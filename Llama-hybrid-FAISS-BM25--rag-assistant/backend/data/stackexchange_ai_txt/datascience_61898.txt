Random forest, predicts the class with highest probability estimate. The predicted class probabilities of an input sample is computed as the mean predicted class probabilities of the trees in the forest. The class probability of a single tree is the fraction of samples of the same class in a leaf. Majority voting, which is also called Hard Voting, every individual classifier votes for a class, and the majority wins. In statistical terms, the predicted target label of the ensemble is the mode of the distribution of individually predicted labels. Majority voting may works better in cases where there are some outliers. Consider these votes: $\{0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.01\}$ and $\{1,1,1,0\}$ .
