The author of rjags has mentioned, that the Wishhart distribution can only be used, when it appears as a conjugate distribution in a strong sense: http://sourceforge.net/p/mcmc-jags/discussion/610037/thread/eab372de There is a way around this though (I have to give credit to the authors of the R package bamdit though, thats where I first spotted the following trick: model { for( i in 1 : n ) { m[i,1:2] ~ dmnorm(mu.0[1:2], sigma.inv[1:2, 1:2]) ## m is not the data w[i] ~ dgamma(nu.2, nu.2) T(0.1, 3) y[i, 1]
