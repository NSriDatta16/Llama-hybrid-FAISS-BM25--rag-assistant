Several studies demonstrated [1, 2] that radiologist fatigue levels and performance are related to environmental factors such as number of False-Positives and False-Negatives. However, the number of False-Positives is usually higher than the number of False-Negatives if we consider solely the diagnosis ( e.g. , breast, lung cancers, etc.) over medical imaging analysis. This is due to the fact that typically, clinicians do not want to take risks [2] in the presence of an ambiguous case. Thus, clinicians will diagnose that case with their higher probability for the worse case scenario. In breast cancer diagnosis, such medical decision will translate into a patient's biopsy in which patients are physically and mentally affected, as well as affected by healthcare costs. On the other hand, False-Negatives are severe medical errors that can lead to patient mortality. Although False-Negatives are more severe, the improvement window is much lower. For instance, in breast cancer diagnosis, about 8% to 10% of cases are yielding False-Negatives and between 30% to 50% are yielding False-Positives [3]. These results show a much more promising output relation for working on False-Positives than False-Negatives. Moreover, it is much safer for the Data Science community to work on False-Positives improvement for now, as it instantiates lower levels of patient mortality.
