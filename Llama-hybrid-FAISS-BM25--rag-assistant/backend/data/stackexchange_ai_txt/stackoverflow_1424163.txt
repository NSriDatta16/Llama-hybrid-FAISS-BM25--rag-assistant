To be brief, automating builds accross solutions without a 'common directory structure' is possible through the use of: commandline parameters environment variables I would encourage you however to consider the "Convention over Configuration" mantra and think up a convention about the relative positions of solutions A and B. Furthermore it's possible to build projects and solutions using the MSBuild task. The binaries can be copied to your "External references" folder using the Copy task.
