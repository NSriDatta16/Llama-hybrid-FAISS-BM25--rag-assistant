No, I don't think so. However, in practice tomcat will only ever instantiate a single servlet, even if the JavaEE spec allows it to instantiate several. Most, if not all, of the MVC frameworks out there rely on that assumption, and store a lot of config state in the servlet. If you want to play it safe, then don't store your state in the servlet, stick it in another class which uses the singleton pattern, and reference that singleton from your servlet.
