LIke Kragen said, Depends.exe often complains about those files. When using Depends.exe I look at only the DLLs that are not provided by the system (i.e. mine and their dependencies). Also note that the Windows Installer cannot intsall system files. Those files are all system files so they definitely should not be in your MSI.
