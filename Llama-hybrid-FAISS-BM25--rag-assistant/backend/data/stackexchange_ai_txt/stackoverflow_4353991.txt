Which type of the project you are developing? The java project or plug-in project? If you're developing plug-in project, your project should not directly depend on the concrete swt fragment(such as swt.gtk, swt.win32). It should depend on the host plug-in 'org.eclipse.swt' that the actual implementation of swt is the different fragments in different platforms. If you're developing a java project that requires the swt as the third-party requirement. You can install eclipse delta package for both your 32bit and 64bit eclipse.
