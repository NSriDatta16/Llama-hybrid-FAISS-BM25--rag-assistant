What you have seems to be a fairly standard log-normal survival/reliability model of continuous-time failure data. You presumably didn't model quantiles directly, but rather the entire function describing $\log (T)$ as a function of covariates and time. The way you did this was with likelihood-based methods. That doesn't seem to be what is usually considered " quantile regression ." Rather, it's a Bayesian survival analysis. If a cumulative distribution of failure times conditional on covariates is $F(t)$ , then the corresponding distribution of survival times is $S(t)=1-F(t)$ . All you are doing to get quantiles of survival times is sampling from your posterior estimate of $F(t)$ . One caution: did you observe failure times for all samples of the material, or did some samples not fail at all? In the latter case, make sure that your model incorporated the contribution of such samples with right-censored survival times to the likelihood. Otherwise your estimates are likely to be biased.
