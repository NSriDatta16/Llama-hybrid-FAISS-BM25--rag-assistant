Entity Framework not mapping 1 to 1 Relationship

I have some tables and I can't get them to map. aspnet_Users UserId //Other Fields Table A(intermediate table) UserId Table B UserId Field1 Field2 Field3 Yep when I add these 3 tables in I will either get a 1 to 1 relationship with aspnet_users to Table A or Table A to Table B I need to have aspnetusers to Table A to Table B I tried to add this association but it never works. Error 3021: Problem in Mapping Fragment starting at line 168: Each of the following columns in TableA is mapped to multiple conceptual side properties: How do I fix this?
