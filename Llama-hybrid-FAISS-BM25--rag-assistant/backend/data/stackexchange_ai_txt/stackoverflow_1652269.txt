Drag and drop layout designer

Are there any tools (frameworks) to create web based layout desinger (something like in Visual Studio, but with html and javascript) - with drag and drop, ability to combine several html tags into one control, changing "control" properties on the fly (e. g. width, font, etc) and exporting layout into html (xml)? Looked at jQuery and ExtJS .
