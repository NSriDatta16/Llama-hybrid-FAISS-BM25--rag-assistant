Causal inference on time-series data: is intervention needed?

I'm working on the topic of causal inference, I use time-series data. I have two scenarios in front of me and I don't understand the difference: Given X and Y "time" features. I would like to know whether X, e.g. average income, does it cause Y, e.g. hotel reservations. Given X "time" feature and an intervention. I'm curious to see how the intervention affects X. As an example, I publish a new web interface, while I look at the amount of purchases. Are both causal inferences? What is the difference between them in practice? A good tool for the second is Google Causalimpact. Could you give me examples of the estimation methods in both cases? Earlier, I used causal inference on cross-section data sets and that was obvious for me, because I could use DoWhy and a kind of matching and scoring-based estimation methods.
