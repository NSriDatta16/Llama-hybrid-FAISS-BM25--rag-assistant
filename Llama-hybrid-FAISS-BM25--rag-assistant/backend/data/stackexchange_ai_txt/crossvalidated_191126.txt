Is this a sensible deconvolution procedure?

I'm working with deconvolution a lot, in situations that naturally give me a long series of observations O in the presence of both noise N and effect E a long series of observations C from a control situation where only N is present and I want to estimate the distribution of E. Thus O is a convolution of C by E, I have O and C and want to deconvolve O to get E. A simple approach to estimating E has occurred to me: (assuming for the sake of simplicity that O and C have the same number of observations) sort O and C each in ascending order then construct a series E' where E'1 = O1-C1 .... E'n = On - Cn assuming a good number of observations, then the distribution of E' will be a good estimate of the distribution of E. Am I right? Is it really as simple as this? Ultimately I will use the distribution of E obtained by deconvolution as a Bayesian prior to get a point estimate of the amount of E present in each O. In case it's helpful, here is R code that implements this, with extra complexity to allow for the length of C to vary from the length of O. empiricalDeconvolve length(base)){nextPoint
