In my opinion, deep learning algorithms are one of the algorithms that you could use. You really don't have to nest the classification but instead use all of the data or choose the features that you think would be useful. Convolutional neural networks could also be used. refer here . or here . Although this is mostly used in computer vision, and image classification but with you're problem you probably might want to apply this where your "layers" are to be determined by your model and you'll never know, it might find more relationship amongst your features than you think.
