This is something you shouldn't do. Why would you want to change that color but not the overall opacity of the bar? it decreases readability. There are multiple problems: there is no public API, so it's not trivial tampering with the subviews is fragile, may break and may have side-effects it's not foreseen to be done -- the alpha value of the view is used and animated when pushing/popping a controller If you really want to do it, there's only one clean, public way: Give each navigation item to be pushed a custom title view. You can tamper with that one as much as you want. So it's possible to set a view with a UILabel as subview and having it's alpha set to 0.5.
