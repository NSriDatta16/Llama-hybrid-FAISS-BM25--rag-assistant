One option could be to use a BERT encoder to tokenize and encode the words and then use a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification task. If you need a tutorial on how to do it, check this article . Also you can fine-tune a Transformer model, like BERT or Google's T5, to do the classification. But they can take long to train, so try CNN first and if you are not happy with the results think about transformers .
