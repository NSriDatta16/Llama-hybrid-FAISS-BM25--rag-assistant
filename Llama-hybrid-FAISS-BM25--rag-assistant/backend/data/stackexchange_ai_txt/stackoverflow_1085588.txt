My quick stab at it would be to use a thin plate spline (or possibly a similar, cleverer linear algebra technique) to fit a plane to the function of frequency density. The average 'altitude' of each plane (per frequency) would then tell you whether a frequency is overused (i.e. when it's higher than the others); the slope would be an indication of the spatial distribution.
