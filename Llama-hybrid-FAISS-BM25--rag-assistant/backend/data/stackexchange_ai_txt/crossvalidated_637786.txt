I agree with @Robert Long's sentiment that you should be skeptical about results (assuming your model even converges) with your data characteristics, especially your sample size of 30. The issue of what to do when one wants to fit a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model with a small sample has been addressed a number of times on this site (e.g., here ), though yours is unique in that I don't believe I have seen an application of FA with a sample size smaller than 50 (though that does not mean it is not worth a shot!). Is there a way to conduct confirmatory factor analysis with a small sample size? I heard about regularized exploratory factor analysis is used for small sample sizes. Is there an equivalent of it with confirmatory factor analysis? You are correct to point out that regularization can help with small samples. For example, Jung & Lee (2011) found evidence that samples of less than 50 may be sufficient for fitting a regularized exploratory factor analysis (EFA) model. Though from your question, it seems like you are more interested in fitting a regularized CFA model, which can be fit using the regSEM (Jacobucci, Grimm, & McArdle, 2016) $^1$ R package. Also, what softwares can I use to run these? I currently have SPSS, AMOS, and LISREL. Regarding software, besides the regSEM package, the only other software I have seen used to fit a regularized FA model is MATLAB (e.g., Jung & Lee, 2011) and mplus (see Asparouhov & Muthén, 2023 for more information). $^1$ Also see Li, Jacobucci, & Ammerman (2021) for a good tutorial on the method.
