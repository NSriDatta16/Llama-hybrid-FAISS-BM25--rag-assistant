In a Java-Webstart setting you start a JNLP file which then triggers the download of the Jar files needed to run the application. Everytime webstart checks if there are newer versions of the Jars and would download them replacing the locally cached ones. With a tool named jardiff you will create only diffs towards the newer jars and distribute these via the server (e.g. only get an update). Pros: always up to date Cons: you need an application server (tomcat, JBoss) in order to distribute the files you need an internet connection in order to get the application
