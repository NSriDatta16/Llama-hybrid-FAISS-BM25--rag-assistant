Linear regression always results in the optimal linear model?

let's say I'm running a linear regression model via sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression for two independent variables X1 and X2 predicting Y. Am I guaranteed that the result would be optimal / minimize the sum-of-squers-error, and other linear models like Perceptron or linear SVM will not results in better metric? Now, lets say I'm defining a new variable X3 = X1 (a direct copy of the existing variable) and now I repeat the process of a linear regression, only this time with 3 input X variables. will the answer to the previous question change?
