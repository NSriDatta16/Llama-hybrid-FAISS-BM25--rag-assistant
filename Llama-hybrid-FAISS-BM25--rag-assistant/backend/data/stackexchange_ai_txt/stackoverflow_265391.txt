I'm not sure about the bidding and profits but the scrum methodology can certainly be applied to a fixed-length/price project. If the requirements are known and solid they can be put in the product backlog and the sprints can be planned according to the requirements and the time limit. You can still leverage the benefits of the daily scrum meetings, burn-down charts, etc to make sure the project stays on track.
