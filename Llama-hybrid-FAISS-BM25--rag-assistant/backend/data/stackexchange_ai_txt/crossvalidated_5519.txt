Conditional logistic regression compares cases to controls. The coefficients multiply differences in factor values between cases and controls. The intercept terms cancel in the likelihood and therefore play no identifiable role in the model. See the section on "Conditional Logistic Regression" in Ying So's tutorial for SAS .
