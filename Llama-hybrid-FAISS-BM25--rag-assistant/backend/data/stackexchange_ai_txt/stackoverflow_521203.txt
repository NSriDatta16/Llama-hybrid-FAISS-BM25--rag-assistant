I second dwf 's recommendation of Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition by Chris Bishop. Although, it's perhaps not a starter text. Norvig or an online tutorial (with code in Matlab!) would probably be a gentler introduction. A good starter project would be OCR (Optical Character Recognition). You can scan in pages of text and feed each character through the network in order to perform classification. (You would have to train the network first of course!).
