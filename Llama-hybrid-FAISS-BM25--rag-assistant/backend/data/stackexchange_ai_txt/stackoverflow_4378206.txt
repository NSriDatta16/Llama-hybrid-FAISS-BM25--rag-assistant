I recommend skipping the Crystal Crosstab and making your own: Make a subreport where you want the crosstab to appear (you may not need a subreport, but I'll assume you do). Group the subreport by your 3 levels. Drag & drop your fields onto your design however you want them. In the group footer sections, add some custom field formulas with the sum({number},{group}) for the custom formula. Using the section expert, suppress the fields as you see fit. The count({number},{group}) would be useful here. It'll take a fair bit of tweaking to get it right, and of course the columns in your manual crosstab will be fixed, but this allows for the most customization.
