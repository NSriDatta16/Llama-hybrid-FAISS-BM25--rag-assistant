I think the confusion stems from the term autoregression . Autoregressive is anything that uses previous information from time steps to predict (regress) the output at the current time step. Refer to the links given below for more information on autoregression [1,2]. Examples can be any time series models, for example, predicting share prices based on historical share prices. An autoregressive decoder is a decoder model which uses information from previous time steps of the decoder to generate the value at the current time step. An example of such an autoregressive decoder is a English-French machine translation model. While translating from English to French, the decoder will condition its current time step's prediction on the previously generated words (past time steps) [3]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autoregressive.asp https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/4476/4354 (Wang, Yiren, et al.
