Well, you just need to pay attention to this code snippet: DateTime? LimitDate= null; ..... var x = c.ExecuteScalar(); if (x != null) LimitDate = (DateTime)x; return LimitDate.Value; You initialize LimitDate to NULL, and if the value "x" returned from ExecuteScalar is NULL, you don't do anything - and consequently, you shouldn't be calling return LimitDate.Value on it, after all LimitDate IS NULL in this case! Or you need to initialize the LimitDate variable to non-NULL value..... You need something like this: if(LimitDate != null) return LimitDate.Value; else return null;
