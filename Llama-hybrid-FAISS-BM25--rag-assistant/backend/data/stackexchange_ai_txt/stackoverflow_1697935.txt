Text Pattern Processing in paragraph with unix linux utilities

I have a file with the following pattern (please note this is a file generated using sed, awk, grep etc processing). The part of file input is as follows. filename1, BASE=a/b/c CONFIG=$BASE/d propertiesfile1=$CONFIG/e.properties EndOfFilefilename1 filename2, BASE=f/g/h CONFIG=$BASE/i propertiesfile1=$CONFIG/j.properties EndOfFilefilename2 filename3, BASE=k/l/m CONFIG=$BASE/n propertiesfile1=$CONFIG/o.properties EndOfFilefilename3 I want the output like filename1,a/b/c/d/e.properties, filename2,f/g/h/i/j.properties, filename3, k/l/m/n/o.properties, I could not find a solution with sed or awk or grep . So I ams tuck. Please do let me know if you know the solution with these unix utilities or any other language, platform. Regards, Suhaas
