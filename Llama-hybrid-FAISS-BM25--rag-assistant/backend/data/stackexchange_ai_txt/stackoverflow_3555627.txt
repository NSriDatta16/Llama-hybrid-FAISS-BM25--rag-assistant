Short answer, as Anthony says is No. You can emulate the functionality by using the the drag entry event and mouse button up event, then create a silverlight control that most closely matches the HTML one you were dragging, and hide the original html control (which should snap back to its original position)... Its a little messy, but it works... Incidently, as far as i'm aware, dragging between 2 silverlight instances on the same page would require a similar technique...
