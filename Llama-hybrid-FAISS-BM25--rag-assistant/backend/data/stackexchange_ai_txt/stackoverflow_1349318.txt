Use the base controllers File method. public ActionResult Image(string id) { var dir = Server.MapPath("/Images"); var path = Path.Combine(dir, id + ".jpg"); //validate the path for security or use other means to generate the path. return base.File(path, "image/jpeg"); } As a note, this seems to be fairly efficient. I did a test where I requested the image through the controller ( http://localhost/MyController/Image/MyImage ) and through the direct URL ( http://localhost/Images/MyImage.jpg ) and the results were: MVC: 7.6 milliseconds per photo Direct: 6.7 milliseconds per photo Note: this is the average time of a request. The average was calculated by making thousands of requests on the local machine, so the totals should not include network latency or bandwidth issues.
