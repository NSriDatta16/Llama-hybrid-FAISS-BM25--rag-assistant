What does it mean if X → Y → Z is a markov chain, it mplies that Z → Y → X. Some-times written X ↔ Y ↔ Z

In the book Elements of information theory (Cover, Thomas) 2nd ed. Page 34 On Markov Chain it says: X → Y → Z implies that Z → Y → X. Thus, the condition is some-times written X ↔ Y ↔ Z. I just don't get this. Is this property has any name? What does it exactly mean? Is it mean that this is always the case for any markov chain? This might seem silly! Let us consider a random variable $X \in [-10,10]$ , $Y=X^2$ , and $Z=\sqrt{Y}$ . Can we say that $X \rightarrow X^2 \rightarrow \sqrt{X^2}$ is a markov chain? If Yes then does this means that $\sqrt{X^2} \rightarrow X^2 \rightarrow X$ is also a markov chain? If Yes then how the second chain can recover X? I appreciate any intuitive example that elaborates this property.
