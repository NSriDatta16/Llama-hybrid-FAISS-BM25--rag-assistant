Alternating signs of significant estimates in VAR model

I have 6 variables and 125 observations, which I am modelling using a VAR model, in which I put all variables in as edogenous, as all relationships interest me (the bidirectionality). I have carried out granger tests, detrended my data (i.e., checked the stationarity, taken logs, log_difference as necessary) so all variables come into the model stationary. For the lag I set lag.max = 6 , and use the AIC criterion in the model (which never returns a lag larger than 5 anyway). The model works fine and I can read the answers off, with significance here and there, more or less confirming my hypotheses that I made before the test. I am looking at how the inventories of oil are related to another factor (Net Convenience Yield, WTI Oil) This relationship gets 2 lags from AIC. Then my results: summary(equations="NCY_WTI_3M",VAR(data.final[,c("NCY_WTI_3M","NCY_BRE_3M","SP","INV")], type="const", ic="AIC", lag.max=LagMax)) VAR Estimation Results: ========================= Endogenous variables: NCY_WTI_3M, NCY_BRE_3M, SP, INV Deterministic variables: const Sample size: 123 Log Likelihood: -763.052 Roots of the characteristic polynomial: 0.8509 0.8509 0.5029 0.5029 0.4318 0.4318 0.2642 0.2151 Call: VAR(y = data.final[, c("NCY_WTI_3M", "NCY_BRE_3M", "SP", "INV")], type = "const", lag.max = LagMax, ic = "AIC") Estimation results for equation NCY_WTI_3M: =========================================== NCY_WTI_3M = NCY_WTI_3M.l1 + NCY_BRE_3M.l1 + SP.l1 + INV.l1 + NCY_WTI_3M.l2 + NCY_BRE_3M.l2 + SP.l2 + INV.l2 + const Estimate Std.

INV.l1 (* ) has a negative estimate, whereas INV.l2 ( ) has a positive estimate - this means a differing relationship over time periods, if both being significant should be believed. This 'anomaly' has appeared in practically every model I have run from all 27 variables (using smaller basket models), where each time a factor has significance, the estimates provided have different signs (+/-). I don't believe this is the case, and so my question is, is there an inherent property of VAR models that might help to explain this? I was thinking, if the effect from lag1 on today is positive, then the effect from lag2 on lag1 should also be positive, so what is the expected effect from lag2 on today? Does the fact that the sign changes with each lag, mean that there is actually some consistency over the whole time series? UPDATE: After speaking to other people, my current theory is that there is an ilk of overcorrection occurring. The second lagged variable has an effect on the independent variable only after the first lagged variable has been taken into account. In this train of thought, my 'problem' would then be created by a kind of mean-reversion effect, whereby the calculation always partially overshoots the mark and thus producing the positive / negative signs in front of my estimated values.
