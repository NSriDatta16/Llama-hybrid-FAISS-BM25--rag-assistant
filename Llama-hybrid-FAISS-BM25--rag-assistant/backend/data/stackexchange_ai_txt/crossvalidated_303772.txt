Binary logistic regression with two continuous independent variables with different dimensions

I have a binary dependent variable (1/0) and two continuous independent variables that are in different dimensions, one is in kilometers and the other is in years. I used Minitab and binary logistic regression. Of course, the results haven't been trustworthy especially considering error. It is obvious that the reason of this is that data are in different dimensions, therefore in different sizes as well. I understand that I should do coding of these independent data, but how?
