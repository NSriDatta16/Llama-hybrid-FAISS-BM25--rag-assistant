It's really a question of data handling in the browser. If there were no security issues involved this would be a piece of cake ... but there are security issues, big ones. Any time you permit data from site X to be introduced to site Y in a programmatic way you are opening a door, and it's very difficult to find the right balance of "useful enough to permit exciting new functionality" without going all the way to "bending over in the shower in prison to pick up the soap". Cheswick and Bellovin say there are two basic approaches to security: That which is not explicitly forbidden is permitted. That which is not explicitly permitted is forbidden. Microsoft basically went with #1 and you can see where that leads to. Most paranoid sysadmins go the route of #2 with a vengeance. Opening a big door between two unrelated sites would send most of us screaming off into the woods. Unfortunately, although browsers & web site people are mostly (somewhat?) aware of this problem and are trying to deal with it, companies like Adobe and their "flash storage" are creating more and more problems.
