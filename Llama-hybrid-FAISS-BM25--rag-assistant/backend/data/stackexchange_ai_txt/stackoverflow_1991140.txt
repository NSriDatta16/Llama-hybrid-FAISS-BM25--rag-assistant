1558 is actually a modest number of features/attributes. The # of instances(3279) is also small. The problem is not on the dataset side, but on the training algorithm side. ANN is slow in training, I'd suggest you to use a logistic regression or svm. Both of them are very fast to train. Especially, svm has a lot of fast algorithms. In this dataset, you are actually analyzing text, but not image. I think a linear family classifier, i.e. logistic regression or svm, is better for your job. If you are using for production and you cannot use open source code. Logistic regression is very easy to implement compared to a good ANN and SVM. If you decide to use logistic regression or SVM, I can future recommend some articles or source code for you to refer.
