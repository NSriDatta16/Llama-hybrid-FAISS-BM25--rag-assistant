In the enclosed context, can a linear mixed effects model be used in place of a general linear model when repeated measures are present?

I work within a field that has some fairly challenging datasets. Without going into too much detail, the following sequence of analyses are canonically performed: Individual subjects have time series datasets. These datasets are modeled as being explained by some other predictor variable's values across time (i.e. I'm using one time series to predict another time series). This is canonically formulated in a GLM context. After running the GLM, a $\beta$ coefficient associated with the predictor time series will be output for the given subject. Step 1 is repeated across all subjects so that each subject's GLM analysis has a corresponding subject-specific $\beta$ value. All $\beta$ values (from all subjects) are now pooled together and treated as a collection of observations. Suppose from the beginning, all subjects were partitioned by one between-group categorical factor with two levels: treated vs control. A 2nd GLM is performed with a binary index ( $0$ for control and $1$ for treated) and a corresponding coefficient (to be solved for) $\gamma$ . After performing this 2nd GLM, a t-test can be conducted on $\gamma$ to determine if there is a difference between the beta values from the treated individuals versus the non-treated (control) individuals. You can imagine a scenario where the original subject partitioning involves $n$ between-group factors. For simplicity, let us assume that $n=2$ and suppose that each factor has only two levels each. In this scenario, for the 2nd-level GLM, is it correct to say that my linear model is being implemented (conceptually) as follows: $\beta_i=\alpha_0+\gamma_1X_i+\gamma_2 Y_i +\varepsilon_i$ where $(X_i,Y_i)$ corresponds to $(0,0)$ , $(0,1)$ , $(1,0)$ , or $(1,1)$ depending on the particular factors that subject $i$ is described by. Secondly , it is my understanding that the standard GLM does not permit within-group factors. Assuming this is true, I wondered if someone could clarify whether the following would be appropriate: Still keeping $n=2$ , suppose that now I have one between-group factor and one within-group factor. In this context, obviously we will have $\beta_i$ 's that are potentially correlated with one another due to the repeated measures. Rather than employing the aforementioned 2nd-level GLM, I wondered if it would be appropriate to model my $\beta$ values using a linear mixed-effects model.
