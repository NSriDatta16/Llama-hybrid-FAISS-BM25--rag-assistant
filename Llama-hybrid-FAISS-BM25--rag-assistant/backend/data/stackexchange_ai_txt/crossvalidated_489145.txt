High Dimensional Swiss Roll? (For Metric Learning/Dimensionality Reduction)

So I've just started a project which includes some metric learning, and came accross this swiss roll in 3D to 2D problem. Ideally, you should 'unroll' the roll. My question is, can this be extended to higher dimensions? As in is there any other way of validating a metric learning technique where we know the structure in higher dimensional data and so we can have some sense of the structure in lower dimensions? The one other example I can think of is concentric n-spheres, but even then I don't know any dim-reduction technique that would help.
