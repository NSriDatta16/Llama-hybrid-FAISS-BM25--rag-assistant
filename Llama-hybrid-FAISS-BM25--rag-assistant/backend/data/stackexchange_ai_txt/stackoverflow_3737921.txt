You've got a basic violation of Separation of Concerns/Single Responsibility Principle: Your business objects know about their storage. The Data Layer of the 3-tier architecture should be responsible for CRUD operations, and should be queried for instances of the objects consumers need. Something like this: Presentation Layer ------- Data Layer || || Business Layer This allows the business layer to focus on implementing, and keeps the persistence concerns out of it. If the Presentation layer needs a new business object (for creation), it asks the data layer for it.
