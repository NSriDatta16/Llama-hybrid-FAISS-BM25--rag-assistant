Rails 2.3 caching by time

I would like to cache my fragment page in my rails application by time. I found this plugin to do this => ici but any download is available. I searched in the rails doc but I don't found how to cache my fragment by time. Are you know another plugin to do this or another method to do this ? Thanks.
