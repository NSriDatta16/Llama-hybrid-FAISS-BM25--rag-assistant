A certificate binds an identity to a public key . The binding is performed by the issuing authority (VeriSign, Cybertrust, etc.) digitally signing the contents of the certificate. The Subject of a certificate indicates the entity for which the certificate was generated. If it's an SSL certificate, it may correspond to a server and include the server's DNS name, for example. If it's an e-mail digital signature certificate it may correspond to a person's e-mail address. You are correct that it includes the organizational unit, etc. The Subject Key is the public key in the equation. While there is a private key corresponding to the certificate, the certificate itself only contains the public key.
