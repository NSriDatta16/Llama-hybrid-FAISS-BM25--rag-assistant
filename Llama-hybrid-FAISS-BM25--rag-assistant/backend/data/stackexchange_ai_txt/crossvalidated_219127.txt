Incorporate an external estimate of probability as predictor in a logistic regression model

I am predicting a binary outcome (e.g., credit default) with logistic regression. For each observation, in addition to my own observed predictors, I have obtained a probability estimate from an external source (e.g., a likelihood of default from a black-box algorithm). I'd like to test whether incorporating this estimate improves my model. The approach I am considering is to include this estimate as a predictor in the model and do a $\chi^2$ test for the improvement. Because I am expecting a linear relationship between the estimate and the underlying probability of the outcome, I suppose that rather than $x$ I should include the term transformed as $\ln\frac{x}{1-x}$. Is this transformation appropriate, and is the overall approach recommended?
