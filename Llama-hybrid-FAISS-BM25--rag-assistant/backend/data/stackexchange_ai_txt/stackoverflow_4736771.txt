Calling a code activity compiled as x86 from a work flow in TFS build 2010

Background We have a need, or at least a desire, to call a 3rd party DLL that will only load/run when called from a .Net assembly compiled as x86. For compatibility we normally compile our .Net programs as x86 anyway so this hasn't been a problem in the past. I'm looking into getting a x64 version, but it doesn't look promising. The Real Problem When I compile our Code Activity as x86 instead of "Any CPU" the build agent throws an error stating that it cannot find our code activity. Questions Is there something special I need to do in the work flow to tell it the code activity's assembly is x86? Can I force a code activity to run as x86 even if it's compiled Any CPU? Is there a way to force the whole work flow to run as x86?
