The Observer Pattern comes to mind. One object (suscriber) can suscribe to another object (publisher). When the publisher changes or is updated, he can notify all his suscribers. Depending on what language you are using, you can specify a function that should be called on notifies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern It is well described in Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software [Gang of Four]
