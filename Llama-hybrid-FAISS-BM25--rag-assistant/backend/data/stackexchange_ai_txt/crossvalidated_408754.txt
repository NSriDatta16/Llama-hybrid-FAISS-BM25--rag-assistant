For the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in causal inference, defined as $E(Y(1) - Y(0))$, what is $E(Y(1))$ usually referred to as?

For the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in causal inference, is it usually defined as $$ E(Y(1) - Y(0)) $$ I am wondering what the most commonly referred to name for $E(Y(1))$ is? Is it not the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), but calling it the expected response for treatment doesn't seem quite there. Is there a formal name for it in the literature?
