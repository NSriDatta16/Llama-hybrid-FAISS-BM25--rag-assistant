why don't we test error on autoencoders?

we are not suppose to use test set when we r fitting the model to our data. but I noticed in this blog https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html which is very established it uses validation_data=(x_test, x_test), The mnist is split in 3 parts test list(10000 data points) , train list(55000 data point)and validation list(5000 datapoint). in all the tutorial i have seen they use test set when they want to train the model shouldn't they use validation set? I haven't seen ppl use test error in Autoencoders! how can I measure the test error of an autoencoder?
