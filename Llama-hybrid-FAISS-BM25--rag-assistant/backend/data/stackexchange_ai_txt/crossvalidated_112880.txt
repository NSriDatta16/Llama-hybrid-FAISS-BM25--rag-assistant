Which Analysis to use? Likert Scale

I have 3 independent variables (1-5 Likert Scale) questions and I want to check how well these three can predict/explain my DV (1-5 Likert scale) The three independent variables are: 1. Quality of information 2. Accessibility of staff 3. Quality of technical advice My DV is: Overall evaluation of service center All variables are ordinal (1 = low... 5 = high) Which analysis would be appropriate to run here? I would prefer an easy approach and I think Ordinal Logistic Regression is way too complicated. Can I use a Linear Regression? Basically, I want to be able to say that (for example) "quality of technical advice" is better at predicting "overall evaluation" than "Accessibility of staff" Also, I have a 0 value on all variables ("No opinion", so in fact all are measured on 0-5 Likert scale)). How should I treat this variable? Can I replace the 0s with the mean of the observations? Many thanks! Fredrik
