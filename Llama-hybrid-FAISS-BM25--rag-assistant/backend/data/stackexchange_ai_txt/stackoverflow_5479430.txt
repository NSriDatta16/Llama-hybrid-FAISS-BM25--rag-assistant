Also you can start drawing thread @Override public void run(){ while(shouldDraw()) this.wait(500); yourCalculations(); // maybe setting fields in runnable object SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(yourRunnableObject); // or invokeLater if you prefer non blocking version } This code shows only conception (I've skipped synchronization and exception handling). SwingTimer looks more elegant but I've never used it.
