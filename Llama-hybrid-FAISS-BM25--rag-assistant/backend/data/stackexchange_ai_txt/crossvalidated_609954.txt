For counter-examples, you might want to consider cases where the weak law of large numbers applies but the strong law of large numbers does not. These cases must have $E[X_1]$ undefined. For example, adapting the second example in Wikipedia , suppose $\mathbb P\left(X_1=\frac{(-2)^n}{n} \right)=\frac1{2^n}$ for positive integer $n$ this does not have a mean since $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-2)^n}{n} \frac1{2^n}=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ does not converge absolutely but the sum does converge conditionally to $-\log_e(2)\approx -0.693$ and the sample averages converge in probability to this In this example, you need a large sample to see much convergence. For example with $10^4$ simulations each with sample sizes of $10^2$ (red), $10^3$ (green) and $10^4$ (blue), the following R code Xbar shows the increasing concentration of the sample mean as the sample size increases
