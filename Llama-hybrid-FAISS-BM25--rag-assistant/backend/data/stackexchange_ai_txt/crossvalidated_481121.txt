From your question, it appears that the hypothesis tested was "the proportion of bottles with the additive present in 2019 was greater than the average proportion of bottles with the additive present over all previous years". If I am interpreting you correctly, you actually want to know if the data generating process (in this case adding the additive) changed in 2019 from previous years, or if the high in 2019 is plausibly just a result of random variation. If this is the case, you could do the following to demonstrate your case: Fit a binomial distribution to your data, where each observation is the pair consisting of the count of bottles with the additive for a given year and the total count of bottles for a given year. Simulate a large number (e.g. 10,000) of random draws from the binomial distribution where the total count of bottles is equal to the total count from 2019, and calculate the proportion for each simulation. Calculate the proportion of simulated proportions that are greater than the 2019 proportion. The closer this proportion is to 0%, the less likely it was that the 2019 value came from the data generating process given by the model. Classically if the proportion is less than or equal to 5%, we would deem the difference "statistically significant". What follows is some R code that would solve this for you. Since I don't have your data, the first part of my code generates some fake data akin to your real data. # Your post mentions years 1999 through 2019. year With our fake data in tow, we can do the proposed calculations. # Maximum likelihood estimator for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution. mle_prob prop_for_2019) # Determine if 2019 is statistically significantly different at the 5% level prop_of_sim_prop_gt_2019_prop ```
