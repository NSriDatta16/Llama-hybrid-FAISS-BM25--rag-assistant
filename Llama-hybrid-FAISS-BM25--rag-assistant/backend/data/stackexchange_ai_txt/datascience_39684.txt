I recommend the use of the Tensorflow playground to get an intuitive understanding. In particular, try to find a fit for the spiral dataset. The way I understand it, each layer of a neural network can be composed of all the shapes provided by all the previous layers. The first layer (assuming sigmoid or tanh activation) can only make sigmoid shapes. Each node in the second layer can now make complicated shapes out of linear combinations of all the sigmoid shapes in the first layer. Each node in the third layer can make even more complicated shapes out of the complicated shapes of the second layer. And so on, and so forth.
