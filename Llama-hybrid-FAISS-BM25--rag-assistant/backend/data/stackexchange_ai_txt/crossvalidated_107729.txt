Testing for Unimodality or Bimodality Data Using MATLAB

I am trying to figure out what I did wrong or what I could do to get accurate results. I have n vectors of data, and I am trying to decide whether each dataset is unimodal or bimodal. I assumed that it could be a mixture of Gaussians, so in MATLAB I attempted: fit1 = gmdistribution(data(:,x),1) %x is the index for each vector fit2 = gmdistribution(data(:,x),2) I used the minimum AIC of the two to decide whether it is unimodal or bimodal. The results return all to be bimodal, but they all aren't. Also by looking at the histograms of the data, they all don't seem bimodal. My question is why am I getting inaccurate or false positive results? Is there a better method? Did I do something wrong? SOME EDITS: using the gmdistribution function and the mean and variance from fit1 and fit2, I created random samples using: Y = random(obj,length(original_data) %obj contains unimodal dist. Y2 = random(obj2, length(original_data) %obj2 contains bimodal hist(Y, length(original_data) hist(Y2, length(original_data) I compared each to the original vectors of data and the bimodal seems to provide samples that most resembles the original data. Is this a proper way of testing the AIC or dip test? I also used the hartigans dip test in matlab and the p values were close to 0 (less than 0.05), so I assumed this also means bimodal. I checked the kurtosis also, but they didn't return all bimodal. Any inputs or direction?
