Find dependent objects for a table or view

Background When dropping (or replacing) objects in PostgreSQL, if there are dependencies, the drop will fail (without specifying CASCADE ). Problem The error message returned by the database does not list the dependent objects. Example Solution The query might look something like: SELECT * FROM information_schema i, pg_depend pd WHERE i.object_id = pd.object_id AND i.object_type = 'TABLE' AND i.object_schema = 'public' AND i.object_name = 'table_with_dependents'; The objid is missing.
