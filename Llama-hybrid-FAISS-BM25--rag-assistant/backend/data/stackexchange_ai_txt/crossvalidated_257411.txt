Simulation Using Cauchy Distribution as Error Disturbance

I had run artificial data using y=a+ax1+ax2+e. x1 is generated using Normal Distribution and e generated using Cauchy and Normal Distribution. The model i want to compare is ANN and SVM. When using Cauchy as disturbance in artificial data. The model tend to generate high RMSE. Why is that happen?
