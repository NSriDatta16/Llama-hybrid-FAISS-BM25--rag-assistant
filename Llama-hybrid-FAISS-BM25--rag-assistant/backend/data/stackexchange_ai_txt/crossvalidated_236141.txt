Why do you want to do PCA? PCA is for dimensionality reduction and getting rid of linear correlation among features. So if you have a lot of repeated data PCA will mistakenly think two features are linearly correlated and share information. Using your example, if you have only one tree and two branches, but say 90% of your measurements are from brachnum 1 and the rest are branchum 2, any linear correlation test will tell you that treenum has a 90% correlation to branchnum, although this correlation doesn't make sense. In your example data set you have 50% from branch 1 and 50% from branch 2, but still this number doesn't make sense. So basically PCA will probably not be a good idea, but it really depends on the task. Perhaps you can elaborate, as I mentioned, on what is the goal of the PCA.
