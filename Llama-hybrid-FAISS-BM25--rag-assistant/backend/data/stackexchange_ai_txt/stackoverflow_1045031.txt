I had roughly the same idea as Gbacon to use paragraph mode since that will neatly chunk the file into records for you. He typed faster, but I wrote one, so here's my crack at it: #!/usr/bin/env perl use strict; use warnings; local $/ = ""; my @items; while (<>) { my( $course, $description ) = (split /\n/, $_)[0, 1]; my( $course_id, $name ) = ($course =~ m/^(\w+)\s+(.*)$/); push @items, [ $course_id, $name, $description ]; } for my $record (@items) { print "Course id: ", $record->[0], "\n"; print "Name and credits: ", $record->[1], "\n"; print "Description: ", $record->[2], "\n"; } As Ysth points out in a comment on Gbacon's answer, paragraph mode may not work here. If not, never mind.
