I have fixed this problem now by using a GUID for a PK instead of a auto-incrementing int. This guarantees that each row inserted by the server or any client will be unique. I know there are some disadvantages such as additional storage space and time it takes to search but this is something I am willing to live with (and I will filter the data that the client gets which will help to improve performance).
