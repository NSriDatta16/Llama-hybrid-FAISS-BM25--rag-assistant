It is not a bug. CLEditor uses standart browser api which can produce different result in different browsers and you cannot change IE behaviour but you can disable "br" generation in Mozilla by using execCommand $("#input").cleditor()[0].doc.execCommand("insertBrOnReturn", false, false); But content should have at least one paragraph. Only in this case firefox will generate "p".
