I'm a bit of a one-trick pony lately, but this seems like a perfect case for Bayesian methods. You need incremental information, and the fact that the observations are noisy further supports the case for them. Your goal would be to get $p(Y|S,P,X, [T])$ , where the parameters are: $S$ - Source $P$ - Precision (i.e. reliability of the source) $X$ - Value measured by the Source. $T$ - Time (optional, and will complicate matters) For multiple sources, you can then combine these into the final posterior distribution via the same general procedure. In particular, if you ignore Time and your sources are some physical measurements (or are otherwise very macro-scale), it should be safe to model them all as Gaussians. This would let you plug in the numbers to an already established equations in a fairly straightforward fashion. To spare some virtual trees, and since I don't know if you know the source precision or not, you can find them here .
