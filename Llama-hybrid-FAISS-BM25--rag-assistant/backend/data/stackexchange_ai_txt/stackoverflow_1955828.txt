I agree with ngm. If the categories match up then you could bring the results from the different call with the following: $offersCat1 = get_offers('category1','none','compare'); $offersCat2 = get_offers('category2','none','compare'); foreach ($offers as $key=>$row) { $offera=$offersCat2[$key]['detailA']; $offerb=$offersCat2[$key]['detailB']; $offerc=$offersCat2[$key]['detailC']; echo "you can have {$row['name']}, it's logo looks like it's characteristics are $offera, offerb, offerc, etc"; } This example will do the same thing, but you keep it in the foreach loop. By using the $key=>$row you are able to access the key of the array. I also took the liberty to echo your variables directly rather than putting them in variables. If you put {} around an array variable (or class variable) you can use them within an echo, print or Example: echo "This variable {$variable['test']}";
