Random sampling for estimating mutual information - Time complexity and sampling error?

I have a dataset and I want to compute the mutual information (MI) for a selected set of variables. The dataset is large enough so that computation of the MI may take undesirably long time. Can I just take a 10% sample of the data and use it to compute the MI measure? I am aware of different sampling techniques including random sampling, stratified sampling and bootstrapping . Even though techniques that require computing MI more than once such as bootstrapping or clustering provide good clues about bias and variance, they lead to some extra computational time. I want to compute MI only once. So, preparing a single random sample and using it for estimating MI is a solution. My concern is how accurate is this solution based on a sample size of 10% of data? What about the sampling error and do I have to pay attention to it? Note: Regarding computing the MI, I do not assume normality for estimating any probability; rather, a non-parametric method ( i.e. histogram) is used.
