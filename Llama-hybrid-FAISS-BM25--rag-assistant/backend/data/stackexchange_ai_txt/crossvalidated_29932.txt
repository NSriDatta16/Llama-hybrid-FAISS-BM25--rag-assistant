How to generate predictions with rjags?

I've used rjags to run MCMC on a model, specified in the JAGS language. Is there a good way to extract that model and perform predictions with it (using the posterior distributions of my parameters)? I can re-specify the model in R and plug in the modes of my parameter posteriors; I'm just wondering if there's a less redundant way of doing this. I believe http://sourceforge.net/p/mcmc-jags/discussion/610037/thread/0ecab41c is asking the same question.
