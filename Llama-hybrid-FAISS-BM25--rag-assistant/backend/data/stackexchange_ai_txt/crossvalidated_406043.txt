You will at least need strict stationarity, because even in the $X_t$ all have the same mean (and variance), the distributions can be different and so the $f(X_t)$ does not necessarily have the same mean if $f$ is nonlinear. So then assume strict stationarity, then the answer becomes yes for marginal transformations $f$ . That is really a consequence of the well-known result that $\DeclareMathOperator{\E}{\mathbb{E}} \E f(X) = \inf f(x) \; dF(x)$ , see wikipedia . For a question about the converse see If the square of a time series is stationary, is the original time series stationary?
