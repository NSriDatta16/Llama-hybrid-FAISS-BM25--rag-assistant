There's a function called TukeyHSD that, according to the help file, calculates a set of confidence intervals on the differences between the means of the levels of a factor with the specified family-wise probability of coverage. The intervals are based on the Studentized range statistic, Tukey's "Honest Significant Difference" method. Does this do what you want? http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/TukeyHSD.html
