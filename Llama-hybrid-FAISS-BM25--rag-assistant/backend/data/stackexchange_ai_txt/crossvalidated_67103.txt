There is no generic way to get the boxplot of the differences from two boxplot summaries. The same marginal boxplots are compatible with quite different sets of differences. Here is a simple example: Values $X = 1,2,3,4,5$ and $Y = 5,4,3,2,1$ produce the same box plot, but the differences are $4,2,0,-2,-4$. Let $Z$ be another copy of either $X$ or $Y$; then necessarily the differences between $X$ and $Z$ or $Y$ and $Z$ are $0,0,0,0,0$. Nothing depends on how these values were produced, so origin in a Bayesian problem is quite immaterial. (UPDATE) The same argument applies to histograms or any other univariate plot, the principle (as concisely expressed by @Glen_b) being that properties of joint distributions don't follow from properties of marginal distributions. Strictly, what this implies is that juxtaposing or superimposing marginal distributions as a way of comparing groups is insufficient, and the corollary that you should plot differences directly leads to other plots, notably plots of differences versus means. Whenever variables occur in pairs (e.g. husbands and wives, before and after) which differences to plot is easy to answer. When there are several variables, there are usually too many possible pairwise plots to handle, however.
