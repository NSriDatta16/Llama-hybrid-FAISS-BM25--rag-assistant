Why setting SVDD's C-parameter to $> 1$ does not affect the result?

Why setting $C>1$ does not affect the result (compared to $C=1$ ) according to: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#libsvm_for_svdd_and_finding_the_smallest_sphere_containing_all_data However in their reference paper [1] the optimization is $$\min_{R,\mathbf{a},\boldsymbol\eta}\ (R^2 + C \sum_{i=1 \dots \ell} \eta_i)$$ subject to $$(\phi(\mathbf{x}_i)-\mathbf{a})^2 \leq R^2 + \eta_i,\ \ \ \eta_i> 0, \ \ \ i = 1,\dots,\ell $$ .
