Stationary Distributions and Financial Markets

Not sure my idea makes sense but here goes. Financial markets are notoriously hard to model. Is this perhaps there does not exist a stationary distribution for any Markov chain stochastic process modelling any given financial security's prices, and hence we cannot reasonably compute statistics that are adequate for future predictions?
