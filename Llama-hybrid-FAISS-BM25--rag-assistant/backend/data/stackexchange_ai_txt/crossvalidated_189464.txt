After you trained a model over your data, then a simple way to understand which features are more positively or negatively contributing to an output is by looking at their corresponding weights. Generally speaking, the larger the weight for a feature the more positively that feature contributes to the output and vice versa. In linear models this is 100% true but in non-linear models it is harder to tell. For instance, in a logistic regression you can simply identify the important features by looking at the weights.
