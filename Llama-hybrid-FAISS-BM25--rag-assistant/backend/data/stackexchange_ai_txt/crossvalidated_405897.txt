Your confusion starts at 1. PCA is not a variable selection method. It is a linear transformation method that linearly transforms your predictors into so-called "principal components". If you decide to use the first 11 "PCA variables" based on your variance plot, you will need to use the first 11 principal components. These will be quite different from the original predictors, and usually nontrivial to interpret. We have an enormously good thread on PCA: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues . Very much recommended.
