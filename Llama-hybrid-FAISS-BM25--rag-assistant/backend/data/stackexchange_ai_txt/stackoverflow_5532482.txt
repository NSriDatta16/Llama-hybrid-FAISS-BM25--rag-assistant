i am trying to develop a test runner in python

Any pointers ? Suggestions ? Opinions ? I am thinking here is a draft specification: Can run individual test methods Can run a single Test Class Rsult in XML Result in HTML Dry-run Calculate and display time taken by each test case, and overall time. Timeout for test cases TAP type test results Log Levels Create Skeleton test cases Coverage Be able to run on a remote host (maybe) Test Reports Command line Help (--help) Now, where do i start ?
