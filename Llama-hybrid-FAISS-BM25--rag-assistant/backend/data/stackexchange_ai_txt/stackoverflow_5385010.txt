Can HtmlAgilityPack handle an xml file that comes with an xsl file to render html?

I was wondering the best way for HtmlAgilityPack to read an xml file that includes an xsl file to render html. Are there any settings on the HtmlDocument class that would assist in this, or do I have to find a way to execute the transformation before loading it with HtmlAgiliyPack? If yes for the latter, anybody know of a good library or method for such a transformation? Below is an example of a website that returns xml with xls file and the code that I would like to use. var uri = new Uri("http://www.skechers.com/"); var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); request.CookieContainer = cookieContainer; request.UserAgent = @"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5"; request.Method = "GET"; request.AllowAutoRedirect = true; request.Timeout = 15000; var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); var page = new HtmlDocument(); page.OptionReadEncoding = false; var stream = response.GetResponseStream(); page.Load(stream); This code does not throw any errors, but the xml is what gets parsed and not the transformation, which is what I want.
