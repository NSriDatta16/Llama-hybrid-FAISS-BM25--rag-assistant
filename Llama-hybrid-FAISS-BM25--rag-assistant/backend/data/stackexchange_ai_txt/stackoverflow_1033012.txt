Why PartCover report shows 0% when mstest runs successfully and all tests pass

I'm trying to get code coverage with mstest tests. I'm using PartCover 2.2.0.36424. The problem is with real assemblies, I get 0% code coverage (Note: All tests pass). On demo test for demo source that I created, it worked fine (the report makes sense). I noticed that in log file: for demo files, after line "Assembly AAAAAA loaded (MyTestesAssemblyName)", there is line "Class NNNNNN loaded (MyTestesAssemblyName.MyClassname)"; and for the real files ther is no second line (for class) after the line for assembly. Have any ideas what is different in our assemblies? (Note: they are not signed) 10x.
