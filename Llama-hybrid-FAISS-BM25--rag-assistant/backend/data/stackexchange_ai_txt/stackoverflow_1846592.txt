Prototyping neural networks

from your experience, which is the most effective approach to implement artificial neural networks prototypes? It is a lot of hype about R (free, but I didn't work with it) or Matlab (not free), another possible choice is to use a language like C++/Java/C#. The question is mainly targeting the people that tried to test some neural networks architectures or learning algorithms. If your choice is to use a programming language different from the three mentioned above, can you tell me their names and some explanations concerning your choice (excepting: this is the only/most used language known by me). Thanks.
