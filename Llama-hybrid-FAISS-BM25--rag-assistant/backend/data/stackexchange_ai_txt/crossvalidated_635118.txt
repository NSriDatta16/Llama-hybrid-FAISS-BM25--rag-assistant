Given that you have observations spread across different regions and you're interested in the structure of clusters within these regions, K-Means may not be the best fit if the clusters are not spherical or have varying sizes and densities. Algorithms that do not assume spherical clusters and can handle different densities, such as DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models, might be more appropriate. For comparing the structure of clusters, regardless of the clustering algorithm used, metrics such as the Silhouette Coefficient , Calinski-Harabasz Index , and the Davies-Bouldin Index can help with understanding the compactness and separation of the clusters. Beyond these metrics, a statistical approach could involve a comparison of variances such as classical ANOVA, MANOVA and spatial autocorrelation models. For the interest in dispersion, you could look a within-cluster dispersion (ie. a metric like the average distance from each point in a cluster to the centroid of that cluster); between-cluster edispersion (involving the calculating the distance between cluster centroids or other representative points); ratio of between- to within-cluster dispersion which can serve as a bespoke metric for this requirement indicating the degree to which clusters are separated from each other compared to how spread out they are internally.
