For what purposes have YOU used T4?

T4 has existed for several years in Visual Studio, but doesn't get a lot of attention. However, for those that know it, there seems to be some very creative and useful purposes. I am researching some different ways that T4 is used, and I would appreciate to hear how YOU may have used it for real life scenarios. I am primarily interested in non-standard and creative uses. Some interesting examples: Phil Haack uses T4 to create static CSS files from .less To Generate WPF and Silverlight Dependency Properties using T4 Templates Note : I realize this is a discussion-oriented question, but the answers could be helpful to others. I have tagged it as subjective and also marked as "community wiki", so please allow the question to remain open. Thanks!
