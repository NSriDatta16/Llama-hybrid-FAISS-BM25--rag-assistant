You might want to try a cleaner way of storing grouped options. get_option and set_option can work with objects and arrays, they're serialized in the database and unserialized upon retrieval. So the option name itself never changes, but the stuff inside it does. That way you'll not only be able to access your options as an array using functions such as isset, and empty, but you'll also be able to loop through them. Then, in case you need to add an extra field, just add an extra variable to your array and save.
