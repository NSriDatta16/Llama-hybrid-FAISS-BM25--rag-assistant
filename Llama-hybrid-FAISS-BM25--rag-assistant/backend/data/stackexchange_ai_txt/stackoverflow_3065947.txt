Deploying spring message driven pojo on weblogic 8.1

I am trying to deploy a spring message message driven POJO on weblogic 8.1. It is a simple POJO, and it works fine being run outside of an application server, but the messages do not seem to be picked up at all. I have created empty home and remote interfaces, as well as a container bean class that contains an instance of the pojo which it gets from the application context. I then added this container bean class to the ejb-jar.xml as a . I have not been able to get the messages pick up. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong? Could anyone point me to a tutorial on how to deploy a MDP? Thanks.
