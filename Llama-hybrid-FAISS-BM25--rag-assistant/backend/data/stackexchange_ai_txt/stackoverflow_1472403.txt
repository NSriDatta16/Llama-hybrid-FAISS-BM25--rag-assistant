No. Unlike Primary key, Foreign key does not imply an index. An explicit index on a foreign key is useful because foreign keys are often used in joins and the index can speed up the join. You should look up sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats after a full coverage test (or after some lengthy amount of day-to-day use) to understand what indexes are understand what indexes are ignored by the query optimizer when considering your access paths. These stats are reset after a server restart so they are no relevant unless the application(s) had run for enough time or the tests have covered every query run on the data, with realistic data amounts.
