Misfitting of drift rate in Wiener model

In a binary-decision experiment, the accuracy and response time of some subjects were recorded. My goal is to fit a Wiener model to response time and accuracy data. The binary experiment has three conditions and the drift rate (delta) can vary between these conditions. The data is uploaded. Let's take a look at the mean of response time load("dat.rdata") require(ggplot2) agg So, condition 3 has the slowest response time. Now let's fit the model using the RWiener package many_drifts and plot the drift rate by condition: drift So, here is a paradox: the drift rate for the slowest experiment is the highest! But it shouldn't be like that. Generally, I have 10 persons and the same paradox came up even when I used a Bayesian (diffusion) model and sampled from posterior distribution in JAGS. I dont know how to explain it? I would appreciate any help. P.S. data as CSV http://www.wikiupload.com/9LVT07H5QMVAGM4 ASCII http://www.wikiupload.com/7QUUCG8HJHWUZ8D or rdata. http://www.wikiupload.com/PT9W36EP10PRPN4
