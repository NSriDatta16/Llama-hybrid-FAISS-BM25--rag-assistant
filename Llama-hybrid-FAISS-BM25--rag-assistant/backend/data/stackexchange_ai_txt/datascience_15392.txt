extract names in a list of names

I have been provided with a text cleaning task and I am assuming this involves some amount of natural language processing. I have a collection of names which does not have any specific pattern and I need to separate individual names from that list. Below is an example: John Batista Barack Obama George W. Bush Serafim Batzoglou Vijay Pande Fei Fei Li Oussama Khatib Kwame Nkrumah John Oliver As you can see there are two things peculiar with the paragraph. 1) space " " is the only delimiter, however, it is unusable as there are names which have middle names. 2) I have french, German, Spanish, Chinese and other ethnic sounding names written in English. Now the challenge I am facing is to find names from this paragraph. I am very new to NLP and use Python and R for modeling work. Any help will be appreciated.
