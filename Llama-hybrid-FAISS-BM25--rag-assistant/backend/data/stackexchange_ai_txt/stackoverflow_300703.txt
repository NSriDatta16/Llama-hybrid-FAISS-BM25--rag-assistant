What release management solutions are worth investigating?

In organisations where you have large numbers of applications, written in a myriad of languages running on innumerable platforms and databases how do folks manage the release of builds and patches, particularly when some of the releases are 3rd party? I know there a whole bunch of "Release Management" applications out there, but I'd be interested to know what experiences people have had. To clarify, this isn't a question on configuration management, although that might be a small part of it. I'm more interested in managing software releases and the interdependencies and prerequisites that stem from that.
