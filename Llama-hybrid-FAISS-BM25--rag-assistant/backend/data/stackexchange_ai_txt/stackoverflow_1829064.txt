I don't if i'm approaching this question properly... The first point is totally arbitary, and sounds a bit fascist, or bolshie if you come from the Uk. Many different types of libraries come with configuration file. What other way would you do it? How would it work if you didn't have configure it, which is what .NET configuration model is built on. Folk need to stop focusing on architecture buffs, P&P mechanics and programming purists, who often take extreme views based on some best, or minor design principles, above all else saying you should do this and do that. On a purley technical footing, if your wanting to hide your configuration file, encrypt them. If you don't want to do that, but want them exposed to authorized users, then use protected storage. Bob.
