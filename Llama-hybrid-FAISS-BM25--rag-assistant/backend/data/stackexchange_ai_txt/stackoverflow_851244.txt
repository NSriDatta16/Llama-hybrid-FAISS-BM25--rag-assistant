The only way I can think of to automate the changing of text inside of a PSD would be to use a regex based substitution. Create a very simple picture in Photoshop, perhaps a white background and a text layer, with the text being a known length. Search the file for your text, and with a hex editor, search nearby for the length of the text (which may or may not be part of the file format). Try changing the text, first to a string of the same length, then to something shorter/longer. Open in Photoshop after each change to see if the file is corrupt. This method, if viable, will only work if the layer in question contains a known string, which can be substituted for your other value. Note that I have no idea whether this will work, as I don't have Photoshop on this computer to try this method out. Perhaps you can make it work? As for converting to png, I am at a loss. If the replacing script is in Python, you may be able to do it with the Python Imaging Library (PIL, which seems to support it ), but otherwise you may just have to open Photoshop to do the conversion. Which means that it probably wouldn't be worth it to change the text pragmatically in the first place.
