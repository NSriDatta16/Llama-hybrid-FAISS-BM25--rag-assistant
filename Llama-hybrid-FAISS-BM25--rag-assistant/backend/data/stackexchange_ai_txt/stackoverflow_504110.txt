SQL 2005 Transactional Replication: Behavior during snapshot processing?

So, I've got SQL (2005) Transactional Replication generally working well with a single publisher and single (read-only) subscriber. Data changes and updates flow perfectly, with about 5 second latency, which is just fine. My one nagging problem, that I've spent a couple days trying to solve (and Googling everywhere for answers) is that new sprocs/tables/etc. do not get propagated to the read-only subscriber, even though I've added them as "articles" to the "publication". The publication has "transmit schema changes" set to ON, and stored procedures are set to transfer their definitions. But, for some reason, they don't. My "snapshot agent" process is set to NOT SCHEDULED. (In other words, it only happens once, when I initiate it manually.) Should I be putting this on a schedule to enable the transfer of new or modified tables and sprocs? I thought the mere act of adding the object as an article to the publication would do it, but it's still not sending it unless I do a snapshot. The WAN connecting these is totally fast and reliable, so that's not the issue, and table-data-updates transfer relatively fast and flawlessly. While I could put my snapshot agent on a schedule, does this have any real-time production impacts for users of the main publication database or the read-only copy? (My site currently gets 4+ million unique-users a month, so I'd like to have minimal disruption...) Thanks!
