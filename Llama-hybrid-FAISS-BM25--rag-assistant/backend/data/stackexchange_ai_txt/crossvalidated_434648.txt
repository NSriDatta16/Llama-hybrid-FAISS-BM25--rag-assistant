Which are the typical metrics used to evaluate a model in Crossvalidation?

I have implemented a 5 fold Cross-Validation method for classifiers in MATLAB. To choose the best model i evaluate the best model as the one that obtained a better average accuracy. Now i would like to know if accuracy is an acceptable standard measure or it is advisable to use other metrics or even statistics. For example, there is any difference between magnifying the average accuracy or minimizing the MSE?
