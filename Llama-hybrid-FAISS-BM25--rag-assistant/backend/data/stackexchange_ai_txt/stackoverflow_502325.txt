Frameworks like .NET and jQuery have been largely backward compatible and allows you to use new features slowly. Mootools however... the API broke so many things from 1.11 to 1.2 to 1.3. Upgrading was not straightforward in that case. As a rule, I try to wait for something to be out of beta before embracing it in production code. An endorsement can go a long way too - since Microsoft has called jQuery the winner of client-side frameworks its been easy to encourage others to pick it up too.
