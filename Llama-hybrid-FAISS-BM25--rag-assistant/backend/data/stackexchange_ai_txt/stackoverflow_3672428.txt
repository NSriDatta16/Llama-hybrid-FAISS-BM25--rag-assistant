MySQL or PHP date averages

I am trying to figure out how to find the average of a number of different time values, the time values are time differences from 2 dates so they will be in the format of hh:mm:ss . So if I had 4 time values of: 00:11:05 00:01:30 00:04:25 00:09:50 I have trouble figuring this out. I think these time values would need to be converted to some type of integer value then divided then converted back to this time format. Any help is appreciated. Thanks
