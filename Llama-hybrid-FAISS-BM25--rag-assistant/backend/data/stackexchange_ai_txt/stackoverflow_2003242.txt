Even if there was such a tool, I would strongly encourage you to reconsider this idea. Here are just a few problems I think you'll find with doing this: Your code will no longer be standard C. That means that you'll have a problem with other programmers reading your code. You'll also be unable to use any code-analysis tools, since they won't understand your syntax. If you've got some kind of tool that will convert on, say, every compile, that still means you'll be writing different code than you'll be reading. I would hate to use a tool that changes my code for me all the time. This really seems to be a case where fitting your habits to everybody else is the smarter approach. Hope this causes you to reconsider.
