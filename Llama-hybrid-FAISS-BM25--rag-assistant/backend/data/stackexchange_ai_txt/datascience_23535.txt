How to decide which images to label next?

We have a custom dataset of 20 thousand images with two pixel-wise labeled classes. However we have 1 million more raw images, which we would like to label. We want to label the most important new images first. Importance is defined as: Images with the more new information Images helping our deep learning bounding box classifier to improve So instead of labeling images, where we already have about thousand similar ones, we first want to label the images which are quite different from the already-labeled ones and help more to improve our classifier. How can we assign priorities and decide which images to label first?
