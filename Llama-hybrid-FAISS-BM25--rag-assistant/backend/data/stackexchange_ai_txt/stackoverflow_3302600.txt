How to fail the build when there is new uncovered code?

Do any code coverage tools for Java allow you to cause the build to fail when new uncovered code gets introduced? I don't want to fail the build based on an arbitrary cutoff like 80% because in a large codebase, the actual coverage percentage rarely fluctuates. Also if coverage falls by 0.1% it's hard to tell which are the new uncovered lines. EDIT I'm convinced not to fail the build. The other part of the question still stands. How can I find only the uncovered code that was recently checked in?
