Average = Sum / Number of values Just store all 3 values, there's no need for anything complicated. If you store the Average and Sum then calculate Number of values you'll lose a little accuracy due to truncation of Average. If you store the Average and Number of values then calculate Sum you'll lose even more accuracy. You have more margin for error in calculating a correct value for Number of values than Sum thanks to it being an integer.
