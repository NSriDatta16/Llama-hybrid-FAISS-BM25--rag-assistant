What is the impact of upgrading MSBuild to VS2010 for projects targeting .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.5?

I’m working on the build process for a VS 2010 solution and some projects within it target the .NET framework 4.0. As far as I know, to have this type of solution built by TFS 2008 we will have to change the version of the MSBuild.exe file used by the build agent – modifying the TFSBuildService.exe.config file, pointing MSBuildPath entry accordingly. Do you know if this will have any impact to existing project builds that target the 2.0 and 3.5 framework? Are you aware of any known issues with this type of set up?
