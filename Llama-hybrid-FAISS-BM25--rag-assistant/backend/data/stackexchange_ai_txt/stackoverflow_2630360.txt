VB.NET ASP.NET Web Application woes (VS 2008)

I am making my first web application with ASP.NET and I am having a rough time. I have previously created the application I am working on as a Windows Form application and it works great, but I am having problems with the HTML side of things in the web application. My issues are pretty minor, but very annoying. I have worked with websites before and CSS, but as far as I can tell I do not have direct access to a CSS when creating a web application in VS 2008. My biggest issue is the positioning of components that I have dragged onto the "Default.aspx" form. For instance, how am I supposed to float a panel next to another one if I don't have a CSS, or how am I to correctly position a label?
