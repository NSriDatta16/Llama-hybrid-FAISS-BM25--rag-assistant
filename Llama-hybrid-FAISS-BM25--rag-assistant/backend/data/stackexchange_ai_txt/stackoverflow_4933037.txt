How to disable custom layouts in magento based on a custom module state?

I have created a file called "myblock.phtml" in frontend\default\default\layout\mytemplate .It simply displays a "check " button which in turns calls a custom module's controller url.The question is,I want to stop displaying that button(i.e;the myblock.html template ) whenever that custom module is disabled since it doesnt make sense without the enabling the module.Any way to tweak within the module's config.xml??
