Unless it's very important that you throw an exception for non-boolean values, I think it would be more elegant to coerce the value to a boolean, for example with !! : baz = !! options.fetch(:baz, true) That way the client code can pass any truthy or falsy value, but you can still be sure that the value you work with is a proper boolean. You could also use the ternary operator (e.g. baz = options.fetch(:baz, true) ? true : false if you feel that !! is unclear.
