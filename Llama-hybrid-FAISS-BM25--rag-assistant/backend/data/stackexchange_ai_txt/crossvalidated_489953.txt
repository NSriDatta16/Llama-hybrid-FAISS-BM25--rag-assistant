Is there anything wrong with having a Bayesian logistic regression model with beta priors?

The Bayesian logistic regression model with beta priors seem to work using JAGS. I just can't find any examples of it in any literature or any tutorials. They all seem to use normal priors. Just want to know there are any issues. Model in JAGS (I have just changed a dnorm model to a dbeta one and I have put in uninformed priors): model { for ( i in 1:Ntotal ) { # In JAGS, ilogit is logistic: y[i] ~ dbern( ilogit( zbeta0 + sum( zbeta[1:Nx] * zx[i,1:Nx] ) ) ) } # Priors vague on standardised scale: zbeta0 ~ dbeta(1,1) for ( j in 1:Nx ) { zbeta[j] ~ dbeta(1,1) } # Transform to original scale: beta[1:Nx] There are four variables - they are proportions in the domain [0,1] that try to predict a binary indicator.
