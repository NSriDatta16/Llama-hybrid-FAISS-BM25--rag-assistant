Jquery .html() function returns html out of nested order

I have a method which returns a persisted html template from a database. The template is of the format: Some Headline Some text here Some Headline Some text here ...and so on. However after I run the following: alert(data); //check that the template is in order. It Is. $('#template_area').html(data); the Html is now: Some Headline Some text here Some Headline Some text here ...and so on. So what gives? Is there a better way to replace the empty template_area's content than the .html() method? EDIT: Solved. replacing paragraphs with divs yields the correct nesting. Jquery: writing better html than I since 2006.
