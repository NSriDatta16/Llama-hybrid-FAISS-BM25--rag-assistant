Depending on what tool you are using for Holt you can always set the value for $\beta$ close to $0.9$ to make it more reactive to recent changes. Keep in mind the formula for Holt's method: $$\hat{Y}_{t+1} = \alpha Y_{t} + (1-\alpha)(\hat{L}_{t}+\hat{T}_{t})$$ $$\hat{T}_{t} = \beta (Y_{t}-Y_{t-1})+(1-\beta)\hat{T}_{t-1}$$ $Y_t$ is the actual value, $\hat{Y}_{t}$ is the estimated/forecast value, $\hat{L}_{t}$ is the estimated level, and $\hat{T}_{t}$ is the estimated trend. $\beta$ is the trend smoothing factor, $0 . $\beta$ close to $0$ tends to give a long term average of the trend, while $\beta$ close to $1$ gives you a value that is almost a copy of the most recent value, with little consideration of previous values. Hence a high $\beta$ means the trend is more reactive to recent changes. Most modern tools will find $\beta$ automatically using an optimization routine, but you could simply manually set it to $0.9$ or something. This answers your basic question, but doesn't really solve your underlying challenge which is detecting underlying structural changes. Making the trend very reactive might help in capturing structural shifts, but there are better ways to do so with change point detection and structural break detection methods.
