Not very "elegant" and kinda a waste, but if you really care what the code looks like you could make your own fancy flag and then do a str_replace. Example: $myoutput = "After this sentence there is a line break. .|.. Here is a new line."; $myoutput = str_replace(".|..","&lt;br />",$myoutput); or how about: $myoutput = "After this sentence there is a line break. E(*)3 Here is a new line."; $myoutput = str_replace("E(*)3","&lt;br />",$myoutput); I call the first method "middle finger style" and the second "goatse style".
