If you are looking for something more concise and elegant I would suggest you to look forward functional languages like OCaml or Haskell (maybe F# if you want an API similar to the Java one) that have the so called type reconstruction which is how the real generics thing should be implemented.. maybe it's a little bit more strict but you don't lose expressivity, you just gain in syntax. In any case your question is quite silly, you don't choose a language according to just "generics", it's a long and complex tale which usually includes what are you going to develop. Every program has its story and its needs.
