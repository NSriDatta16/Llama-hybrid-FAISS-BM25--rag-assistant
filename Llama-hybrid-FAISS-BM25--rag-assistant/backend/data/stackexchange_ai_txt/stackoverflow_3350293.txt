how to sort durations with Qt?

i'm trying to make QSortFilterProxyModel sort items by duration. preconditions: hours and minutes must not have leading zeros if duration is less than an hour, then hours must not be displayed, but only minutes and seconds if duration is less than a minute, then 0 minutes and the corresponding number of seconds must be displayed [0:42] tried to store durations in the source model as H:mm:ss ( http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qtime.html#toString ) if they are one hour or longer, and as m:ss - if less than an hour, but since sorting of QStrings is alphabetical, then, for instance, 5:20 is "more" than 12:09 as its first digit is greater. is there an elegant way to do the sorting?
