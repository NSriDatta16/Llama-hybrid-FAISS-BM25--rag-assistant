I reproduced the results, using the wikipedia page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression as a guide, instead of Pattern Recognition, and I got the exact same results, eg for 25 samples: The full jupyter notebook (mostly using torch, rather than numpy, just a bit of numpy for the gaussian/IG sampling), is at https://github.com/hughperkins/pub-prototyping/blob/f1398e2244aa74da914534e26a3c164823d52f5c/maths/bayesian_linear_regression.ipynb I hypothesized that it's not that the results are wrong/incorrect, but that given these data, the most probable lines are actually fairly well centred between the points. It would seem more probable that the mean line is fairly central, with just highish variance, than that the line passes through some of the outliers, perhaps? To test this hypothesis, I tried with just 7 results, and the lines were more varied, and looked fairly plausible to me: So, I'm going to say that, given we both independently worked through the formulae, from independent sources of formulae, and writing the code entirely from scratch, and get the same results, that: the results are in fact correct given the number of points we have in your example, and my first example, the most likely mean lines are in fact fairly well centred between the points if you want to see lines that vary more, then you might need to reduce the number of points perhaps? As per my second example tldr: your code and results seem correct, as far as I can see
