Your analysis seems correct in that the distinct applies to the 'original' nodes, not the related ones. So you could try to 'reverse' your view construction, starting from the now 'related' nodes, adding a relation to the now 'original' nodes and filtering the results on the terms of those. The last point is the one I'm not sure about, in that I don't know if it is possible to apply the term filter on the nodes pulled in via a relationship, but it might be worth a try. If it should turn out to be impossible to get your desired results by means of the 'standard' views functionality, there are various options to manipulate a view from custom code, but this would need a more detailed knowledge of the usage scenario (e.g. does it need to work with a pager and similar). If it looks like you need to go that route, you could enhance your question with a description of what you need to achieve exactly. Edit: As for options to manipulate a view programmatically, you could take a look at the views module hooks . For small adjustments of the query result, one can implement hook_views_pre_render() and manipulate the returned resultset in $view->result directly (that is, after the query got executed). However, for bigger manipulations (like in your case), one might implement hook_views_query_alter() and adjust the actual query before it is used to return a resultset. Care must be taken to only alter sort or filter criterias, but keeping the general structure of the returned data (e.g. it still needs to contain all the fields the view expects). While this approach gives huge flexibility, one needs to be aware that it is fragile concerning later changes applied to the view - if the view definition is changed in a way that alters the constructed query, the alteration done on hook_views_query_alter() might not work anymore, or cause weird results. The views hooks get fired for every view, so one needs to check for the right view (and eventually display also) before applying any changes in there.
