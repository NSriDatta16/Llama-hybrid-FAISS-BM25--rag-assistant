The problem, I think, is that the value of an input field is contained inside the value attribute, not in the element's contents. You need an attribute selector. Try this: $('#registerajax_email[value*="yahoo.com"]').val(''); which uses the Attribute Contains Selector This is the most generous of the jQuery attribute selectors that match against a value. It will select an element if the selector's string appears anywhere within the element's attribute value. The selector you were using (the :contains() selector) does not look at element attributes: The matching text can appear directly within the selected element, in any of that element's descendants, or a combination thereof. However, since you're targeting the element by ID, you really don't need to use an attribute selector at all. Most likely this code should be contained inside an event, as Robert Koritnik suggested, and you can just check the string contains using a simple indexOf: // Register event onBlur (you could also use change, or whatever event suited the situation) $('#registerajax_email').blur(function() { // Does value contain yahoo.com? if ($(this).val().indexOf("yahoo.com") != -1) { // clear the value $(this).val(""); } });
