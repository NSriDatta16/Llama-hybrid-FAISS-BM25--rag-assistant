They are pretty much interchangeable. Which you use and when may have different connotations, however. And while almost everyone recognizes them as interchangeable, some people and textbooks do not agree. Here are their connotations, as far as I know: Mean : The arithmetic mean. That is, the sum divided by the total number of observations. Not to be confused with the geometric mean. Average : Almost always the same as the mean. Some people believe the term "average" to be the mean paired with its standard deviation. Some people consider any measure of center to be an average. (ie, "the median is an average"). But the people who use this context are small. Don't know if I've ever met any in real life. Expectation : The connotation is that this is a theoretical mean. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, recording a 1 for heads and 0 for tails, you get 6 heads and 4 tails. The mean will be 0.6, but the expectation would have been 0.5.
