The reason your program is freezing is, roughly speaking, that the message box and the drag-drop subsystem are fighting over the mouse. You don't say whether the program freezes when the message box is displayed or when it is dismissed, but I'd guess the problem is that the drag-drop subsystem is still capturing the mouse, preventing you from clicking the message box buttons. Or the message box has broken the capture and the drag-drop system is left trying to run a loop that can now never finish. The solution is to change the MessageBox.Show to a Trace.WriteLine. This will give you the diagnostic output you want without interfering with the mouse handling.
