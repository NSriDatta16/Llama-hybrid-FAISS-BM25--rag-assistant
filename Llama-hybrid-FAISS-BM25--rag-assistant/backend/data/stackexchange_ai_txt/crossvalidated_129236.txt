I agree with whuber --- would also state that the odds of predicting a win/ loss/ draw changes again if one is even roughly aware of the relative strength of the teams. Picking a win or loss is different than picking above or below the "Vegas Spread" --- the reason for such an existence of said spread (or horse betting odds) -- is due to a free market to an extent (in horse race, entirely the free market --- odds literally change as wagers and betting pools for X horse change --- while the horses themselves and "true model odds" of one winning do not change). So what -- what does the "Free market" determining betting odds/ the predicted score spread have to do with calling winners? Well, it turns out, as in predicting the stock market, the free market is extremely adept at forecasting, and nearly impossible to beat systematically using currently known forecasting methods. In other words, in the NFL, if you always picked the Vegas favorite to "win" --- which anyone can do --- you would fare much better than 50% success rate on average. Of course, such bets are not as common, and pay out less than double your money.
