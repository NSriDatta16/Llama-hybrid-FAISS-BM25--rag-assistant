I usually don't use pragma once because pragmas are not standad. You could have to port your code to a different compiler where it's not defined, and you'd have to rewrite each with #ifndef ... #define idiom. This is because I go straight with #ifndef ... #define . Second thing: using many includes in an header file is not a good idea: I always try to minimize them. If you got too much of them, each time you change a little thing in one of them you'll have to recompile each dependent .cpp file. If that's the case, I adopt the Pimpl idiom, that you can find described here (see the C++ example). Anyway, if the project's size is not that big, I think that your approach is correct.
