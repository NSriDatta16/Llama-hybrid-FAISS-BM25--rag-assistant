What machine learning algorithms for process optimization

I found a lot of articles talking about manufacturing process optimization using ML but I could not find detailed methodology with state-of-the-art algorithms to use for this. Classical ML algorithms are meant to predict while process optimization are about explaining data. To do so, I found ways to retro-engineer models to find correlations such as importance plot, SHAP and so on. This approach works but with high effort to format results in an understandable way for non-data scientists. My willing would be to have an algorithm able to find the best process windows (intervals for KPP - key process parameters) to optimize a given KPI - key process indicator. For example "quality is x% better if your process is running with parameter A between x and y and parameter B above z". Of course, the algorithm would have to penalize rule's complexity (a rule based on 1 parameter is better than a rule based on 2) and lack of representativeness (a rule with 30% of my data inside the window is better than one with only 3%). Is this approach the good one? Does such algorithms exists (open source if possible) or should it be developed from scratch? Would you have any other approach/algorithm in mind for process optimization?
