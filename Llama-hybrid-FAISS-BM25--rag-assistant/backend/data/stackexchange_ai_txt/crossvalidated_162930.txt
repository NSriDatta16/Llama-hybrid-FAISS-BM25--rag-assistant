CausalImpact - Should I use more than one control?

In the intro document ( https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html ) it suggests that using one predictor is not ideal. Am I current in understand that they mean one control? If so, should I look into using multiple time series as controls? I was using this method, but summing up all of the control streams into 1 since I am not sure whether using multiple controls is possible. Are there pros and cons of both approachs?
