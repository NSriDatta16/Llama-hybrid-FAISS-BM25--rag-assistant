Way to store large amount of experiments and corresponding results

I have an experiment setup that produces a few csv and text files every run. In my research I run a number of these in parallel each day and trying to store and organized them in a directory heir-achy is getting rather inefficient and tedious. One idea I thought of doing was using MySQL or something to store the the run description along with the associated output. This however has the inefficiency in that I am storing a number of gigantic Strings in the table fields. Basically I would like to know if a system exists that can automatically organize the output of runs. Such that it would give a list of the run descriptions, and upon choosing this you can request the corresponding outputs. This wouldn't have to be in any particular language as I can hopefully just add the step to a shell script.
