After a couple of days of pondering...here's my answer to my question above: Does assigning the role of 'Attacker' (a negative role) to a user strike you as being a sensible thing to do. My answer: No, its a very silly thing to do. Why Aside from the issues outlined by koen and Robert Harvey.. The ACL allows for roles to be inherited and so having positive AND negative roles would cause more chance of complexity and conflict if two roles become applicable to a situation. I mean 'positive' in the sense of : 'only let someone do something if they are this role' As opposed to 'negative' in the sense of: 'only let someone do something if they are NOT this role' Therefore, if you were going to add a role to define 'a hacker', it would be better to keep it in the positive (by negating the negative) - i.e. 'NOT a hacker'. Or to rephrase that rolename: ''FriendlyUser'' All positive : + Role1: FriendlyUser + Role2: Guest + Role3: Member + Role4: Admin As opposed to mixed: - Role1: Hacker + Role2: Guest + Role3: Member + Role4: Admin The second role list is much more confusing.
