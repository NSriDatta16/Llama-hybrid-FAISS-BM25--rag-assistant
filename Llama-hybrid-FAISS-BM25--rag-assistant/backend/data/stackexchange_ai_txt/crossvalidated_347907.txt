How are models combined in locally weighted linear regression?

The cost function in locally weighted linear regression is $$J(\theta)= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^mw^{(i)}(y^{(i)} - \theta^Tx^{(i)}) =(X\theta - y)^TW(X\theta-y),$$ where $x^{(i)}$ is the $i$-th instance, $y^{(i)}$ is its corresponding class label, $\theta$ are the model parameters, and $w^{(i)}$ is the weight of the $i$-th instance, given by $$w^{(i)} = \exp\Big(-\frac{(x - x^{(i)})^2}{2\tau^2}\Big),$$ where $\tau$ is the bandwidth, and $x$ is the query point, which is fixed for a given regression model and is typically one of the instances. I am trying to implement locally weighted linear regression, where my dataset is such that $y\in\mathbb{R}^{450\times 1}$, $X\in\mathbb{R}^{450\times 2}$ (including the intercepts), and $W\in\mathbb{R}^{450\times 450}$. The point of weighted linear regression is to choose a query point, $x$, meaning that the instances close to $x$ are weighted more heavily in the regression model. Following this question: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/16850/understanding-locally-weighted-linear-regression , I believe a model is supposed to be generated for each query point (i.e. a query point corresponding to each instance), meaning that 450 models will be generated in this case. The models are then supposed to be combined to give a final model. I take the following steps: thetas = [] for instance in X: Set current instance as the query point Compute weights for all instances using the equation above Compute optimal parameters using the equation for theta above Append these parameters to thetas And this gives us 450 linear regression models for the data, with each model being weighted around a specific query point. (If this is an incorrect implementation, please correct me.) Main problem The final stage is to combine these 450 models to give the final weighted linear regression model. How do I do this? Am I supposed to take some kind of average of the parameters across each model? My Google searches so far haven't been fruitful.
