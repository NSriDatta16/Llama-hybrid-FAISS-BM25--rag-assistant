In random forest, what happens if I add features that are correlated?

I'm training a random forest, trying to predict market shares of future stores on geographical areas. I have many features for these areas, some of which tell similar but different things about one thing. For example, I know the total number of accommodations in the area ( housings ? not sure of the exact terminology), and I also have 5 others columns which are all linked in the following way : number of main accommodations + number of secondary accommodations + number of holiday accommodations = number of houses + number of flats = accommodations I have the feeling that including them all in my model would be wrong... but including them might be important... Any hint on how I should handle this ? Would it be a good idea to include accommodations as absolute value and include all the other five but as % (of accommodations ) and not as absolute values ? In a similar fashion, I also have the total number of households of the area, the total income of the area, and the average income of households in the area (so that households * average income = total income ). I have the feeling using the average and not the total income would be a better idea, but how can I be sure I'm right ? (I guess I could train three random forests using the average income only, the total income only, and both, and see how they perform on cross validation, but is there a rule of thumb that I should know of which can make me go faster ?) Thanks (In case it's relevant, I'm using R and the randomForest package)
