I was looking for the same thing a while ago. Something that people kept suggesting was the Three20 project (google it). For my needs this was overkill because it requires the whole project to build and I didn't want the whole project. Plus it's more fun to try it yourself :) I ended up starting from scratch and making my own: I started out with a subclass of a UIScrollView to contain the different controls. I subclassed a UITextField and overrided "editingRectForBounds" to support multiple lines. The bit where the contacts are displayed is just a UITableView with a background color of: [UIColor colorWithRed:0.92 green:0.92 blue:0.92 alpha:1]; And separator color: [UIColor colorWithWhite:0.85 alpha:1]; This and the use of a shadow makes it looks like it's sunken slightly under the UITextField. I create the shadow with a custom UIView, loading it once and hiding it when required, but it works just as well with an image. Finally, I made the blue pill shapes with a custom UIView which can intercept "touchesBegan" to know when they should change color. Adding them is a simple matter of calculating where they need to go and using: [myTextField addSubview:myBlueView]; Hope that helps!
