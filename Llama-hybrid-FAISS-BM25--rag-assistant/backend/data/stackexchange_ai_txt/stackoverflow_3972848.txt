After quite a lot of browsing through the code and with some help from a collegue, we found out the two file to change for adding a column to such view: app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/sales/order/view/items.phtml for adding the table header app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/sales/order/view/items/renderer/default.phtml for filling the column with data. I'm not really experienced with Magento but I guess that, in order to do a "clean job", one should not directly modify those files but override them instead. EDIT app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/downloadable/sales/order/view/items/renderer/downloadable.phtml for filling the column with data for downloadable products.
