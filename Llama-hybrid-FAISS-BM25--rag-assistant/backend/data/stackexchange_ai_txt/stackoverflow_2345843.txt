Honestly, your best bet is to go back and get the brute force solution working. Once that is done (and if you still have time, etc) you can look for a better algorithm. EDIT to the down voter. The student is (should be) trying to get his homework done on time . By the sounds of it, his homework is a programming exercise where a brute-force solution would be adequate. Helping him to figure out an efficient algorithm is not addressing his REAL problem. In this case he has tried the simple brute-force approach (which everyone agrees ought to work for small N values) and given up on it prematurely to try something that is probably more difficult. Any experienced developer will tell you that this is a bad idea. The student needs and deserves to be told so, and if he is sensible he will pay attention. But obviously, it his choice ...
