How do I go about including the Tortuga 22 NinePatch library to my XCode project?

First of all, there is finally NinePatch support for the iPhone, BIG thanks to the Tortuga 22 team for that. Unfortunately for me I have not been able to add their library to my project. What is NinePatch? The Tortuga 22 blog post. The source code at git hub. If I just drag and drop the source-files into my project I get a ton of "No such file or directory"-errors. If I reference the libNinePatch.a-file as an external framework I get the same result. What is the proper way of doing this? There are no instructions from their part so I guess there must a fairly straight forward way of doing this. Thanks in advance. //Abeansits
