You will have to have a single UIView containing your UIImageView and UIButton. Using InterfaceBuilder first drag the UIImageView and then drag the UIButton inside the parent UIVIew. Or programmatically you can call the parent UIView's addSubView method first for the UIImageView and then for the UIButton view [view addSubview:myImageView] [view addSubview:myButton] Either of this approach will place the instance UIButton on top of the UIImageView when the UIView is rendered Also, FYI, transparency of a View can be controlled through its alpha property alpha = 0 being the most transparent and alpha = 1 being the most opaque Hope this helps.
