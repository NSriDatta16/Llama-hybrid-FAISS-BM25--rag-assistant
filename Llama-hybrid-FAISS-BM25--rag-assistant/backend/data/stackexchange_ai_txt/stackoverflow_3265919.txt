C#, right click in internet explorer using watin

Using WatiN, I'm loading up http://maps.google.com/ All I want to do is right click the map and click "Center map here" when the context menu pops up. Another great feature would be to be able to "drag and drop" the mouse on the map so as to make the map scroll. I would really appreciate some help. Thankyou very much, Fidel
