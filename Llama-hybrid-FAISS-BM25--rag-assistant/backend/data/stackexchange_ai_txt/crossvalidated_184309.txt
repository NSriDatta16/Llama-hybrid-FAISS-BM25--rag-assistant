Interpreting the value of pair correlation function

I'm attempting to learn various methods for summarizing spatial statistics, and I'm struggling to understand how to interpret the value of the pair correlation function. This link gives a nice qualitative description of how the PCF is different from Ripley's K function, but it doesn't go into how the value itself can be informative. The documentation on pcf() from spatstat in R has some insight, telling me how to interpret $g(r)$ values above and below 1 (the value of $g(r)$ corresponding to CSR), but no more granularity than that. My question: How do I interpret the value of the pair correlation function? As some further context, here are two graphs of the PCF for two different species in a given observational area: And a second species: At a distance of 50 meters, Species 1 has a g(r) value of ~1.5 while Species 2 has a g(r) value of ~1.25. Can I infer anything about the two species from those values? For example, is it appropriate to say that at 50m, Species 1 is 120% as dense as Species 2? As always, many thanks for any assistance folks can provide. ---Edit after further research--- After reading some more, particularly this, pg 620 , it seems I can consider the $g(r)$ as a ratio of the density at a given distance to the total average density across the window of observation? Further, since CSR is $g_{poiss}(r)=1$, $g(r)$ is the ratio of density to a Poisson CSR?
