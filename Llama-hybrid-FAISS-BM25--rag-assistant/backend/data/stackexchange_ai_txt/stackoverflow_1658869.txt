ANTLR: "missing attribute access on rule scope" problem

I am trying to build an ANTLR grammar that parses tagged sentences such as: DT The NP cat VB ate DT a NP rat and have the grammar: fragment TOKEN : (('A'..'Z') | ('a'..'z'))+; fragment WS : (' ' | '\t')+; WSX : WS; DTTOK : ('DT' WS TOKEN); NPTOK : ('NP' WS TOKEN); nounPhrase: (DTTOK WSX NPTOK); chunker : nounPhrase {System.out.println("chunk found "+"("+$nounPhrase+")");}; The grammar generator generates the " missing attribute access on rule scope: nounPhrase " in the last line. [I am still new to ANTLR and although some grammars work it's still trial and error. I also frequently get an "OutOfMemory" error when running grammars as small as this - any help welcome.] I am using ANTLRWorks 1.3 to generate the code and am running under Java 1.6.
