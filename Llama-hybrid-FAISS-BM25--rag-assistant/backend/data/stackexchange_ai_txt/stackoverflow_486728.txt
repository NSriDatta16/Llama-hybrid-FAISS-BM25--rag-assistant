Another thing you could do would be to manually undo the bad commit on the branch, which would then allow you to merge the branch back into the trunk as you would normally. TortoiseSVN Using TortoiseSVN you open up the log view on a file, select the offending version, and choose "Revert changes from this revision" from the right click menu. Commit the changes it makes on your working copy and then you can merge the branch back in easily. Command Line To do this with the command line client you perform a reverse merge, (This is taken from the Pragmatic Source Control using Subversion book) where you merge the changes between the offending version and the previous version into the working copy of the file. Then as above you'd commit the changes and can then branch normally. In your example you would do something like: svn merge -r 4:3 test.txt
