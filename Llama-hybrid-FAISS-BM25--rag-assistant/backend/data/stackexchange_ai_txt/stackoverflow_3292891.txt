I'm going to answer this as if you're asking for advice on column definitions. I will not copy and paste your tables, because that's completely silly. Don't store dates and times as integers. Use a DATETIME column instead. Keep in mind that MySQL stores DATETIMEs as GMT, but presents them in whatever timezone it's been configured to use. It may be worth setting the connection time zone to GMT so that your separate time zone storage will work. Keep in mind that not all time zones are full hour offsets from GMT. Daylight Saving Time can throw a monkey wrench in hour-based calculations as well. You may want to store the time zone string (i.e. "America/Los_Angeles") and figure out the proper offset at runtime. You do not need to specify a character count for integer columns. Don't be afraid of TEXT columns. You have a lot of VARCHAR(255)s for data that can easily be longer than 255 characters, like a URL. Keep in mind that optimizing for a specific database engine, or optimizing for storage on disk is the very last thing you should do. Make your column definitions fit the data . Premature optimization is one of the many roots of all evil in this world. Don't worry about tinyint vs smallint vs int vs bigint, or char vs varchar vs text vs bigtext. It won't matter for you 95% of the time as long as the data fits.
