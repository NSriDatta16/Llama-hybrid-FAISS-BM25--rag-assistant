How to deal with an SVM with categorical attributes

I have a space of 35 dimensions (attributes). My analytic problem is a simple classification one. Out of 35 dimensions, more than 25 are categorical and each attribute takes more than 50+ types of values. In that scenario, introducing a dummy variable also will not work for me. How can I run an SVM on a space which has a lot of categorical attributes?
