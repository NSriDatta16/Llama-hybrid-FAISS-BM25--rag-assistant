I'm guessing wildly here, but can you see if You have a nonstandard Setup.hs ? You have flags: set in ~/.cabal/config ? The most helpful tutorial I have found is not ostensibly about Cabal; it is called How to Write a Haskell Program . I have looked through the guide you mention (the official Cabal documentation), and the information I wanted is a tiny bit of flotsam swimming in a sea of complexity. I assume that the complexity serves some useful purpose, since I know that good people have been working very hard on Cabal for several years, but as an outsider, I find the state of play discouraging. I was just barely able to build, install, and upload a simple package of my ownâ€”with a little help from my friends on SO. I tentatively suggest you might want to avoid cabal upgrade and maybe try cabal install instead, and see if you can move forward with your original goals.
