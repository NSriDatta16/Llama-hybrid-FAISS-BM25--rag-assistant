How the current date is treated for a trailing/moving average

I'm not sure if this is more a stats question or a finance question, but I'll post it here. Let's say I have the following data for the sales of a product by day: # date, sales - 2014-01-01: $2.00 - 2014-02-02: $ 4.00 - 2014-02-03: $8.00 - 2014-02-04: $ 16.00 What would be the 2 day trailing average on the following days: 2014-01-01 — How would this be treated because we only have one day's value at this time? Is this considered a NULL value or is the average still computed? 2014-01-03 — Is the two-day trailing average based on the dates 2014-01-03 (today) and 2014-01-02 (yesterday), or is it 2014-01-02 (yesterday) and 2014-01-01 (two days ago)? Basically, how is the trailing average usually defined?
