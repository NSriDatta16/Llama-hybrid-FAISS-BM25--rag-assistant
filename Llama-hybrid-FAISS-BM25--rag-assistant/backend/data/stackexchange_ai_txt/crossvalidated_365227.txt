The only model with a lower AIC than my null model has no control variables

When you choose a final model to predict sth with a logistic regression. Can you just choose a model without any control variables, if that is the only way to make your AIC smaller than that of the null model? I always read that you should keep controls, but what if some of the controls are there, mostly because I don't know if they have an impact. In the concept, they should somehow, yes. But the sample is so small, that it is no wonder it is not showing. There are only two independent variables that make the AIC smaller, both behave very much the same no matter which combination of variables I try. If I add a control or any other variable, the AIC gets bigger than the null model. When you want to predict sth. in that way, how do you choose the final model? What I can't comprehend is, that there doesn't seem to be any clear rule like: When a, then do b. When c, then do d. At least none that is applicable to the situation and can't be questioned by the person who evaluates it. It's like a dead end.
