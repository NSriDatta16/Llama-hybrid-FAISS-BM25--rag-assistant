Short answer: Speed, optimal data storage, Index, Search ability. Your database can better make use of the internal works when everything has the correct datatype. You can also make better use of the special database function. If you want to retrieve all data from a certain month. You can use special database functions to just group by a month when using a date time datatype for instance. When using a varchar to store a date, you lose all of that functionality. Most databases are able to search or retrieve data faster from a table when the index has been created on a INT datatype. So if you had created that storage field as a varchar you would have lost performance
