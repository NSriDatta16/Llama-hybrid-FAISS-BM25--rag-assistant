Smarx explained the best practice to me on the Azure forum. Here is what he wrote: There are two secure ways to access storage from the client: 1.Use Shared Access Signatures with blobs. Server-side, you can generate the signature (basically a signed URL), and that signature is limited in scope (maybe to a particular blob, particular permissions, and a limited amount of time). 2.Only access a web service from the client, and have the web service access storage. In both cases, there's a server in between, much like in a web app. (The browser never talks to your SQL database... it talks to your website, which then talks to the database.)
