I would recommend using a bytecode tool such as asm to "visit" the code, and have your visitor override visitMethodInsn . Then use reflection on the owner class looking for a method with the indicated name and signature. You'll also need to look at the opcode of the invocation instruction - it will be one of invokevirtual, invokeinterface, invokespecial and invokestatic. Note to pay attention to the distinction between invokevirtual and invokeinterface; a call to invokevirtual will not successfully invoke an interface method, and a call to invokeinterface will not successfully invoke a method which is not defined on an interface.
