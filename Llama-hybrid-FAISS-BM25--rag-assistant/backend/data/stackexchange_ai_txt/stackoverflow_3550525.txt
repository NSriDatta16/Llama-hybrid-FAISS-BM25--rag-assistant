Learning AI by practice ( Perceptrons, Neural networks and Bayesian AI)

I'm about to take a course in AI and I want to practice before. I'm using a book to learn the theory, but resources and concrete examples in any language to help with the practice would be amazing. Can anyone recommend me good sites or books with plenty of examples and tutorials ? Thanks ! Edit: My course will deal with Perceptrons, Neural networks and Bayesian AI.
