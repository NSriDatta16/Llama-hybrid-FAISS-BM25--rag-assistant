training neural network

I was given the task as follows, Scrape articles appearing in Times of India since 2010 on HIV and AIDS. Classify them using training a neural network of your choice. Find patterns in those articles, analyze the data. I have done the scraping part, But I have no clue what to do now with the data I have extracted. I searched for hours on internet but could not find any help. I know theory part about the neural network but lack knowledge for implementing it on a text. It would be of great help if someone can suggest me any method or provide me some helpful link.
