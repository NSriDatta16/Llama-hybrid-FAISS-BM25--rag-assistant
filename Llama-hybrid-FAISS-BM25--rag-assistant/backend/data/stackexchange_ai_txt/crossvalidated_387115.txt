How can we generate stationary and non-stationary time series data in python?

I need custom simulated stationary and non-stationary(trending) time series data for one of my python projects. I searched all the web for it but didn't find anything for python. Then I came across this post Is a model with a sine wave time-series stationary? where a stationary series is explained as yt=yt−1+ϵ where μ(ϵ)=0 in the comment section. I coded a sample code for generating stationary series import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np n=100 x=np.arange(n) y_=np.random.uniform(-1,1,[n]) mu=0 sigma=0.01 e= np.random.normal(mu, sigma, n) #stationary series y=y_+e plt.plot(x,y) plt.show() the output looks like a stationary time series but I am not sure of it. But the most difficult part is finding a way to generate non-stationary(ie. trending) time series data. I can't find anything releated to it. How can we generate stationary and non-stationary time series data in python?
