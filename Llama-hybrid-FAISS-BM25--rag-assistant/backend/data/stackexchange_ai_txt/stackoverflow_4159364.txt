Flash can't directly access a user's computer as they're in different security sandboxes. If you're using Adobe Air there is support for some file-io stuff, but I'm not sure how that works. The workaround for allowing people to save their images is to send the image data to a server script (PHP, Perl, Python, whatever...) and have the script present an image to the user. If you use the header application/octet-stream, most user agents will ask the user if they'd like to save the file (there are other work arounds as well). Pixlr is a good example of that sort of interaction.
