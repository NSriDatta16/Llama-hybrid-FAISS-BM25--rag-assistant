Dummy vars and WLS (with exchangeable correlation structures) are both methods that can handle additive effects of cluster based samples. The dummy variable approach is the most appropriate method. The only reason to discourage its use is when the number of clusters is high relative to the sample size. Weighted least squares specifies a dependence structure and then iteratively estimates the model effects and covariance structure until an optimal result is found. Unlike the above example, this one gives consistent estimates even when there is a relatively large number of clusters. The approach is very similar to fitting a mixed effects model with random intercepts. You can find great a reference in Longitudinal Data Analysis by Diggle Heagerty Liang and Zeger.
