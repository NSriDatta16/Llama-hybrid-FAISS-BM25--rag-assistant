What is the best approach to get from relational OLTP database to OLAP cube?

I have a fairly standard OLTP normalised database and I have realised that I need to do some complex queries, averages, standard deviations across different dimensions in the data. So I have turned to SSAS and the creation of OLAP cubes. However to create the cubes I believe my data source structure needs to be in a 'star' or 'snowflake' configuration (which I don't think it is right now). Is the normal procedure to use SSIS to do some sort of ETL process on my primary OLTP DB into another relational DB that is in the proper 'star' configuration with facts and dimensions, and then use this DB as the datasource for the OLAP cubes? Thanks
