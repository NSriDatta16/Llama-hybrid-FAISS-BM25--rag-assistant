Is there a tool to generate a sample application configuration by analyzing a ConfigurationSection type and its attributes?

I am working on an application that has a large set of configuration values, modelled and organized through the .NET configuration types from the System.Configuration namespace (i.e. ConfigurationSection , ConfigurationProperty , ConfigurationElement , etc...). Several values are required and may or may not have defaults, while others are optional and have defaults. I am curious if a tool or application exists that can reflect over the types that implement a configuration section and generate a sample XML, XML Schema, or other document describing the configuration. Such a tool would be great for people that manage the application in production, and don't need to navigate several classes in a repository to determine which configuration values are allowed.
