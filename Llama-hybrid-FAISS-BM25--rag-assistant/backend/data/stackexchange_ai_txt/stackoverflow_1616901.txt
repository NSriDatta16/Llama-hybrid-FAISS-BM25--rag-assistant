OG is definitely the place to start. If it doesn't work, you might also try the Domain Access module. It is geared around creating multiple Drupal sites on top of a single Drupal instance. It is more extreme separation than Organic Groups, but it is a smaller user base than OG, which might mean slower bugfixes/etc. Multisite with a shared user table is a maintenance complexity you probably don't need.
