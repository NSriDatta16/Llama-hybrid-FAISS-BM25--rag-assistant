Camera intent/Activity - avoid saving to gallery

I am using the Camera Activity to capture the picture. I call it with the MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT extra parameter. The image is correctly saved to provided path, put it is saved also to the gallery folder, so I can view the image in "Gallery" application - can I avoid this? ... File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "Test.jpg" ); iImageOutputUri = Uri.fromFile( file ); // Start camera intent to capture image Intent intent = new Intent( MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE ); intent.putExtra( MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, iImageOutputUri ); startActivityForResult( intent, CAPTURE_IMAGE ); ... Thanks
