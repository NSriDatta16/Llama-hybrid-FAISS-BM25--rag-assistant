Why all "nBSV"s are zero in LIBSVM classification outputs?

I'm training a classification SVM for a binary classification model with 20 features (LIBSVM). These are some reports of my model (with different combination of features). Why all nBSV s are zero? Otherwise, based on *.* and .* outputs, the SVM trains real fast. Is this a problem? .* optimization finished, #iter = 1194 nu = 0.007242 obj = -296.242686, rho = -0.026875 nSV = 617, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 617 *.* optimization finished, #iter = 924 nu = 0.007236 obj = -296.473015, rho = 0.002460 nSV = 618, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 618 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1204 nu = 0.007288 obj = -298.117823, rho = -0.021878 nSV = 618, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 618 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1169 nu = 0.007248 obj = -296.465051, rho = -0.012346 nSV = 618, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 618 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1449 nu = 0.007177 obj = -367.201873, rho = -0.015914 nSV = 772, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 772 .*.* optimization finished, #iter = 1355 nu = 0.008642 obj = -300.306592, rho = -0.028429 nSV = 617, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 617 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1196 nu = 0.008608 obj = -298.631753, rho = -0.017603 nSV = 616, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 616 *.* optimization finished, #iter = 774 nu = 0.008684 obj = -301.772061, rho = 0.000564 nSV = 618, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 618 .*.* optimization finished, #iter = 1313 nu = 0.008646 obj = -299.953007, rho = -0.026729 nSV = 617, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 617 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1107 nu = 0.008649 obj = -300.051120, rho = -0.007149 nSV = 617, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 617 .* optimization finished, #iter = 1482 nu = 0.008603 obj = -373.305016, rho = -0.013622 nSV = 771, nBSV = 0 Total nSV = 771 From LIBSVM documentation: obj is the optimal objective value of the dual SVM problem. rho is the bias term in the decision function sgn(w^Tx - rho). nSV and nBSV are number of support vectors and bounded support vectors (i.e., alpha_i = C). nu-svm is a somewhat equivalent form of C-SVM where C is replaced by nu. nu simply shows the corresponding parameter.
