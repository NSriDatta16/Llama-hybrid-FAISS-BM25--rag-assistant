Fourier Transform - This can be used to efficiently can compute the cross-correlation , which will tell you how to align the two images and how similar they are, when they are optimally aligned. Sift descriptors - These can be used to compare local features. They are often used for correspondence analysis and object recognition. (See also SURF ) Histograms - The normalized cross-correlation often yields good results for comparing images on a global level. But since you are just comparing color distributions you could end up declaring an outdoor scene with lots of snow as similar to an indoor scene with lots of white wallpaper... Pixel grabbing - No idea what this is... You can get a good overview from this paper . Another field you might to look into is content based image retrieval (CBIR) . Sorry for not being Java specific. HTH.
