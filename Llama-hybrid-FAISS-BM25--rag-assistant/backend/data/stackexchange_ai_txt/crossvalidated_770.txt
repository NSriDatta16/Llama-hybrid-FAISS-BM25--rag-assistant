Is it possible to use machine learning as a method for learning stats, rather than vice-versa?

During every machine learning tutorial you'll find, there is the common "You will need to know x amount of stats before starting this tutorial". As such, using your knowledge of stats, you will learn about machine learning. My question is whether this can be reversed. Can a computer science student learn statistics through studying machine learning algorithms? Has this been tested, at all? Are there examples where this is the case already?
