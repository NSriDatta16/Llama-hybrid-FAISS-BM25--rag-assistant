Understanding a simple post-hoc power analysis of effect size

I am trying to understand a relatively straightforward paragraph found in " Gun Shows and Gun Violence: Fatally Flawed Study Yields Misleading Results " by Wintermute et al that appeared in the American Journal of Public Health . The paragraph is as follows: This means the study is attempting to identify a 1.5% increase in homicides (5% × 30%). Let us also assume that the control group size is 900 000 (the maximum control group size for California), and the size of the intervention group (gun show counties) is 20 000. Using findings from Duggan et al. of a mean gun homicide rate per county of 0.035 deaths per 100 000 persons per week with a standard deviation of 0.203, then for a 2-sample test, 1-tailed, with an α of 5%, the power is 10%. However, I am completely stymied as to how to reverse-engineer the result of "...the power is 10%". I am not at all challenging the findings of Wintermute et al. (I agree with the study). I am interested in seeing how the authors carried out this post-hoc power calculation to evaluate the effect size. Key aspects of problem: Control group N: 900,000 Intervention group N: 20,000 $\mu_1$ : 0.035 $\sigma_1$ : 0.203 $\alpha$ error rate: 0.05 2-sample test, 1-tailed direction Could anyone provide direction from here as to next steps?
