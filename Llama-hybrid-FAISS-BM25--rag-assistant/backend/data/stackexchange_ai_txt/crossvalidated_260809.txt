They are strongly related to each other. For $n \rightarrow \infty,\ p \rightarrow 0$ such that $np \rightarrow \lambda\ $we have $$P_{Bin(n,p)}(k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \eqsim \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}\exp^{-\lambda} = P_{Poiss(\lambda)}(k)$$ So Poisson distribution is a limiting binomial distribution with $\lambda$ being the average rate (that is $np$) of certain event occuring
