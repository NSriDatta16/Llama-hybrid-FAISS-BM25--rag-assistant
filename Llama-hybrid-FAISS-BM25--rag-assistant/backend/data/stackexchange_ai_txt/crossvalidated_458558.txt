Model can be reparametrized in such a way that two new likelihood equations emerge, each with just one unknown parameter. This will facilitate solving the likelihood equations and also help the general interpretation and use of regression models. (7.2.2 in [hendry2007econometric]) Suppose you want to reparametrize the following model: (note that $X_{3}$ can be any transformation of some previous regressor) $$ Y \sim X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} $$ $X_{1}$ , $X_{2}$ and $X_{3}$ can be orthogonalized at the same time. In the book, the operation is based on a constant vector. $$ \begin{aligned} Z_{1} &= \mathrm{residuals}\left(X_{1} \sim 1 \right) \\ Z_{2} &= \mathrm{residuals}\left(X_{2} \sim 1 + X_{1} \right) \\ Z_{3} &= \mathrm{residuals}\left(X_{3} \sim 1 + X_{1} + X_{2}\right) \end{aligned} $$ Following the example by @Elvis: library(magrittr) ## generating random x1 x2 x3 in (0,1) (10 values each) x1 % summary() ## orthogonalize regressors on a unit vector lm(x1 ~ 1) $residuals -> z1 lm(x2 ~ 1 + x1)$ residuals -> z2 lm(x3 ~ 1 + x1 + x2)$residuals -> z3 lm(y ~ z1 + z2 + z3) %>% summary() You will have: Call: lm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -2.1528 0.7973 -2.700 0.03558 * x1 2.1005 0.9730 2.159 0.07421 . x2 0.7895 0.9364 0.843 0.43149 x3 6.8008 1.0055 6.764 0.00051 *** Residual standard error: 0.7628 on 6 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9293, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8939 F-statistic: 26.27 on 3 and 6 DF, p-value: 0.0007538 Call: lm(formula = y ~ z1 + z2 + z3) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.18106 0.24121 13.188 1.17e-05 *** z1 -0.05549 0.72386 -0.077 0.94139 z2 4.41463 0.76784 5.749 0.00121 ** z3 6.80079 1.00551 6.764 0.00051 *** Residual standard error: 0.7628 on 6 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9293, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8939 F-statistic: 26.27 on 3 and 6 DF, p-value: 0.0007538 So the intercept in the second model can be interpreted as the expected value for an individual with average values of x1 , x2 and x3 , and its standard error is reduced by 78.21%. Most of the time, you are very interested in this value. Also, maximum likelihood estimators become much easier to handle. (5.2.3 in [hendry2007econometric]) Referece hendry2007econometric Hendry, D.
