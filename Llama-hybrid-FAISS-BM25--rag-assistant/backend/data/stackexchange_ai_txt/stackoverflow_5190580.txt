I found the reason for that FileNotFoundException , its because instead of the following line: create_file = new FileOutputStream(new File("filename.txt", false)); we have to specify the path for that file, for me, I have stored it in internal storage and I gave the path "/data/data/ /files/" + "filename.txt" and I've changed the overwrite coding like this, FileOutputStream overWrite = new FileOutputStream("/data/data/ now all are working well.
