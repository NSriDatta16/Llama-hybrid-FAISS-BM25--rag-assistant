python dealing with Nonetype before cast\addition

I'm pulling a row from a db and adding up the fields (approx 15) to get a total. But some field values will be Null, which causes an error in the addition of the fields ( TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int' ) Right now, with each field, I get the field value and set it to 'x#', then check if it is None and if so set 'x#' to 0. Not very elegant...any advice on a better way to deal with this in python? cc
