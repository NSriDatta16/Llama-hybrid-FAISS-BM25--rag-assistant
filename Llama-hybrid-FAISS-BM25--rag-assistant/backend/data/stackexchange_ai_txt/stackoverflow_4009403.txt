Yes, this is quite straightforward to do. Inside the snmp-agent.sar directory, you'll see a file called attributes.xml . This file associates SNMP OIDs with JMX attributes. So for each item in your MIB, you need to expose that information via a JMX MBean, and then add the OID->JMX association to attributes.xml . The agent itself neither knows nor cares about your MIB, so you need to be careful to specify the OIDs in attributes.xml properly.
