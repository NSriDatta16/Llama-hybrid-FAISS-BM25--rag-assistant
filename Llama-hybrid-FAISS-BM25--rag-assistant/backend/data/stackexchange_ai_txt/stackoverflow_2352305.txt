link back to full page from a mobile version

I would like to forward iphone users to a mobile version of my site with apache's RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (...) My question is, how would I redirect visitors of the mobile site back to the full site? Since they're on a mobile device, they'd just get re-routed to the mobile site again right? Cheers, Phil
