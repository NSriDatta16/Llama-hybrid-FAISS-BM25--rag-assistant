For padding in CNN's there is a useful answer in this link: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/246512/convolutional-layers-to-pad-or-not-to-pad In Q-learning an action is taken in current state, and a next state is obtained. Then state-action value of the current state-action pair is updated by using best state-action value of obtained next state. If you have discrete state-action space, or a few states you can simply record each state-action pair in a table, and then update it by Q-learning, but if the space is continuous, or there are so many state-action pairs then you should use function approximation methods like neural networks. For example by extracting current state's visual features by CNN, and then updating weights to better approximate value of this perceived state, and taken action pair.
