What are some useful data visualisation or data mining techniques to investigate horse racing forms?

I have a dataset of 13k horse races from four different tracks with an average of 11 runners per race. In all, there are 26k unique runners in the data. For each race, I know who came first, second, third, etc. A horse's form is a record of significant events, including its performance in previous races. To be specific, let's say form means a string of six digits ABCDEF, where A = finishing position six races ago or 0 if finished outside top 9, B = finishing position five races ago or 0 if finished outside top 9, etc. And let's say a horse's form at track X means only races at that track are considered when compiling its string of six digits. There are reasons to believe a horse's form may not transfer well between tracks because of differences in surface type and other characteristics. What are some useful data visualisation or data mining techniques to investigate such a hypothesis?
