List of keywords as features

I'm new to machine learning, being this the first time I'm involved in a project in the area. I have a dataset of news articles and have extracted the keywords present on the news title such as ['china factory activity shrinks', 'first time', '2 years'] . Note, the list size varies. I would like to use this data in my features, but I don't know how and what is the best way to extract features based on a list of keywords. Since the keywords cannot be converted to a categorical value, I think I can't use OneHotEnconder, but I'm not 100% certain. Is bag-of-words or TF-IDF viable possiblity? How can I encode this keywods to numerical values maintaining some meaningful information to the model?
