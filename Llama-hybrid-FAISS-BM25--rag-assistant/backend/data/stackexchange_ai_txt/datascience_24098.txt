Do some feature engineering. As they told you in the comments, try to see if the event is more likely to happen during weekends or weekdays, during certain months, during a certain season or quarter, etc. To read some more on this topic. https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/ Explore different machine learning models. I suggest to start with a Random Forest. Check your model accuracy (confusion matrix). Iterate. Try other features, other models... Just to get you up and running, you can take a look at the Titanic dataset in Kaggle. It will help you understand a bit more of the problem you are trying to solve.
