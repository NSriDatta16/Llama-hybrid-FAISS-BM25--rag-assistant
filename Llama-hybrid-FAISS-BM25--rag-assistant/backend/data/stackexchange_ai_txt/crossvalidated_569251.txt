Is my way of deriving a statistical test from Hoeffding's inequality correct?

I'm trying to deduce from samples of observations from two finite sets of random variables $X_{1}, ..., X_{n}$ and $Y_{1}, ..., Y_{m}$ that the expected values of the average of those random variables are not the same. Let's denote $\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{X_{i}}$ and $\frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}{Y_{i}}$ , $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ respectively. So I'm trying to deduce from observations $x_{1}, ..., x_{n}$ and $y_{1}, ..., y_{m}$ that $E[\bar{X}] \neq E[\bar{Y}]$ . So my null hypothesis, $H_{0}$ , would be $E[\bar{X}] = E[\bar{Y}]$ and the alternative one, $H_{1}$ , would be $E[\bar{X}] \neq E[\bar{Y}]$ . I thought of using Hoeffding's inequality this way: If my random variables are all bounded and between $0$ and $1$ (which I have in practice), we then have: $P(|\bar{X}-\bar{Y}-(E[\bar{X}]-E[\bar{Y}])|\geq \varepsilon) \leq e^{-\frac{2\varepsilon^{2}}{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}}}$ Under the null hypothesis we have then : $P(|\bar{X}-\bar{Y})|\geq \varepsilon) \leq 2e^{-\frac{2\varepsilon^{2}}{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}}}$ , we can fix the type $I$ error rate to a maximum of $\delta$ if we take $\varepsilon_{\delta} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m})}ln(\frac{2}{\delta})}$ . Now, suppose we get observations such as $|\bar{X}-\bar{Y}| , there's a probability of $P(|\bar{X}-\bar{Y}| under $H_{0}$ , so our type $II$ error is at most $1 - \delta$ . I hope you can help me understand if what I'm doing is correct or not. Thank you in advance.
