Is the bias of a coin a latent variable or a parameter?

Consider the standard Bayesian estimation problem in which the bias $p$ of a coin is picked uniformly at random from $[0, 1]$, the coin is tossed a few times, and $p$ is then estimated from the outcomes. In such a case, is $p$ a parameter or a latent variable? It is "fixed", in the sense that it is a single number and doesn't change throughout the problem, but I can also see it as a random variable since it has a prior uniform probability distribution, so I don't know what to call it...
