I got help for my program for the following code. I is working, thank you to 'paxdiablo'. It is still showing the '\' character in the result. How can I fix it? (not sure how to reply 'paxdiablo' to sya thanks. if (strchr (",.();:-\"&?%$![]^@~`{}_<>/#*_+=", curChar) != NULL)//new change { paragraph.erase(subscript, 1); numWords-=1; } else subscript+=1; }
