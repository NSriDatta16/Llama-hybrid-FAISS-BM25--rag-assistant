Perhaps I don't fully understand the complexity of your research questions, but if you are interested in The effects of cueing and The effect of training then the specicification is simply: fm1 This will give you a scalar value for the average effect of training , and a scalar value for each dummy variable created by cueing . If you want know if training helps more for some cues than for other cues, then an interaction of the fixed terms can be included in the model fm2 This model gives The effects of cueing with and without training. The effects of training for each cue. The specification you originally presented fm3 is perfectly valid, but it is perhaps overly complicated, since it estimates an individual (random) effect of each combination of cueing and training. Use the loglikelihood ratio test with anova(fm2, fm3) to find out if that is really warranted, or if the simpler model is to be prefered. Your question: "Therefore, I wonder whether I would have to nest the items within each participant with (1 + time*cueing | item:participant) " is an empirical question - it can only be answered after seeing the data. In your case the random effects are only nuisance terms, they are only included in order to enhance the estimation of the fixed effects (and the standard errors of the fixed effects), the random effects are not interesting per se . Therefore, just use the level of complexity on modelling the random terms which is necessary, and use anova() to rule out that a simpler modelling is sufficient. Only if anova(fm1, fm2) yields a signficant result (ie that fm2 is significantly better than fm1), go ahead and try even more complex random terms.
