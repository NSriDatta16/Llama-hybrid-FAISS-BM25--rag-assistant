Find average sequence from a set of sequences

I have a set of user sessions. Session consists of an ordered list of types of actions that user made (for example, bought a gun, played a mission, etc). I want to create/calculate session that have most possible similarity to all provided sessions (most common types of actions users make in order they make them) Unfortunately, I know nothing about data science but I tried to google a way to do that. I've found this document: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TraMineR/vignettes/TraMineR-state-sequence.pdf And it looks like 9.1 and 9.2 describe things similar to what I want. But I dont know this for certain and even if it's true I stil don't know how to use it for my scenario.
