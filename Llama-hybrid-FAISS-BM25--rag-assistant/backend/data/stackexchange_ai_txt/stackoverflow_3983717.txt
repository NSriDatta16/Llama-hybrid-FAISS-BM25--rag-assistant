Read files in Windows Phone 7

I'm trying to open a file in Windows Phone 7, but it says it doesn't exist. Here's the code I'm trying: IsolatedStorageFile file = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); bool test = file.FileExists("\\ClientBin\\clubs.xml"); And in my project I added a folder called ClientBin, and the clubs.xml is in there. The clubs.xml file properties are: Build action: Content Copy to Output Directory: Copy always I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. You can see what I have in this screenshot . Thanks!
