Take a look at this extension method found here . /// /// Swaps the rows and columns of a nested sequence. /// /// The type of elements in the sequence. /// The source sequence. /// A sequence whose rows and columns are swapped. public static IEnumerable > Transpose ( this IEnumerable > source) { return from row in source from col in row.Select( (x, i) => new KeyValuePair (i, x)) group col.Value by col.Key into c select c as IEnumerable ; } I'm not sure about performance but the code looks elegant.
