Is it possible to avoid compilation and testing before cobertura? Or maybe there is some other workaround? There are several issues about this (see MCOBERTURA-83 , MCOBERTURA-76 ) but AFAIK, there is no perfect workaround (due to the way the life cycle is constructed - things might be improved in Maven 3). The only one I'm aware of (works with CI servers) would be to run: mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true and then mvn cobertura:check Instead of binding cobertura:check on the build lifecycle. Note that compiling twice shouldn't be an issue as all classes should be up to date.
