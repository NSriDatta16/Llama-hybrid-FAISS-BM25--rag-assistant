Well, first off what are you trying to accomplish? Are you sure fragments are the solution? Fragments are simply additions to an existing plugin. There is no Bundle-Activator to "startup" the fragment. You just gain the additional resources in the fragment. You could use an extension point to inform the host that some particular functionality was extended by a present fragment. Think of it as merging the two at runtime. See this note from the Eclipse Wiki .
