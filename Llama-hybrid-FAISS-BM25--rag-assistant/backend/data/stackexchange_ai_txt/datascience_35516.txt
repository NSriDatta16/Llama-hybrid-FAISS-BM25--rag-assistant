Do Data Scientists prefer MACS?

I see many Data Science (DS) tutorials done on MACS, and many DS blogs recommend MACS as the best developing platform, thus the quote "Data Science is statistics on a Mac" came more than once into my mind. I'm quite fascinated by MACS (be it iMAC or MacbookPro) but I never could get a valid reason to why Data Scientists in particular use them (if that is true, of course) All who I asked said: "because it has Unix", but I hardly manage to accept it as a valid reason (at least for me). The hardware is very weak for Machine Learning processes, and the OS is inefficient and cumbersome (no file path, no drag and drop photos and music files, windows don't fully open by default nor close, etc) The only benefit I found so far in MACoS (or Linux for this matter), is that when running parallel processes, the RAM is being shared, unlike on windows, but quoting one of my lecturers: "you need to be mad to switch OS for that reason only" Would be grateful if you could enlighten me on the subject.
