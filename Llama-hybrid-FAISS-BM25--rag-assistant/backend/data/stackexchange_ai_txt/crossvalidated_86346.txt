Clustered data WITHOUT multilevel / GEE model?

I have a data-set with around 700 observations from 12 centres. Although the clustering effect as tested in a random intercept model didn't seem significant, it seems more appropriate to use a multilevel / GEE model. But it may not be easy to do so as I want to test for multiple potential mediators. (to be specific, the model in my mind is a SEM without latent variables). So my question is: is it theoretically advisable to fit the data in a single-level path model using ML (Huber sandwich estimator, or bootstrap SE)? UPDATE: Thanks for those helping out. Just a update for what I did yesterday. I tried the following models: Single-level SEM in R (lavaan package) Single-level SEM in MPlus Two-level SEM in Mplus (1) and (2) were fitted with ML (Huber / Bootstrap SE). (3) was fitted with Bayesian estimator as MLR did not converge. Basically all of the above gave me similar results but (1) and (2) gave me the chance to do multi-group analysis on top of the SEM and (3) seems to be more theoretically correct. I am not quite sure if the results from (1) and (2) can be trusted. A quick literature search told me that Huber SE will give a correct SE even if the model is specified, but the parameters estimated may be biased. Under this situation, will (1) and (2) provide biased parameter estimates?
