I personally would report it to the company giving them some reasonable time period to correct it. But also offer them the option of requesting a deadline extension if they feel it will take longer. After that deadline, disclose the vulnerability. I might consider reporting it to a governmental security organization. My main concern would be whether I need to report anonymously, given that you might be breaking some law by disclosing a vulnerability publicly. It depends on your country.
