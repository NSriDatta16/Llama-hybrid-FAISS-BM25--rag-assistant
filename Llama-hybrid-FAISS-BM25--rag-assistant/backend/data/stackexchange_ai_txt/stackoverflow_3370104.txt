Change price of product on store's website (Magento)

Is there a way(by codehack if neccesary) to change the price of a product per store website, so from display in search results and individual product view all the way to checkout and order information I need this for a multishop website where some shops can offer a product at lower price depending on how much they paid and there's an extra percentage added depending on various options. I've been looking around in app/code/core/catalog but can't seem to find it? Also, I want to add some custom code to selection of wich products are displayed in a store(again according to some own data), these 2 are majorly important. Is it possible?
