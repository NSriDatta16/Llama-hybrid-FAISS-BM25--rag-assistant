I don't disagree with Noah's answer. I have never heard of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees or with targeted minimum-loss estimation, so I can't comment on those specifically. Methods involving weighting and propensity scores are well-accepted in epidemiological circles. You should also consider instrumental variable and regression discontinuity approaches. In the former, there are sometimes cases where you have a variable that influences the probability of receiving treatment but not the outcome. For example, McClellan et al (1994) noted that some hospitals treated acute myocardial infarction (the fancy term for heart attack) more intensively than others (i.e. they were more prone to use cardiac catheterization and revascularization, as opposed to what I guess is medical management). They used the differential distance as their instrument: for each patient, what was the distance to the nearest high-catheterization hospital minus the distance to the nearest low-catheterization hospital? IVs are not without untestable assumptions - just like all observational methods, really. Also, they answer a subtly different question than a randomized trial would. Quoting McClellan et al Thus, IV methods are ideally suited to address the question, "What would be the effect of reducing the use of invasive procedures after AMI in the elderly by, for example, one fourth?" They do not address the question, "What would be the expected effect of treating a particular patient aggressively rather than with noninvasive therapies alone?" For clinical decisions involving treatment of individual patients, the answer to the latter question is more useful. For policy decisions affecting the treatment of patient populations, the answer to the former is likely to be more useful. Alternatively, sometimes you have cases where treatment is given to people at or above a cutoff point on some sort of score, and withheld from everyone below the cutoff. You can exploit that in a regression discontinuity design. You'd compare people just above the cutoff to people just below it. The inherent assumption is that because all scores are measured with error, the people just above the cutoff and the people just below it are pretty similar. This does also require that the participants did not game the score - which is an assumption that you should really think about. In some ways, being above versus below the score is an instrument. The issue is that it may be difficult to find an instrument, and that the treatments you're interested in may be not be assigned according to some score.
