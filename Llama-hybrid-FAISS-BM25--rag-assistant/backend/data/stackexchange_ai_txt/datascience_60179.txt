How to create an image with pixel values of another image?

I have the following situation: I have an image file with each pixel having a specific value. Now I want to rearrange and distribute these pixel values so that the result image looks similar to a set of other images that share a similar pixel value distribution. I wanted to know how I should tackle this challenge. I know basics in machine learning and would "just" use the training images as a csv file and create a model from it to apply to my other image. Any tips you could provide me?
