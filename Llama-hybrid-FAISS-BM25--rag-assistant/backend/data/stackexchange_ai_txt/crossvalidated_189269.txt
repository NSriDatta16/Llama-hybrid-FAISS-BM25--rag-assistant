First things first - this is not a feature selection problem. Not yet, anyway. It is the definition of a prediction problem. So let me get you started with that -- You have a bunch of advertisers, to whom you want to sell ads. You know their features. You also have a bunch of advertisers you've pitched to in the past - some were convinced, others weren't. Now, you want to predict, given your past sales records, which advertisers are most likely to buy ads from you. Right? The way to do this is to build a model, that relates features, to outcomes. In this case, with a binary outcome, you could use logistic regression. Once you've fit that model (using ALL your data, or else you'll think everybody will always buy from you), you put the new advertiser's features into that model, to predict how likely they are to buy, also - or, more accurately, how much they resemble the advertisers who bought from you in the past. Maybe once you've done this you'll find that some of your features don't help the prediction, or there are too many, in which case you can remove them from the model. But until you've built the model (which is more work than it sounds, done right), there's no reason to throw away any of your features - you haven't used them yet! I'm sure you'll have more questions once you get started, but the first thing for you to do is to start reading about prediction - that's what you're trying to do here.
