What characteristics should the input data have for a neural network?

I am planning to use a neural network for prediction. For example, to predict whether a student will pass a course based on his previous academic records or characteristics. I was wondering how to choose meaningful data as input for my neural network, as opposed to irrelevant data. I remember reading that it's better if the input data is not strongly correlated. Is that true?
