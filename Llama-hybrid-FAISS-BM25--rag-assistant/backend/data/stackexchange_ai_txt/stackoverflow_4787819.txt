Here's a few concrete things to pay attention to: avoid the use of dialogs. They interrupt "flow" pay attention to tab order (ie: make sure user can use tab to navigate between items) be consistent with the platform (windows-like buttons on windows, mac-like buttons on mac, use standard shortcuts) use standard fonts, colors and icons. Don't think you know more than your user what looks good. tailor the interface so that the most common actions are the easiest to do do things that give your user confidence (like automatically saving backups or having proper undo, so they don't feel like they can accidentally lose data) make sure all windows have proper resize behavior. Give the user the ability to make input areas bigger and/or make sure they work with big fonts. And finally, create prototypes (paper works fine) and ask your actual users.
