Pattern for Spring-MVC stateful interaction

Today I was doing this thing with Spring: Have a page with a form and a chance to choose one item related to the form. If you push "Choose item" the app will save somehow what you typed in the form, go to another page, let you choose the thing. When you are back to the form it's filled with what you wrote before going to the other page, plus the item chosen. Seems easy, but you have to take into account that for some stupid reason the user could open the page where you choose the item (maybe because of a bookmark, or because he pressed the back button 10 times to play). You know what I mean. I tried many ways, mainly based on HttpSession... I don't like any of those. None of them seems elegant. I was even thinking of using a hidden form in the other page, but given that it is not unique to this "flow" (I mean you can go to the item choose page from others as well), I will have to worry about conflicts and so on. So what would be the preferred way for you? Suggestions?
