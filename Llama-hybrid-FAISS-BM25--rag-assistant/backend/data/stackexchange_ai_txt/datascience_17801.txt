One way could be applying a good segmentation technique and then classifying all the regions with some algorithms like(ann,svm,knn...), this method doesn't need a lot of training sample at all. Another way is applying deep learning (but this would mean a lot of training samples) you could use a CNN which perform a regression and so as output it gives you the text(this would mean you have to set a max sentences length). But to avoid a max sentences' length you could use a CNN with also some RNN layers and then you feed the network with parts of the image(a cascade approach).
