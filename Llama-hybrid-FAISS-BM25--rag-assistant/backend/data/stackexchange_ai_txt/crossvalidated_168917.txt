Summing multiple posterior distributions

I have obtained separate posterior distributions of regression coefficients of several variables, and would like to know what the most probable sum of these coefficients is. This is because the sum of the coefficients has a strong underlying hypothesis, though the individual coefficients do not. To do so, I have randomly drawn values from each variable's posterior distribution, and summed them. Is this appropriate? Unlike in a previous question these are different variables, but I'm unsure if similar problems apply. This question's answer says that products of posteriors are not even defined in a Bayesian context. Also, is the sum of random draws from these posterior distributions a 'posterior distribution'? Or is it a conditional distribution, because it depends on distributions that are themselves conditional on modelling assumptions and data?
