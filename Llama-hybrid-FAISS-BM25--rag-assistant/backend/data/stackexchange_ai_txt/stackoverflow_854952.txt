No, you didn't do anything wrong Yes. You should reorganize your CVS Repository before you import it via cvs2svn Reason for this symptom: You always need to check out a folder. If you update to a previous version, this folder may not exist(the folder was moved) then Subversion will delete its contents. Renaming in Subversion is always implemented as remove and add. So you have a thin connection between files, but it is merely for history of this file. If you want to see the new layout you need to checkout a folder which contains both: target and source folder. Than you will be able to "see" the move of this folder, however if you only have one of the folders in your checkout, the folder will just vanish and you need to checkout a different URL(either target or source). So It is easier to restructure your projects in CVS and then migrate. Disadvantage: You will not have any history of your restructuring and you are not able to build/compile previous versions (which were created in CVS).
