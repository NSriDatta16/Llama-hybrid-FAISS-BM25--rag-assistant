This discount must be shown in customer account,if they belong to that particular group, and when user want to use that particular discount, price of that item must be discounted according to that discount offer to them. I know how to create a customer group, but how can I give them desired discount and make it show at time of purchase. so that customer can use it. please suggest me any method or refer any document. Thanks!
