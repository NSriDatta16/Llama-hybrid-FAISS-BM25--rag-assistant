SQL server scalability question

We are trying to build an application which will have to store billions of records. 1 trillion+ a single record will contain text data and meta data about the text document. pl help me understand about the storage limitations. can a databse SQL or oracle support this much data or i have to look for some other filesystem based solution ? What are my options ? Since the central server has to handle incoming load from many clients, how will parallel insertions and search scale ? how to distribute data over multiple databases or tables ? I am little green to database specifics for such scaled environment. initally to fill the database the insert load will be high, later as the database grows, search load will increase and inserts will reduce. the total size of data will cross 1000 TB. thanks.
