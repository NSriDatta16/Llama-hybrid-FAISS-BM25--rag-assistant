I have already give a suggestion based on Stirling numbers of the second kind and Bayesian methods. For those who find Stirling numbers too large or Bayesian methods too difficult, a rougher method might be to use $$E[U|n,s] = n\left( 1- \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^s\right)$$ $$var[U|n,s] = n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^s + n^2 \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)\left(1-\frac{2}{n}\right)^s - n^2\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{2s} $$ and back-calculate using numerical methods. For example, taking GaBorgulya's example with $s=300$ and an observed $U = 265$, this might give us an estimate of $\hat{n} \approx 1180$ for the population. If that had been the population then it would have given us a variance for $U$ of about 25, and an arbitrary two standard deviations either side of 265 would be about 255 and 275 (as I said, this is a rough method). 255 would have given us a estimate for $n$ about 895, while 275 would have given about 1692. The example's 1000 is comfortably within this interval.
