The issue with a linked list is searching within it (whether for retrieval or insert). For a single-linked list, you have to start at the head and search sequentially to find the desired element. To avoid the need to scan the whole list, you need additional references to nodes within the list, in which case, it's no longer a simple linked list. A binary tree allows for more rapid searching and insertion by being inherently sorted and navigable. An alternative that I've used successfully in the past is a SkipList. This provides something akin to a linked list but with extra references to allow search performance comparable to a binary tree.
