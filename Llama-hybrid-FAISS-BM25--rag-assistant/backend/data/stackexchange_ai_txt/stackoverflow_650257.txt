Yes, this will work as expected since std::vector is mandated to use contiguous storage by the Standard. I would suggest passing in a pair of iterators if you are working with a range of objects. This is pretty much the standard idiom as employed by the STL. This will make your code a little safer as well since you have an explicit endpoint for iteration instead of relying on a count or something like that.
