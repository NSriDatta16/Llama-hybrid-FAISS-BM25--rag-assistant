A neural network is a statistical model, not a data structure. Data structures are meant to store and recall information. A statistical model is meant to record events and provide useful information regarding the event's statistical properties. Thus, a NN uses data structures but is itself not a data structure. This question is like asking if Mr. Coffee is a computer simply because it may contain one to accomplish its task. Mr. Coffee is not a computer, but yes you could tear it apart and find interesting ways to mangle the control electronics inside to do some computing.
