SPSS/Stata Repeated Measures - Contrast question

I have data from 8 subjects collected at 5 time points. I would like to see if there is a difference between time points (1 + 2) and (3 + 4 + 5) using either SPSS or Stata. When in SPSS I use 'Analyze > GLM > Repeated Measures' I am able to specify the 5 time points, but I can not create contrasts. I can only select the predefined contrasts. I guess I could just average time point (1 + 2) and (3 + 4 + 5) and compare the means in a paired-sample t-test. Q1) Are there any disadvantages with averaging the time points and using a paired t-test (e.g. loss of power?) Q2) How could I model these contrasts in SPSS or Stata?
