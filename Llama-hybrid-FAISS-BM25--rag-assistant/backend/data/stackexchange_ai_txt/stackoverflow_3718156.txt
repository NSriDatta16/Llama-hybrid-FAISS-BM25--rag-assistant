Is there HTML embeddable audio player which prevents downloading of the audio it plays?

I'm looking for an audio player (like jplayer) which can be embedded in a HTML page which will allow MP3's to be played but not downloaded. The problem: Flash players request the audio file from the server so the URL of the MP3 is present in the HTML source and can be copy/pasted in to the address bar to download the track. This will inherently be the problem with most players. Possible solution: The player accepts some "encrypted" (non-playable) format which is then decoded inside the player. Anything like this exist? I am not looking for solutions which sound like: Obfuscating the URL of the MP3 Preventing downloading of the MP3 from third party sites (eg. forums) using .htaccess Embedding the mp3 inside a flash movie unless this can be automated, since mp3's are uploaded on a regular basis. Having a URL which only works for a certain period of time
