XPath to produce a result node-set containing the same node more than once?

What I tried to say in the title is: Given a bit of XML in which I know a particular element appears only once, is it possible using a single XPath query to select a node-set that contains that element twice? I understand there's a "union" operator (|) but that's basically a logical-OR, right? In SQL terms I'm looking then for the equivalent of a "union all". E.g. Given the XML fragment... specific data specific data 2 ...is there a query that will get me a result set equivalent to... ...identical content... ...identical content... I haven't found anything that makes me think it can be done - but that's why I'm asking...
