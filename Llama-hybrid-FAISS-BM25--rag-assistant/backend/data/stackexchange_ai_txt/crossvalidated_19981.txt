Distribution of values in a time series (tidal data)

I was trying to help my colleague with fitting a distribution curve to some empiric data (these are sea water level observations at different time points). However, I haven't succeeded since it's my first experience in approximating an empiric distribution with a theoretical one. The mean value of $Y$ is 0.32688. $\sigma^2_Y$ is 0.076191. Here's a histogram: And an empirical cdf: There are 1024 samples in the data. Obviously the distribution is asymmetric. It doesn't look like $\chi^2$ since $\hat{\mu}_Y >> 2\hat{\sigma}_Y^2$ I tried approximating it with beta distribution (picked various $\alpha, \beta$ parameters) together with normalizing Y by some real number in $[0.5; 3]$. It didn't help, Pearson chi-squared statistic was always, you know, like 300, 700 or even more. I tried squaring Y and the histogram of $Y^2$ looks like this: I tried approximating this with exponential distribution (and normalizing Y with a real number) - but P-value was always like zero all the time. The data itself can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqeuZRXRoMfRdF9UQzFEZVdOTmh0ZzNSaFRhRndHWmc Does anyone have any ideas on what distribution this data could have?
