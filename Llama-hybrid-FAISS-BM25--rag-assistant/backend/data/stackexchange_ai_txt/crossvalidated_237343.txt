Is there a way to reconstitute the unit of measurement in PCA?

I have a data set composed of changes in financial asset prices. Because they are on different levels, e.g., one asset is trading in the 100s, the other in the 5s, the change their prices have vastly different levels. I scaled the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each time-series. The result is running PCA using correlation matrix. Is there a way to recoup the original measurement (i.e., $change) from the PCA on correlation matrix?
