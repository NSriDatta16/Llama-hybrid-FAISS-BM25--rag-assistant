CSS zIndex troubles. Link inside

Good evening Stack Overflow, I've got a css issue tonight. I have a fixed-positioned shopping cart at the top of the viewport, and products can be dragged and dropped into the cart. The problem is - the products are showing up behind the cart. I've been playing with the z-indexes and positions of all of the elements in question and can't seem to find anything that works. http://hub.mhn.co/Store/Product/ I'll admit CSS isn't a strong point for me, I'm hoping someone will see this and know how to fix it.
