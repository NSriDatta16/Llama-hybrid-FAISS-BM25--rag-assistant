I think you should genralize the collection as, say, a ' BaseList ' which would house the common properties for both OrganizationalUnit.Children and Group.Members. Then the Children and Member classes could extend that base class and add other custom functionality that needs to occur when you accept changes. So in summary: public class BaseList { public virtual void Persist(...); // Common stuff } public class Children { public override void Persist(...) { // do custom stuff } } public class Members { public override void Persist(...) { // do custom stuff } } Then you can loop through a collection of ' BaseList ' and call each individual persist method.
