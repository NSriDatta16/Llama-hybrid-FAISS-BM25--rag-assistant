Check these out: on Ruby Inside, an article presenting Towelie, Flay and Simian , all tools to find code duplication Towelie flay Simian (a more general tool that supports Ruby among other languages) reek : a code smell detector for Ruby Roodi : checks the style of your Ruby code flog : a code complexity analyzer rcov : will give you a C0 (if I remember correctly) code coverage analysis. But be careful though. 100% coverage is very costly and doesn't mean perfect code. heckle : changes your code in subtle manners and runs your test suite to see if it catches it. Brutal :-) Since they're all command-line tools they can all be integrated simply as cc.rb tasks. Just whip out your regex skillz to pick the important part of the output. I recommend you first try them out by hand to see if they play well with your codebase and if you like the info they give you. Once you find a few that give you value, then spend time integrating them in your cc.
