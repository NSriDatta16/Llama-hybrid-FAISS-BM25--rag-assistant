I might call this the antisymmetric property (See here for more information). It is normally stated as (x >= y) && (y >= x) iff (x == y) , but the left side is equivalent to !(x by DeMorgan's law and the definition of (x >= y) that you yourself gave. But if I was trying to derive this using just properties of the strict weak ordering, I would use irreflexivity which says (x is false. As for the name of the relation itself (which now that I re-read your question, I think was what you were actually asking), I don't know that it has one. You might call it the "canonical equivalence relation" of the strict weak ordering. Or maybe that it is "generated" or "induced" by the strict weak ordering.
