Is the output of logistic regression the chance that the event occurs? Yes. If I get a predicted value of say, .7…. I say that the prediction says there is a 70% chance the event happens. Is my reasoning correct? Yes. If I get a predicted value of say, .7, and the actual value is 1, I count that as a correct prediction.… Is my reasoning correct? Not really. What you're doing is evaluating the prediction according to zero–one loss: the prediction is either right enough (i.e., on the right side of $\tfrac{1}{2}$) or not. This isn't a proper scoring rule and hence not an appropriate way to assess the accuracy of predicted probabilities. Zero–one loss is appropriate for ordinary classification, but not for probabilistic classification.
