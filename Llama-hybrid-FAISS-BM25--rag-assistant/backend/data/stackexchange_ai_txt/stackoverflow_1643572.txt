Adding libraries to Visual Studio problem

Can someone link me a good guide for using libraries in a c or c++ project? Right now I'm trying to add OpenCV to a newly created project. I've added all the directories I can think of in "Project and Solutions -> VC++ Directories" and to make sure I've dragged and dropped all the .lib and .dll files into the project. The project builds but when I run the simple "Hello, World program" it gives me this error message: "cv.exe unable to locate component. This application has failed to start because cv200.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem." How can I really add this cv200.dll? I've dragged&dropped it into the project.. Thanks!
