Call me crazy but I dislike gui builders. I prefer the extra control that hand-coding brings. Also, as you wrote the code yourself it makes it far easier to debug. What is important is to layout your code in a logical order and to use methodical variable names. You mentioned trying to use a list. However, I don't see how this is going to save you much time at all (or as I hinted eariler, what time you'll save on implementation, you'll lose during the debugging process). I'm guessing that the headaches are starting when you start sanity-checking the input of your JTextFields. I'd suggest subclassing JTextField into MoneyTextField, PhoneNumberTextField, etc. which can be used to setup the ActionListener to stop people doing stupid things.
