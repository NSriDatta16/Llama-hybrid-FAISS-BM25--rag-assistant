Do bear in mind that in the ListView row items are RECYCLED. This is likely to explain why actions on one row are affecting another. Dig around in Mark's book and you'll find coverage of this. If you're using an adapter with the list, you can use getView() on an adapter to add a click handler to each row as it's created/recycled, and make sure the state is managed correctly as the row items are created and recycled. My approach is to store the state in my own data structure, and then use getView() to mirror that in the UI as the user scrolls up and down the ListView. There may be a better solution, but that works for me.
