File Write Vs Memory Storage in Java

I have a requirement where I have to retrieve the contents from excel rows, do some operations write the response in same excel rows using Java class. So I decided to store the response in memory and write it once. Is it advisable or I have write them in to file for every response? Please advice me the best approach. P.N: The excel file will have more than 1000 rows with three individual work sheets.
