google maps, how to disable marker icons from being dragged around?

I have noticed that in most google maps you can not drag the marker icon into your address bar and see or download the icon .png file itself. Rather then you hover your cursor over the marker, you can see javascript:void(0). How is that achieved? Thanks!
