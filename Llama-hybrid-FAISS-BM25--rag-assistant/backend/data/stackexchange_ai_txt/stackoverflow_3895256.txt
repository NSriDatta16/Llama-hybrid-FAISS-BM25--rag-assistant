avoiding repeat data in hCard

I'm revamping my work's Employee Directory, adding hCard data to each employee's listing. An issue I haven't been able to figure out is how to avoid duplicating information, such as organization-name and organization-unit . Here's a trimmed-down example of my code: Business 123 Business Street City , ST , 99999 , USA Marketing Department NAME TITLE PHONE EMAIL Employee Name Director 907-335-1243 employee.name@business.com Business Name , Marketing Employee Name Assistant 907-335-1243 employee.name@business.com Business Name , Marketing What I'm attempting to do is trim out the hidden span from the last , grabbing organization-name from the business' hCard and organization-unit from the . I've pretty much scoured microformats.org looking for an example of what I'm attempting, but no luck. I've even peeked at several of their "microformats in the wild" list, but the few sites I found there with multiple employee lists were using the same hidden method with duplicate information that I've used in my example. Is what I'm attempting to do even possible?
