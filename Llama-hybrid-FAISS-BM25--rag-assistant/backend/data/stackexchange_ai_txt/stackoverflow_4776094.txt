Can't make an ACTION_MOVE with the emulator

Even though I'm newbie with Android I'm feeling more noob than ever. I have my view that extends SurfaceView, and there I override the onTouchEvent and put this testing code inside: if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE) { return true; } return false; Then when I run the application in the emulator (using Eclipse) in debugging mode, there's no way I can make it return true. I click, keep clicked and drag, and then release, but it will always be event.getAction == 0 no matter what. What am I missing?
