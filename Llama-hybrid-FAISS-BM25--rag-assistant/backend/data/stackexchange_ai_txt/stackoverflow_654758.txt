What DBMS is appropriate for keeping a schema private even when installed 'in the wild'

I have an application server which connects to a database server. I would like to be able to supply users with installers and, with a moderate degree of comfort, trust that the database schema is secure. I understand that there are some risks that I will just have to accept with not controlling the computer on which it installed - a determined person with the right tools and knowledge could look directly at memory and pull out information. Initially I thought my area of focus would simply be on adding the credentials to the installer without them being trivially viewed in a hex editor. However, as I began to research, I learned that for PostGreSQL, even if I install the database silently and don't provide the credentials to the user -- they can simply change a text-based configuration file (pg_hba.conf), and restart the server, enabling full access to the database without credentials. Is this scenario secured in other DBMS? How do most commercial products protect their schemas in this scenario? Would most products use embedded databases? Edit: I assume (perhaps wrongly so) that some products rely on databases that the user never actually touches directly. And I of course never see them because they have designed it in such a way that the user does not need to - probably using an embedded database.
