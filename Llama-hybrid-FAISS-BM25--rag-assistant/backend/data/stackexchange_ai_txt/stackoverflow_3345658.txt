Maybe you should look into using something simple like a truecrypt volume for source code storage as that seems to be a concern of yours. You can create an encrypted file on a usb key or just encrypt the whole volume (provided the code will fit) so you can simply take the key with you at the end of the day. To compile, you could then use something like PyInstaller or py2exe in order to create a stand-alone executable. If you really wanted to go the extra mile, look into a packer or compression utility in order to add more obfuscation. If none of these are an option, you could at least compile the script into bytecode so it isn't immediately readable. Keep in mind that these methods will merely slow someone trying to debug or decompile your program.
