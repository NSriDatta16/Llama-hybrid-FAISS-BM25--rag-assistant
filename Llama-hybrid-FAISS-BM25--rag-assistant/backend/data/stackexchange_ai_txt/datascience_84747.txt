For theory Tibshirani: The elements of statistical learning https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf Also Andrew NG and other books from deeplearning.ai: Machine Learning Yearning https://d2wvfoqc9gyqzf.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2018/09/Ng-MLY01-13.pdf of course the applied machine learning books on computer languages: An introduction into statistical learning in R http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ or deep learning with python: http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yury/AAI/Textbook/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Python.pdf Of course there are a lot of free public pdf books in internet. However in my opinion for the beginning Tibshirani and Andrew NG are good. (and of course take your own project and ask questions on stackoverflow. That helps me a lot).
