You want to add tabbarcontroller to your split view at rootview side and its very simple. create as many viewcontrollers subclasses with xib for ipad as u want to put in tabbarcontroller. Then expand your splitview , u have two things navigationcontroller(which in turns contain rootview controller),detailview controller(right side view). Open your library just drag tabbar controller exectly onto navigationcontroller ,so it will replace all that navigation controller and rootviewcontroller(i assume u dont need that rootview controller or u can create it later). now expand this tabbar controller u can see viewcontroller 1 - viewcontroller 2 etc. Now simply select view controller 1 , open attributes and select nib file on [command 1 attribute] and select controller file for that nib file by press[command 4 attribute]. Reapet this for view controller 2 in tabbarcontroller and save close IB. run program select landscape then u can see its done.
