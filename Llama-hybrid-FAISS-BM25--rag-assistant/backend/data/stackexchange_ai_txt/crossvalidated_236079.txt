Identifying outliers in logistic regression model

I'm looking to identify outliers in a logistic regression model, e.g. mod1 The model itself converges. However, when I try to determine influence using influence.ME (in order to calculate Cook's and DFBETAS), the operation fails to converge: mod1.est And produces a warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.00125887 (tol = 0.001, component 1) I've tried the following fixes, but the warning message remains the same: I converted my ID variable from an integer to a factor (it becomes a factor with three levels, 67 observations at each level): my_dat$ID I inputted ID as the grouping variable in the influence function: mod1.est2 Any advice about what might be going on and/or how to identify outliers using a different method would be much appreciated. Thank you!
