What are some trends or interesting features you see in the following time series plot?

This is a time series plot of hourly temperature recorded of a city for a month. I am unable to see any trends or cycles or other interesting features except the fact that it seems there was some type of discontinuity around 260-400 hour. Please share any features/trends you see.
