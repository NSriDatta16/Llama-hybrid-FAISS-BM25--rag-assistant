2 Different F1-Measure to calculate clustering performance - which one is correct and why?

I know it sounds incorrect but that is the truth Here let me show you This below one is the first one and very widely used in the literature First one reference : Steinbach, Michael, George Karypis, and Vipin Kumar. "A comparison of document clustering techniques." KDD workshop on text mining. Vol. 400. No. 1. 2000. And the second one is this one : http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html Here an answer about second one : https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/80194/5263 The second one is pretty complex and hard to understand I coded both and they produce different results I believe second one is better evaluation but the question is Why there are 2 different F1-Measure? Which one is better and why?
