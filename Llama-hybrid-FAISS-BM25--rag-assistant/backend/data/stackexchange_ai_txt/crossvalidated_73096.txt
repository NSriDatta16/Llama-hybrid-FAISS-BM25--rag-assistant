ANOVA failed to model data, what is a more appropriate test?

This is a cross-post ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19432964/anova-error-in-levelsxx ) about an error I received in R while trying to run an ANOVA on my data. But error aside, I need help understanding why an ANOVA can't deal with my data and what other statistical models could be applied instead. So here's my objective: I have 3 people (speaker) who recorded a bunch of words that I analyzed. The analysis yielded 3 continuous variables: skewness, kurtosis and Center of Gravity (CoG)*. I need to find out what combinations of these 3 variables best model the difference between each speaker. For example, are skewness and CoG together more significant than just CoG in finding the difference between speakers? I have a basic knowledge of stats, but erring on the side of assuming I'm an idiot might be better for any complex explanations. Thanks in advance! The skewness is a measure for how much the shape of the spectrum below the center of gravity is different from the shape above the mean frequency. The kurtosis is a measure for how much the shape of the spectrum around the center of gravity is different from a Gaussian shape. The center of gravity is a measure for how high the frequencies in a spectrum are on average weighted by their energy.
