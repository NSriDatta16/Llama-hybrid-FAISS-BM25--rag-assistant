Why is the average value of the disturbance term u in the population zero? (zero conditional mean assumption)

The assumption $E(u)=0$ says that the distribution of the unobserved factors in the population is zero. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I really can't figure it out. In my textbook the assumption is illustrated by the following example: $yield = B_0 + B_1fertilizer + u$ In $u$ factors like rainfall, land quality, and so on are contained. Why would the unobserved factors affecting the yield have an average of zero in the population of all cultivated plot?
