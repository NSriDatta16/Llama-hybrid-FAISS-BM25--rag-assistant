Hard to tell what you need, but are you looking for the .not() method ? This will filter out (at the top level) any elements that match the selector or element you pass. var str = ' a div \ a span \ a paragraph '; var $obj = $( str ); // remove the span before appending $obj.not( 'span' ).appendTo( 'body' ); EDIT: From your comment below, it seems as though you wish to prevent the rendering of an element coming from the server. This is not possible with javascript. Javascript can only manipulate elements that have been parsed into DOM elements. This means that by the time your javascript has a chance to manipulate it, it has already been displayed. Depending on your situation, if you can't take care of this on the server side, you could perhaps try setting the element's CSS to display:none . This would not keep it from getting parsed but it would prevent it from being drawn on the page.
