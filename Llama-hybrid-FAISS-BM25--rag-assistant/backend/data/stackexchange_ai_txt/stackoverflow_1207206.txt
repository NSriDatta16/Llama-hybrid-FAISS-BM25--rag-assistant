ASP.NET Update Panel stops jquery from working

I have binded jquery events set for mouseenter mouseleave, as well as jquery draggable. The divs are placed in an update panel and when a button is clicked information is sent to the database and the update panel is updated. However when the panel is updated the jquery events no longer work. Any idea as to why this would be the case?
