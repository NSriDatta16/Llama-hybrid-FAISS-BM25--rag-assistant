Help on C# DevExpress XtraGrid GridControl - making checkbox in cell invisible

I have a GridControl view which is being populated with one column as a Boolean to show the value as a checkbox. However, I wish to hide some checkboxes based on the state of other columns. I have tried to use the gridView_CustomDrawCell() event but cannot find a suitable property. I expected to find a visible property to set to false but there doesn't seem to be one. Maybe it is possible to hide the checkbox when the view is being populated but I cannot think of one. Does anyone know if this is possible, and how? Many thanks!
