Objects are not references, but you use references everywhere. e.g. String a = "abc"; the a is a reference to a String . So references get passed around everywhere. Are they pointers ? No. A reference is more like a handle to an object. The JVM is at liberty to move around objects within memory. A pointer would have to change to reflect this. A reference doesn't. A reference could be modelled as a pointer to a pointer.
