Do I have a multiple comparisons scenario here?

Edited after the first 2 responses, additional content in italics I have 4 treatments and a control to encourage people to sign-up for a class. I'll be looking at sign-up and actual attendance rates, with covariates of age, nationality, and gender . There are 3 main things I want to do: I want to find out whether any of these treatments work (i.e., do they trigger higher signup rates?, compared to a simple control?) I want to evaluate whether there are other variables that affect efficacy of these treatments ( i.e., run multiple regressions to control for confounders ) I want to find out how treatment effectiveness varies by subgroups e.g. for older people, what treatment works the best? For people of certain nationalities, what treatment works the best? Problem I can't wrap my head around the concept of multiple comparisons. Since I'm doing 3 sets of analyses, there are technically plenty of hypotheses tests/comparisons going on (e.g. testing whether treatment coefficients in varying contexts are statistically different from 0). Q1: Do I have a multiple comparisons problem, such that I need to do a Bonferroni/Sidak/FDR correction? Q2: Are my tests are all part of a 'family'? (and what even defines a family?) Appreciate your guidance.
