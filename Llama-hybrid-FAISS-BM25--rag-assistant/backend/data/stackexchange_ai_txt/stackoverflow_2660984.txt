How can I map one to one relationship in Fluent NHibernate. I have tried everything else

I have this table structure and would like to map it using Fluent Hibernate (subclass if possible). I cannot change the structure because the database has too many records and might cause major applications rework. It would be easier if the Id from Party table was a foreign key in person and organization table, but in the particular scenario the database has person and organization key as a foreign key in party table. Any help would be great. Party table Id PersonId OrganizationId Person table Id FName LName Organization table Id OrgName OrgDescription
