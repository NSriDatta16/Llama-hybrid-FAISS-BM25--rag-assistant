Availability of BridgeConnect in Magento

One of our clients is thinking of buying an Enterprise Edition, due to his requirement of using the Exact CRM Services with Magento. But today, to my utter astonishment, I’m not finding any inclusion of ” BridgeConnect ” module in either the ” Enterprise ” or the ” Professional ” Editions. Can anybody from the SO please highlight, whether Magento still provides this ” BridgeConnect ” module with the ” Enterprise ” or the ” Professional ” Editions? If this module is not being provided, then when will Magento provide this module? Or, is Magento planning to provide any better solution module, instead of the ” BridgeConnect ” module? This is very much urgent for us, and will be very very grateful for some quick responses. Any help is really appreciated.
