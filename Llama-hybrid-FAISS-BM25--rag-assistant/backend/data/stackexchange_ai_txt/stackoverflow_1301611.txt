Now I know that if you make schema changes you are supposed to remove mirroring and the mirror database, make your changes to the principal, then backup-restore the principal and restore mirroring This is actually wrong. The principal and mirror database are in fact a single database that is stored in two physical locations. Any and every change that occurs in the principal, occurs also in the mirror. They are literarly identical all the time. So any schema changes, including tables, views, procedures, functions, schemas, database principals, assemblies and so on and so forth occur on both the principal and the mirror. The only changes that require special attentions are changes that are related to the database but don't occur in the database: Agent jobs (they are in msdb), server principals (logins), replication settings (they are all over the place in database, msdb and distributor.
