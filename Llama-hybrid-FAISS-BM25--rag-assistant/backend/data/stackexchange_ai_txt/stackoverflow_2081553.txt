I'd say the 4.5 Gig of data will be easier accessible via a 64bit number space (which has a upper limit of 17.2 gigabyte in directly addressable memory). 32 bit addressable memory is 4Gb, so if your database is bigger than this then possibly MySQL cannot handle the indexing as quickly. Is there a way of re-indexing or optimising your database so that its paged in a more 32bit friendly way? Altering the largest table to a different storage engine may do this (use ALTER or phpMyAdmin). You may also have lost some indexing on the ID field after the move. try running your select again, with EXPLAIN at the front; EXPLAIN select id from filetable where cid=1234 if the table produced after the query contains mosty NULLs then you need to re-configure the keys in your table. Alternatively, check how much RAM is on your 32bit box, is it comparable to the 64 bit box? Obviously, back it all up and do tests on a non-live server first ;) I hope this helps you get on the right track.
