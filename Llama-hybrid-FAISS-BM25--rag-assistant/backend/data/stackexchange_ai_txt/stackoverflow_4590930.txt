You could use the Web Storage API, and include a polyfill to port the functionality for older browsers: http://code.google.com/p/sessionstorage/ https://gist.github.com/350433 Both of these use window.name to provide a session-like state. This may or may not be secure enough for your needs. From there, you can use the following code for all browsers: // Store on previous page sessionStorage.setItem("yourArray", JSON.stringify(yourArray)); // Restore on following page var yourArray = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("yourArray")); EDIT: Older browsers may need the following for the above code sample. This is so the array can be serialized to a string, since sessionStorage only supports string key-value pairs: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
