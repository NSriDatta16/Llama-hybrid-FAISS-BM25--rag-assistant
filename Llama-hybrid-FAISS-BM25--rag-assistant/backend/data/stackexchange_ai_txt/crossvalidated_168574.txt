That kind of update rule would make total sense if we knew our curve was perfectly convex, however, with noisy data (or real data), I'd suspect that this terminating condition might not a good idea (I might be totally wrong, hence the question). You kept the cost function completely out of the picture! While your argument holds truth when using root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), it falls apart when you consider cross-entropy error . You might refer to Andrew Ng's Coursera course. He actually explains this concept very well in one of his lessons (see Week 3: Logistic Regression Model).
