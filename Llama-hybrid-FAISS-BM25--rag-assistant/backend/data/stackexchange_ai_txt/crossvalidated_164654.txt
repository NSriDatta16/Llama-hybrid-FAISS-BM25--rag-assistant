First, it looks like you built a regular linear regression model, not a logistic regression model. To build a logistic regression model, you need to use glm() with family="binomial" , not lm() . Suppose you build the following logistic regression model using independent variables $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ to predict the probability of event $y$: logit This model has regression coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$ and $\beta_3$. If you then do predict(logit) , R will calculate and return b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 . Recall that your logistic regression equation is $y = log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_3$. So, to get the probabilities that you want, you need to solve this equation for $p$. In R, you can do something like this: pred
