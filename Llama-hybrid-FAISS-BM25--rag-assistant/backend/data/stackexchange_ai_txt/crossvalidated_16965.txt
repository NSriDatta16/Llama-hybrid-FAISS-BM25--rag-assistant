I am a biostatistician in what is essentially an R shop (~80 of folks use R as their primary tool). Still, I spend approximately 3/4 of my time working in Python. I attribute this primarily to the fact that my work involves Bayesian and machine learning approaches to statistical modeling. Python hits much closer to the performance/productivity sweet spot than does R, at least for statistical methods that are iterative or simulation-based. If I were performing ANOVAS, regressions and statistical tests, I'm sure I would primarily use R. Most of what I need, however, is not available as a canned R package.
