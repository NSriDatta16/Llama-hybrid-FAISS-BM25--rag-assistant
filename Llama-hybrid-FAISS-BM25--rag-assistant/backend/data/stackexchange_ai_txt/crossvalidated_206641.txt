What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a way in which scientists build algorithms that can learn . Choose any Task T, such as driving a car. Then your algorithm can display a certain level of performance P. If this improves with experience E, then the algorithm is said to have... learned! So what is Deep Learning? Well, its a bit more complex, but basically let's say your trying to approximate a function. You have inputs and you have outputs. But you don't know what goes on in the middle. For instance, we know humans can drive cars well, they don't crash (often) but we don't really know how the mind is working to achieve this... So let's think about a neural network model that attempts to drive a car. It is a bit like the brain. So there are many layers to the model. In fact, its a function within a function within a function etc. Because there are many functions nested within one another... we use the term deep to describe it! In one line: Deep learning is a kind of neural network, and a neural network is a kind of machine learner. That's it :-) I recommend this textbook .
