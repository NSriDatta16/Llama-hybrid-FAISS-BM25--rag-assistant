Testing pre-conditions before testing a hypothesis

I prefer the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing myself, and when I look at how traditional null hypothesis testing is taught, I see a problem that is never talked about. For example: While testing for a difference between two independent groups, it is very common to find people testing each group for normality, then testing for equality of variances and then doing either a parametric or a non-parametric test. But then the overall probability of a Type-I error then is no longer 0.05 - it is closer to 1 - 0.95^3 or 1 - 0.95^4 (0.14 or 0.19) depending on how many assumption tests have been done. But you never see this mentioned in books on null hypothesis testing. Many websites advocate doing tests of assumptions before the actual statistical test and this technique is almost always used by researchers in the social, physiological sciences. Many textbooks with a generic title of "Statistics for ..." even have flowcharts indicating which tests to perform to test assumptions before the actual test. Comments?
