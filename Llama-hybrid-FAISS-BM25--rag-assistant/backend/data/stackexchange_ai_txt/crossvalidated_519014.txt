You could try running PCA with varimax rotation. You would obtain a set of uncorrelated components, where groups of highly correlated variables cluster together in a particular component, which you can see by them having high loadings of similar magnitude in that PC. Perhaps a component can also serve as an aggregation of the set, you could then try PCR instead of regular OLS.
