In a multiple Bayesian linear regression model, do all variables (dependent and predictors) get prior distributions? All parameters get a prior. Random variables/data might get a prior if you're modeling missing/latent/hidden data. If so, can one mix non-informative and substantive priors in the model? Based on this information alone, I don't see anything wrong with this approach.
