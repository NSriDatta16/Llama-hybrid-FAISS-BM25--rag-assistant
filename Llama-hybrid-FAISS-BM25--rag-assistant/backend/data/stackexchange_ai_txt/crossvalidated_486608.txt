log-odds and it's standard error as priors in logistic regression

I'm attempting to complete a Bayesian logistic regression with the outcome of whether or not a crash occurred. I have various covariates in my model that are widely used to predict crash occurrence. As such, I'm using informed priors from prior publications that report the odds ratio and it's 95% C.I for each covariate. Here's an example of a prior provided by the model I'm pulling from crash at night (OR 13.1; 95% CI 5.0 to 31.5) : log-odds (1.12,.20) from $$ \frac{log(31.5-5)}{3.92}$$ I wanted to apply the log-odds of these results and their standard error in my updated model as priors. My first thought was to apply the log-odds and it's a standard error on a normal prior. I'm using logic from the sources 1 & 2 listed at the end of the post. My question, if my assumptions about applying these log-odds and SE's on a normal prior are correct, can I simply transform the SE of the log odds to variance and implement? a normal prior: β k = (μ βk ,σ 2 βk ) requires a variance rather than an SE. According to citation 3 log-odds SE and be transformed into log-odds VAR: $$SE[log(OR)] = \sqrt{VAR[log(OR)]} => SE^2 = VAR[log(OR)]$$ therefore, if I square the standard error x then I should be able to apply this as my final prior: β k = (1.12,.04) Is this assumption correct or am I way off? Is there a better way of implementing log-odd priors and their SE's into a logistic regression model? Thanks!

Furthermore, using a normal prior for log odds ratios should give you very approximately normal posteriors." Sander Greenland, Bayesian perspectives for epidemiological research: I.
