How do I get this JQuery to target & shorten URL's in a string?

I'm just starting out with JQuery. My Question: I want to know if I can modify this code below to shorten long URLs, but ignore anything that isn't a URL? My Problem: This code fragment targets everything in the DIV ('tasks-overflow'). Although I just need it to affect URL's in that DIV based on protocol( http://.. .). There are sentences on either side of the URL. $(document).ready(function(){ $(".tasks-overflow:contains('http://')").each(function(){ $(this).text("http://..."); }); }); Any help would greatly be appreciated, thanks
