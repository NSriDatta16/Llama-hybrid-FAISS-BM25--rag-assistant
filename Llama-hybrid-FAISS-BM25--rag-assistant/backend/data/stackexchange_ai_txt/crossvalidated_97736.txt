Binary and ordinal scale

I know my response variable is ordinal(5 levels). I decide to ignore all the information in the response variable and group it into two groups. I then fit a logistic regression model to it. I use this logistic regression model for classification for the two groups. Alternatively, I fit an ordinal logistic regression model, with this ordinal logistic regression model I use it for classification for my outcome but only for classifying objects in the predefined groups that I choose before fitting the binary logistic regression model. Which model will perform better when assessed with the $AUC$?.
