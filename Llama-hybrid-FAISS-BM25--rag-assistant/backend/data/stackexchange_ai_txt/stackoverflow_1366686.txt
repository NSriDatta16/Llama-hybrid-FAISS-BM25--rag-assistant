LINQ many-to-many relationships: Solution?

LINQ so far has been remarkably elegant, but to perform basic m2m queries it offers no solution I can imediately see. What's worse is that while it works for any other table relationship, LINQ is not giving me an association in the class structure for my m2m table. So I can do things like artwork.artists.where(...) //or artist.Artworks.add(artwork) but I can't do artwork.artowrks_subjects.tagSubjects.where(...) //or tagSubject.artworks_subjects.add(artwork) alt text http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/257/20090902122107.png Is there a common pattern for solving this limitation?
