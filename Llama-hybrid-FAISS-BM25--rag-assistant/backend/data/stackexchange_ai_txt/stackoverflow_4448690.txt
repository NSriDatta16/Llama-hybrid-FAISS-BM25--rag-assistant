Have you checked the limits configured for the IIS. There are a few of them to limit CPU, Network usage etc. If this happens it will write all the logging to the Event Log if closing a session. And on your second question the countdown timer for a session in IIS is rested at every request. Update: Check this one out.. http://bluedragon.blog-city.com/lost_sessions_webgardens_sessionstate.htm Talking about setting the max number of processes to higher than 1. Cheers, Stefan
