Setting variance of an informative prior

I am creating a Bayesian Poisson Regression model and I have access to a dataset and a previous corresponding model. I want to use the previous model to create a prior that I will combine with the data. To incorporate the previous model as a prior in the Bayesian model I have calculated a point estimate of a parameter $\hat{\beta}$ . Now, I am planning on using this point estimate as the expectation in a gaussian prior, meaning that I get the following prior: $N(\hat{\beta}, \sigma)$ . My question is, does anyone know how to set $\sigma$ ? I know that when a Jeffreys prior is used you could for instance say that the prior should be worth 2 observations. Is there a corresponding method where I could say how many observations my prior is worth in this context? Note Note that I am using point estimations since the previous model is very different from the likelihood and the model cannot be incorporated in a straightforward way.
