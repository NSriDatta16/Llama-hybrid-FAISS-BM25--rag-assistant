At the risk of encouraging copy-paste programming, I'll say that I use the code found here to do the very same thing. It'll take a UIImage, check the EXIF data, and return you a new UIImage that has been adjusted to match so your service won't need to worry about it. Just keep in mind you may need to tweak it slightly to match your specific needs. It's definitely a starting point though.
