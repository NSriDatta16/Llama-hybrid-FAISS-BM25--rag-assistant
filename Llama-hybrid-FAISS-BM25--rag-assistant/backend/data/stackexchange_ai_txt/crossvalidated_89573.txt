Answer for your questions: 1) how do I convert the race into numbers to make my model more accurate? -> I think answer lies in which tool you are using for analysis. Most of the tool have facility to convert attributes/factor in appropriate inputs. To explain your first question you can refer following link: You can find your answer precisely here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm It's self-explanatory article on admission based on GPA and ranks. I am just recreating example from there. Tool used in this blog is R, freeware statistical analysis tool. Data would look like this: ## admit gre gpa rank ## 1 0 380 3.61 3 ## 2 1 660 3.67 3 ## 3 1 800 4.00 1 ## 4 1 640 3.19 4 ## 5 0 520 2.93 4 ## 6 1 760 3.00 2 Admit is output, 1 means student got admission. Now lets make rank as category: mydata$rank You can use other input into factor/category using above method. Now we will prepare a regression model for above table. mylogit Above function will prepare a logistic regression model where we are checking whether admission depends on GRE,GPA or rank. Using summary function you get see the results. summary(mylogit) 2) How do I find which factor make the most contribution to estimate students final GPA, so I can put more weight on it? -> You don't have to give weight before hand, regression table will give you weight (co-efficient) for each input along with its statistical significance. I hope I have cleared your answer.
