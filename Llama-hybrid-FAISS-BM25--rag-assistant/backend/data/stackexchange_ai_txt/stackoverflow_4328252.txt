Javascript localStorage and domains

Because iPad/iPhone doesn't support cookies from third party sites, I want to store values in localStorage. An example on domainA might be: this script on domainB can access window.localStorage and it works great. However the values are stored in domainA because that's the document's location. If I put my script inside an iframe whose source is on domainB, then it works, but I'm trying to avoid frames. So my question is: Is there a way to get/set values in localStorage on a remote domain such that they'll be there when I visit domainB at a later time?
