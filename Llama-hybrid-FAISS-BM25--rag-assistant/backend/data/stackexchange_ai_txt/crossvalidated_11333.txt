I don't know if I am understanding correctly your question. But I guess you may use the posterior density to assess the uncertainty around point estimates like the mean. You may plot a histogram, calculate standard deviations. This is easy to do, if you have the MCMC output. Just take the values sampled (after a burnin period) and compute the means, standard deviations and plot histograms or densities. Another advantage of a posterior distribution is that you can assess your uncertainty on tails of the distribution and also if the distribution is simetric around the mode/mean. Confidence intervals in general assume that the distribution is simetric and that outliers are rare...
