How do I specify a random effect in Bayesian beta regression model?

My response data are proportions that I want to model with one continuous predictor and a random effect of group. Here's my winbugs code: ##priors for (i in 1:n_group){ alpha.group[i]~dnorm (mu.group.int, tau.group.int) ### random intercepts } mu.group.int ~ dnorm (0,0.001) ### mean hyperparameter for group tau.group.int Here's the error I'm getting: Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) : 3 nodes produced errors; first error: Error in node y[1] Invalid parent values That makes me think the random effect is pushing the parent alpha and beta outside of the 0,1 limit....and maybe random effects/mixed levels are specified differently in these sort of models. Any help?
