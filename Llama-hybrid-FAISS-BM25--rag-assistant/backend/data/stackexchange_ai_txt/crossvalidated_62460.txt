What are "starting values" in glm() function?

What are parameters start , etastart , mustart in the glm() function ? I have been looking in the docs and the internet but I have found no clear explanation what this means. It resembles bayesian "initial values" for the chains, but I doubt this is related, as glm() function in R is frequentist statistics...
