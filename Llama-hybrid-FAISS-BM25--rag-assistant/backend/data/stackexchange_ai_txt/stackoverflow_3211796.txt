TextItem In GWT With Decimal Problem

I think this may be very simple, but it swallow my time. I am using TextItem In GWT in my JAVA Application to get the price input from the the user. I am trying to stop allowing more than one dot (".") on text item. All my exercise are gone to fail. I am using regular expression; Try to handle the key chars on BlurHandler event of TextItem both drag me a wrong. Can anybody help me to achieve the above? Thank you in advance.
