Java web start doesn't launch

On my Windows 7 x64 machine, I'm having problems launching my remotely deployed Web Start app (the Web Start app launches correctly on another PC as expected). In IE or FF, I click on the web start launch link, the JNLP is downloaded, it seems to get executed and nothing happens. I see javaws.exe processes running. I don't see a java.exe running. I don't know if it's related but I also can't get the java console to run. In the Control Panel Java applet settings, I have have enabled "Show console" and "place Java icon in the system tray". I don't see the Java icon in the system tray either. I'm running Java 1.6.0_21 (32 bit). I'm able to run Netbeans so the it appears as if Java is installed correctly on my machine. Why isn't web start working?
