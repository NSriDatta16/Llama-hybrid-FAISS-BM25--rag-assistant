Calling type I assertion probability the "type I error rate" when it is neither a rate nor the probability of making an error. It is the probability of making an assertion of an effect when there is no effect. Calling type I assertion probability the "false positive rate" when it is not the probability of a false positive result. It is the probability of making an assertion of an effect when any assertion of an effect is by definition wrong. The probability of a false + result is the probability that an effect is not there given the evidence was + for such a finding. The is a Bayesian posterior probability, not $\alpha$ . Thinking that controlling $\alpha$ has to do with limiting decision errors.
