Can the cointegration coefficient be negative?

I am trying to understand the cointegration coefficient, $\gamma$ . In the following case, $$P_{A,t }- \gamma P_{B,t}= \varepsilon_t$$ where $P_{A,t}$ and $P_{B,t}$ are the prices of the assets A and B at time $t$ , respectively. If $P_{A,t}$ and $P_{B,t}$ are I(1) and $\varepsilon_t$ is I(0), I can say that the assets A and B are cointegrated and I should buy 1 unit of stock A and $\gamma$ units of stock B. But what if $\gamma$ is negative? Do I need to buy $\gamma$ units of asset B? Or is it not possible that $\gamma$ is negative? Thank you for your attention!
