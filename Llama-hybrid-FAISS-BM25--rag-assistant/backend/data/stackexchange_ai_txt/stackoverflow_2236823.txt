No - this is a really bad idea. By making your souce code files writeable you open a whole avenue for attacking your system. Embedding data into source code is a messy practice - not least because it will not scale. What happens if the file is locked for an update when a script tries to include it? What happens when the connection to the browser is lost part way through writing the file? If you're quite sure that you'll only ever have a very small number of users and a low level of concurrency then abetter solution by far would be to have a seperate directory, with all http access denied, containing one file per user, named with the username (or a hash of it if you prefer) containing the hashed password.
