The magic word is feature construction . Statistics and machine learning almost always take some effort to prepare data before running an algorithm. Some "tricks" with respect to your particular problem: try to reduce the number of factor levels without losing too much information (e.g. combine rare levels) Convert ordered input factors to numeric (tree-based methods work much faster then). A possibility is also to manually dummy code an input factor which greatly reduces computational effort. Some further hints: If the response variable is a factor, then a random forest does classification, not regression. You can try out faster algoritms like multinomial logistic regression to fill in missings.
