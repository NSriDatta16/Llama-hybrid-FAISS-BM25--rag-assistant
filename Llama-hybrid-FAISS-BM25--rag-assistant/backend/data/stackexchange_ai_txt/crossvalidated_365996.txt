So I will try an answer even if I have no direct experience with problems with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. Your problem seems similar to novelty detection, or anomaly detection, so you can search this site for the tags anomaly-detection and novelty-detection . One problem with searching for information is that this problems seem to go under multiple names, PU-learning, one-class learning, semi-supervised learning. If not all examples are labeled, usual supervised learning seems difficult ... so here are some papers you could look at: Learning with Positive and Unlabeled Examples Using Weighted Logistic Regression , Generative Probabilistic Models for Positive-Unlabeled Learning , This post is relevant: one class (positive and unlabeled) classification R package There are also some R packages on CRAN, like AdaSampling, RSSL, ssc and SSL (and possibly others). And maybe: start with some descriptive statistics/visualization of the labeled "fake" objects ... are they "fake" in some similar way, or all in its own way? Maybe something relevant in some of this: Posts on PU-learning or posts on one-class learning .
