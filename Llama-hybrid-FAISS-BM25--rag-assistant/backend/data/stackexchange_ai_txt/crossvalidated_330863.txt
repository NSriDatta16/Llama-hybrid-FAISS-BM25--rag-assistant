Decimal Lags on ACF or Integer

I have an hourly time series, so when I plot the ACF it shows decimal lags. I can solve this by setting l=frequency of data times the numeber of integer lags I want to study. Ex: acf(data, l=8765*4) For selecting ARMA order, should i look at integer lags or decimal lags?
