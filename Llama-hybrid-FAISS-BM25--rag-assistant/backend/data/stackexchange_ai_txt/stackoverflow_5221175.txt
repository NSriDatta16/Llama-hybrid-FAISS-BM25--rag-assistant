Is Rhino the only interpreter with support for sandboxing and serializable continuations?

I need (a) sandboxing, and (b) serializeable continuations. I'm exposing server-side game scripting to users , and it is extremely async, thus the callback pattern makes code un-readable and very un-approachable for newbie programmers. A continuation-passing style is an alternative, but has the same drawbacks. Async in the sense that a query to the user may take months to complete. See http://weaverengine.com/platforms for my full list Serializeable continuations seem like a very elegant solution, but few interpreters support them. So far, it seems that my only option is Rhino. I was hoping that NodeJS or PyPy would work, but the evidence so far points to the contrary. Lua seems to support coroutines , but I can't find any information on whether it supports serializeable continuations. Lua does sandboxing well. NodeJS has Jefe to offer really nice sandboxing, but nothing so far regarding continuation serialization . PyPy also hasn't yet refined their sandboxing and serializeable continuation support to the point where they can be used together, from what I understood on the pypy-dev mailing list. JavaFlow hints that if all classes implement Serializeable, then java continuations could be serialized. But unless I can run an interpreter for a nice dynamic language on top of JavaFlow, I'm not interested. Is Java and Rhino my only option? Is there a branch of NodeJS with continuation support? Any reasonably nice, dynamic language that meets these criteria?
