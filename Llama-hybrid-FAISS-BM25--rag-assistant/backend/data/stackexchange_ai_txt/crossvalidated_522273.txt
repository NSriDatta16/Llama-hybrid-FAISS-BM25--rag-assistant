If you are going to use a numerical representation using 0 or 1 you do not need to factor the categorical variable. When the value of the categorical variable is 0 then you have created your reference group (because 0 x beta = 0) so the beta of the categorical variable when x= 1 will be interpreted as the effect of having a condition present compared to the reference group (not present) on average holding all else constant. If you do not want to use 0 or 1 then yes you need to have your categorical variable set as a factor, and it helps to specify which factor is your reference factor. You can use the following code to specify your reference group for your factor variable. dat $x = as.factor(dat$ x) dat $x = relevel(dat$ x, ref = "not present") Then the coefficient of the present group will be evaluated as the effect of having a condition present compared to not having the condition present on average holding all other covariates constant. Sorry not sure how to include $, between dat and x without it formatting to an equation. Both would give you the same answer in terms of your estimate. Now for interactions of a numeric numeric interaction and factor factor interactions. When using categorical variables it is important to note that the reference group is swallowed up in the intercept term. Meaning that when the covariates are equal to zero and the disease is not present the expected value of the response variable would be the intercept term on average. So if you have two categorical variables then both reference groups are included in the intercept term. You are not losing any information using a numeric or factor. Since they are doing the same thing. So let's say your other dichotomous categorical variable is whether or not an individual smokes. We then have the categorical interaction model below; $ \hat{y} = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1(x_{present}) + \hat\beta_2(x_{smokes}) + \hat\beta_3(x_{present})(x_{smokes})$ Now the reference groups are excluded from the model since they are taken up in the intercept term. This is understood more easily in numerical form. "not present" = 0 and "no smoking" = 0. $ \hat{y} = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1(0_{not present}) + \hat\beta_2(0_{no smoke}) + \hat\beta_3(0_{not present})(0_{no smoke})$ Since all coefficients except for the intercept terms are multiplied by 0, the resulting model gives, $\hat{y} = \hat\beta_0$ . The factor*factor model gives the same resulting model for the reference group.
