Poisson or binomial regression?

I have a binary response variable (it is a presence/absence variable) and a ordinal discrete predictor: response : [1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ... ] predictor : [1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 ... ] I'd like to know whether there is a higher probability to encounter whatever is recorded in the response variable when the levels of the predictor is higher or lower. Do I have better to perform a Binary GLM: response ~ predictor Or do I have better to count the number of occurrences (number of one in response ) in each level of the predictor and run a Poisson GLM: response2 ~ predictor2 response2 : [15 22 21] predictor2 : [1 2 3] 1: Are both models correct? What is the difference? 2: Is there a difference between Binary GLM and logistic regression? Is one a special case of the other?
