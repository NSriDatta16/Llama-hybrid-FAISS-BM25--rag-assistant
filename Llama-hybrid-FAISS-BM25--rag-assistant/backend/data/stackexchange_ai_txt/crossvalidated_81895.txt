You only need to log-transform the mRNA expression, not $x$. If you didn't log-transform, you could use the rank-based Kruskal-Wallis (KW) non-parametric variant of ANOVA. (Kruskal-Wallis is much less sensitive to skewness and outliers, and doesn't require homoscedasticity). If you go the ANOVA route with log(mRNA), you have to ensure the variance of log-mRNA is equal across the groups (homoscedasticity-->equal variance of log-$y$ between groups). You also can't have outliers when using ANOVA, since they will bias the results. For outlier effect on averages, consider the average of 1, 2, 3, and 1000000, which is near 250000. However, if you use ranks, the the 1,2,3,1000000 turns into 1,2,3,4 for which the average is 2.5. KW is based on ranks. You can also assign a rank to the mRNA levels (without a log-transform), and use the ranks in ANOVA.
