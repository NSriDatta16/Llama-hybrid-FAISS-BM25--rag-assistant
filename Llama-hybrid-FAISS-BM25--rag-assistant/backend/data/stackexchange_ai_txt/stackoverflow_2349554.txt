Resources on making editors / program interfaces more gaming-like

In this gigantic simulation program I'm writing, I'm designing the UI and writing a mini-editor in it. I would like to design the UI so that it's very computer-game like (almost a command & conquer feel). Anyone have good resources on articles/books/links from cognitive psychology, programming, or HCI on how to design interfaces to be "gaming-like"?
