Legal considerations of analyzing and training language models with online public documents

When training and evaluating my language models, I always wish to have more data, especially those from different sectors. Then, I noticed the following statement about copyright on the US government website, "Unless a copyright is indicated, information on State Department websites is in the public domain and may be copied and distributed without permission." Is it legal to train language models with documents subject to this statement and, more interestingly, write Medium posts or publish papers to present the results?
