LDAP is incredibly fast for read operations compared with your average RDBMS. Auth operations are read intensive and generally change data infrequently - which is well suited for ldap's strengths. On the flip side, write operations are generally much slower than their database counterparts. So, while LDAP would most likely not be an adequate alternative for your general data storage needs, it is a strong choice for auth.
