Updating the probability distribution when removing links from a Bayesian network

I have spent a fair amount of time trying to solve this problem but I can't find the solution. More specifically, I have the following matrix: P(D|E&F) = [ 0.5 0.3 0.5 0.2 ; 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.8 ] All the variables are binary (two states) D, E and F are nodes of a Bayesian network. E and F are the parents of D and they are independent. Now, new evidence comes in and we know that D and E are independent as well (the link between D and F remains but the arc from E to D is removed). How do I go about finding P(D|F) from P(D|E&F) ?
