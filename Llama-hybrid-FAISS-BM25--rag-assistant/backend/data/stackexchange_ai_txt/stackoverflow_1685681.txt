How to remove extended ascii using python?

In trying to fix up a PML (Palm Markup Language) file, it appears as if my test file has non-ASCII characters which is causing MakeBook to complain. The solution would be to strip out all the non-ASCII chars in the PML. So in attempting to fix this in python, I have import unicodedata, fileinput for line in fileinput.input(): print unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', line).encode('ascii','ignore') However, this results in an error that line must be "unicode, not str". Here's a file fragment. \B1a\B \tintense, disordered and often destructive rage†.†.†.\t Not quite sure how to properly pass line in to be processed at this point.
