Project time series from previous time series examples and characteristics

Say I want to open a shop but first I want to project the likely sales in the first 5 years to see if it is a viable option. I have data pertaining to 100s of other start ups, including their success in the first 5 years measured as sales, location, average income of surrounding households, median age, local population, etc. What would be the best method of projecting the sales of the shop I want to open? One approach would be to predict sales in year 1, then separate model for year 2, but I would like to avoid building 5 different models. Open to all options. Although would be interested in how to tackle in a Bayesian approach or approaches that can produce prediction intervals.
