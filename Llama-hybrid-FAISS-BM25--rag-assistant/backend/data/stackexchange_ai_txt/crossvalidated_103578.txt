You could: measure the average absolute distance for the $j^{\text{th}}$ observation $\left(\frac{\sum_{i \ne j}{|x_{j} - x_{i}|}}{n-1}\right)$ measure the total absolute distance for the $j^{\text{th}}$ observation $\left(\sum_{i \ne j}{|x_{j} - x_{i}|}\right)$ measure the average distance for the $j^{\text{th}}$ observation $\left(\frac{\sum_{i \ne j}{x_{j} - x_{i}}}{n-1}\right)$ measure the total distance for the $j^{\text{th}}$ observation $\left(\sum_{i \ne j}{x_{j} - x_{i}}\right)$ And probably do a lot of other things. However, you haven't told us why you want to such a measure, and as the different behaviors you will get from each of the above will have different ramifications, your motivation is important. Update: If, for example you want to filter out points because they are too dispersed (based on some yet to be determined criterion), then you might simply examine what happens to the total variance (or standard deviation) when you remove each point .
