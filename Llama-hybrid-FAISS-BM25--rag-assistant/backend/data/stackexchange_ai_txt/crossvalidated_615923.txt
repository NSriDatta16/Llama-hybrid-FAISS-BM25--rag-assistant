If I apply a wrong model, do I get a correct confidence interval by bootstrapping?

Assume there are $n$ subjects and for $1\leq i\leq n$ , subject $i$ is measured at $t_{i1} time points. Consider a regression model $E[g(y_{ij})|u_i]=\beta\cdot x_{ij}+u_i$ for GLM where $u_i$ is random effect following normal distribution for subject $i$ measured at time $t_{ij}$ . If $g$ is identity link, then ignoring $u_i$ will not lead to bias estimation of $\beta$ . This is not true in non-identity link case. Suppose I want to obtain confidence interval of $\beta$ 's by bootstrap, where bootstrap has nested structure in accordance with random effects $u_i$ . I apply GLM without random effects $u_i$ . Apply bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals of $\beta$ 's. I apply GLM with random effects $u_i$ . Apply bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals of $\beta$ 's. 2's confidence interval always have nominal coverage under assumption of true model with random effects. However, it is not clear that 1's confidence interval will always have nominal coverage. $Q1:$ In linear model case, I expect 1 has nominal coverage and its median is unbiased as well. When do I expect bootstrapped median unbiased? And when do I expect bootstrapped CI having nominal coverage? $Q2:$ In case that 1 is biased, would 1's CI still have some close to nominal coverage?
