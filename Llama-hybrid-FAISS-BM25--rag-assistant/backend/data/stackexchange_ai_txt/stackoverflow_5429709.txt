Need Help With Core Data Model

I'm working on a gym logging app using Core Data model. I'm trying to figure out the best way to design the data model. I'm thinking I will have 2 entities: Exercise and Routine. The Exercise entity will have attributes for name, link to pic, etc. The routine will have attributes for strings containing the exercises, along with the reps and sets worked for that particular entry. What do you guys think or if you have any suggestions? I'm not sure if this is the correct way to organize my data model. I currently have all the muscle groups and their exercises in an array loaded from a plist.
