drawing a graph in a JPanel in Net Beans

Is there a possible way to override the paintComponent() method in the auto-generated GUI code in NetBeans? I managed to manually draw a graph without using the drag-and-drop components, and I need to make adjustments (e.g. adding radio button group) which I find really time consuming and tedious work. I created a GUI using the NetBean's drag-and-drop components, but I cannot edit them. Is it possible? Pls give me a solution. Greatly apprecite any insight Many thanks in advance
