When you want to hand your stuff over to someone else in a discoverable way. Command-line scripts are awesome because they are simple and elegant, but they are not very discoverable. That is, if you were to hand your scripts over to someone else with no documentation, would they be able to figure out what they are and how to use them? If your tasks are so simple that myscript /? will explain what you need to do fully, then you don't need a GUI. If on the other hand, you are handing your scripts over to someone who isn't so technical, or needs some more visual guidance about the task to be done, than by all means, a GUI is a good way to go. You might even want to keep your scripts as they are and just create a separate GUI that runs them for maximum flexibility.
