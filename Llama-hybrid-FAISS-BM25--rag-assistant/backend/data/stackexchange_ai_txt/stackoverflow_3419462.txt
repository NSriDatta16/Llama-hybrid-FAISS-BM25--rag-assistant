if (nothing_works) { is_ie6 = true; } Seriously though, your conditional comment is probably the best and most accurate detection method. Even if a browser lies in their user-agent, it presumably won't parse the conditional comment as if it were IE6. I have to go home and cry a little bit now that I've learned someone is still developing for IE6.
