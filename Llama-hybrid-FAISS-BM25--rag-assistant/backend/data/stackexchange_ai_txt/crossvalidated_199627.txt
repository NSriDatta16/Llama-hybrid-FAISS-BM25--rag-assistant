The decision function $g(x) \in \{-1, 1\}$ of a kernelized SVM is given by $$g(x) = \mathrm{sgn}(f(x)), \\ f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i k(x_i, x) + b,$$ where the training set is $\{(x_i, y_i)_i\}_{i=1}^n$, $k$ is a kernel, and $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^n$, $b$ are learned. If $g(x)=1$, $x$ is classified to the positive class. If $g(x)=-1$, $x$ is classified to the negative class. The set $\{x \mid f(x)=g(x)=0\}$ consists of all the points lying exactly at the boundary. These are the points on the blue solid line. The heat map shows $f(x)$. That is, the magenta region shows points such that $f(x)>0$ and the cyan region show points $x$ such that $f(x)
