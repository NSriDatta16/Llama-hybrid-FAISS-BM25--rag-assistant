How to remove seasonalization in time series data?

I am new to time-series data. I have a dataset with Year(2013-2018), Month, Mdate (1,2,3,4...31), Day (Monday - Sunday), Time (0-24) and Hourly Counts. I saw two seasonal trends in the dataset. I need to create a regression model to train and test the model to predict the Hourly Counts in 2018 based on past records(2013-2017). Hourly Counts is the target variable and other attributes will be combined together to form a feature. I have drawn two boxplots. The left side is the Daily average hourly count and the right side is the monthly total hourly count. May I know how to deal with the seasonal trend in the dataset? Thank you so much Decision tree regression is used in this case as per requirement.
