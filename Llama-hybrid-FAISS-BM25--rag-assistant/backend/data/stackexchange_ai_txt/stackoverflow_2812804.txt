Bookmarks are organized in a tree, where each node in the tree is either a bookmark or a group (a folder that can contain nodes). Each node in the tree is represented by a BookmarkTreeNode object. There is no root bookmarks folder in the sense of a file system object. All the bookmarks are stored in a structured file that you access through the api in the link you provided. The root of the tree is returned by getTree: chrome.bookmarks.getTree
