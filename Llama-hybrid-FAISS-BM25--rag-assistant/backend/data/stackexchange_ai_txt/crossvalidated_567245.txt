What is a GAM; question about sklearn's SplineTransformer

From my understanding, using basis-spline feature expansion/transformation with fixed parameters (number and placement of knots, etc.), then feeding that into a linear/logistic regression is technically a GAM. If we call this a "baby GAM", then it seems like a "fully grown GAM" learns the smoothing functions and its parameters during training. Let me know if my understanding is in the right ballpark. Also, is it OK to call the "baby GAM" approach a GAM, or is it sort of a cultural faux pas like calling logistic regression a machine learning model?
