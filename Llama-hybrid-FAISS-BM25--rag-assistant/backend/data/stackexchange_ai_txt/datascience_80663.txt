How to give a 3D Tensor as input to LSTM

I'm having X_train of shape (1400, 64, 35) and y_train of shape (1400,). I want to give X_train as input to LSTM layer and also want to find the Average (using GlobalAveragePooling Layer) of the Output of LSTM at each time step and give it as input to a Dense Layer. For this problem how to connect the layers and build a sequential model? I'm using Tensorflow.Keras API's
