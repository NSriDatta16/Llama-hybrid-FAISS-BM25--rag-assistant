Cross-correlation with Spearman's method

I should investigate the lead-lag relationship among 2 sets of data, annual incidence of a disease and annual average data of an environmental factor for 13 consecutive years. Both sets are not normally distributed and therefore, correlation should be assessed by Spearman's correlation. But "cross-correlation analysis" in SPSS 16, checks correlation in lags by Pearson's method. SPSS does not have any option to choose the method for cross-correlation. what can I do to obtain Spearman's rho for lags?
