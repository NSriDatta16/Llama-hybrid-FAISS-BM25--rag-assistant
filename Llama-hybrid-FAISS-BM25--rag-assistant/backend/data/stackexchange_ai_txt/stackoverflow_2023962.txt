Organising .libs in a codebase of several C++ projects

Let's say you have several bespoke C++ projects in separate repositories or top-level directories in the same repository. Maybe 10 are library projects for stuff like graphics, database, maths, etc and 2 are actual applications using those libraries. What's the best way to organise those 2 application projects to have the .libs they need? Each lib project builds the .lib in its own directory, developers have to copy these across to the application area manually and make sure to get the right version Application projects expect lib projects to be in particular paths and look for .libs inside those locations A common /libs directory is used by all projects Something else This is focused on C++, but I think it's pretty similar with other languages, for instance organising JARs in a Java project.
