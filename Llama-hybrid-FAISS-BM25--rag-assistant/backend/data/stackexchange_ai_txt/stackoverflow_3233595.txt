Quite simply a Set is a node based storage entity. In the case of a Set you can implement it as a tree wherein you are not recreating all the edges and the nodes when you "add" an element to the next version of the Set, instead you're just creating a new set of edges. You can do this because the nodes themselves will never change, nor will the objects held within them. The real benefit it's found within single threaded applications but rather in multi-threaded applications. Immutable data structures remove the need for locking mechanisms. If they're never going to change, you don't have to worry about state.
