I had the following issues: 1) I had an incorrect class name in my registration of this assembly in IIS: FtpLogging.FtpLogDemo,FtpLoggingDemo ,version=1.0.0.0,Culture=neutral,PublicKeyToken= 2) I did not closely follow Robert's advice when registering the assembly. I left the checkbox checked, and this kept it as an authentication provider, which this code sample is not. I instead left basic auth enabled, disabled anonymous auth (in my case), and unchecked the box mentioned in the tutorial -- 'Clear the FtpLoggingDemo check box in the providers list.' 3) I was not using AppCmd (or modifying the appropriate section in applicationHost.config directly) to update the custom providers section in applicationHost.config Doing these three things fixed the issue.
