What do you mean to cluster data around a column? You can use standard clustering models, such as k-Means clustering or Gaussian Mixture Models for an exploratory analysis of your dataset. However, I'm not sure this is what you're looking for, please let me know. I often study a new dataset by employing some dimensionality reduction technique. The most common is PCA , but I don't recommend it since it can extract only latent factors that are linearly associated with your variables. You can use t-SNE models (available in sklearn), or, if you are familiar with Deep Learning, with Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction . Once your dataset is compressed/reduced, you can observe how different values-factors are distributed on it. Dimensionality reduction is also very important in case your dataset suffers from high multicollinearity. You can remove duplicates using pandas ' drop_duplicates() function, explained here . Hope this helps, otherwise let me know.
