What is a good report builder (SQL to HTML & Excel) that can add/remove columns, group columns, filter, etc.?

I really like the tool that salesforce has for building reports. You can choose your categories (aka data tables) and then drag and drop columns into your report, arrange columns etc. I am looking for an off-the-shelf product that does the same. Any recommendations? I've attached screen shots of the salesforce tool that has the functionality I want: http://i53.tinypic.com/msokgg.jpg http://i56.tinypic.com/2lkd9ft.jpg
