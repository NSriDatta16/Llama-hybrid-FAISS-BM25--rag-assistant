I don't have a full tutorial for you but here are the first few steps in creating a custom hslider component. Hope it helps. Start by looking at the hslider skin which is made up of 2 parts, a thumb and a track: Now, create a new skin except give it two buttons: Create a new component that extends HSlider and call it something like MultiButtonSlider. Override the partAdded() function and grab a reference to thumb2 when its added. override protected function partAdded(partName:String, instance:Object):void{ if(partName == "thumb2"){ thumb2 = instance as Button; } } Hope this starts you off in the right direction. Don't forget to set the MultiButtonSlider.skinClass = "YourNewSkin" Next steps would be to make it draggable and convert its point to a value. See the HSlider.pointToValue() function.
