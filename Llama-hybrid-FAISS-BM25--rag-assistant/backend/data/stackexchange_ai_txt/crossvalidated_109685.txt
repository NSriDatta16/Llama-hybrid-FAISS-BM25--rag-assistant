Interpreting odds in a logistic regression

I am having some problems interpreting the odds. I run a logistic regression for an out come 'Yes' or 'no'. My reference category is 'No'. I have 2 variables and this are the log(odds) and the odds: Variable A -> It is a integer with values 2 to 80. logodds: -0.014078787; odds: 0.9860199 Variable B -> It is a integer with values 1 to 30. logodds: 0.214099984; odds: 1.2387465 What is a correct statement to interpret these odds? And how do I transform this in real probabilities? I would like to say something like: Every extra point of variable A causes an decrease of x in the probabilities of going from 'No' to 'Yes' If I do exp(coef(model)) /(1+exp(coef(model))) for Variable A I obtain 0.49. This is the probability right? Is it correct to say that each point of variable A makes the probability go down 0.01% I am really confussed about this so would thank any help!
