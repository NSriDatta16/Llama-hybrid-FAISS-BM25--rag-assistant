Once you've created the first exam, there are 92 questions that have never been used, and 100 that have. If you now generate another exam, with 100 questions in in it, you are chosing from a set of 92 questions that have never been used, and 100 that have. Clearly you are going to get quite a few duplicates. You would expect to get (100/192) * 100 duplicates, i.e. in any two randomly chosen exams, there will (on average) be 52 duplicate questions. If you want the probability that there are 25, or 75, or whatever, then you have two choices. a) Work out the maths b) Simulate a few runs on a computer
