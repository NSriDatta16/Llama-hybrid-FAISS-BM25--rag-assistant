What is the best way to store text files remotely?

I am building a "document storage" system for storing text files on my server. I was wondering if anybody has any recommendations or best practices on the best way to store text files remotely. The system will be user-based, each user can upload multiple text files. I want the text files to be stored in some fashion which is easy to perform a full-text search. The server I am using is a standard web server, with a multitude of scripting languages, and MySQL database support. Thank you for your help!
