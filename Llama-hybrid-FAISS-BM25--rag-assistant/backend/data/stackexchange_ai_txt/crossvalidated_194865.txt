Which test statistic to use to test for cross-sectional dependence in panel data (R, plm)?

I would like to test for cross-sectionally dependent residuals in my panelmodel (pooled). I found pcdtest() in plm package and tried pcdtest(mod, test="cd") , which yielded p = 0.03845. However, pcdtest(mod, test="lm") gave me p = 0.2266. According to plm documentation test="cd" uses Pesaran's CD statistic, while test="lm" uses Breusch/Pagan's LM statistic. What is the difference between test="lm" and test="cd" , in practical terms?
