IBM is a very large development organization with 5 separate and distinct software brands and many many products in each so to ask whether the entire organization still uses Dojo or not may a bit misleading. It could be the case that a certain team or product has stopped using Dojo but I can definitely tell you many still do. Aside from still being listed as a Dojo sponsor and contributor on the Dojo Foundation's website: there are active and very recent developments going on around Dojo. One very interesting thing is JDojo, essentially a translator that lets you write Dojo in Java that then gets translated thus giving you strong typing and Eclipse IDE features. You can check out its wiki page here: https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/JDojo (registration required) or google some blog posts or twitter (can't post links yet on this account)
