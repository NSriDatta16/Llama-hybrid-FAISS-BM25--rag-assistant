in Flex Apps

I am learning flex and have written a little app with a TextArea that had data getting populated dynamically by embedding simple HTML (mostly for font styles) I ran into a weird issue when I wanted to include images, the images in this case are small arrows as in reddit.com. My desired aligmnent is, ------------- o | foo bar | ffdfdfdf | fdfd ------------- o | dfdd ------------- Where o in the first column is an image. Note that the borders are invisible. I just used a simple and works perfectly if I view the resulting HTML in a browser. However flash renders the table in a very screwed manner, I get something like this instead -------------- o fooooooo ffffdfdf fdfd ------------- o fff -------------- If the second line has more than one line, the subsequent lines wrap around the first column. Is this a known problem?
