The reason is that the Page.Load event fires before any response has been sent to the client; so any instructions for the client (such as executing your javascript) doesn't occur until the client receives the response. So... placing the long-running task in Page.Load won't have the effect you want. This sounds like a case for using AJAX or some other form of asynchronous data-retrieval. In this scenario the page you return to the client doesn't containt he result of your long-running task--so the page itself (with it's spinner) loads quickly, then the client requests the data; when the data is ready (10-15 seconds later) you can update the DOM in the client with the results.
