Time series forecasting. How use future values

I have a time series dataset containing hourly data from a few year, like below. Let's assume that I want to make prediction for the next 3 hours (2021-01-01 19:00, 2021-01-01 20:00, 2021-01-01 21:00). The output from model (e.g. LSTM) is the following sequence: [Feature_1(t+1), Feature_1(t+2), Feature_1(t+3)]. One of the features of my training data is weather data. Date Feature_1 Weather_feature 2019-01-01 15:00 value(t0) value(t0) 2019-01-01 16:00 value(t0) value(t0) .... ... ... 2021-01-01 18:00 value(t0) value(t0) Can I use data, that I already know in my model? I would like to use the weather forecast for the next hours to improve my predctions. For example at 2021-01-01 18:00 i know value Feature_1 and Weather_feature in time t(0) but also i know already Weather_feature in (t+1) , (t+2) , (t+3) . How can i use it in the model? At the moment, this is what one training sample looks like: [[Feature_1(t-n), Weather_feature(t-n)]...[Feature_1(t-1),Weather_feature(t-1), [Feature_1(t0), Weather_feature(t0)]]
