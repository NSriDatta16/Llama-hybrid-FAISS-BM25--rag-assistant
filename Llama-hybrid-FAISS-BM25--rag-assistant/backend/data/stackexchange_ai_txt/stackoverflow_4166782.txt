You can use a php rule for the allowed values array of your node reference field, which I think in your case would need to run a quick query for all the nodes made by the current user. I have not tested this code, but it should be reasonably close to what you're after if I have understood the question! global $user; //make sure we have access to the user //find all the job organisation nodes made by this user //(replace organisation with the actual name of your content type) $query = db_query("select nid from {node} where type = 'organisation' and uid = %d", $user->uid); //put the results in the values array $values = array() while($result = db_fetch_result($query)){ $values[] = $result; }
