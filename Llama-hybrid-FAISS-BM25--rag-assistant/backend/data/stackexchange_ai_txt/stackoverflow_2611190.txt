The "web module deployment descriptor fragment" (aka web-fragment.xml) introduced by the Servlet 3.0 specification would be nice here. The specification defines it as: A web fragment is a logical partitioning of the web app in such a way that the frameworks being used within the web app can define all the artifacts without asking devlopers to edit or add information in the web.xml. Java EE 6 is maybe not an option for you right now though. Still, it would to be the standardized solution.
