Regarding your code: You don't have to override the Mage_Customer_Model_Entity_Setup because this class is only used to install the customer attributes. The solution is to have your own setup class that inherits from the Mage_Customer_Model_Entity_Setup. You also need a mysql4-install setup file To see exactly how to add new attributes to customer see this magento module I've made: https://code.google.com/p/magento-code-snippets/source/browse/#svn/trunk/PWS_ExtCustomerFields
