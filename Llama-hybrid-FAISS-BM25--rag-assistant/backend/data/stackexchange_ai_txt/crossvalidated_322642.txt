Neural Network is one of the black box models that would not give "easy to understand" rules / or what has been learned. Specifically, what has been learned are the parameters in the model, but the parameters can be large: hundreds of thousands of the parameters is very normal. In addition, it is also not clear on the important features learned, you can understand the model uses all the features, with many complicated operations to derive the results, where not easy to say in plain English how the model transform each feature use it. In fact, the one layer neural network (without hidden layer) with logistic function as activation function is identical to logistic regression. Logistic regression is very rich in interpretations. Here is one example. But with complex neural network / more hidden layers, such interpretation will not apply.
