Forecasting a transformed time series

I have fitted a seasonal ARIMA model using R to a log transformed times series which I called lnseries. I can forecast fine for the transformed time series ( lnseries ) storing the ARIMA model (which I called fit ) then using the command: $\texttt{plot(forecast(fit))},$ this shows me the forecast and 95% confidence interval. But I'm stuck on how to get the actual original time series forecast plot using this model. Help anyone!?
