LINQ DBML isn't letting me insert, update, delete or select data from any tables? Why?

I've created a DBML file for a LINQ to SQL mapping and after dragging all of my tables into the designer surface. In the properties of each table, the "Delete", "Insert" and "Update" are grayed out so they're not editable like they're disabled. I'm not sure why this is. Does anyone know how to make it so that I can insert, update and delete the values inside of those tables? I also know that I have write permission because I've already written to these tables on the same User ID.
