I'm not very familiar with Android development, but I think I may be able to help. As far as running HTTP Requests, you can obviously do that. I recommend the third party library ASIHTTPRequest for that. This library is very flexible and can help simplify the requests. For local storage, you have a few options. You can use Core Data (which is the closest thing to a database, short of SQLite) or NSUserDefaults , depending on what you want to store. You can also use NSKeyedArchiver to write objects to disk as files. As far as making HTTPRequests in the background, this is limited by certain factors. See this document fo r more information. Basically, your app can request up to ten minutes of background time, after which it must stop.
