It's not clear to me what it means, in words, for Z1,Z2,â€¦,Zn to be conditionally independent (on Y). It means that given $Y=y$ all your $Z_i's $ are statistically independent of each other. Otherwise they could be correlated. An example could be : Suppose there is an algorithm which classifies if an image has a car in it or not. Every time it runs on a bunch of images you generate a score for it represented by the variable $Z_i$ . Let $Y$ be 1 if the algorithm learns over time after knowing the correct results (a reinforcement machine learning kind of an algorithm) and let $Y$ be 0 otherwise. Now given $Y=0$ you really won't expect your algorithm to improve in performance over time, or in other words $Z_1$ wouldn't have much to say about $Z_2$ . However, for a reinforcement type of an algorithm (when $Y=1 $ ), you would expect the scores to improve over time in general $Z_1 is more likely compared to $Z_{1000} . Hence conditional on $Y=0$ , $ \quad Z_i's$ are independent.
