I realise this question is from a while ago, but I recently read this article as well and have a slightly different answer. As often happens when scientific research is "translated" into pop-science-y articles, there has been a misunderstanding. The original paper reads as such: "The average size of an [speed-dating] event is approximately 22 men and 22 women...Striking gender differentials in proposal behavior are observed in the data. In line with sexual selection theory (Trivers 1972; Buss 2003), women are much choosier than men. On average, women select 2.6 men and see 45 percent of their proposals matched, while men propose to 5 women and their proposals are matched in only 20 percent of the cases." We can see here (and in the following table) that the paper authors intended that the 45% of matched proposals for women and 20% of matched proposals for men is an empirical fact, and not a statistical one. Statistically speaking, if each of 22 women goes on a date with each of 22 men, and each woman makes two offers, there are two main scenarios I can envision: (1) Proposals are given purely randomly. This means that if a woman proposes to two men, and each man proposes to five women, the chances that she will be accepted (by either person) is: 2*(5/22) = 45% (Actually it should be 2.6 proposals, but let's use the figures from the BBC article). The chances that any of a man's proposals will be accepted is the same, since both parties have to reciprocate, and under this model, selection is independent and random. (2) Proposals are not given purely randomly. Then, we need to have some more demographic and selection information to know how to calculate these probabilities. No matter how you look at it, the BBC article is incomplete and misleading at best. The quoted percentages are empirical, not statistical, as the text would have you believe.
