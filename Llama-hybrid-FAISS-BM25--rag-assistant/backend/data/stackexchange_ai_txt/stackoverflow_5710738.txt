How can I refactor this ForEach(..) code to use Parallel.ForEach(..)?

i've got a list of objects which I wish to copy from one source to another. It was suggested that I could speed things up by using Parallel.ForEach How can I refactor the following pseduo code to leverage Parallel.ForEach(..) ? var foos = GetFoos().ToList(); foreach(var foo in foos) { CopyObjectFromOldBucketToNewBucket(foo, oldBucket, newBucket, accessKeyId, secretAccessKey); } CopyObjectFromOldBucketToNewBucket uses the Amazon REST APIs to move items from one bucket to another. Cheers :)
