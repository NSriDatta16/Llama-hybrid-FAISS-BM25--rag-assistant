Javascript and ASP create dynamic folders more elegantly

I have written the following script below - I am not quite happy with the script as I think it could be written in a more elegant and dynamic way... I am using ftp.exe to ftp files from my application to another server. If the folder structure does not exists on the web site. I need to create the folder stucture... and doing it this way mkdir folder1 mkdir folder1/folder2 mkdir folder1/folder2/folder3 with the script below I cater for a few folder lengths but not unlimited... so the solution will only work up to a certain amount of sub folders . ftpmkdirlength = ftpmkdir.split('/').length-1 var i=0; for (i=0;i How can I make it more dynamic? so that the script see how many folders the input contains... I can see the folders full length and get the folder like this /folder1/folder2/folder3 but need to strip it to folder1 folder1/folder2/ folder1/folder2/folder3/ and then create it...
