No, the fact that you have a large studentized residual does not necessarily mean that the observation is an outlier . (Although some define outlier as simply a large residual, in which case it would be by definition.) "Influential" is somewhat ambiguous. One could think of leverage as a measure of influence, or of DFbeta as a measure of influence, and neither of these will track Cook's distance perfectly. Thus, Cook's distance is not necessarily the same as influence; but I imagine that you are using them as synonymous, which may be a reasonable thing to do in some context. In that case, Cook's distance does measure influence, but that is tautological. Yes, a case can have $0$ leverage (if $x_i=\bar x$), and have any size residual. It may help you to read my answer here: Interpreting plot.lm() .
