Correlating two variables at different levels

Imaginary example, but should work well for the purpose of this question: I'm doing a simple linear regression (or a correlation, with 1 IV and 1 DV) for 2 variables, for example the number of steps in the staircase vs reported satisfaction of achieving the top by participants. Let's say I'm taking 4 different staircases into account: 3-steps; 5-steps; 10-steps; and 50-steps high. The point is, this isn't a categorical, but a ratio scale (ignore the other problems with this sample of staircases, such as far-from-normal distribution, etc). Now, let's say I have 10 participants climbing these staircases in random order each, and reporting their satisfaction in a number from 1 to 7. There are 2 ways to analyse this data. One would be to average responses for each staircase. So say we get the results: 3-steps: 1.6 5-steps: 2.3 10-steps: 3.4 50-steps: 6.1 Our scatterplot would be very simple: But maybe averaging the results is unnecessary and kills the variation in the data? We could leave the raw scores as they were and then plot them, like this: How we approach it also affects Person's r (or Spearman's rho since we had non-normal distribution of stair number). Obviously degrees of freedom (and therefore p values) also change. Is there a one-and-always-true definite answer to how this should be done?
