Is L1(a,b) <= L1(c, d) if and only if L2(a,b) <= L2(c, d)? L1 vs L2

I am doing machine learning and in one stage, I have to measure tensor vector differences to find the minimum distance . Lets say I have a set of linear tensors with dimension 100. I want to find a best pair, which in this case is a pair with minimum distances from each other. So, I have to find two tensors a and b that are closest ones to each other i.e. d(a,b)
