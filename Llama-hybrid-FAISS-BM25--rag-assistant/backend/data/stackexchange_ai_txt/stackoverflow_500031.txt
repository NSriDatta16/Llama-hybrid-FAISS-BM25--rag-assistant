How to split using a prefix character using regular expressions?

I would like to split the example string: ~Peter~Lois~Chris~Meg~Stewie on the character ~ and have the result be Peter Lois Chris Meg Stewie Using a standard string split function in javascript or C# the first result is of course an empty string. I'd like to avoid having to ignore the first result because the first result may actually be an empty string. I've been fiddling around with using a regular expression and I'm stumped. I'm sure somebody has come across and elegant solution to this.
