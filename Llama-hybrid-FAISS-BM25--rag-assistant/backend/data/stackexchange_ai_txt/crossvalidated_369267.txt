I would use periodic splines to represent periodic function. Then I would use three of your variables, Month, Day, Hour leaving out Season (Season should be well enough represented by Month). These three periodicities will then be added. Some pseudo-code in R (since we do not have data): library(pbs) # periodic splines basis functions mod.bike If you could post some data we could use that for an example. A worked example can be found here: circular periodic time series or fit with periodic splines
