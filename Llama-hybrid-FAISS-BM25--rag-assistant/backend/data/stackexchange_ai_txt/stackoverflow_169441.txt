I find that they obfuscate the code in all but the simplest of uses. The only use we advocate in our projects are the ones the IDE uses (interface implementations and designer code). The right tools should be used for the right purpose. Code should be written to show intent and function rather than arbitrarily grouping things. Organizing things into access modifier grouping or some other grouping just seems to be illogical. I find the code should be organized in a manner that makes sense for the particular class; after all, there are other tools for viewing class members by access modifier. This is also the case for almost every other use of regions; there is a better way. For example, grouping properties, events, constants or otherwise together doesn't really make sense either as code is generally more maintainable if the things are grouped together by function (as in, a property that uses a constant should be near that constant, not near other unrelated properties just because it's a property).
