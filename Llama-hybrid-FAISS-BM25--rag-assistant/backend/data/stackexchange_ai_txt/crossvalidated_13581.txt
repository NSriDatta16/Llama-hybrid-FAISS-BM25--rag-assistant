Categorising continous data in logistic regression

If a predictor in a logistic regression is not discriminating between 'goods' and 'bads' for most of the range and is discriminating only at higher or lower values (monotonic), should the variable be used as continuous or as a dummy indicating the range in which it is predictive?
