Information bottleneck and deep neural network

I learned about "the information bottleneck view of deep learning." But in a nutshell, what does this tell us? I don't see what the role is of depth in this approach as long as it is larger than 2 or 3. Is there a rigorous theory? Or just some hypothesis or heuristic explanations on deep neural net? I saw the author's talk on YouTube . But, probably my ignorance, I don't really get the main point and the implication is. I can see a lot of explanations on graphs on the video, but honestly, I don't get it. Any comments, suggestions, opinions will be very appreciated.
