Clarification of methods for using non-parametric tests to compare groups- vegan package

I would like to validate my approach to comparing groups using non-parametric tests. data created below describes the structure of my data. Each var. corresponds to the average concentration of a substance that was measured in an individual ( ID ) that was randomly sampled from a population of interest ( Loc ): set.seed(123) data The data frame created above serves only to explain the structure of my data, and allow me to demonstrate how I am doing this analysis (you will not get the same answers I am describing in my questions by using this data, but the process I am using can be replicated with it). My goal is to determine which locations ( Loc s) can be differentiated based on the concentrations of these substances, and which substances are contributing to those differences. The substance data does not meet the assumptions required of parametric tests, and my real data set is fairly unbalanced (samples per Loc range from n=6 to n=17). Therefore to answer my questions I have been learning to use the vegan package in R to conduct non-parametric tests, much of which is relatively new to me, which is why I am seeking validation. To perform a PERMANOVA, I started by using the vegdist function to create the distance matrix using Euclidean distance: vars Next I used the adonis() function to fit the model, and viewed the results via aov.tab : mod The results were significant, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between at least two Loc s in either dispersion or location of their centroids. To rule out over-dispersion I used the betadisper() function to calculate the average distance of each group to the groups centroid, and used both an anova and a permutation test to look for differences: betad The dissimilarity coefficients did not produce any principle coordinate axes with negative eigenvalues, and both tests gave insignificant results (p Loc s. To further support this idea, I used an anosim on the dissimilarity matrix, which compared the average-ranked dissimilarities between the Loc s to the average-ranked dissimilarities within the Loc s: aosim(dmat, data$Loc) These results came back significant (p>0.05), further suggesting differences between the Loc s in terms of substances. I believe that up to this point I have done everything correctly (correct me if I am wrong, or should have done something differently). What I am really not sure about is the appropriate next steps to take in order to determine where these differences exist. If I were doing a parametric MANOVA, the next thing I would probably do is conduct univariate ANOVAs to compare Loc s using each individual var . But in this situation, it is very unclear to me what the appropriate next step would be with a categorical grouping variable and continuous predictors. What can I use to further examine where these differences exist?
