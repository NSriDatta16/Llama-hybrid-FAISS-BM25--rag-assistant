The TeachingDemos package for R has a couple of functions that may help: Predict.Plot and TkPredict . These will take a fitted model object and plot the relationship between one of the predictor variables conditional on the other predictors and the response variable. You can then change the values of the other predictors to see how the relationship changes. This is not the same as "independent" of the other predictors, but could end up being more meaningful. This does not show residuals, but as you mention, the residuals don't make much sense in a logistic regression.
