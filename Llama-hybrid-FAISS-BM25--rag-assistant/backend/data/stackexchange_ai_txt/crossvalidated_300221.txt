Compare quarterly time series with another annually time series

I have the following time series: 1) Criminality series in UK (for example, theft) every quarter year. 2) Refugee count in UK every year. I would like to compare both series to identify if the entrance of refugee are statistically increasing the number of the criminality levels in UK. How can I go on with the comparison? EDIT The data is adjusted, thanks to IrishStat answer (Cubic Spline method). Main problem is going through the comparison, if you have any other suggestion please feel free to comment! Expected results: according to Becker (1968) and Elrich (1996) criminality study, the entrance of low income refugees with relatively lower scholarity than UK population would increase crime in the region.
