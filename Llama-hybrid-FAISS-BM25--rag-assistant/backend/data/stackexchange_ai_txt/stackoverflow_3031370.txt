Whenever you hear "scaling", think "proportions": You can set up a proportion, here: old width new width --------- = -------- old font new font 567 768 ---- = ----- 7 x 567*x = 5376 x = 9.48 So your new font is about 9.48, or 9 if you only want integers. Alternatively, you could also use the height-to-height proportion in your calculations instead of width-to-width. Or use the average font height you'd get from doing either. Or do old_area/old_font^2 = new_area/new_font^2 If you want a way to find the scaling factor for any arbitrary new width: old width new width --------- = -------- old font new font 567 w ---- = --- 7 x 567*x = 7*w x = (7/567) * w Given your new w (or h, or w/e), the new font size is (7/567) * w
