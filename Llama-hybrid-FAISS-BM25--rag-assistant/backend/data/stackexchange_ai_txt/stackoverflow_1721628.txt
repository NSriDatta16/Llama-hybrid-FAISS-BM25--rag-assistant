Decision making and prioritising When aiming for validation across a large site it can be good to start off with a prioritisation task. This will give you some time to find out which pages in the site are most often accessed, what do your real users use, and given that, which of those are used the most and would benefit from being made valid first. Validation is a requirement to my mind, however being pragmatic in a business context is also of high value. Do you know how much time you want to spend initially working on validating your website code? and given the time you've allocated, knowing which parts to start with will give you a real head start. Estimating If your team arn't used to writing valid code and have never undertaken a validation task, estimating is going to be hard for them. You can however estimate in terms of complexity points which will then give you more visibility and transparency to offer the business bods. Ad-Hoc Get used to correcting errors as you go. Have each developer on your team fix up 2 errors for each page they work on, each time they work on them. Over time, you'll end up with a nicely validating website and combined with an initial revamp, this is a great way to keep pages valid, keep developers on top of validation and saves a lot of time in the future.
