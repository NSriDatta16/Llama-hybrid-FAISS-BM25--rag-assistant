I don't know if this will work as I have never tried it, but I think it might. Start by subclassing the MKMapView. Then, override all the touch handlers (e.g. touchesBegan:withEvent:, touchesEnded:withEvent:, etc...). In the overridden touch handlers do a bounds check on the current region being displayed on the mapview. If it is at (or maybe really close) to the edge of the area you want to show, then don't do anything with the touch event. Otherwise, just pass the touch event to the super classes implementation of the method. If this works, let me know.
