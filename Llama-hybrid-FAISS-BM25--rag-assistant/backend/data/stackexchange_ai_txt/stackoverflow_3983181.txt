raw text storage vs text parsing (BBCODE(PHP))

Im making my little site where users can create blogs, and have studied publishing tools like wordpress and vbulletin. When a user creates a post with BBcodes/mark up language, should i parse it into HTML and insert in db, and then only echo the text for the user, or should insert it with bbcode in the db, and let the php page parse it from bbcode to proper html? lets just say i have 2000 visitors at one given time, what is the best method? can it not be tough for the server if 2000 pages has to be loaded where 200kb of text needs to be formatted from bbcode to html
