Simple: you use it. That may sound trite but there is no substitute for learning something new in programming than trying to do something with it. As in writing code. If it's really new, you might start by taking an existing program and modifying it to do something you want. This will usually break it and you'll spend the next 2 hours working out why. In that 2 hours you'll have learnt more about the basics of program structure (in that language/framework), how a program is put to together and so on than 5 times that long reading it from a book. Not that I'm suggesting books are worthless: far from it. But programming is ultimately a pragmatic discipline.
