In Python 2.x, just use the ord and chr functions: >>> ord('c') 99 >>> ord('c') + 1 100 >>> chr(ord('c') + 1) 'd' >>> Python 3.x makes this more organized and interesting, due to its clear distinction between bytes and unicode. By default, a "string" is unicode, so the above works ( ord receives Unicode chars and chr produces them). But if you're interested in bytes (such as for processing some binary data stream), things are even simpler: >>> bstr = bytes('abc', 'utf-8') >>> bstr b'abc' >>> bstr[0] 97 >>> bytes([97, 98, 99]) b'abc' >>> bytes([bstr[0] + 1, 98, 99]) b'bbc'
