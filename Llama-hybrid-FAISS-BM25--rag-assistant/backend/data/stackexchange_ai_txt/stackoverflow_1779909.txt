If you are limited to polynomials (which appears to be the case), there would basically be three steps: Parse the input string into a list of coefficients to x^n Take that list of coefficients and convert them into a new list of coefficients according to the rules for deriving a polynomial. Take the list of coefficients for the derivative and create a nice string describing the derivative polynomial function. If you need to handle polynomials like a*x^15125 + x^2 + c , using a dict for the list of coefficients may make sense, but require a little more attention when doing the iterations through this list.
