First off, getting an MD5 or CRC32 from data size of GB is going to be painfully expensive computationally. Probably better to avoid that. How about store the data in a file, and index the filename? If you insist, though, my suggestion is still to just store the hash, not the entire data value, with a lookup array/table to the final data location. Safeness of this approach (non-unique possibility) will vary directly with the number of large samples. The longer the hash you create -- 32bit vs 64bit vs 1024bit, etc -- the safer it gets, too. Most any dictionary system in a programming language, or a database engine, will have a binary data storage mechanism. Failing that, you could store a string of the Hex value corresponding to the hashed number in a char column.
