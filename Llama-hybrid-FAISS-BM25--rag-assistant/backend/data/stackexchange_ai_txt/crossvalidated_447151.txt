Neural network model that ouputs how similar a new input is to the previously trained ones for curiosty-based learning techniques

I don't find where to ask this or if this is too basic or complex to be solved, here is my question: Is there a NN model like a CNN where you would recursively input images and get a single output telling how similar is that new image compared to the ones processed in past batches? An example would be: You feed de model with images of furry animals till some point the last inputed images give a value of 1.0 as they are similar and share features, then you input a picture of a house and the model would give a very low value like 0.001 telling you it doesn't recognise many features in common. Ideally this model would evolve in a Long short-term memory way meaning that after you input new kind of images, returning to the example mentioned before, after thousand of images of houses processed it would again return a low value if inputed a cat or dog image.
