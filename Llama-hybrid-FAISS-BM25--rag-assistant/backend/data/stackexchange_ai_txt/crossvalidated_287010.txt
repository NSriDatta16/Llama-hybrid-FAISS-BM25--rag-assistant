Visually comparing hierarchical clusterings

I'm working with a computational model. The model demonstrates the behaviour of a several sub metabolic systems (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J) of a bacteria. I cluster these sub systems based on their behaviour. The dendrogram for this is in the left side. Then I do some modifications to the model and re-cluster the sub systems (left side). I'm using the same method to cluster both cases (complete linkage). The changes introduced to the model does have an impact on the behaviour and the improved model's behaviour is slightly higher (~0.1) compared to the old model. I used the FM index to compare the two dendrograms but it says the dendrograms are similar. I believe it is due to the slight change in the values before and after modification. But the dendrograms are clearly different. Therefore I need to compare the dendrograms visually. Would it be correct, if I were to say the following? The height axis represents the average distance between all inter-cluster pairs. In the min-growth dendrogram the distance between inter-clusters are not that strong. Meaning there is no clear grouping. But in the enhanced- growth dendrogram the distance between the clusters are large, the clusters are well separated. Hence the two models are different.
