fitting specific formula/model in r - model possibly not identifiable

I would like to fit the following formula in R: y ~ alpha *(x1_0 * x2_0 * beta_0 + x1_1 * x2_1 * beta_1) Here: alpha , beta_0 and beta_1 are parameters to be found. IVs are: x1_0 , x2_0 , x1_1 and x2_1 (there are actually more - _n indicates lag as it is more or less time series data). My first thought is to use nls but I am also wondering if this formula/model is actually identifiable? Thanks!
