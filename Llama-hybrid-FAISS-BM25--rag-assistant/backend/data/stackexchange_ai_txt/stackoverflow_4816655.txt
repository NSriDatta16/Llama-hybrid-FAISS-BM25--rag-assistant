You believe the Facebook class has a certain method but Python is sure it hasn't. Why? Maybe you misspelled the method name, maybe you did not get the indentation right - hard to say without seeing the code. You could try poking around to validate your assumptions: import facebook import logging logging.warn('Facebook class: %r', dir(facebook.Facebook)) logging.warn('facebook module: %r', dir(facebook)) If you are sure you are operating on the correct file, the you should expect to see check_connect_session as a method of Facebook. If you didn't add enough indentation then you expect to see check_connect_method as a function defined in the facebook module. Too much indentation would make check_connect_method a sub function of which ever method precedes it and it won't show up in the above logging. Pay close attention to indentation. However, a better way to add some custom methods might be: import facebook class Facebook(facebook.Facebook): def check_connect_session(request): pass facebookapi = Facebook(API_KEY, SECRET) if not facebookapi.check_connect_session(...): ... Now when Facebook update their code you simply copy the new file into place - no need to merge your customisations.
