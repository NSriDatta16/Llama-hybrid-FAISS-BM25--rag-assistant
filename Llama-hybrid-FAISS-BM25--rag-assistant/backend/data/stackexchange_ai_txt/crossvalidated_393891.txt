Statistical analysis for quasi-experiments

This is my first message on this forum. I hope I am not doing any mistake. I must analyze data obtained after a quasi-experiment and I am not sure how to proceed. The experiment has been carried out in a hospital service where the medical staff has introduced new medical procedures. We would like to assess if after that: - the frequency at which a diagnostic test is carried out has evolved ; - the frequency of some binary health outcomes has changed. --> The data have been collected at the individual level, during one month before the intervention (around 70 patients) and during one month after the intervention (around 70 different patients = not repeated data). There is no control group. Considering the patient profiles may have changed between the two periods, I was thinking to carry out logistic regressions (adjusted on covariates) for the different parameters of interest. I was however wondering if a Poisson regression might not be an alternative? I also read about interrupted time series. Could it be relevant for this study (knowing the pre/post periods are rather short)?
