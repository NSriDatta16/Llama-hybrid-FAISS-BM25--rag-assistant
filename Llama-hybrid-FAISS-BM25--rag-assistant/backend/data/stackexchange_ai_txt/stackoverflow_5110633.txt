I found the problem! I had the code for creating the directory in the wrong place. It was under the If statement for Zip Code Matching and would only execute if the zip code was a match and the zip code is an optional field in the search. I moved all the code under the TransferFile Method and it worked fine. Also the data's source directory had to be pointing to C:\Documents and Settings\bmccarthy\Desktop\sourcedir AND the files had to be in a special format under a subdirectory of that directory at C:\Documents and Settings\bmccarthy\Desktop\sourcedir\AMLDailyHotLeads20101001 Here's the rewritten code: // Copy the file if ANY of the search criteria have been met if (found) { m_form.Invoke(m_form.m_DelegateAddString, new Object[] {"FOUND: Order_No: " + Order_No + " barcode: " + barcode + " MailerCode: " + MailerCode + " AgentID: " + AgentID + " City: " + City + " State: " + State + " ZIP: " + ZIP}); //passes values to TransferFile TransferFile(directory, barcode, AgentID, ZIP); } } // end for that finds each matching record } // find and copy the file to the target directory string ZIP private void TransferFile(string sourceDir, string filename, string AgentID, string ZIP) { string fullFileName = filename + ".pdf"; string fullFileNameAndPath = sourceDir + "\\" + fullFileName; string targetFileAndPath; // adds the given lead's agentid and zip code to the targetpath string string targetzipdir = m_sc.get_TargetPath() + "\\" + AgentID + "\\" + ZIP; // If the given lead's zip code subdirectory doesn't exist, create it. if (!Directory.Exists(targetzipdir)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(targetzipdir); } targetFileAndPath = m_sc.get_TargetPath() + "\\" + AgentID + "\\" + ZIP + "\\" + fullFileName; // Copy the file if the source file exists if (File.Exists(fullFileNameAndPath)) { m_form.Invoke(m_form.m_DelegateAddString, new Object[] {"COPYING FROM: " + fullFileNameAndPath}); m_form.Invoke(m_form.m_DelegateAddString, new Object[] {"TO: " + targetFileAndPath}); // Copy the file and over-write the target file if it exists File.Copy(fullFileNameAndPath, targetFileAndPath, true); } else { m_form.Invoke(m_form.m_DelegateAddString, new Object[] {"Source file does not exist: " + fullFileNameAndPath}); } m_form.Invoke(m_form.m_DelegateAddString, new Object[] {""}); }
