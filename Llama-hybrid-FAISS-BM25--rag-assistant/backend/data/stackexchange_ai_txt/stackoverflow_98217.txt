The heap size depends on the allocator used. There might also be some Windows API call that limits the amount of memory a process can allocate, but I'm not aware of one and I don't feel like looking for it right now, sorry. But in general, if you write your own allocator (maybe just wrap around the compiler-provided malloc() or new operator) you can artificially limit the heap size that way. Alternatively, if you have your own allocator, even if just a wrapper, you can keep track of how much memory has been allocated in total. If you know the amount available you can just do some subtraction and be done with getting the total. You might also be able to get fragmentation statistics then, like largest free block.
