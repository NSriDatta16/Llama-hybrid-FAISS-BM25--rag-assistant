I have the same question but for NLP. Unfortunately, the internet is packed with a lot of conventional multi-label classifications but nothing for realistic scenarios. I found these links https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/3465/multi-label-classification-with-non-binary-outputs , https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/32132/multi-label-classification-on-non-binary-labels-with-pytorch , that may come in handy for your case
