One way I can think of is using matrix condition number . According to Wikipedia: In the field of numerical analysis, the condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument. This is used to measure how sensitive a function is to changes or errors in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input. ... In linear regression the condition number can be used as a diagnostic for multicollinearity.[1][2] [1] Belsley, David A.; Kuh, Edwin; Welsch, Roy E. (1980). "The Condition Number". Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity. New York: John Wiley & Sons. pp. 100â€“104. ISBN 0-471-05856-4. [2] Pesaran, M. Hashem (2015). "The Multicollinearity Problem". Time Series and Panel Data Econometrics. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 67â€“72 [p. 70]. ISBN 978-0-19-875998-0. Here is a toy example: > set.seed(0) > x=runif(100) > A1=cbind(x,x+runif(100)*1e-8) > A2=cbind(x,2*x) > kappa(A1) [1] 329716417 > kappa(A2) [1] 5.742016e+15
