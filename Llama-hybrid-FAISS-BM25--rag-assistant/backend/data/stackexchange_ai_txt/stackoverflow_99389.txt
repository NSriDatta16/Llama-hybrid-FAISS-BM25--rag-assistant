Is there a good reference on how java executes bytecode?

I'm interested in how java organizes memory and executes code (like what gets put in the stack or the heap), from the start of main, to assigning variables, calling functions, passing parameters, returning values, instantiating objects, etc. Has anyone found a good, beginner-friendly article/reference on it?
