UIWebView delay in loading local content

I'm displayed a small amount of local content in a UIWebView, roughly 3 paragraphs of text and one 100x100px image. When the UIWebView is pushed onto to the nav controller, it takes about half a second before the content is displayed. This occurs on the device, not in the simulator. Obviously the UIWebView needs to do some work before displaying the content, but is there some way I can do this before the pushed view appears? I have not had any luck doing this myself. Here is where I'm creating and pushing the view controller which contains the UIWebView: ArticleViewController* viewController = [[ArticleViewController alloc] init]; viewController.article = article; [viewController view]; //touch the view so it gets loaded [viewController loadWebView]; //load the web view content [self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES]; [viewController release]; And here is the loadWebView method: -(void)loadWebView { NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]; NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path]; NSString* content = article.content; NSString *html = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"\ body {font-family: helvetica; color: black; font-size: 10pt; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px} \ %@ ", content]; [self.webView loadHTMLString:html baseURL:baseURL]; } Previously I had [viewController loadWebView] in the viewDidLoad method, but the result seems to be the same. A blank screen when the viewController is pushed, followed by the content loading half a second later. Any ideas?
