Well... It looks like you have three options. In your batch file, issue a tf get at each directory branch you want. reorganize your solution so that all of the dependencies are under the same root path. Use the visual way of right clicking on the loaded project and issuing the get command. The only time it's actually solution aware is when the project is loaded in the IDE; or when it's loaded by the build servers.
