Greasemonkey & http-on-modify-request

I'm researching on writing some JavaScript code that tampers with HTTP POST requests and responses. Since the code I want to write is largely a proof-of-concept, a Firefox extension is too much I think (plus I would prefer to not deal with all that wrapping and over-SSL restrictions). I wondered then if I could write it as a Greasemonkey script. My question therefore is this: Can you use Mozilla's event observers (http-on-modify-request etc) under Greasemonkey ? Please have in mind that I learned what JavaScript is 10 minutes ago and I don't have any experience in that domain. However I believe this is within my skills and with a little research and stubbornness I can implement it. Though I worry about trying to make something work in an impossible way. Thanks! George.
