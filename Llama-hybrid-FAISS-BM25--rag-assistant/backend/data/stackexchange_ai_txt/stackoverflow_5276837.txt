Special End-line characters/string from lines read from text file, using Python

I need to read lines from a text file but, where the 'end of line' caracter is not always \n or \x or a combination and may be any combination of characters like 'xyz' or '|', but the 'end of line' is always the same and known for each type of file. As the text file may be a big one and I have to keep performances and memory usage in mind what seems to be the best solution ? Today I use a combinaison of string.read(1000) and split(myendofline) or partition(myendofline) but I would know if a more elegant and standard solution exists.
