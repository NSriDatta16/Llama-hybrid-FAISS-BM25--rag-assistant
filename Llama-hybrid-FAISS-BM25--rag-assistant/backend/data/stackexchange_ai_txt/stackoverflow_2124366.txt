The issue was file permissions. This was a file that came from a zip sent to me via e-mail. I dragged the folder out of the zip and moved it into place, which was probably the worst I could do. The files were individually blocked and encrypted (they turned up green) so the UrlRouteModule wouldn't treat them as files that existed and would instead insist that they're Action methods. I should have "unblocked" the zip file before starting to copy the assets in it.
