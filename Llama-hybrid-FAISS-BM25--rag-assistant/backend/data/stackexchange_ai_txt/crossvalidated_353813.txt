It is possible for $D_{m,n}$ to be zero: this will happen when the K-S test is applied to two identical datasets (up to permutation). Since $S_m \in \{0, 1/m, 2/m, \ldots, 1\}$ and $S_n\in\{0,1/n,2/n, \ldots, 1\},$ wouldn't it be enough to say that the sample space is a subset of the set of their absolute differences? A function to do this could be written in R with a single line, function(m,n) unique(c(outer(0:m, 0:n, function(i,j) abs(i*n-j*m)))) / (m*n) outer generates all ordered pairs $(i,j)$ in $\{0,1,\ldots, m\}\times \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$ and for each one computes $|in-jm|.$ c flattens this from a matrix to an array and unique converts that to the set of its elements (in some arbitrary order). The final division by /(m*n) yields all the the distinct values $$\frac{|in-jm|}{mn}= \left| \frac{i}{m} - \frac{j}{n} \right|.$$ You could sort these (using sort ) if you like. Remove the $0$ when $m\ne n,$ too, if that helps. By leaving off the final /(m*n) you will generate the numerators of all the fractions, producing exact results (at least when $mn$ doesn't overflow the long integer storage mode in R ) if that's desired.
