Question about the proof of independence of $\bar Y$ and $S^2$ for normal random samples

For an i.i.d. sample of size $n$ from a normal distribution $Y_1,...,Y_n$ , the proof below shows that $\bar Y$ and $S^2$ are independent. My confusion comes from the fact that the author defines $U = B^T Y$ , and the fact that $U = a + B^TY$ has distribution $N(a+B^T\mu, B^T\Omega B)$ (shown earlier in the book). In the very last equation, the author uses the fact that $B^TB = I_n$ (stated in the second paragraph) to show that $\sum_{j=1}^nY_j^2=Y^TY=Y^TB^TBY=U^TU$ . This seems to imply that $U = BY$ and not $B^TY$ ?
