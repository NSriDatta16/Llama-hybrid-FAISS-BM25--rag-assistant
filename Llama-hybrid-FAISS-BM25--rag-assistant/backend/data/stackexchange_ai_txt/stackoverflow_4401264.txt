Display multiple prj site in one view

Suppose I've 3 prj sites which is used to maintain a prj task Prj A Prj B Prj C And in each prj, they have their task Prj A - Task A.1 Prj B - Task B.1 Prj C - Task C.1 Is it possible to have a view which can display all the prj tasks in one view where Gantt view is also supported? I've tried to combine 3 data sources into one. However, I can only use the combined source to create a very fundamental view (just a plain table only). Is there any way to display it in a "traditional prj task" way? Or said in another way, is it possible to change the data source of a Prj task? If so, can I then change the Prj Task data source to my combined data source?
