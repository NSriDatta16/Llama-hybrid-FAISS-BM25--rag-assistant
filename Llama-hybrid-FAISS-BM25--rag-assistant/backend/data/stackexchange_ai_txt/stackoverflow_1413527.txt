You can do the following, which is referred to as a recursive query: WITH y AS ( SELECT x, y, z FROM MyTable WHERE [base_condition] UNION ALL SELECT x, y, z FROM MyTable M INNER JOIN y ON M.[some_other_condition] = y.[some_other_condition] ) SELECT * FROM y You may not need this functionality. I've done the following just to organize my queries better: WITH y AS ( SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE [base_condition] ), x AS ( SELECT * FROM y WHERE [something_else] ) SELECT * FROM x
