Browser downloads jnlp on Java Web Start. How to prevent it?

When I click on a link to "web start" my java application, browser downloads jnlp file which I should execute afterwards. Is there any way to force browser to execute jnlp right after the download completes, or event better, to make the whole process transparent, so user just confirms that he wants to launch the application? Thanks.
