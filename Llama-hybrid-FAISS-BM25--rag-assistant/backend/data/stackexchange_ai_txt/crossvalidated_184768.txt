If you are comparing, say, the sample median, the sample interquartile mean (trimmed mean with 25% of data removed from highest and lowest values) and the sample mean, you have to say what you are trying to do. Otherwise asking which one is better makes no sense at all. If your goal is to estimate the 'center' of a population, you will have to face the problem that these are estimators of DIFFERENT POPULATION PARAMETERS. In this sense, they are not really comparable. For instance, with life expectancies, do you want to estimate the life expectancy that is attained by half of the people? Than you want a median. If you want the average population life expectancy, you'll estimate that with a sample mean. If you want the average life expectancy of the middle 50% of the population, you'll want to estimate it with the interquartile mean. These are not the same value if the population isn't symmetric. With symmetric populations, all of these are, in some sense, estimators of the same parameter (I say, in some sense, because the sample mean isn't a consistent estimator of population center for some really thick tailed distributions). You'd want to pick the one that minimizes some reasonable loss function (variance?) for the distributions you are likely to work with. Under this criterion, we CAN compare the three. In general, the mean uses more of the information in the data than does the trimmed mean, which uses more than the median. On the other hand, the median is extremely robust to errors in the data, the trimmed mean somewhat less so and the mean very susceptible to being ruined by outliers. If your goal is to look for a shift in location for your distribution (for instance, does the life expectancy increase by a fixed amount in one treatment group), you can base comparisons between treatment groups on any measure of center, even if the distribution isn't symmetric. Then you'd select the one that has the lowest variance. It's pretty easy to compare these via simulations (here I'm using the median, mean and the trimmed mean with 40% trimmed from both extremes). Note that these are all symmetric distributions: > sims = matrix(ncol=3,nrow=100000,NA) > colnames(sims) = c("mean","trimmed mean","median") > for(i in 1:100000){ + x = rcauchy(20) + sims[i,1] = mean(x) + sims[i,2] = mean(x,trim=0.4) + sims[i,3] = median(x) + } > # Variances > diag(var(sims)) mean trimmed mean median 1.865621e+06 1.360353e-01 1.397239e-01 > > for(i in 1:100000){ + x = rnorm(20) + sims[i,1] = mean(x) + sims[i,2] = mean(x,trim=0.4) + sims[i,3] = median(x) + } > # Variances > diag(var(sims)) mean trimmed mean median 0.05007671 0.06883245 0.07347544 > > for(i in 1:100000){ + x = rcauchy(20)^3 + sims[i,1] = mean(x) + sims[i,2] = mean(x,trim=0.4) + sims[i,3] = median(x) + } > # Variances > diag(var(sims)) mean trimmed mean median 2.023236e+27 2.045000e-01 1.308861e-01 > For this simulation: For the normal distribution, the mean has a higher variance than the others. For the Cauchy, the trimmed mean is best (variance of mean is actually infinite!), while for the cubed Cauchy, the median beats both of them.
