In your wscript module, you can use the Python standard library's atexit to register callables that you want to be called when the process exit. For example: import atexit import time class MayBeep(object): def __init__(self, deadline=10.0): self.deadline = time.time() + deadline def __call__(self): if time.time() > self.deadline(): print '\7' atexit.register(MayBeep()) ... rest of your wscript module ... Of course you may use something better than print '\7' for beeping purposes (all the way to full-fledged multimedia extravaganzas, depending on what other Python extensions you import and use), but this code answers the Q's title -- "add code that's always executed on exit".
