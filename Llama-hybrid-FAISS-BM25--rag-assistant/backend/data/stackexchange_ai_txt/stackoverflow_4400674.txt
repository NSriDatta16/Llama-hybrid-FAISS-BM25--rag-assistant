htaccess multi rss feed redirection with language variable

I have a multilingual blog, default language is Italian and second language is English. So I have 2 RSS feeds: /feed /feed/?lang=en The first points to Italian the second to English. I wanna both redirect to Feedburner using .htaccess, the first should point to http://feeds.feedburner.com/SimoBlog and the second to http://feeds.feedburner.com/digitalking/haPl I successfully done it for the first with this code: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^.*(FeedBurner|FeedValidator) [NC] RewriteRule ^feed/?.*$ http://feeds.feedburner.com/SimoBlog [L,NC,R=302] I don't figure out to make it working also for the second feed URL, any help? Thanks, Simone
