I would filter the model at a layer above the repository, with LINQ if you like. Makes the repository simple. If you are using LINQ to get the data from the database this method works very well, if you are having to use ADO or some other legacy data access layer than it might make it more difficult to make the repository so simple. Linq makes it easy so that you can have the repository return IQueryable and let the next layer add the filtering and the actual retrieval of data does not happen until it is asked for. This makes it possible to have a method on the repository like GetImages() that gets all images, and the next layer adds the filtering for a specific image. If you are using ADO, you are probably not going to want to bring back all images then filter....so could be a trade off.
