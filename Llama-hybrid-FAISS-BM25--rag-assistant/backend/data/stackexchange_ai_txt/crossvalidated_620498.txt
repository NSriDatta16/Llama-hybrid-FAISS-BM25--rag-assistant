A weighted mean would of course always be biased by $(1-p) \beta$ . I guess, the variance bias trade-off could of course be positive. If you really had the exact assumptions above, you can of course do much better than that. If you really believed that there is always a fixed bias $\beta$ for the second estimator, then I'd think you could do a pretty good job by writing down this exact model and estimating the parameters. Given the small sample size, you could elicit (from experts) what the various model parameters could roughly be to at least have weakly informative (or even fully informative) priors in a Bayesian setting. That's a really nice approach, by the way, if you want to investigate different notions of optimality, because you can pick estimates based on MCMC samples so as to minimize some loss function you may care about. One thing you didn't say and which you'd have to make choices about is whether the errors in predictions of the two approaches are correlated. In practice, you'd of course rarely be sure that the particular model form you wrote down would apply (e.g. both methods might be a bit biased, variability may also depend on circumstances and not be exactly known, the size of bias might change depending on each case etc.).
