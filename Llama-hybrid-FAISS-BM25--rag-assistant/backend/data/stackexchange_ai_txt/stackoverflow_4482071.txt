Using text files to build pages (Rails 2.3)

So I have some plain text files that I'd like to open and manipulate, then return some output that will be used in the view. I have the name of the file stored in my MySQL database (I would store the text in there but this text can vary drastically in length, making database storage inefficient), but where should I put the files, and what path should I use, to ensure that the server gets a hold of them when I call File.open() on it? And I'd also like to have it so that the users don't have access to the original text files, if at all possible. All help is appreciated and thanks!
