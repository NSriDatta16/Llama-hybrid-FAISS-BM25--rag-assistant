A different way to think about it is to write down the factor model for the tensor $$Y = \sum_{r=1}^Rv_{1,r}\otimes v_{2,r}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{d,r} + U$$ This factor model is the CP decomposition + noise. Then it is possible to estimate the loadings and factors in this model applying the standard PCA (or SVD) to the flattened tensors, see https://junsupan.github.io and https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12981 for more details.
