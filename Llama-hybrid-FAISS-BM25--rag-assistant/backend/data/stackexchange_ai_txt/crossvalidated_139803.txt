Quantitative importance for interacting variables in Artificial Neural Networks?

Is there any common/sound method to quantify (similar to T-test or F-test in regression models) the measures of influence and significance of terms in Artificial Neural Networks? By terms I mean both the individual independent variables and interacting variables (e.g. terms like $x_i$ and $x_i x_j â€¦ x_k$ where $x_i$ are input variables). In another word this question can be reduced to "feature selection" when we have only the Neural Network structure of the trained data.
