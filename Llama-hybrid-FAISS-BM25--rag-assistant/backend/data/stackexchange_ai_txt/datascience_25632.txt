Building CNN, Need More Images

I'm building a custom Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition. I'm running into the issue of only having around 100 images or so to train and test on. From my research and model results, this is not enough. Does anyone who of a service for hire to have someone search web/research and build up images based on certain criteria?
