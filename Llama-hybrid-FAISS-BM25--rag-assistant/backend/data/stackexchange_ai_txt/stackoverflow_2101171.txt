How to add User control in the toolbox for C#.net for winforms by importing the dll to the reference?

I have one dll of usercontrol and I add to it to the references in my project. And now I want to access this usercontrol from toolbox but it does not appear in the toolbox. And I can access them by writing code, but I want it in toolbox and want to use by just dragging it to the form.
