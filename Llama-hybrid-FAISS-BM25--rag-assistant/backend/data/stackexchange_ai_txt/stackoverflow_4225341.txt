Draggable stops working after I reload a part of web page with AJAX

I have implemented draggable and droppable jquery functions. They work. However, they stop working if I reload a part of the website. For example, I reload a div containing draggable items via AJAX (to get updated items) and suddenly I cannot drag and drop these new items. Though I do not reload the part of the web page with javascript code so it should still work.
