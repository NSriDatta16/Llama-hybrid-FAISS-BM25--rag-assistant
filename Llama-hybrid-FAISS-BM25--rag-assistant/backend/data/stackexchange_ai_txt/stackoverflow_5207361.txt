I'd put it in the 'medium' challenge bin offhand, but the specifics of the game could make it a lot harder or a lot easier. If the game isn't sending the data encrypted it could get harder, if the game is using Flash or Silverlight with TCP sockets or some specific protocol (like flash remoting), then you'll limit your technology choices (or make it harder), which in turn limits your pool of "good" developers. Likewise, there may be some challenges to managing the FB session in a way that mimics the browser, you might have to do user-agent spoofing... Lots of things to consider.
