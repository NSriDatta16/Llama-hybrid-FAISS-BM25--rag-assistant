As per the documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html CHAR(M) M × w bytes, 0 VARCHAR(M), VARBINARY(M) L + 1 bytes if column values require 0 – 255 bytes, L + 2 bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes CHAR is a fixed-length type - it will always store the maximum length of a string, regardless if the string uses it all up; it will however store the real string length using 1 more byte. VARCHAR is variable-length, and it will store only as many bytes as needed, plus one or two bytes to keep their length. This comes to maximum of 255 bytes for characters, and 1 byte for their length, or 65533 bytes for characters plus 2 bytes for their length.
