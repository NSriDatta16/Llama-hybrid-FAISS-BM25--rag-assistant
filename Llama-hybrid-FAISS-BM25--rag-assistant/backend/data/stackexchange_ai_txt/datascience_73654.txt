What is difference between transductive and inductive in GNN?

It seems in GNN(graph neural network), in transductive situation, we input the whole graph and we mask the label of valid data and predict the label for the valid data. But is seems in inductive situation, we also input the whole graph(but sample to batch) and mask the label of the valid data and predict the label for the valid data.
