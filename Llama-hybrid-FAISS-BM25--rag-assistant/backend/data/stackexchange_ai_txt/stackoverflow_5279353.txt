Whether table locks are applied or not depends on the storage engine. MyISAM does table locks, InnoDB does row locks. As you want to read and write rows, you will have to use InnoDB is it will allow concurrent access to each row (readers don't block writers, writers don't block readers) If you udpate the rows based on the primary key, they should be fairly fast (if your server can keep up with the IO that is beeing generated by this).
