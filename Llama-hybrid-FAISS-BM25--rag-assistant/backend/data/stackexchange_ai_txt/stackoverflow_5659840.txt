Can I embed a windows 7 gadget into WPF application

I am thinking of embedding a Windows 7 gadget into a WPF application, as there are already so many Windows 7 gadgets available on the internet. Windows 7 gadgets seems to be using Html, css and javascript. Thus, if I'm going to embed the gadget, I will need to have Webbrowser control (which has lots of memory problems and opacity etc.) which will make the application designer ugly. Any ideas?
