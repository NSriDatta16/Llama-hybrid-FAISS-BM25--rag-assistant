Is there a way to store and access a SQL CE (.sdf) database in isolated storage?

I have a .Net application which must store all it's local data in isolated storage. I want to start using SQL CE to store this data. I can't find any documentation on how (or even if) this is possible. Is it possible to use isolated storage to store a SQL CE database? If so, what would the connection string look like (or is there some other way you would need to open the database)?
