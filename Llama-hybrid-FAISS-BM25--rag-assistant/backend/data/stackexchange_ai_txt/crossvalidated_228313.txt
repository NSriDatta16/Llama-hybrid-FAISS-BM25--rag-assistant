Statistical sampling for auditing

I have a team with agents that I have to audit their services (which has a standardized rating system that I follow). There are 11 guys that I need to audit and each of them work a different amount of cases per week. I.e. Agent Cases worked Guy A 93 Guy B 53 Guy C 81 Guy D 111 ... ... Guy K 73 I was reading about statistical sampling , but didn't figure how to make an effective way to split my work and still have a significant confidence in my audits. Should I use something like Sample Size Calculator for each of them? Or is there another systematic approach that works better for this scenario? I want to have their average scores per week but I am not able to investigate all cases.
