a) What is the point of simulating SDEs if the solution is always different due to the randomness of the Wiener process? I have been simulating Geometric Brownian Motion and read that it is used in the Black-Scholes model in finance, so how do they actually price stocks based on the SDE? The Black-Scholes model is for evaluating the price of stock options (where the underlying stock is assumed to follow Geometric Brownian Motion). In terms of probability theory the idea is that the option price is the (discounted) expectation (as of today) of a function of the stock price at the maturity date of the option. So you are averaging over all the paths. The expectation is under what is called the risk-neutral measure- the idea being that to avoid arbitrage[basically having two prices for the same financial product] - all bets(options and other [financial] derivatives) on the future value of the stock price must be representable as an expectation with respect to a single pricing measure which is absolutely continuous [agrees on what states are impossible] with the real measure.If you think of the pdf of the stock price at maturity,$S_T$, then the pdf in the pricing measure is the price today of receiving a dollar at time $T$ for each value of the stock at time $T$. b) What are the methods used in determining the coefficients in an SDE to calibrate it to data? AFAIK you cannot even estimate the drift of a "gaussian" SDE $dX_t=\mu dt+\sigma dW_t$ , whereas the diffusion term is easy. However, the drift term is irrelevant to pricing options where the drift term (for the pricing measure) is set at the risk free rate of interest.the diffusion term ($\sigma$), on the other hand, determines the possible pricing measures so it should tie in with historical estimates...[but things get complicated] c) What is a good textbook for a very applied and computational approach to stochastic calculus with a crash course on measure theory? Although I think it would be a nice idea to combine the theoretical issue of dealing with infinite dimensional spaces [namely in the time dimension] with computations, I don't think you will find a book that takes that approach. you might want to read the parable of the bookmaker from baxter and rennie's book, Financial Calculus to read about arbitrage pricing and how probability is used in derivative pricing.
