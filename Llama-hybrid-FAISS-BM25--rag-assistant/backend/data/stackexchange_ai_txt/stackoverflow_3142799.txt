Some ideas for you... Do Have a blog and a blog post about the framework Have a specific website devoted to the framework. Include a documentation and examples section. Lots of examples including annotated code. Use the YUI examples as a guide. Eg YUI AutoComplete and their examples Have patience, it will take awhile Include interoperability discussion with JQuery, etc Offer lots of examples including annotated code. Can't overestimate importance! Also Don't cover ground already provided by a popular framework such as JQuery, Mootools, YUI. Do offer a release roadmap. Tell people what's coming and when. Do offer support and build a community. I suggest using Google Groups. Be the most frequent responder. Be prepared to respond to dumb and repetitive questions. They probably won't RTFM Do consider writing additional types of documentation--tutorials, cookbook-style recipes, API references, etc. Do plan for internationalization of your framework and community. Solicit help in translating the docs. Use a wiki to keep it all organized and easily updated by community members. Do consider paying a minimal amount on a logo-design site to get a nice logo. Do offer open, unrestrictive licensing such as MIT. Don't use GPL or LGPL.
