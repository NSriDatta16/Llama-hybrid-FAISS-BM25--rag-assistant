Is it possible to specify the Java U version when using Web Start?

I have a Java WebStart application for which I want to specify that the client use JRE 1.6.0_17 or later. To the JNLP file I've tried adding: or But when downloading JNLP file I'm given the message: "The application has requested a version of the JRE(version 1.6.0_17) that is not installed" despite the fact that: "java -version" reports the version number on the machine as "1.6.0_17" Changing the jnlp file to use and calling "System.getProperty("java.version")" reports the version that it is actually using to be "1.6.0_17" Looking through the spec section 4.6.1 indicates that there is some difference between platform version and product version, but it isn't clear to me how I would go about using the product version (or even if I should). Any help or pointers would be appreciated.
