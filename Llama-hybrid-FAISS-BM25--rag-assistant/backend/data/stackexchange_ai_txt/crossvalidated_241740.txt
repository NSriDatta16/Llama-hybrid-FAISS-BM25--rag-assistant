Lasso Regression: all coefficients are zero

I'm getting crazy with this. I hope that someone can help me. I want to perform LASSO regression on " House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques " dataset on Kaggle. I'm using R . This dataset is about predicting house price based on some features. Data is messy. It has a lot of missing values. So, in order to solve this problem, I began to observe the meaning of the variables and I noticed that almost all missing values are the absence of a feature of the house. For example, in the dataset, there's a categorical variable that measures the type of alley access to property. So, in this variable, NA means "No alley", so I add a proper level to the variable. And so on with almost all variables. At this point, I'm using glmnet library to perform lasso regression. glment function works with a matrix, so i use model.matrix in order to have a matrix that transform categorical variables in dummy variables. Then i combine with numeric variable and pass to glmnet. CVglment selects best lambdas and it returns me this absurd lambda( 2540) that brings all coefficients to zero( i know why, due to the penalty factor). library(glmnet) house So i tried with other values of lambda grid but all coefficients to zero anyway. My response variable( SalePrice) isn't in the matrix x.lasso . just checked out several times. Please help me, i'm desperate. I don't know if the problem is in my code or is a theoretichal problem( multicollinearity???).
