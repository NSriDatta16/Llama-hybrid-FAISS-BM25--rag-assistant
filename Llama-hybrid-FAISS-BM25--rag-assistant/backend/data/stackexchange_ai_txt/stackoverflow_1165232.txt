The human ear indeed perceives sounds on a logarithmic scale of increasing intensity, and because of that, the unit generally used to measure acoustic intensity is the decibel (which is actually used for all sorts of intensities and powers, not just those of sound, and also happens to be a dimensionless unit). The reference level, 0 dB, is usually set to the lower bound of human hearing, and every ten-decibel increase above that is equivalent to an increase in power by a factor of 10. Note, however, that you should first check with other people and see what they think, just in case; what sounds odd to you may not sound odd to others. If they agree with you, then go right ahead and do it exponentially, but if you're in the minority, then it might just be your own ears that are the problem. EDIT: Ignore my previous third paragraph. Refer to back2dos's answer if you decide to do it exponentially.
