Better way to limit the number of form validation attempts in my MVC controller and redirect to another action when limit is reached?

I am fairly new to MVC and am looking for some much needed guidance. The goal is to determine when a user is banging their head against a wall for any given action and redirect them to a different page with contact information for our "Help Desk". I have code that is functional but ugly and not very re-usable. (Validation is handled in a ViewModel): [HttpPost] public ActionResult MyForm(MyForm model) {.... if (ModelState.IsValid){..... return RedirectToAction("Success")} var attempts = Convert.ToInt32(TempData["Attempts"]); if (attempts >= 3) { TempData["LocalMessages"] = new Message { Class = "Alert", Text = "It looks like you are having trouble ...Please Contact...." }; return RedirectToAction("HelpDesk"); } attempts += 1; TempData["Attempts"] = attempts; return View(model); An ideal solution would be to leverage something like an Action Filter so I could do the following for any given action: [HttpPost, MaximumAttemptBeforeRedirect(4, "HelpDesk")] public ActionResult MyForm(MyForm model) Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
