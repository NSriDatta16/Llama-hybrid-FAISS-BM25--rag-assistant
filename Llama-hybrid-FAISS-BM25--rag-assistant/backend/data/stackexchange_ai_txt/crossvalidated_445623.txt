Is it okay to perform PerMANOVA on PCA values?

Is it acceptable to first perform principal components analysis on a dataset, and then use permutational MANOVA on those principal components values, rather than on the original values in the dataset? For example, in a dataset looking at sex differences in 11 variables, I don't get a significant p-value when performing perMANOVA on the dataset values, but do when the perMANOVA is performed on the PC values. I have a feeling that this is probably not statistically valid, but I wanted to check. Thanks!
