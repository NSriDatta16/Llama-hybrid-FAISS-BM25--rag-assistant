How to eliminate heteroskedasticity using the hccm function in R

I have a multiple regression model which failed Breusch-Pagan tests, and so I've recalculated the variance using a heteroscedasticity-corrected covariance matrix, coeftest(lm.model,vcov=hccm(lm.model)). The result of this is: t test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -365247.87 26636.12 -13.7125 I am not sure how to interpret these results. 1. How can I be sure that I can use these results for inferences? 2. Is there a way to visualise the results? (for example: graph of residuals after transformation)
