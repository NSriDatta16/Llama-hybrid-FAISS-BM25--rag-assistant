Relative frequencies

i am looking for a theorem to state if exists any for the following problem. I have 4 different groups of different sizes with smokers and non smokers and I have calcualted relative frequencies for smokers in each group. I combined four groups into one and calculated relative frequencies. Now the question: are the average of realtive frequencies of 1 and relative frequenices of 2 the same? If yes, which theorem explains that? Thanks!
