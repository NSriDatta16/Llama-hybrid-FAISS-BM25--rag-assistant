Canvas redraws only after loop ends

I have an issue with drawing on canvas in a loop. What I want to achieve is that in each loop the script waits for a few milliseconds, then draws on a canvas, the user can actually see the change, and then the loop repeats. What it does instead is that the user can't see the change, until the for-loop ends. But I have found that if I show an alert window and the script waits for the user to respond, it actually draws the change. How to show "the small changes" in every loop, not just in the end? My code ( also here: http://janiczek.github.com/heighway-dragon/ the link now contains something else): function sleep (ms) { var start = new Date().getTime(); while (new Date().getTime() var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas"); var c = canvas.getContext("2d");
