You could use HuggingFace's BertModel ( transformers ) as the base layer for your model and just like how you would build a neural network in Pytorch, you can build on top of it. HuggingFace's other BertModels are built in the same way. For reference you can take a look at their TokenClassification code over here . This hasn't been mentioned in the documentation much and I think it should. For Tensorflow however, you would have convert the Bert Model into a Keras layer. I haven't really gone through it much or tried it, but I think this blog post does a pretty good job of explaining it.
