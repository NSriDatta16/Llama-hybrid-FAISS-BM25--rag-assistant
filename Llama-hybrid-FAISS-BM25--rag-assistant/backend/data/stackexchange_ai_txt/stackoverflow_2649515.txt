the problem is that especially CSS hacks really wreck the parser. We do have a workaround, but it's far from elegant at the moment: the insert statement. It works the same way as the import statement, but it does not process the imported file, so it's ideal whenever you have code that can't be run through the parser (like copyright notices in comments or css hacks like yours) to just put them in a file somewhere and import them to your .less file. I know, this is not perfect, we are currently working on a complete parser rewrite to improve the situation. greetings Daniel
