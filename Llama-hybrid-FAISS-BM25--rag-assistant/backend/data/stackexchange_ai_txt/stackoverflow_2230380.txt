File format or parsing guidance for Visual Studio SUO files.

Where can I find a file format spec, or guidance for parsing, .suo files? I'd like to extract breakpoint information from them. The MSDN topic Solution User Options (.Suo) File briefly describes how storage streams are read from and written to this structure storage file, but this information is very scant, especially for someone of my structured storage experience.
