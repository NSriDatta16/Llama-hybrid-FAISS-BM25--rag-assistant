On starting feature engineering

I would like to start my feature engineering process by first selecting a subset of features that are highly correlated with the target feature. However, if I do select let’s say the top k in terms of correlation, won’t I be implicitly selecting k features that are also highly correlated among one another? If yes, isn’t this kind of a bad thing because in a way I am just picking the same vectors in space? Wouldn’t it be a good idea to also make sure that among these k features I am picking the ones that are less correlated with one another ?
