Everything that is part of the implementation of the class must be private, that makes you have the liberty to change it, if the need arise. In the example you mentioned, maybe the interface of the class wasn't defined completely because you need to change a private property of the class. If you have control of the code you could make the property protected or add functions to get and set the value.
