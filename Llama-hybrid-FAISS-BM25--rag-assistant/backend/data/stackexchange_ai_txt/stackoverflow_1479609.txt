Why don't you use a Predicate for this? It would allow you to pass your sorting conditions as a delegate . The example below doesn't sort, but it should serve as a decent example of the technique: private class Book { public string Author { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public DateTime Published { get; set; } } //Create and fill a list of books private List Books = new List { new Book { Author="Mcconnell",Name="Code Complete", Published=new DateTime(1993,05,14) }, new Book { Author="Sussman",Name="SICP (2nd)", Published=new DateTime(1996,06,01) }, new Book { Author="Hunt",Name="Pragmatic Programmer", Published=new DateTime(1999,10,30) }, }; // returns a new collection of books containing just SICP and Pragmatic Programmer. private IEnumerable BooksPublishedAfter1995() { return Books.FindAll(Book => Book.Published > new DateTime(1995, 12, 31)); } http://www.rvenables.com/tag/predicates/ Then again, now we're back to OrderBy, aren't we?
