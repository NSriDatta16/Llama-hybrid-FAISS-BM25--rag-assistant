I am guessing that normally when you ssh from your local machine to the machine running crond, your private key is loaded in ssh-agent and forwarded over the connection. So when you execute the command from the command line, it finds your private key in ssh-agent and uses it to log in to the remote machine. When crond executes the command, it does not have access to ssh-agent, so cannot use your private key. You will have to create a new private key for root on the machine running crond, and copy the public part of it to the appropriate authorized_keys file on the remote machine that you want crond to log in to.
