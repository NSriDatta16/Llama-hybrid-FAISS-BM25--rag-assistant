Compute posterior distribution when many (10) parameters involved

Is it feasible (in terms of computational time) to compute a posterior distribution involving 10 parameters? The time to calculate the likelihood function is about 1 minute, as likelihood is computed from a model made of more than 100 differential equations. I assume uniform distribution for each of the ten priors and I assume that they are indepedent. Which MCMC algorithm would be adapted for this problem?
