Which method(s) can I use to predict a response when the inputs have various combinations and proportions of of categorical and numeric variables?

I don't think a question like this has been asked before but please excuse me if it already has. I’m hoping someone can help me by pointing me in the right direction with my problem as stated below. I have a need to derive predictors for several continuous variables (let’s call them A, B and C), from a combination of two categorical variables (let’s call them U and V), an ordinal variable (W) and several continuous variables (let’s call them X, Y and Z). At this stage I’m not sure how important each input variable will be and indeed if some of them can be ignored e.g. W and Z may prove to be of little use. A, B and C are likely to be correlated, but probably not linearly. X, Y and Z show some roughly linear correlations if I look at them split by combinations of U and V. I have some doubts about the reproducibility of U, V and W as they are logged subjectively, but on the whole they should be OK. I have a database of several thousand records that give me values for A, B and C on a daily basis. However, the values for U, V and X, Y and Z are given in shorter, irregular time frames, and I have around 8,000 such records. An example of the data is given below (note that I’ve copied the values of A, B and C to each row on the same day but these values are the averages for the day): My initial idea was to use something like a Regression Tree to come up with an equation for A for each combination of U, V and W (and then do the same for B and C). However, the data set has around 10 unique values for both U and V and 5 for W, so the potential number of unique combinations is very large, even if I were to remove one of the categorical variables. Also, I do not have values of A, B and C available that I can map perfectly to these combinations i.e. there are always two or more combinations of U and V in any day.
