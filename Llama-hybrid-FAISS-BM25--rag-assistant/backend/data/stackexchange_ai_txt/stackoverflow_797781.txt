One source of the patent is this . There are, it appears, two claims, the second of which is more nearly relevant: A computer implemented method for organizing and searching a set of related records, wherein each record includes: i) a fixed ID field; and ii) a variable ID field; the method comprising the steps of: (a) generating first and second sets of link pointers, wherein the first set of link pointers points to successor elements of the set of related records when the records are ordered with respect to the fixed ID field, and the second set of link pointers points to predecessor elements of the set of related records when the records are ordered with respect to the fixed ID field; (b) generating third and fourth sets of link pointers, wherein the third set of link pointers points to successor elements of the set of related records when the records are ordered with respect to the variable ID field, and the fourth set of link pointers points to predecessor elements of the set of related records when the records are ordered with respect to the variable ID field; (c) generating first and second sets of field pointers, wherein the first set of field pointers includes an ordered set of pointers that point to every Nth fixed ID field when the records are ordered with respect to the fixed ID field, and the second set of pointers includes an ordered set of pointers that point to every Nth variable ID field when the records are ordered with respect to the variable ID field; (d) when searching for a particular record by reference to its fixed ID field, conducting a binary search of the first set of field pointers to determine an initial pointer and a final pointer defining a range within which the particular record is located; (e) examining by linear scarch, the fixed ID fields within the range determined in step (d) to locate the particular record; (f) when searching for a particular record by reference to its variable ID field, conducting a binary search of the second set of field pointers to determine an initial pointer and a final pointer defining a range within which the particular record is located; (g) examining, by linear search, the variable ID fields within the range determined in step (f) to locate the particular record. When you work through the patent gobbledegook, I think it means approximately the same as having two skip lists (one for forward search, one for backwards search) on each of two keys (hence 4 lists in total, and the name 'quad-list'). I don't think it is a very good patent - it looks to be an obvious application of skip lists to a data set where you have two keys to search on.
