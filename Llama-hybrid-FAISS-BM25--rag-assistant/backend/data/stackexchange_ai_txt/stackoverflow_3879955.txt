input open the file ( fopen ) in text mode and read the lines ( fgets and sscanf ) store array you cannot have an array with unspecified size. You must either use a size limit and leave some elements unused, or use malloc and friends and manage storage for the array manually modify use + , - , * and other operators along with sqrt , abs , sin and other functions available in the Standard Library to massage the data (you can create some functions of your own too) put it back It's better to write to a new file and if everything went ok, delete the old file and rename the new one ... so open the new file ( fopen with "w" for mode parameter) at the beginning when opening the input; if the input is not the array line write ( fputs ) it back directly, otherwise write the 'massaged' line; read and write all the other lines. (C++?) with MFC The above is for C . It might work for C++ with or without MFC Regards Have fun!
