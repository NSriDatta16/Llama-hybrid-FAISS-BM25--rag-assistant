I'm not sure if you really want to make it hidden. If you're worried about users looking at it, a more than average user will know how to un-hide things and pilfer around. So, that being said, if you want to keep users from seeing what's in the config you will need to encrypt the config. A good example of that can be found here: http://www.davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/11/17/2572.aspx If you still want to hide the config, then you could try hiding it once the application is run for the first time. Using: ApplicationDeployment.IsNetworkDeployed && ApplicationDeployment.CurrentDeployment.IsFirstRun with a click once application you can tell if this is the first time an application is run. You could then use File.SetAttributes(path, File.GetAttributes(path) | FileAttributes.Hidden); to actually hide the app.config. Which would result in: if (ApplicationDeployment.IsNetworkDeployed && ApplicationDeployment.CurrentDeployment.IsFirstRun) { File.SetAttributes(path, File.GetAttributes(path) | FileAttributes.Hidden); }
