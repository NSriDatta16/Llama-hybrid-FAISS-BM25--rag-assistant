Some others (albeit small) comments to throw against the wall... SQL Server database schemas can be useful for both organizing tables and stored procedures as well as controlling security. Every transactional table should always track both who and when created the record as well as updated the record in separate columns. I've seen implementation that simply used "update date" which can lead to auditing challenges in the future. Use GUID's for row identifiers for all rows for projects with offline/synchronization requirements.
