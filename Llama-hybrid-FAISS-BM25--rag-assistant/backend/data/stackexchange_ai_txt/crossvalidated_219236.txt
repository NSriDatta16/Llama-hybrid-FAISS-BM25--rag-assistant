dropout: forward prop VS back prop in machine learning Neural Network

Regarding dropout , we know that in the forward propagation some neurons are put to "zero" (i.e., turned off). How about back propagation ? Are these dropped out neurons also zeros (turned off) during back-prop ? Thank Refer to this link, which seems to be not very clear ... : Dropout backpropagation implementation
