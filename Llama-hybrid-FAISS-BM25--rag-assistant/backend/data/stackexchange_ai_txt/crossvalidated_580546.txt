With a 0-5 scale (often called a Likert item ), a t -test isn't a good choice. You only have a small number of possible values or paired differences between values, so the underlying assumption of normally distributed error terms in t -tests won't hold. Your outcome values are nevertheless ordinal , in that each higher value on the scale represents a higher level of pain, although the levels might not be evenly spaced. There are well established ways for analyzing such ordinal outcomes, with ordinal logistic regression a frequent choice. Furthermore, as you note, you have paired results on the two eyes from each participant in the study, one eye the control and the other treated. One way to account for this pairing is to treat the participants as "random effects" in a mixed model. In your situation, you would include as "fixed effects" the eye (control versus treated), the day (to account for changes over time) and an interaction between eye and day (to allow for different effects of treatment over time). Sal Mangiafico's R Companion has a web page illustrating such a model with Student as the random effect, a Likert outcome similar to yours, Time as one fixed effect, Speaker as a second fixed effect, and an interaction between those two fixed effects. That should provide a direct template for your study. I would recommend that you find local statistical consultation for this analysis, particularly if there are other variables that your study needs to take into account.
