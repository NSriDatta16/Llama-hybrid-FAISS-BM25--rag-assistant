TekPub always does a great job with their instructional videos. If videos are your thing, I strongly encourage you to subscribe to their service so you can view all the videos they offer. BUT the one you are looking for is actually provided FREE. They did a 5-part series on programming concepts and there's an entire episode devoted to Lambdas.. check it out: http://tekpub.com/view/concepts/2
