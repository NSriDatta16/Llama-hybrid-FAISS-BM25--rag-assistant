Which model to use for word tokenization?

What type of model for word tokenization in a group of words is good?? I want to tokenize skills in a group. There are multiple groups, and I want to predict group number using a single skill. I have used BERT but I think it's mainly used for sentences not list of words. Can you suggest better model??
