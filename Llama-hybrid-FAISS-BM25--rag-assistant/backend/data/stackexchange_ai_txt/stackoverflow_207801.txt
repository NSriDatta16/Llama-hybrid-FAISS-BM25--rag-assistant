Manage large amount of data and images within

my question is similar to other friend posted here...we are trying to develop an application that supports possibly terabytes of information based on a land registry in Paraguay with images and normal data. The problem is that we want to reduce the cost of operation to minimum as possible because itÂ´s like a competition between companies, and for that reason we want to use a free database....I have read a lot of information about it but I am still confused. We have to realize that the people who is gonna use it are government people so the DB has to be easy to manage at the same time. What would u people recommend me? Thanu very much
