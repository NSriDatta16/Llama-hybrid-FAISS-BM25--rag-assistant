This is not a complete answer, but I'll offer a couple suggestions. First, you might try breaking your problem down into pieces, and solving iteratively, perhaps using a Bayesian updating procedure. For example, in your test data set $T_1$, you have $M_{0,0} = 1000$, $M_{1,0} = 900$, and $M_{1,1} = 100$. Focusing just on this subset of the data, a MLE procedure will give you estimates of $p_{0,0} \approx 0.9$ and $p_{0,1} = 1-p_{0,0} \approx 0.1$. By construction you already know that $p_{0,2} = p_{2,0} = p_{2,1} = 0$ and $p_{2,2}=1$. So you've got a lot of structure that should help reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Expanding on this theme, you could estimate these transition probabilities using a Bayesian procedure, using a Beta distribution for the prior on $p_{0,0}$. Using only the data from the transition from $t=0$ to $t=1$, your posterior distribution over $p_{0,0}$ would be a Beta distribution with mean $0.9$. This posterior distribution could then be used as the prior for the next round, when you need to analyze data reflecting the transition from $t=1$ to $t=2$. A final thought: you might look at maximum entropy estimation procedures. They tend to work very nicely when you need to estimate probabilities for under-determined problems.
