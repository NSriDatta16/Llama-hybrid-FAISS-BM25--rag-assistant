Write code. Having written actual code is much more valuable than reading books. It seems it's a problem that programmers can't write code - see here . So in order not to be one of those that can't program, write code. You can undertake a project of your taste. Since it's now popular, you can create some social tool, like TweetDeck or HootSuite. Or you can create an arbitrary useful software. For the cornet-shop or car-repair garage of a relative of yours, whatever.
