Comparison of returns of two investment strategies. Can some kind of randomization help?

My task is to compare the returns of two investment strategies using historical quarterly returns calculated from S&P 500 Index data. Example: If I chose 10 year horizon of an investment, then for strategy A I have a time series of returns 1930q1-1940q1, 1930q2-1940q2 ... 2005q1-2015q1, and the same for strategy B . So I need to compare these two time series in order to determine which strategy gives significantly higher returns . Both autocorrelation and non-stationarity are present. I can't use paired t-test, since time series is not a random sample. There is significant autocorrelation of higher orders. By differencing I just lose information about how high the returns were. And my goal is really just to say something like "based on historical data, returns from strategy A were significantly higher than returns from strategy B". I don't need to analyze trend of these series nor to make predictions. I haven't found any solution to this problem. There were few similar questions on the internet but the asnwers recomended either to do something else than just pure comparison or to use t-test which I consider incorrect. My idea is to use some kind of randomization. If I randomly chose say 30 values from the whole time series (the example above has 300 values), is it possible to consider these 30 values as a random sample? I assume that I could get rid of autocorrelation by this so to have justification to use t-test. I could repeat this 100 times and look how often I get significant difference. Is my idea correct in any way? Or does anyone have any other idea? Thank you very much for reading and any suggestions. Tom
