I think you have three options here. You could select one dose and then use all the studies which use that dose, trials and observational. If you do that you would probably want to include a moderator variable for study type with two levels (trials versus observational). This analysis might be appropriate if there is wide clinical agreement on the standard dose. If the two study types differ substantially you might want to fall back on a stratified analysis and presentation. However if the studies are all comparing several doses then it seems unlikely that there is a clinical consensus about the best dose and so you need to do either a multi-level meta-analysis with meta-regression or a network meta-analysis. In the multi-level analysis you would have a random effect for study and fixed effects for dose and study type. The network meta-analysis would proceed similarly. If you use R then there are some useful references and examples on Wolfgang Viechtbauer's pages about his metafor package here . there are also packages for network meta-analysis, see the CRAN Task View on meta-analysis (disclaimer, I maintain it). If you use Stata I think you will find that Ian White's mvmeta command can be tweaked to do these analyses but I do not use Stata myself.
