One option is to speed up your code is to standardize features, removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler scaler = StandardScaler() X = scaler.fit_transform(X.reshape(-1, 1)) y = scaler.fit_transform(y.reshape(-1, 1)) After I standardized the data, each model fit in less than 500ms. Support vector machines (SVMs) need to calcuate the distance between each data. Standardize numbers make the calculations faster.
