Logistic regression is a binary classifier (edit: can be used as a binary classifier), and therefore you can use the standard metrics for classifiers. The metrics you use are the standard ones, F1 being the most complete (though the less intuitive in terms of meaning). Accuracy, for instance, is the percentage of points that have been correctly classified. Your model seems not bad at all. A random classifier (a monkey doing random guesses) would get an accuracy of a 50%. Still, it depends on the dataset. In an easy dataset many basic models would be able to get similar (or best) values than yours. You can compare your model to others to see whether your model gets remarkable results or it is just that the classification task was easy. To complete the evaluation you can also plot a confusion matrix to see whether your model tends to do a good job in classifying one class but not as good in detecting members of the other class. In a confusion matrix, you want most of the elements to fall in the diagonal (true positive and true negatives). The other two blocks in a confusion matrix of a binary classifier are the false negative and false positives. Besides, you should do all this in a test set , a subset of your data that your model has never seen (that is, that you didn't use to tune the coefficients of your regression).
