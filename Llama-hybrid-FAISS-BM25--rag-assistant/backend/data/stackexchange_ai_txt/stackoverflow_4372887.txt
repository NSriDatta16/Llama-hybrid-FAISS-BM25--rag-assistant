It's not really too much different then adding a grid to any other page. I know when I was building a module I dug into the Google Base addon that is native to Magento, I found a lot of good code there to help me understand how to implement different aspects of an admin module. For instance my tab block overides grid, like so: class Ssi_Crm_Block_Quotes_Edit_Tab_Bom_Product extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid This class then overrides the standard grid functions such as _prepareCollection() and _prepareColumns() stuff that you can find documented elsewhere.
