Though i cant definitively site for or against, this implementation has its issues. Where are these IP Addresses coming from, if they are randomly selected, what happens when they do not reply or are late in replying, does that mean the random number will be slower to appear. Also, even if you would make a visual graph of 100.000 results and calculated that there are no or few correlations between the numbers, does not mean it is truly random. As explained by dilbert :)
