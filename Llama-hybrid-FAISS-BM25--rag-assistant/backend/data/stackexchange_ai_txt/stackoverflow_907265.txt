Highlighting effect to text and/or image similar to be synchronized with audio

I am looking how to approach following problem: We have application that displays text with audio recorded material. We use Browser Control (Internet Explorer) in Delphi App to do this. We respond to events in Delphi code setting innerHTML for elements if we have to update the style ... Now, request is to add option to dynamically move the cursor or dynamically highlight the words spoken from the paragraph. It doesn't need to match absolutely the exact word spoken so we will have to dynamically update the content of position of highlighted word based on some timer or something (because it is not text to speach). What should be the most practical and easy approach to this kind of problem, all answers are greatly appreciated. Thanks.
