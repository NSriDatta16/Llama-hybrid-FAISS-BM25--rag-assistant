If you're just getting a start on things, check out the ASP.Net tutorial on building a Data Access Layer using TableAdapters. This is a great start because it gives you a nice drag and drop type interface for a lot of things, in addition to giving you strongly typed data. All the concepts of data adapters and connection strings are there, just managed by the object it creates. The nice thing about the Table Adapters is that it leverages ADO.Net so you simply have to replace your DataAdapter with SQL, MySQL, SQLite adapter you need. Once you get the hang of that, you can move into integrating your Business layer as well through the LINQ to SQL tutorials.
