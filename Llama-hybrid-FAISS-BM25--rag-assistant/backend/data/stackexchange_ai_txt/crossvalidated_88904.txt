The book I have is Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data by Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand. It's used in the spatial statistics course at the University of Minnesota where two of the authors are located. It starts out with the classical basics and then moves toward Bayesian methods in later chapters. One caveat is that, being over ten years old, the computing examples are a mix of R and S-plus, and an updated (all R) edition is in the works and expected soon.
