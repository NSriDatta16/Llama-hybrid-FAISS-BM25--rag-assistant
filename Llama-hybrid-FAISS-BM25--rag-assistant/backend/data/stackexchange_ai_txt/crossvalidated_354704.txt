What does it mean if the ROC AUC is high and the Average Precision is low?

I have a model that produces a high ROC AUC (0.90), but at the same time a low average precision (0.30). From what I've found, I think it might have to do something with imbalanced data (which the dataset is). However, I cannot see how this imbalance results in this significant difference. Reading Davis' paper has not gotten me to an answer either.
