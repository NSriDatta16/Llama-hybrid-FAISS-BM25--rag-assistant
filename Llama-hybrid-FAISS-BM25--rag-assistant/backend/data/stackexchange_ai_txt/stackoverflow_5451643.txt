Grouping a sequence of bools in clojure?

I would like to transform the following sequence: (def boollist [true false false false true false true]) Into the following: [[true] [false false false true] [false true]] My code leads to a Stackoverflow: (defn sep [boollst] (loop [lst boollst separated [[]] [left right] (take 2 lst)] (if (nil? left) separated) (recur (next lst) (if (false? left) (conj (last separated) left) (conj separated [left])) (take 2 (next lst))))) Is there an elegant way of transforming this?
