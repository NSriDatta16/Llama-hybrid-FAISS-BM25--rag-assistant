The other answers are too formulaic to be convincing, so let me give a more general answer. I've struggled with this question for a while. I offer this process: Know your message Know your audience Know your constraints Tailor your message to your audience given your constraints I am skeptical of blanket claims such as "keep it simple" -- what does that mean? Well, it depends on the audience. Some audiences will eat up the Tufte style. But some audiences appreciate a little chart junk now and then. Some people are bored by scatterplots. Some people like colorful backgrounds. Is it so wrong to engage them a little bit even if you compromise "aesthetic" purity? That is up to you to decide. Your audience's reaction will be an important piece of feedback, but not the only one. If you find a way to measure their understanding before and after your presentation, then you will start to understand the impact you've made. The "right" answer will depend upon these sorts of questions: What media will you be using? Are you creating static or interactive plots? Are you trying to tell a pre-defined story (exposition) or encourage experimentation (exploration)? To what degree do you want the audience to draw their own conclusions? To what degree to you want the audience to follow along with and be convinced by your story? To what degree to you want the audience to challenge your findings? In summary, design your materials deliberately given your message, audience, and constraints.
