How would I reverse this equation?

I’m using this equation to convert steps to estimated calories lost. I now need to do the opposite and convert total calories to estimated steps. This is the equation I’m using for steps to calories: +(CGFloat) totalCalories:(NSUInteger)TotalStepsTaken weight:(CGFloat)PersonsWeight{ CGFloat TotalMinutesElapsed = (float)TotalStepsTaken / AverageStepsPerMinute; //Average Steps Per Minute is Equal to 100 CGFloat EstimatedCaloriesBurned = PersonsWeight * TotalMinutesElapsed * Walking3MphRate; //Walking3MphRate = 0.040; return EstimatedCaloriesBurned; } It’s written in Objective-C, but I tried to make it as readable as possible. All calculations are being done over a 1 hour period. Thank you for you help.
