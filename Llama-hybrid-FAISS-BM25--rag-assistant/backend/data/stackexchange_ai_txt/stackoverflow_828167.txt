Another approach is to use an XML Server which stores XML data and use XQuery to access and deliver the result on the server side (I work at MarkLogic, we make an XML Server, try it here: http://developer.marklogic.com/download/ ) In this architecture you have a single server storing XML and executing XQuery. If you deliver the result formatted as HTML you now have a two tier system. Of course you can use AJAX to access the XML Server vis ReST directly from within the page. An advanced form of this architecture is called XRX. See this post for more info: http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2008/05/xrx_a_simple_elegant_disruptiv_1.html
