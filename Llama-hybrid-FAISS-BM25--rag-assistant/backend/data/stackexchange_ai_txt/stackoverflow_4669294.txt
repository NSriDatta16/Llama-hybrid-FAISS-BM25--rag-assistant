If you use the "Build and Archive" feature from Xcode to distribute the app (to Apple Store or the user), you can drag the crash log to the organizer and let the IDE do symbolication. Remember, you must have the exact version of the app and .DSYM. Recompiling the app generates a different .DSYM and it will not work.
