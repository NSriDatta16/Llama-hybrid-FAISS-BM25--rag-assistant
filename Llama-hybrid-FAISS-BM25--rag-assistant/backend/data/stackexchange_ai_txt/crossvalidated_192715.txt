A simple non-parametric technique for both testing and selecting a changepoint is to use maximally-selected test statistics. Essentially, these look for the point in x where a two-sample contrast of y is maximized. In R, this is implemented in the coin package for conditional inference in the maxstat_test() function. Alternatively, you can also use a 0/1 dummy coding of the response and rely on structural change methods for OLS regressions. In R, the strucchange package can be leveraged for this. As this was originally developed for time series data, you should order your data by x and then regress on a constant to see whether the (segment-wise) constant mean/proportion of y changes over x . Consider the following simple artificial example with a uniform x from [-1, 1] and a response y whose success proportion changes from 20% to 80% at x = 0.5 . set.seed(1) x 0.5, 0.8, 0.2), size = 1) plot(factor(y) ~ x) To apply a two-sample maximally selected test statistic (essentially a type of two-sample t-test), you simply do library("coin") maxstat_test(factor(y) ~ x) ## Asymptotic Generalized Maximally Selected Statistics ## data: factor(y) by x ## maxT = 9.0955, p-value For applying strucchange it is easiest to include the data in a data.frame and order it by x to resemble a time-series structure: d Then you can test for a structural change using a CUSUM-type test: library("strucchange") sc The corresponding plot already shows that the test is significant (because the boundary is crossed) and that the changepoint is close to 0.5 (because of the peak in the process). To formally estimate the changepoint and obtain a confidence interval you can use breakpoints() : bp Here, the breakdates are simply the proportion of the data. To convert the breakpoints (= numbers of observations) to the corresponding x values one has to do this manually: d$x[confint(bp)$confint] ## [1] 0.4635850 0.4933965 0.5326213 Thus, in this simple example, the changepoint estimated by OLS regression and by the maximally-selected two-sample statistic above coincides exactly.
