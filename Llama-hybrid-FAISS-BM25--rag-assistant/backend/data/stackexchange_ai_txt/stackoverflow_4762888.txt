It all depends on how critical your software is. In order to make a trial version of a web app, you could incorporate the following mechanisms. Obfuscate assemblies - This prevents users from decompiling\reverse engineering your code and looking into how the trial version logic is implemented. Release different versions -Maintain two different versions of the product i.e. Full version and a demo version, by using compiler directives. This prevents the trial version from being cracked. Limit features - Say if its a payroll application, limit the number of users, say something between 10 or 20. Suppose if its a BI app, then embed watermarks on generated graphs and reports. Next what you could limit the number of logins per day or put restriction on major features from being used more than a specific number of times per day. Configuration Storage - Store trial version counter related data in a encrypted file and keep the hash of that file separately. Each time after writing to the file update the hash and also verify the hash before reading from the file. Also make sure the trial version configuration file's creation date is same as that of any other program file, so as to prevent it from being replaced with a new one, so as to reset the counters. Here are couple of links from SO on this same query. Implementing a 30 day time trial https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981294/copy-protection-tool-to-limit-number-of-units/2025926#2025926
