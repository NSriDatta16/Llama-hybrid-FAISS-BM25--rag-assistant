Confidence intervals converging to credible intervals when Bootstraping?

As explained already by Rasmus , the Bayesian Bootstrap and the non-parametric Bootstrap "converge" when n is sufficiently large. But if taking the percentile interval in the Bayesian Bootstrapped distribution will approximate a credible interval (or did I misunderstand something?) and the percentile interval in a Non-Parametric Bootstrapped distribution will approximate a confidence interval. Would that imply that when using Bootstrapping (either Bayesian or non-parametric) and when n is sufficiently large (Here I do not mean asymptotically but rather a reasonable number) the confidence interval will be approximately the same as the credible interval?
