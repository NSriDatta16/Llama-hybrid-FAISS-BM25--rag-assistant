SSRS Subreport not seing values in only one dataset

I'm working on a series of reports which need to be shown in two languages so I've created a common header that I planned on embedding into the content of each report. I have two data sets, one that looks up a set of strings in English or French (depending on a parameter passed to the report), and another with numerical data. The original header worked fine and when I extracted it into a separate report it also runs fine. I am just passing the name of the report to the subreport. When I run the main report, it seems that the values in my string dataset are all null (I've tried all of them) yet if I try data from my numerical dataset, the fields have values and get displayed as the title. If I also insert a text field with the same expression to display the report title after the subreport, it works fine but the title still does not get passed to the subreport. I cannot make any sense of why this would be happening, anyone have a clue? I'm using Report Builder 2.0 and SQL Server 2008. Thanks!
