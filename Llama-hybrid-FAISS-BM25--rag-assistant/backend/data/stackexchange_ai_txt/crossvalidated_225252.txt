Both the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) test are tailored for detecting nonstationarity in the form of a unit root in the process. (The test equations explicitly allow for a unit root; see the refence below.) However, they are not tailored for detecting other forms of nonstationarity. Therefore, it is not surprising that they do not detect nonstationarity of the seasonal kind. The result of the ADF test ($p$-value below 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis of presence of a unit root can be rejected at 95% confidence level. The result of the KPSS test ($p$-value above 0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis of absence of a unit root presence of unit root cannot be rejected at 95% confidence level. (The bullet points are there just to confirm what you implied.) For an accessible and intuitive yet technically precise treatment of the ADF and the KPSS tests I suggest Eric Zivot's "Modelling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS" (2nd ed., 2006) Chapter 4 "Unit Root Tests" (especially sections 4.3 and 4.4).
