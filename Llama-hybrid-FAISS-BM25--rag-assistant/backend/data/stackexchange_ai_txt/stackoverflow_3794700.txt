Scrolling 2 lists with 1 scroller Flex 4

Been trying to scroll 2 lists with their native scrollers disabled with 1 scroller added to the right of them. I tried setting the viewport of each List as the scroller and while that works it just instantiates the scroller to each of the Lists rather than use 1. Essentially i'm trying to have them scroll vertically at the same time while dragging only 1 scrollbar thumb.
