There are a number of ways to tackle this, I am going to focus on feature selection/extraction, because you mentioned PCA. Sklearn itself offers a few feature selection/extraction algorithms already, see here , like SelectKBest. This would mean for you to maybe select specific frames, or samples, or even pixels (unlikely). Further it has not only PCA but a few more, see here . I am going to mention PCA, NMF, ICA. While you already apparently tried this, it is important to note that these algorithms als have to be tuned correctly. Now, on the other hand, like Graph4Me already mention you can use a CNN. For this you can use the structure of an AutoEncoder, which tries to learn a minimal representation of the input, to correctly restore the input as output. The Decoder-Encoder structure can be trained, to then only use the Encoder as a way to obtain dimensionally reduced training samples. A tutorial (for pytorch) is here , although it is for text, the same principle can be applied to images and videos. As a final note, you can obviously try some simple preprocessing, like cropping the video, reducing the framerate, converting to grayscale if not already done, or even just black and white. I also hope you are already processing your data sequentially in every regard, if loading everything at once is an issue.
