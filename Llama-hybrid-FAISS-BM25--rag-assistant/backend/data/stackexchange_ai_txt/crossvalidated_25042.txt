My first thought was to compute a pseudo $R^2$ measure as follows: ss.dist Here, we get a value of 0.6814984 ($\approx$ cor(cars$dist, predict(cars.lo))^2 ), close to what would be obtained from a GAM : library(mgcv) summary(gam(dist ~ speed, data=cars)) This also seems to be in agreement with what S loess function would return (I don't have S so I can't check by myself) as Multiple R-squared . For example, using the airquality R dataset, which looks like the air data Chambers and Hastie used in the 'white book' (the one that is being referenced in the on-line help for loess ; but that's not the exact same dataset), I got an $R^2$ of 0.8101377 using the above formula. That's pretty in agreement with what Chambers and Hastie reported. I should note that I didn't find any paper dealing specifically with that (ok, that was just a quick googling), and William Cleveland doesn't speak about $R^2$-like measure in his paper . However, I wonder if the liberty with which you can choose the degree of smoothing (or window span ) does not preclude any use of $R^2$-based measure.
