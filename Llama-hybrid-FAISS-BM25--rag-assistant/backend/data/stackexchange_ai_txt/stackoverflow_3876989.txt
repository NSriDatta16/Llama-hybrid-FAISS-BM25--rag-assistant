Drag-drop AS3: how to drag child mc out of parent mc and add to new parent mc

Here is a working script to drag drop a ball from the stage into another target mc : ball.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, pickUp); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dropIt); function pickUp(event:MouseEvent):void{ var ballPoint:Point = ball.parent.localToGlobal( new Point(ball.x, ball.y) ); ball.parent.removeChild(ball); addChild(ball); ball.x = ballPoint.x; ball.y = ballPoint.y; ball.startDrag(); } function dropIt(event:MouseEvent):void{ ball.stopDrag(); if(!event.target.dropTarget) { return }; var dropT:MovieClip = event.target.dropTarget.parent; var ballPoint:Point = dropT.globalToLocal( new Point(ball.x, ball.y) ); ball.parent.removeChild(ball); dropT.addChild(ball); ball.x = ballPoint.x; ball.y = ballPoint.y; } It works well but I'm new to AS3 and I am having difficulty amending this script to drag the ball out of a parent mc (instead of the stage) and onto another mc (the target mc). To explain: imagine a ball, a box, a tri, + more shapes all within a scrolling mc (initial parent), the user scrolls to select a shape, then drag-drops onto a target mc on the stage. The scrolling is no problem, but how would you amend the script above so that the ball can start inside a parent mc rather than on the stage itself? Any suggestions welcome.
