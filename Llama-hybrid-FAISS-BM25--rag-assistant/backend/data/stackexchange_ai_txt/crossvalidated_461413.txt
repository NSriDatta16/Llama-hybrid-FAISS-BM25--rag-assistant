In basic time series modelling, no matter you use AR(Auto Regressive) or MA(Moving Average) models, they all inciur some sort of autocorrelations. So ACF is not a model, it's just a way to show the autocorrelation properties of different models. No model is more standard than the other, as for what model to pick, it depends on your model selection criteria, such as BIC, or expected prediction error. Most text books start with AR models is because AR is simple.
