The Cache object doesn't guarantee that it will hold onto cached objects at all, much less for the full amount of time that you suggest. If you want to more strongly encourage it to do so, you can set CacheItemPriority.High or CacheItemPriority.NotRemovable when you insert an item into the Cache. With the default Normal priority, the runtime has a fairly aggressive policy of letting go of objects when memory pressure increases. On top of that, by default the IIS AppPool will recycle once/day or so, which will clear everything in the Cache.
