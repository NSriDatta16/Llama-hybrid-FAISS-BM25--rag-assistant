I would follow the "physical object" paradigm of having a 'safety cover' over the actual controls. In terms of the UI, this would be a checkbox that (and I know you said that you want them always displayed, but..) reveals and enables the special controls.

If its keyboard, then a keycombo, or, again, taking from other interfaces, have the user type 'enable' or something relevant to the actual controls. If its primarily a mouse interface, how about a more complex interaction like a "swipe" - where the user has to drag an element a reasonable distance.
