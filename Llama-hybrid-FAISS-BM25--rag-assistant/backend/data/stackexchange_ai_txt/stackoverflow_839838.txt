How to react to Excel events in Ruby?

I can find 10^1000 examples of scripting Excel using Ruby, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to have Ruby react to events in Excel. I'm trying retrieve the contents of a row in a worksheet when it's selected, but such an event-based retrieval I can't find any methods or examples for.
