I don't think you can go through "lines" in a paragraph, because what may visually seem like 10 lines could actually be only one wrapped line (no actual line breaks). You could, for example, set the overflow to show on the container, and detect when the overflow happens with height/clientHeight , and then split the text by counting words or similar. UPDATE: Here is a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/AQwFM/4/ Obviously need improvements, but should get you started.
