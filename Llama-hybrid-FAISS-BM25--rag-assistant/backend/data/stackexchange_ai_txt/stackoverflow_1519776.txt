Juri, I should have clarified that this control might be used by non-developers or developers who we do not want to require too much knowledge of setting properties so I'm trying to develop a control where they would drag it on like a panel and just enter text and maybe set one property which would be the title. I was able to create a compositecontrol which I created a title panel, the collapsible panel and utilized the asp.net ajax collapsiblepanel control. I had to add an Template though which I would prefer not to do. Darrell
