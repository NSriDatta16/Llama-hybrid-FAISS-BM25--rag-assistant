Would a T test be appropriate for determining the significance of an algorithm's results?

Say you have an algorithm which should yield a higher score when given two similar images and a lower value when given two images that do not resemble each other. Two sets of tests are run, one where pairs of similar images are given and the other where pairs of different images are given. Each test set contains 10 tests on complex images. The algorithm yields a higher score, on average, for the images which resemble each other. Although this seems to confirm a hypothesis that the algorithm works, statistical significance needs to be calculated. Would a T test be appropriate for this? If so, should the normal distribution of results from both test sets first be proven? Or, maybe another test altogether is more appropriate for this.
