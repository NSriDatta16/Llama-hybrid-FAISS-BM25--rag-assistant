Before deciding on where to store your class, you have to answer two questions: How long this class should live? In what scope should it be visible? Examples that answer both questions: request, user session, application. If this class is stateless (no data and only logic), then it can probably live during the whole life of application. If this is just data unique to each user (that should not be reloaded on each request), then you can put it directly into session and skip following paragraphs. Now, after you decided on life length, you have several solutions. The best solution for lifestyle management is an IoC container. The simpler solution is just to abstract storage and use a static facade, like Current.MyClass, where MyClass instance is stored in request, session or application depending on what storage was provided to Current. You should not implement singleton in the specified class, however, since it should not itself decide how many instances you need and it limits your ability to replace is with another class with same interface if required.
