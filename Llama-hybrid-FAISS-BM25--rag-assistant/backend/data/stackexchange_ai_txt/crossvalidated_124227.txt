$A(x \rightarrow x')$ is an acceptance probability, so it has to fit the [0, 1] range. But in practice it is not of much importance and can be omitted, like in an example of MH given by Robert and Casella (2010) : y = geneq(x[t]) if ( runif(1) where geneq is a generator for $q(y|x)$. As you can see, if writing it this way it doesn't matter if $A(x \rightarrow x')$ is less than one, while it works just the same like in the original formula.
