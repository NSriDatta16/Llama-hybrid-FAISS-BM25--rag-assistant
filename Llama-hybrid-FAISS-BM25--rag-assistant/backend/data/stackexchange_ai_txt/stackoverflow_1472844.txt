Well, look at Medicine and Civil Engineering. These are interesting because people get hurt if not done well. These field have standards and licencing-procedures EVERYONE follows. You cannot wake up one day and begin to work in these field without going through painful rituals (school, licence, apprenticeship and other tasks.) Malpractice is not treated lightly. They do not talk about: "why don't we have good written-down practices"; they have them and everyone follows them at risk of banishment. Now, lets talk about Software. You question has been the basis of books. Yet, where are the best-practice? Robert Martin coughed up one and Joel Spolsky ridiculed him to the point of insult and assualt. At least Martin tried to bring up some standards. Any Tom, Dick, Harry, Sally and Sue can start practicing Software development. If you do rubish, just leave your company (or get fired) and do rubish somewhere else. No one will rebuke you. Licence? IEEE tried it and who cares? Texas, USA tried it and who cares? Talk about certification and your work will be trashed (like one of Steve McConnel book- Software Professionalism.) This was a tirade; but I went through it to tell you the state of things. Software just need time to mature and failures to get the government involved and big ad powerfuls heads to roll because it mature like Civil Engineering. I doubt if that will be anytime soon; but it should be in the far future.
