Presume that "Cloud Computing" is PaaS and/or IaaS... "Hosted systems, applications, services, and storage" then we have been "Programming in the cloud" via IDEs, CDEs, and similar since mainframes. My teams have programmed from half a world away in the cloud via remote sessions running on mainframes, server clusters, dedicated servers and VMs, team servers, shared project servers, ... etc. for decades; although most of those hosts were in "Private Clouds." Evolution happened and happens, as your link and other links demonstrate IDEs , CDEs, and similar are available in the public cloud today. Evolution will also resolve trust issues. By their very nature and sensitivity some things must and always be “dark” … secured away in areas with no communication capabilities except internally… as they are now in the dark private clouds. New "cloud forms" unknown in nature and name by us today will evolve and emerge from the mist of the cloud and elsewhere. Perhaps one day “Cloud Computing” will evolve into something we may name “Universe Computing” or “??? Computing” What would “Universe Computing” or “??? Computing” be?
