ARIMA on top of exponential smoothing for forecasting

I have time series data on temperature, both hourly and daily. I want to forecast the time series. Is it possible to combine ARIMA model and Exponential Smoothing methods to achieve the goal? Would this be feasible? auto.arima(afex_d) ets(afex_d) auto.arima(ets(afex_d)$fitted) Edit (new information from a comment) : I applied ets and got the best model. After that I took the fitted data and applied auto.arima on it. On the other hand, I applied auto.arima on the original series and got the best model. Can I compare between the two ARIMA models based on AIC?
