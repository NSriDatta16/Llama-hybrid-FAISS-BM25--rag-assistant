Try swapping the order of Disallow / Allow: User-agent: * Allow: /index.php Disallow: / See this info from wikipedia: "Yet, in order to be compatible to all robots, if you want to allow single files inside an otherwise disallowed directory, you need to place the Allow directive(s) first, followed by the Disallow, for example:" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt Still I wouldn't expect it to work too consistently
