Stuck with interactions in logistic regression analysis

I would like to get some tips, because I am currently stuck with my regression part. I am using binary logistic regression. The aim is to compare two separate groups' responses. I have a MV (moderator variable, 1-one group, 0-other group). My IV (independent variables are 11 and all of them were measured on 7-point Likert scale). My DV (dependent variable or outcome is choice of 2 categories). First problem I face: I used the median split approach to obtain my DV for each respondent, as I do not have my DV, which I have to obtain to run regression. Second, I tried to run 2 separate regressions for two groups, though my coefficients were poorly significant. Than I tried to run a one model with interactions. Calculating product term for each IV (IV1mean_centered* MVmean_centered) etc. for all IV I have. While running a regression I entered all the IV's vs. my MV and also calculated product terms with MV_centered (also tried without mean centering and with only MV). My issue is that my coefficients are even less significant than with separate models!!! Does anyone have some suggestions how to solve this issue? Maybe I have made some mistake regarding interactions in logistic regression?
