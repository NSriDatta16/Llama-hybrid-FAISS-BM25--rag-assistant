I'm not sure if you have ever used it but iGoogle allows you to customise the google homepage to display information from around the web. You can add tabs to the page to allow you to split the information up. It's extremely useful and as you can log into it from any computer / browser you can access your feeds anywhere. If you have a lot of feeds of one type or feeds that update infrequently then iGoogle can also be combined with google reader. It's also great for adding other plugins like gmail, games, Dilbert :) and more. To create an iGoogle page go to the google home page and click the iGoogle link in the top right corner. iGoogle will then provide you with a starter page and some suggested content which you can add or ignore. If you click the "Add Stuff" link then "Add feed or gadget" you can manually add all your RSS feeds. However, you can also configure Firefox to automatically select google as your RSS reader when ever you click on an RSS feed icon in the navigation bar. You can select / change this under Tools -> Options -> Applications -> Web Feed. In order to use your iGoogle on multiple browsers / computers you will need a gmail / google account however it's free and easy to create. T
