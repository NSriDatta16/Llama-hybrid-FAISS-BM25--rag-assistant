The core of Q-learning is to learn a function $Q$ which maps state-action pairs to the expected discounted future reward. This function can be represented in a variety of ways As a look-up table (each row containing state, action, and expected reward) As a linear or nonlinear regression model mapping state-action to reward. Deep Q-learning is simply an extension of representation 2 to using a much deeper and higher capacity regression model.
