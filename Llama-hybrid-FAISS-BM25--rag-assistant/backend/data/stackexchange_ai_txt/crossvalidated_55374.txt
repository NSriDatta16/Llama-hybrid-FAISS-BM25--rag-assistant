If I understood you correctly, you have many data for class A (auth.) and almost any for class B (imposter) in your (randomly chosen?) training set? From Wikipedia (Pseudocount) , In any observed data set or sample there is the possibility, especially with low-probability events and/or small data sets, of a possible event not occurring. Its observed frequency is therefore zero, apparently implying a probability of zero. This is an oversimplification, which is inaccurate and often unhelpful, particularly in probability-based machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks and hidden Markov models. By artificially adjusting the probability of rare (but not impossible) events so those probabilities are not exactly zero, we avoid the zero-frequency problem. Also see Cromwell's rule. So I would therefore artificially include some data for the other, very rare label/class.
