None in Java API comes to mind since it's intented to be platformindependent and the retrieval of the information you're describing here is heavily platform (and webbrowser!) dependent. If you don't worry about for example a Windows-only solution, then first write (or search) a solution in platform-native language, like C/C++ and then call this in Java with help of Java Native Interface (JNI) .
