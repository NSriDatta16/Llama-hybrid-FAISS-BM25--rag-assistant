Hibernate is performing unwanted SELECTs on call to saveOrUpdate

Let's say I have a House entity which maps to many Person entities. I then load an existing House which has 20 occupants. beginTransaction(); House house = houseDao.find(1L); commitTransaction(); Later in the code, I can then add a new Person to the House: ... List people = house.getPeople(); people.add(new Person("Dilbert")); .... When I make the call: session.saveOrUpdate(house); Hibernate performs 21 queries: 1 to SELECT the House and 20 to SELECT each existing Person in the House. I'm sure it's a small issue on my part, however, what should I do so that I can add a new Person to the house without having such a heavy hit on the database in this situation? This is all done within the same session.
