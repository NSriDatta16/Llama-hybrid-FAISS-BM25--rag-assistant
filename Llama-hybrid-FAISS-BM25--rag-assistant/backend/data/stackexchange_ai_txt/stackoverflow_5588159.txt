This is a pretty well understood area. It also goes under the name "demand forecasting", "inventory management", or "inventory replenishment." A simple technique that works well is called "exponential smoothing." It came out of research done in the 40s for the Navy - looking at how to keep shipyards stocked for building warships. The original paper by Charles C. Holt, "Forecasting seasonals and trends by exponentially weighted moving averages," was reprinted in 2004 in the " International Journal of Forecasting ," but I am sure you can find other tutorials and articles - it's become a standard technique. There is a stackexchange which includes this topic: http://stats.stackexchange.com . "Forecasting" and "smoothing" are good tags to use. Rob Hyndman over there has given many good answers and written at least one book on the subject: " Forecasting: Methods and Applications ".
