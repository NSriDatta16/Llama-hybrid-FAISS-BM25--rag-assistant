I'd say the reverse is true: "bias is always an ethical issue, but it is not necessarily true that an ethical issue is always a bias" . "bias is always an ethical issue" because like you said, a model may discriminate against people of color when it comes to hiring, for example. Even if the model is correct (this is very unlikely and if it happened it is caused by confounding variables obviously), it is unethical to decide not to hire someone because of their skin color. More generally, we should not leave out a group of people entirely. "an ethical issue may not be a bias" because there are many ethical issues related to Machine Learning that do not involve bias. For example: Government Surveillance: the government uses cameras incorporated with facial recognition to track activities and location of certain people of interest. Deep fake videos: a video of a person in which their face or body has been digitally altered so that they appear to be someone else, typically used maliciously or to spread false information.
