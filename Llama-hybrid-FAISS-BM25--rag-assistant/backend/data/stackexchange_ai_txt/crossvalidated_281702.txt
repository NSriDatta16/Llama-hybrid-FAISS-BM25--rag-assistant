What is the intuition behind convolutional neural network?

I am familiar with the multilayer perceptron neural network but not convolutional neural network. What is the intuition behind it? I have learned Convolution Theorem from digital signal process literature, where "Convolution in one domain (e.g., time domain) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e.g., frequency domain)." Can I understand the convolutional neural network is similar to Fourier basis expansion that extract frequency features from data?
