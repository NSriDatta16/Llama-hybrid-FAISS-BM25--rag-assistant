How to properly truncate exponential distribution to represent random memory-less arrivals?

Typically, Poisson and exponential distributions are used to represent random memory-less arrival processes. It has come to my attention, however, that a more realistic distribution is a truncated (or would it be shifted?) exponential distribution in order to not have physically impossible inter-arrival times (e.g. 0.1 seconds between two people/cars/etc). I have been doing some reading, and from my understanding that would be achieved by shifting the exponential distribution to the right (i.e. if the minimum acceptable inter-arrival time is 2 seconds, then shift the distribution to the right by 2 seconds). My confusion now is in regards to the properties of the typical exponential distribution that no longer hold, mainly mean = variance . Instead (and I could be wrong), it seems that the mean becomes 1/lambda + shift whereas the variance remains as 1/lambda . Not only that, but the most important input, being the mean inter-arrival time, no longer represent true conditions due to the shift (if the original mean was 5 seconds, now the new mean is 7 seconds). Would this need correction? If so, how is this corrected?
