Do not worry about single words. State-of-the-art PoST models are typically based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). They take sequences of words as inputs, and classify them based on their context words. If your model is good, a single word that is part of a broader expression should be classifier correctly. The main dataset that I reccomend is the free part of the Penn Treebank dataset, available from python library nltk . From the same module you can also download the Brown corpus. there are compatibility problems between the two (the PoS tags are different), however you could assemble them together using universal tagset (less precise, but applicable to both). Additionally, check this great Kaggle dataset . It's a dataset for both PoST and NER tasks, and you can use it to train your classifier. (It seems the tagset is the same of Penn Treebank, which means you might assemble the two datasets into an even bigger one.)
