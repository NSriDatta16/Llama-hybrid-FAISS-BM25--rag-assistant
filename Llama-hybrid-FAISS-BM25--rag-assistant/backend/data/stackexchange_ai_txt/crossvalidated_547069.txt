A problem in the derivation of distributed multiple model filtering

I have some problems with the derivation of multi-model filtering in a paper. The involved statements in this paper are as follows. My question is how did the above formula get from left to right? Also, does the "first two moments of $x_k$ " in paragraph 1 refer to the first two time steps? why specifically mentioned here? The paper's link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5953482 Thanks in advance!
