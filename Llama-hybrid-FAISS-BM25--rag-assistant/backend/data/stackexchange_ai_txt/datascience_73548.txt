So here is my thought. I suggest you do some sort of clustering of images. It is okay if it is not a robust one. use any pre-trained model architecture of Inception which has been trained on huge corpus. Freeze the layers and take the feature encodings on the images by passing them through the inception model (Output of FC layer) apply pca and form cluster (n=number of classes) For both dataset A and B do the clustering and from each cluster select 80% for training and keep 20% for testing. In this way your model which you will train using this data will have all variations from both set and your test set will also contain the same variations as of your train data. Train and Test set will be an ideal data with all variations.
