Effectively Decreasing Website Load Time [SEO Perspective]

As we know that website load time is now an important factor in Search Engine ranking and Google, especially, is taking this into account. Now I've study all those techniques like minimize http requests, compress css, javascript at footer, compressed images and so on. But sadly they are not putting a great impact on the load time on my blog. Google webmaster tools says that my average blog-page loads time is 11.8 sec which is slower than 98% of the sites. This is really making me worried as I receive handsome traffic from Google and I don't want to lose that. Can anybody suggest a technique that can reduce the time massively, to 2-3 seconds?
