Threshold for your output neuron is also a hyper-parameter and can be tuned just like others. The $0.5$ suggestion is probably for sigmoid function, because it is symmetric around 0 and hits $0.5$ at $0$ . Similarly for tanh ( check its symmetry), the so-called suggested is probably $0$ , not $0.5$ . But this is like saying your suggested neural network size is 2 layers etc. You should also tune your threshold. Several statistics such as ROC curve, Precision/Recall curves are obtained the measure the performance while changing this threshold, and they're used to understand the behavior of the system. By the way, a more commonly suggested option for sigmoid , for instance, is to use your class priors.
