Getting a Signature Mismatch Error when Compiling Even though it Matches in VS.NET 2005

I changed a reference in my project from pointing to a specific hard-coded DLL to a project reference and now I'm getting an error telling me that the signature for some event handlers don't match even though they do. Here's one exact message: Method 'Private Sub ObjectsGrid_CellChange(sender As Object, e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.CellEventArgs)' cannot handle Event 'Public Event CellChange(sender As Object, e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.CellEventArgs)' because they do not have the same signature. What's also odd is if I drop the control in the GUI editor and have VS automatically create the handler, it still produces the same error.
