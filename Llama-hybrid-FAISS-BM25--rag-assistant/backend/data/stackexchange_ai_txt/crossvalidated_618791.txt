In Rob Hyndman's blog post , he shows both methods as valid. Multi-step forecasts with re-estimation An alternative approach is to extend the training data and re-estimate the model at each iteration, before each forecast is computed. This is what I call “time series cross-validation” because it is analogous to leave-one-out cross-validation for cross-sectional data. This time, I will store the forecasts from 1- to 5-steps ahead at each iteration. h A variation on this also re-selects the model at each iteration. Then the second >line in the loop is replaced with refit
