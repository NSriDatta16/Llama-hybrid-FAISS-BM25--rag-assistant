realtime measurement of mouse click intervals

I'm writing a application[net/wpf/c#] that is supposed to measure how fast an user clicks (responds) after hearing a word. Its called a Auditory Processing Speed Test (PST) and the average human speed is around 70-140ms. To get an idea of the precision of events generated, I wrote the following. public partial class MainWindow : Window { System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch w = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch(); public MainWindow () { InitializeComponent(); } private void textBlock1_PreviewMouseDown (object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { e.Handled = true; w.Stop(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(w.ElapsedMilliseconds); w.Reset(); w.Start(); } private void Grid_KeyDown (object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { e.Handled = true; w.Stop(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(w.ElapsedMilliseconds); w.Reset(); w.Start(); } } private void Application_Startup (object sender, StartupEventArgs e) { Process thisProc = Process.GetCurrentProcess(); thisProc.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime; ProcessThreadCollection myThreads = thisProc.Threads; foreach (ProcessThread pt in myThreads) { pt.PriorityLevel = ThreadPriorityLevel.TimeCritical; } } The fastest I can click is around 100ms, and if the keep the keyboard key depressed then down I get down to 30ms of response time. Is there any way I can make it faster? TIA
