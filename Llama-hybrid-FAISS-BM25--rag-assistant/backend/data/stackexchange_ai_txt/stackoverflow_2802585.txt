I'm not an expert in Symfony, but these links should help You. Besides, because I am new to this forum, stackowerfolow lets me post just 1 link, so my second link will be explanation how to find it. ;) http://forum.symfony-project.org/index.php/m/92916/ Google: The Definitive Guide to symfony 1.2 (should be still relevant) . There check the chapter 17 - "Extending Symfony" under the paragraph Plugins .
