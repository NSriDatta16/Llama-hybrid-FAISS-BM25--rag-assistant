How to apply a fitted Tree-augmented Naive Bayes classifier to new cases

I am running Tree Augmented Naive Bayes algorithm in R and I have got the desired network. However, unlike logistic regression, Bayesian is non-parametric i.e. I do not have any coefficients which I can save and use to calculate fresh scores. I wanted to understand ways to implement the Bayesian output in SQL frame i.e. how can I automate it in SQL so that for every round of fresh data, I run the trained network to predict the probability score. I am trying to use the conditional probability tables from bn.fit and back calculate the predicted probabilities using conditional independence and Bayes theorm. But my results are not matching with R's predicted probabilities output.
