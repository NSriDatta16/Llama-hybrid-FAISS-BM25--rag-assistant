Of course this problem could be solved but you see the advantage of developing in PHP in this particular case. Did you ever wonder in which language the portable PHP interpreter is written? In ANSI C. So, before you dismiss the portability of ANSI C again, ask yourself in which language your favorite programming language has been written... (tip: almost all were written in C/C++). ANSI C compilers are available on all the platforms I had to work on -and the same is not true for PHP and its gigantic runtime. So much for the portability argument.
