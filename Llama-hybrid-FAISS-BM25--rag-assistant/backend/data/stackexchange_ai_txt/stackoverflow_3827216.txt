This functionality is built into the Character.UnicodeBlock class. Some examples of the Unicode blocks related to the Japanese language: Character.UnicodeBlock.of('誰') == CJK_UNIFIED_IDEOGRAPHS Character.UnicodeBlock.of('か') == HIRAGANA Character.UnicodeBlock.of('フ') == KATAKANA Character.UnicodeBlock.of('ﾌ') == HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS Character.UnicodeBlock.of('！') == HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS Character.UnicodeBlock.of('。') == CJK_SYMBOLS_AND_PUNCTUATION But, as always, the devil is in the details: Character.UnicodeBlock.of('Ａ') == HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS where Ａ is the full-width character. So this is in the same category as the halfwidth Katakana ﾌ above. Note that the full-width Ａ is different from the normal (half-width) A : Character.UnicodeBlock.of('A') == BASIC_LATIN
