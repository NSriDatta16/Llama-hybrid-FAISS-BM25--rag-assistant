Clear Text Selection with JavaScript

Simple question which I can't find the answer to: How can I use JavaScript (or jQuery) to deselect any text which may be selected on a webpage? E.G. user clicks and drags to highlight a bit of text - I want to have a function deselectAll() which clears this selection. How should I go about writing it? Thanks for the help.
