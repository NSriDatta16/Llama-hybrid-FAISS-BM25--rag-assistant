This toy clustering benchmark contains various data sets in ARFF format (could be easily converted to CSV), mostly with ground truth labels. The benchmark should validate basic desired properties of clustering algorithms. Most of the data sets comes from the clustering papers like: BIRCH - Zhang, Tian, Raghu Ramakrishnan, and Miron Livny.
