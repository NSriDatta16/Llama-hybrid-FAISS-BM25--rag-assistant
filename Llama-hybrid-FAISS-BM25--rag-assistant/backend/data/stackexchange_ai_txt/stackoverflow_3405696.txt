Adhoc app not showing in iTunes when dragged in

Distribution certificate recently expired so had to create another one. Everything seemed to work ok - I made a zipped build with the profile & app file. Sent to a co-worker who installed with no problem. Sent to another who had a "signer invalid" message and the client I sent to says they get a "do you want to replace embedded mobile provisioning profile?" message, which I prompt them to say yes too, and then the app does not appear on their list. So iTunes accepts the app but nothing shows. Confused as to how it can have different results on different machines. Any ideas?
