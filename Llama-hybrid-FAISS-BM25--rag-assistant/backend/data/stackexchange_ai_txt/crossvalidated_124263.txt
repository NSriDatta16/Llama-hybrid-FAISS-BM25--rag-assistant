Time series regression with lagged dependent and independent variables

I have monthly data for air passengers, oil price and unemployment. I'm trying to create a model to forecast air travel demand using oil price and unemployment as explanatory variables but are facing some problems: - Passengers data is measured as percentage change between two months year t, minus the percentage change in the same months the previous year. I've made this model as a seasonal arima (0,1,1)*(0,1,1) which is known as the airline model. How do I compute a model where lags of the oil price and unemployment rate are included to predict the percentage change in passengers? I want it to be a model that makes the forecasts using both the time series forecast and whatever explanatory power the lagged oil price might have. Do you have any ideas on models, similar studies, methods etc I'd be forever thankful.
