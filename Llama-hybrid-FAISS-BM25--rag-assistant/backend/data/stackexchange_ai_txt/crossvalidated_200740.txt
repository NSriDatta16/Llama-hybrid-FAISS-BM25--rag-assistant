Daryl Pregibon has written a key paper on LR diagnostics. It looks like it's only available from the publisher: Daryl Pregibon. Logistic regression diagnostics. The Annals of Statistics, volume 9, pages 705â€“724, 1981 That said and from a practitioner's point of view, I would be comfortable using the metrics that have been developed for OLS regression such as the VIF or the eigenvalue-based collinearity index. The best source for this class of diagnostics is Belsey, Kuh and Welsch's book Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity : http://www.amazon.com/Regression-Diagnostics-Identifying-Influential-Collinearity/dp/0471691178/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457527579&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=regression+diagnositcs+belsey Of course, stringent purists or a PhD dissertation committee would likely object to leveraging these readily available and easily implemented methods but they stand as useful proxies for the real thing.
