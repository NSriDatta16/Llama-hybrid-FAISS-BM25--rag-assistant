Sometimes a client wants two y scales. Giving them the "flawed" speech is often pointless. But I do like the ggplot2 insistence on doing things the right way. I am sure that ggplot is in fact educating the average user about proper visualization techniques. Maybe you can use faceting and scale free to compare the two data series? - e.g. look here: https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/wiki/Align-two-plots-on-a-page
