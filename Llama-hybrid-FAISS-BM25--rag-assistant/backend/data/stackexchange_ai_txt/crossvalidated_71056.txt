The predictive distribution is usually used when you have learned a posterior distribution for the parameter of some sort of predictive model. For example in Bayesian linear regression, you learn a posterior distribution over the w parameter of the model y=wX given some observed data X. Then when a new unseen data point x* comes in, you want to find the distribution over possible predictions y* given the posterior distribution for w that you just learned. This distribution over possible y*'s given the posterior for w is the prediction distribution.
