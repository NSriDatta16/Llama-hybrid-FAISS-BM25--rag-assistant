Missing Data (mice) and Survey Package r

First, I am new to analyzing public opinion polls and the r package "Survey". I would like some advice. I am running a regression model with weights from a Pew survey, however, I noticed that a significant portion of my data is missing because of the covariates. As a robustness check, I would like to impute my data set. I would like some advice on the best way to handle this in r. I am most familiar with using the "mice" package in r to handle missing data. I don't believe "survey" can accommodate mice. Should I separate each imputed dataset and then perform a regression analysis (using "survey") for each dataset? Is this the most efficient method? Finally, how do you pool the estimates? You don't average the estimates from all the imputed data sets, do you?
