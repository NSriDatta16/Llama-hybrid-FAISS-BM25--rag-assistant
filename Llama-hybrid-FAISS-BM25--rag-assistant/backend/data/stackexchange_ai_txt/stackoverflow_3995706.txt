Apache webserver crashing!

I am using a Wampserver 2.0 for database-web development. When i ran the following the php code which is embbeded in my html form, the server crashes meanwhile other php processes on different pages are responding effectively. I have checked my apache error log and saw the following message: [Fri Oct 22 11:37:04 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: C:/wamp/www/setapro/setapro, referer: This is php code i executed: Table:Averages for the GPS Receiver "; while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){ echo $row['Mean Number of Satelites'].' '.$row['Mean of HDOP'].' '.$row['Mean of Longitude'].' '.$row['Mean of latitude'].' '; } mysql_free_result($result); mysql_close(); ?> I do not know which file it is talking about as i have all the files in my document root. I need some assistance here. thank you. the "setapro" is the project folder name and not the file.
