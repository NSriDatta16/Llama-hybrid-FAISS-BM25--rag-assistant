In your class declaration, declare a button object, and make sure it is specified as an IBOutlet: IBOutlet UIButton* myButton; Once you save this change, if you go back to Interface Builder, you should see this outlet when you right click on your File's Owner (assuming you have specified the File's Owner properly). Associate this outlet with the onscreen UIButton by right-click dragging. Now the on screen object is associated with your in-code name. Whereever you want to change the text on the UIButton, just say: [myButton setTitle:@"Back - or whatever else you want it to say" forState: UIControlStateNormal ]; // you can set different title text for each state // of the button (selected, active, or normal)
