Extension SNMP Agent C#

I am a complete newbie to SNMP. Recently, I am trying to write a simple program that is supposed to monitor and modify a data file in a remote machine. The file itself could just be a plain-text file or whatsoever. I was introduced to the SNMP, and tried to figure out a way to make SNMP do the job in Windows OS. The prefered language is C# or any .net. I have been googling for a few days, however, did not find a good how-to instruction to do so. Really need help on this to get my job done. Thank you very much, Terry
