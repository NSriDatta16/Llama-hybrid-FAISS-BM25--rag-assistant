Not sure if its the problem, but I'd enclose all your parameters in quotes. should really be: additionally, depending on your Doctype, you may want to change to Things that are allowed in direct HTML are not necessarily allowed using innerHTML. For example, in Firefox, try embedding a form within a form in JS vs html, or in IE, try putting a block element inside an inline element. They both work fine, if you have it in HTML, but if you try it with innerHTML, both browsers will complain.
