The BayesianTools R package (disclaimer: I am one of the authors) allows specifying arbitrary priors, and there is a function createPriorDensity for summarising the posterior as a new prior. The limitation of this is that we currently only implement a multivariate normal density estimator, so you will have a loss of information if your posterior is not approximately multivariate normal, which is likely the case if you have weak data. Extending the function to include more flexible density estimators (e.g. gaussian processes) is on our todo list, but it's quite tricky to get this stable, so I'm not sure when we will have this working. In general, creating reliable empirical density estimates in high-dimensional parameter spaces is extremely tricky, regardless of the software you are using. If possible, I would therefore recommend For a few updates to just accept the computational costs and compute the model again with the full / updated data For frequent updates, consider using SMC instead of MCMC sampling, which doesn't require a density estimate for updating the posterior with new data (the BT package has a rudimentary SMC sampler on CRAN, and a more evolved sampler in a development branch)
