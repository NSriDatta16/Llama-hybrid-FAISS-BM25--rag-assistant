It appears that you have 5 cluster labels and a binary outcome. Just fit a logistic regression with the cluster label as the independent variable, and check for significance of the 4 coefficient estimates that pop out. You may need to do a multiple testing control, depending on what exactly you are checking for (significant differences between ALL groups vs. any pair of groups, for instance). If the outcome were continuous, a classic ANOVA will work and the likelihood ratio test it entails will tell you if the clustering is significantly informative of the outcome or not. If categorical, do a Pearson chi-square test for independence.
