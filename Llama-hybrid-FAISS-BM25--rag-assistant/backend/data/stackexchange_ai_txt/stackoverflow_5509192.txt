Now I have an business logic object that does not have any reference to the controller. But I would like to get the current user. Is there any way of accessing this? So why can't you just pass the current user to those methods? Additionally you can mix them in. I strongly discourage you to write the static helpers (it is not Java, it is Ruby!). Instead, where you need those helpers include them as a module: module SuperLogic def calculate_stuff(current_user=nil) (current_user || user || self).bills.sum end edn Then include this where you need it: # user model class User include SuperLogic #it will get the `calculate_stuff` method end # controller include SuperLogic # so you can use it as one of calculate_stuff user calculate_stuff and so on... additionally where you access your business logic, you can just create an instance of the class instead of "static" methods (in ruby they are "class" methods): # controller def calculate @result = BusinessLogic.new(user).calculate_stuff end This is probably the easiest thing you can do. Really, you don't need to access whole HTTP context in your business objects (I'm not even talking about testing it).
