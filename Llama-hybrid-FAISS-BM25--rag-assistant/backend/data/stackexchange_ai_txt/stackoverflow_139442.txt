Yes, I have seen it successful. In the cases where it was successful they used a hierarchical approach. Rather than having a single massive Gannt chart with hundreds of tasks, there was a master chart for the whole project, with top-level goals. Then there were separate charts for the accomplishment of the sub-goals. Although this limits flexibility in one way (you can't automatically balance resources across sub-goal teams), it seems to match better to the way humans operate well: in small or mid-sized teams.
