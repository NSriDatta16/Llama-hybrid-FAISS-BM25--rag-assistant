My commenting ability isn't turned on yet, hopefully no one will say "rightfully" based on my answer... Pretty-ing up the ugly code could/should be defined as trying to achieve: Readability (OK, stating the obvious -- redundant to the question perhaps) Performance -- at best seeking optimal, at worst it's not a big drain Pragmatism -- it's not far off the way most people do things, given an ordinary problem that's not in need of an elegant or unique solution, changing it later on should be a natural effort, not in need of much recollection. IMO the answer given by org.life.java was the prettiest and extremely easy to read. I also liked the order in which the conditions were written, for reasons of reading and performance. Looking over all the comments on this subject, at the time of my writing, it appears that only org.life.java raised the issue of performance (and maybe mfloryan, too, stating something would be "longer"). Certainly in most situations, and given this example it shouldn't bear a noticeable slowdown however you write it. However, by nesting your conditions and optimally ordering the conditions can improve performance [worthwhile, particularly if this were looped]. All that being said, nesting and ordering conditions (that are more complex than your example) brought on by determination to achieve as fast as possible execution will often produce less readable code, and code that's harder to change. I refer again to #3, pragmatism... balancing the needs.
