transform a supervised neural network to reinforcement learning?

I have a functional LSTM model that works with an acceptable performance. How can I now convert this supervised model to a reinforcement learning model for improving the performane? Is there any example about how to transform a supervised model to a reinforcement learning model? Details: I have a multi-input multi-output system (since I can not share the actual problem lets assume weather forcast as example) where I need to predict the output (e.g temperature, wind speed, etc) in real time . I have a large dataset and I trianed a supervised learning model that can do the predictions pretty well in real time . The problem is that sometimes there is big deviation between predictions and actual values. This means that probably there was a new trend in the inputs that has never been in the data sets. For such cases, I would like to gradually enhance my model predictions. Does it mean that I have to train again my model with the old dataset and the new data or I can simply have a RL mechansim to gradually improve the model?
