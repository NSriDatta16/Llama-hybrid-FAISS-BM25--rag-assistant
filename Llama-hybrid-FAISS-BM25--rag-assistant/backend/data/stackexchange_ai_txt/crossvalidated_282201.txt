I recommend against matching. If you do not match you can use logistic regression or other multivariable methods appropriate for a binary outcome. If you do decide to use matching, then there are models for logistic regression (and similar methods) that are appropriate for matched outcomes, either 1:1 or k:1, that is, where multiple controls are matched to each case. Usually matching isn't worth doing unless your data collection is quite expensive, involving, for example, an extended interview process or the collection and analysis of samples of material. The special methods needed for analysis are harder to interpret as well. Don't do it unless it saves you real money.
