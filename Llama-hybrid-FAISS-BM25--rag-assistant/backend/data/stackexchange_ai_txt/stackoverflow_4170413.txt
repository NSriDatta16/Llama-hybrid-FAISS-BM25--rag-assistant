Approach to developing mobile application that supports a web application

My company built its own project management web application. It's like basecamp on steroids. The core features of this application are: create task lists assign tasks to team members track hours against task items I am looking to build mobile application(s) as an extension to the web application. The mobile applications(s) must: reproduce the features mentioned above connect to the same database as the web application retain drag drop capabilities provide a rich user experience equivalent to or better than the web application work on iphone, droid and blackberry Given the requirements above, how should I approach the development of this mobile application? There's about 20 smart phone users in my company: 8 iphones, 7 droids and 5 blackberries. I've heard of development frameworks like Phonegap that allow you to develop in HTML, Javascript and CSS. The software then works cross platform across blackberry, iphone and droid. If I am an average/slightly-above-average programmer, will I be able to build a high quality cross platform mobile application with PhoneGap (or another x platform development framework) that meets the above requirements? Or should I build each iphone, droid and blackberry application independently? What's the best approach? What are the trade offs?
