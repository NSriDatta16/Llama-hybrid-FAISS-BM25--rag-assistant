How to tune hyperparamters and use CalibratedClassifierCV correctly

Let's say that I have a classifier C ( for example a random forest classifier) and a Dataset. From what I understand I can: prefit the classifier on a portion of data and then "calibrate it" on the other portion. use the method option to fit both the classifier and the regressor (calibrator) using a CV approach. I have then two questions about how should i act with respect to hyperparamter tuning in this setting: should I tune the hyperparameters, for example with a gridsearchCV, on the "first" portion of data (using CV), then retrain it on the whole first portion and finally tune the calibrator on the part I kept away? IN this case, how should i tune the hyperparamter? Should Ii tune them on the whole dataset and then feed the ones I found to the model I pass to the CalibratedClassifierCV?
