How to calculate the slope of noisy time series data

I have a process that consumes multiple sources of live price data from the forex market and produces 2 streams of time series data as its output. The output is noisy (i.e. not smooth like sin or cos), and both streams are bound between the values of 0 and 100. Is there an approach in machine learning or AI that can help me identify when 1 signal is steeply positive and one is steeply negative? I have toyed around with simple moving averages and exponential moving averages to smooth out the lines a little, but I lose too much information that way.
