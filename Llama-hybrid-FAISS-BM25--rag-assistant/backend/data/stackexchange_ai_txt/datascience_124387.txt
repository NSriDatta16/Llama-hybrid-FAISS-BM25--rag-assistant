Language models will experience difficulties processing in an analytical way tabular data and answering complex questions about it because of how they work (just predicting the next token). Maybe you can achieve some interesting results with really big models but an approach that seems more promising to me is to pass the basic structure of a dataset to the models, like describing what a row and what each column represents, and asknig the model to write a SQL query that answers your questions. Example: "My dataset consists of household sales data. Each row is a sale and there are 3 columns: SaleID, Price, Year. Write a SQL query that generates the most expensive house sold by year."
