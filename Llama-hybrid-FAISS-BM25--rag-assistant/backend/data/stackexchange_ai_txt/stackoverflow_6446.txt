There are more than a few people who don't like break and continue . The latest complaint I saw about them was in JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford. But I find that sometimes using one of them really simplifies things, especially if your language doesn't include a do-while or do-until style of loop. I tend to use break in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there's no point in continuing, so you might as well quit. I use continue when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The break statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something. Instead of: Ask a question While the answer is invalid: Ask the question You could eliminate some duplication and use: While True: Ask a question If the answer is valid: break The do-until loop that I mentioned before is the more elegant solution for that particular problem: Do: Ask a question Until the answer is valid No duplication, and no break needed either.
