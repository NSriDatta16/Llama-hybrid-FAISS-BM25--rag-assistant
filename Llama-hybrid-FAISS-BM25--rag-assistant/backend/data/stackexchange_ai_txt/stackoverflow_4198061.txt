I switched the onload event from jQuery's document.ready to window.ready. It worked properly about 30% of the time, so it was definitely a timing issue. It seemed the main JavaScript function on the page, which is retrieving list items, was running slowly. I just moved this entire expanding function to the end of that list retrieval function, so it just runs linearly.
