Help determining model and interpreting coefficients of log-linear relationship

I am trying to determine if the hospital I work at should open a new unit for admissions. I intend to do this by correlating patient assigned unit and length of stay in days. So far, I have determined that the continuous dependent variable (length of stay in days) should be log transformed, as well as the continuous age variable. Unit is categorical and contains 7 categories (unit 65, unit 66, unit 67, unit 75, unit 76, unit 77, unit 94). Gender is standard 0=male and 1=female. My regression equation is as follows: log_glm Model Summary: glm(formula = log(days) ~ gender + log(age) + unit, family = gaussian, data = data2022) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.3606 -0.6712 0.0011 0.7146 2.8338 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.7416 0.9994 0.742 0.459064 gender 0.3257 0.2082 1.564 0.119566 log(age) 1.3809 0.2353 5.870 2.17e-08 *** unitunit_66 0.1329 0.2994 0.444 0.657717 unitunit_67 1.2518 0.3334 3.755 0.000237 *** unitunit_75 -1.8108 0.3067 -5.903 1.84e-08 *** unitunit_76 0.2797 0.3120 0.896 0.371355 unitunit_77 -0.3540 0.3178 -1.114 0.266803 unitunit_94 0.1876 0.5350 0.351 0.726339 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 1.145772) Null deviance: 429.95 on 181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 198.22 on 173 degrees of freedom (14 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 552.03 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2 All units at this hospital house patients with different needs. Is it appropriate to "compare" each unit in the summary output to the reference unit when all units are unique? Is this interpretation correct: Unit 67 is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The coefficient is 1.2518, so being assigned to unit 67 is associated with a length of stay in days 249.6631% ((exp(1.2518)-1 100) higher on average than those assigned to unit 65.* Doubting myself because that result seemed too high and interpretation incorrect, I tried a model with dummy variables for unit, where unit_65 is 1 for patients in unit 65 and 0 if they are not in that unit, and so on: log_glm_age With output: glm(formula = log(days) ~ gender + log(age) + unit_65 + unit_66 + unit_67 + unit_75 + unit_76 + unit_77 + unit_94, family = gaussian, data = data2022) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.3606 -0.6712 0.0011 0.7146 2.8338 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.92919 1.10243 0.843 0.400475 gender 0.32568 0.20819 1.564 0.119566 log(age) 1.38094 0.23525 5.870 2.17e-08 *** unit_65 -0.18755 0.53500 -0.351 0.726339 unit_66 -0.05465 0.52964 -0.103 0.917936 unit_67 1.06427 0.55764 1.909 0.057979 . unit_75 -1.99832 0.53701 -3.721 0.000268 *** unit_76 0.09213 0.54694 0.168 0.866435 unit_77 -0.54160 0.52780 -1.026 0.306252 unit_94 NA NA NA NA --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 1.145772) Null deviance: 429.95 on 181 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 198.22 on 173 degrees of freedom (14 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 552.03 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2 But I am having doubts interpreting this. Since each patient is only admitted to one unit, is it appropriate to have all units in the model? I don't know if it's because I am the only analyst in the entire hospital and can't discuss this with anyone who understands or if I'm having a weird day, but I can't figure out what is correct right now and could use some guidance.
