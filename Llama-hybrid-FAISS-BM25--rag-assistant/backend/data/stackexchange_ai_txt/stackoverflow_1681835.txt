Eclipse plugins really aren't that hard; they take a little getting used to, but not too long. Think about adding whatever functionality you want to the eclipse IDE. You can leverage other plugin functionality (such as JDT, which includes the search functionality you're looking for). You can then provide your plugins for all eclipse users to use, rather than develop another standalone tool.
