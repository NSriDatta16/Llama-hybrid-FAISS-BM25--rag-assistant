How to calculate the Bayesian posterior probability from observations?

Let's say I give you a 10-sided die and tell you that it is biased in some way. I then let you roll the die 5 times and you observe, let's say, 8, 8, 8, 2, and 8. Lastly, I ask you what your belief is regarding how the die is biased. How would you use Bayes' Theorem in this situation to go from complete ignorance to an informed belief?
