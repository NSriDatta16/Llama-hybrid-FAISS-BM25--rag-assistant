If you fit two models, one with logit and one with cloglog, you should report the results of both, and also carry out some type of model comparison technique and report the results of that. As for the models, this is a great situation in which to use Bayesian multilevel models (see this paper [PDF] by Gelman). We can pool information among groups to inform the estimates for groups with smaller sample sizes and for groups with seemingly extreme outcomes (as in phth and pltl). Fitting multilevel models with the brms package is fairly straightforward. The two models here, one with a logit link and one with a cloglog link, would be fit as follows: fit1 These will each generate 72000 samples from the models, which can be accessed with as.data.frame(fit) . After applying the inverse logit and inverse cloglog to the samples, we get the following estimates for the desired probabilities: group prob using logit sd 89% probability interval -------------------------------------------------------------- pctc 0.405 0.169 0.12 to 0.66 pcth 0.562 0.135 0.34 to 0.78 pctl 0.438 0.170 0.15 to 0.7 phtc 0.604 0.141 0.39 to 0.84 phth 0.729 0.162 0.52 to 1 phtl 0.529 0.142 0.3 to 0.76 pltc 0.532 0.157 0.28 to 0.79 plth 0.539 0.180 0.24 to 0.84 pltl 0.623 0.193 0.39 to 1 group prob using cloglog sd 89% probability interval ---------------------------------------------------------------- pctc 0.395 0.162 0.12 to 0.64 pcth 0.545 0.136 0.32 to 0.76 pctl 0.422 0.164 0.14 to 0.67 phtc 0.589 0.144 0.36 to 0.83 phth 0.760 0.182 0.52 to 1 phtl 0.511 0.142 0.28 to 0.74 pltc 0.512 0.158 0.25 to 0.77 plth 0.517 0.181 0.21 to 0.81 pltl 0.627 0.213 0.37 to 1 Overall, the model using the cloglog link induced less shrinkage in the probabilities. It's worth noting that the 89% probability intervals for phth are the same in the two models. The brms package supports model comparison using PSIS-LOO . Using the command loo(fit1, fit2, reloo = TRUE) takes a while but eventually returns the following result: LOOIC SE fit1 59.19 2.95 fit2 58.59 2.91 fit1 - fit2 0.60 0.46 Here the model with lower LOOIC is estimated to have better out-of-sample prediction accuracy. The model with the cloglog link has marginally lower LOOIC, and the standard error on the difference, 0.46, is small, so we would conclude that the model using the cloglog link is marginally better than the one using the logit link.
