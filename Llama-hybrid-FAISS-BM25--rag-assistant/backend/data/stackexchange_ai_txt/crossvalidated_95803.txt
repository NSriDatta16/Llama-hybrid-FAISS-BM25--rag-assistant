characteristic roots of AR(p)

In Tsay's Financial Time Series, for a AR(p) process, In the time series literature, inverses of the two solutions (to the characteristic equation of AR(2)) are referred to as the characteristic roots of the AR(2) model . From other areas of mathematics where the concept of characteristic equations also exists, e.g. difference equations, differential equation, eigenvalues of matrices, isn't the characteristic roots define as the solutions to the characteristic equations? If yes, what the book says is very unusual, and confusing. I hope this is not widely used in time series.
