While I don't have an answer to the question as titled, I did find an answer to the underlying question (how can I make the analysis work). First, the fact that without smoothing, wavelet transforms are . In page 7 of the WaveletComp documentation , it says The concept of Fourier coherency measures the cross-correlation between two time series as a function of frequency; an analogous concept in wavelet theory is the notion of wavelet coherency, which, however, requires smoothing of both the cross-wavelet spectrum and the normalizing individual wavelet power spectra (without smoothing, its absolute value would be identically 1; see Liu [8]) This aligns perfectly with what I found - without smoothing, all coherence values are 1. I still don't understand why, but that is not necessary for the work I am doing right now. The real solution to my problem was that the smoothing was too small of a window - by increasing the smoothing some (about a factor of 5), I got a similar value for coherence to what I was expecting.
