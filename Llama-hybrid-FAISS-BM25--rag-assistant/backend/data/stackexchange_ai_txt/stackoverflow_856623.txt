XHTML is an XML version of HTML. I would probably avoid using XSLT for websites. I would use XHTML along with CSS to control the presentation. I say this because (X)HTML/CSS is pretty much the de facto standard for web applications, and there are many more tools available for development and debugging. There are different levels of validation for XHTML if you want to leverage some of the non-ideal HTML stuff within XHTML.
