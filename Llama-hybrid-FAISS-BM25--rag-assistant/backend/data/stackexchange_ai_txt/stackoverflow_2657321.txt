That would be an interesting tool. I guess my first question would be, is the code photoshop is making going to be semantic? IE. will there be one as the main topic.. and for paragraphs etc. Then when it comes to css.. you definately wont create quality code doing this. However it sounds to me, like you are not really a Front End person. That makes any answer harder.. Best Answer: Hand code it.. the code will be better. Next Answer: Hand coding out of the question? there are some other options. There are these companies that take your psd's and make them into semantic css/html with a 24 hour turnaround. I doubt the code is wonderful, but I am sure it's better than what you are doing with photoshop. Doing it yourself like you aren't wanting to do in the first place. :D A good tutorial is here .. however, its basically helping you hand code.
