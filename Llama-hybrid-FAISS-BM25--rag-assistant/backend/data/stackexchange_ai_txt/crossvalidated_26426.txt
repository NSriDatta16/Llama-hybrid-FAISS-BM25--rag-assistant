I would start by looking at the expected value or expected return of a ticket. The expected value is essentially the average of the payouts, weighted by their odds. For example, suppose you bought a ticket for \$1, which gives you a 1 in 100 chance of winning \$100. The expected value of that ticket is $$ E(\textrm{Ticket})=\bigg(\frac{99}{100}\bigg)(\$0) + \bigg(\frac{1}{100}\bigg)(\$100)=\$1$$ Since the ticket costs \$1, your expected return (expected value - entry fee) is $\$1-\$1$, or \$0. I doubt you'll find odds that good in real life though. Off the top of my head, I think the expected value of a \$1 US lotto ticket is often about \$0.50 (so the expected return is -\$0.50), but it obviously varies with the jackpot and payout structure. You're not plotting something like this , are you? :-)
