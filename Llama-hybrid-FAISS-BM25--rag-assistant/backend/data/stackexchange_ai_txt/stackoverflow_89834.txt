Do an inner join. It's much easier and more readable. select customerName, customerID, count(*) as numberTransactions from customerdata c inner join purchases p on c.customerID = p.customerID group by customerName,customerID order by numberTransactions EDIT: Hey Nathan, You realize you can inner join this whole table as a sub right? Select T.*, T2.* From T inner join (select customerName, customerID, count(*) as numberTransactions from customerdata c inner join purchases p on c.customerID = p.customerID group by customerName,customerID ) T2 on T.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID order by T2.numberTransactions Or if that's no good you can construct your queries using temporary tables (#T1 etc)
