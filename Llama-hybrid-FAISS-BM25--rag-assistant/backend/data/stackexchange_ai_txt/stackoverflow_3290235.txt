Ada: optimize pragma

in the quest to make an Ada code run faster, I'm including the pragma optimize time in the code (in the declarative part). On compiling in AdaGIDE using the GNAT Ada libre Core compiler, I get a warning message: pragma Optimize(Time); | >>> warning: insufficient -O value In the Global settings in the AdaGIDE editor, I have Extensive (O2 level) enabled in the Optimization section. The same code doesn't give any warning though on compilation in GPS. Any one here using AdaGIDE who had a similar experience before? Thanks a lot...
