Forecasted counterfactual as quasi synthetic control

I’ve been curious about a synthetic control inspired design and wanted to get some feedback. Vanilla synthetic control: Takes a treatment group and a control group then infers some optimal weighting of each control unit (0.25A + 0.75B) such that the treatment group and synthetic control group are negligibly different. CausalImpact: Google model where there are still an initial control and treatment group, but the weights are dynamic given time series data on both treatment and initial control groups. Thus the synthetic control group is robust against effects time and continues to be representative of the treatment group. So my question is— why not just forecast the treatment group to get a counterfactual then compare fact-counterfactual for each randomization unit and get the distribution over lift? Does this already have a name or is it a somewhat novel approach?
