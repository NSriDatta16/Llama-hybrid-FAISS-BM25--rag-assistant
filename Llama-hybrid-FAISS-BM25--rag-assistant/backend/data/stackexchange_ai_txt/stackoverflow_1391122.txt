Looking at the traceback, it looks like you have an app called django_test_coverage-0.1 which is importing your app's admin.py . It is probably importing it from a different location, such as yourproject.yourapp.admin as opposed to yourapp.admin . Since it's technically seen as a different module, it is re-imported and the admin.site.register calls are made again. This causes the AlreadyRegistered error. My suggestion would be to remove django_test_coverage app (or fix it).
