Full Doc2Vec Implementation/Repdoduction in TensorFlow?

I'm looking to reproduce the doc2vec, i.e. paragraph vector approach by Le & Mikolov. Is anyone aware of a full script using Tensorflow? In particular, I'm looking for a solution where the paragraph vectors of PV-DM and PV-DBOW are concatenated. So far, I found: GitHub #1 : Only PD-DM, also I'm not sure how to run this script? GitHub #2 : Unclear what it is (PV-DM?) GitHub #3 : Looks like PV-DM? There seems to be no solution that relates to the original IMDB data, and covers both PV-DM and PV-DBOW. I am aware of a few gensim scripts, but would like to know whether there's a TF solution out there.
