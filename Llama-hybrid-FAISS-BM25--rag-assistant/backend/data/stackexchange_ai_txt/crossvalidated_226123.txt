The problem with lowess or loess is that it uses a polynomial interpolation. It is well known in forecasting that polynomials have erratic behavior in the tails. When interpolating, piecewise 3rd degree polynomials provide excellent and flexible modeling of trends whereas extrapolating beyond the range of observed data, they explode. Had you observed later data in the time series, you definitely would have needed to include another breakpoint in the splines to obtain good fit. Forecasting models, though, are well explored elsewhere in the literature. Filtering process like the Kalman filter and the particle filter provide excellent forecasts. Basically, a good forecast model will be anything based on Markov chains where time is not treated as a parameter in the model, but previous model state(s) are used to inform forecasts.
