Android files in intenal storage and local directory

Android gives you getDir (I assume this means I would have myappspace/somedirectory) to create a directory in you application space. But how do you read or write to a file in that directory when android gives you an error if you have the path separator in the openFileOutput/Input call it gives you an error?
