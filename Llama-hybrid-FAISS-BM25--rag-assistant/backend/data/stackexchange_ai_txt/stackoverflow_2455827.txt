Is there a way to determine gaps in try/catch coverage?

I'm debugging a service that's experiencing some problems on start-up. To aid me in this, I'm wrapping pretty much everything in a try/catch block, and writing any errors to a file. I don't want to put them in every method, I just want to put them in the highest level methods so that they catch exceptions from other methods. Something is getting through, though, as the service does stop under some conditions. Is there a way to determine where the gaps in my try/catch coverage are, other than by sight?
