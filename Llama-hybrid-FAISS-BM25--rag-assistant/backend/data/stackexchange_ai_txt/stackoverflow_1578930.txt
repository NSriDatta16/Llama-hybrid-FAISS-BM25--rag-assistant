The accepted answer encouraged me to get the Google-provided plugin to work. I merged the branch mentioned in my question into a checkout of 2.2.0 source code, built and installed/deployed the plugin, and was able to use it in my project as follows: com.google.protobuf.tools maven-protoc-plugin 0.0.1 generate-sources compile generate-sources ${basedir}/src/main/protobuf/ **/*.proto /usr/local/bin/protoc Note that I changed the plugin's version to 0.0.1 (no -SNAPSHOT) in order to make it go into my non-snapshot thirdparty Nexus repository. YMMV. The takeaway is that this plugin will be usable once it's no longer necessary to jump through hoops in order to get it going.
