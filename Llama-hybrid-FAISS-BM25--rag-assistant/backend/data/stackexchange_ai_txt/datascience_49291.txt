method and dataset for credit card fraud detection

I am trying to create a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud (In our definition, fraud means chargeback). I am kinda stuck now with the dataset that I have. I don't have information on the item, quantity, or shipping address. I have information on the credit card, amount to charge, ip address since we are a payment gateway. Is it possible to do fraud detection using the this kind of dataset? The features I created out of existing dataset can't detect the chargeback very well. I have tried: velocity check analysis. ie. checking numbers of transaction past x hours, past x days. Checking number of unique Card used per IP or unique IP used per card. anomaly detection. ie. checking out what transaction amount is considered normal for a merchant or how many transactions per day is considered normal. oversampling/undersampling. We have highly imbalanced dataset and that's why I am doing oversampling. Is there any other method I can try or is it even possible to do proper fraud detection with my current dataset?
