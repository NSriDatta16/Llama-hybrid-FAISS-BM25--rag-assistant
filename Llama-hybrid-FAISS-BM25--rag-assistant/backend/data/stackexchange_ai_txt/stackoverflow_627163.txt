Depends on what you need to do: Measure, so you can do regressions testing to see if changes in performance happened. Find reasons for suboptimal performance and optimize them. These are not the same. For 1, use one of the recommended profilers. For 2, the profiler I much prefer is one you already have: http://www.wikihow.com/Optimize-Your-Program%27s-Performance To see how this goes, check this out. For C++, as for C# and any language that encourages layers of abstraction, those layers may or may not be good from a software engineering standpoint, but they can kill performance. Every method call is a detour in the execution of your program, and the style encourages you to nest those things, sometimes needlessly. Also the style discourages you from knowing or caring what goes on inside them. You may find them creating and deleting objects underneath at a rate and level of generality far beyond what your application really needs.
