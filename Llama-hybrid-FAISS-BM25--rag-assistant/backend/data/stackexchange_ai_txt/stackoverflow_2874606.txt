How to config Remote BLOB Storage(RBS) with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0?

We have working site for Dynamics crm 4.0 and in it we are storing image into the database. Now database is growing very fast and server is dying.. now I want to enable the Remote BLOB Storage with Dynamics CRM 4.0. for that I tried to install RBS for testing but everywhere is configure with Sharepoint 2010 not with Dynamics CRM. Does anybody know how to install and configure with Dynamics CRM 4.0? Does RBS with Standard Edition of SQL Server 2008? I followed following path to install but it with Sharepoint? http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663474.aspx
