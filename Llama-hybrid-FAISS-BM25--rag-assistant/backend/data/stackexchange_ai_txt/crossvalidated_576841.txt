Calculating Avg Days to Pay: Which formula to use?

I want to find the average days to pay for a client based on last year's many invoices. Nearly all of them are paid. Most formulas for this activity rely on outstanding amounts for the client. In this scenario, is there any reason I wouldn't just figure out the difference between bill and paid dates rather than using something more sophisticated? Also, generally speaking, why wouldn't I use the difference between bill and pay dates every time - what is the benefit of a more sophisticated formula using amounts outstanding? If there is a better stack to use for this question, please let me know.
