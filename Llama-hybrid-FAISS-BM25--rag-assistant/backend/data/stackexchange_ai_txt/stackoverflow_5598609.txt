xslt variable match on XML

I'm trying to figure out how leverage multiple templates based on attributes at lower levels of an XML doc. Example: I'm going to receive instances of XML docs as that will either Country = USA or Russia but I won't know which. I want to apply a single XSLT that will allow for either Country and copy different Cities as a result. if its USA for example, the output would look like: if its Russia: Also note, it is possible to want a city in one state but not another state (i.e. OH vs KY, Jonesville). I can get one country to work but I'm not grasping how to force templates to match across different attibutes. Any ideas?
