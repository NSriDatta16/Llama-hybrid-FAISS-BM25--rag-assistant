possible to do binary classification where each sample is time series data with 100s of rows?

I want to use machine learning on candlestick data for hundreds of different cryptocurrencies (where each currency has 12 hours of 1 minute data, so 720 rows, and each row is timestamp, open, high ,low ,close). Each currency will be a sample, but is there any algorithms that can take 720 rows into it? Or do I need to create features on each currencies data as a whole, for instance, the largest price change in that 12 hours, largest wick span in the 12 hours, etc. (Or perhaps grouping the candlesticks into sections of 30 or 60 minutes and calculating the metrics for those sections, and then each section/metric combination would be a separate feature in the algorithm?)
