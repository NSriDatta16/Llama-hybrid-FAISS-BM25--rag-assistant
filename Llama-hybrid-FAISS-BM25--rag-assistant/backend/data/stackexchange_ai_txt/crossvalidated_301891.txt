Three problems that come to mind: First, satisfaction is ordinal and apparently takes only 4 values in the actual data. So, I'd use ordinal logistic regression as a first attempt but, depending on results, might combine levels 3,4 and 5 and do binary logistic regression. Second, room type is almost certainly categorical and you have treated it as continuous. Third, there is likely to be colinarity among the variables.
