Does C# have an equivalent to #pragma pack in C++?

C# provides StructLayoutAttribute.Pack, but its behaviour is "every member gets at least the specified alignment whether it wants it or not", whereas the behaviour of #pragma pack in C++ is "every member gets the alignment it wants, unless it wants more than the specified alignment, in which case it's not guaranteed to get more than that". Is there a way to cause the layout of a struct in C# to be the same as the layout of a similar struct in C++ with a specific #pragma pack, other than using StructLayout( LayoutKind.Explicit ) and FieldOffset on each member, or inserting unused padding members?
