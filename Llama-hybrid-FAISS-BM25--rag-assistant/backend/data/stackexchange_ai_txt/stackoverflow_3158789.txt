Storing a URL value in MYSQL

I am developing an URL bookmark application (PHP and MySQL) for myself. With this application I will store URLs in MySQL. The question is, should I store URLs in a TEXT column or should I first parse the URL and store its components (host, path, query, fragment) in separate columns in one table? The latter one also gives me the chance of generating statistical data by grouping servers and etc. Or maybe I should store servers in a separate table and use JOIN. What do you think? Thanks.
