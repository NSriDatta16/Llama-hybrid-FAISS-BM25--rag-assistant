Wow, that is a curious statement to appear in documentation without an accompanying explanation. Could it be a hold over from when C++ was introduced? I can only guess as to the answers to your questions: a) Perhaps they mean to contrast it with link/load time allocation, such as for globals, constants, and static data. Or perhaps they mean to contrast it with stack allocation, such as the alloca family. b) They may be drawing attention to the fact that you shouldn't allocate memory with C++ new , then pass ownership of that memory to library routine which may free() it. So in that sense, the result of the allocation is language-specific. c) Use C++ new and delete . You have to assume that the underlying C++ allocator in the MSVC runtime is as fast as, if not identical to, the C-style system calls. Just remember that new and delete do more than allocate and free memory. They are not purely substitutable with malloc and free or with other C-style allocators.
