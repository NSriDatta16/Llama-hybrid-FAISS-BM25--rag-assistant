AUC in ordinal logistic regression

I'm using 2 kind of logistic regression - one is the simple type, for binary classification, and the other is ordinal logistic regression. For calculating the accuracy of the first, I used cross-validation, where I computed the AUC for each fold and than calculated the mean AUC. How can I do it for the ordinal logistic regression? I've heard about generalized ROC for multi-class predictors, but I'm not sure how to compute it. Thanks!
