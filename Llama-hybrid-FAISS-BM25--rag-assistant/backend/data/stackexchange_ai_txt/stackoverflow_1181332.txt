Ultraviolet is a syntax highlighting engine used in ruby apps. Combined with Textpow, it allows you to render the same syntax highlighting that you see in textmate on to things like web pages. Textmate ships with plenty themes you can choose from (vibrant ink is probably the most popular one), ultraviolet leverages those themes.
