Core Data is essentially a way to build your model visually, a sort of Interface Builder for the model. You create entities that represent model classes, and define relationships between them. Instead of having to code up a Person class that has an instance of an address class, you can just create them visually by dragging and dropping. There is lots more to it than that, but that is a main feature that I think is cool. Also see this Apple documentation.
