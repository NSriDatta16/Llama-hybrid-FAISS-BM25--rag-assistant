logistic regression or mantel-haenszel?

For a 2x2xk table, where k are strata from repeated cross-sectional studies over the course of 10 years, would it be suitable with a Mantel-Haenszel test of common odds ratio or would a logistic regression analysis be more apropriate? The 2x2 part are purely nominal data.
