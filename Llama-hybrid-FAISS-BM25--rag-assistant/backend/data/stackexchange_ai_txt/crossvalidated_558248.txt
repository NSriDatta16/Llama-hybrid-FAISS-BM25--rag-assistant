This has been discussed at length on this site. Briefly, the test is valid. But no test is especially helpful because of our inability to interpret large p-values, which do not indicate "no difference". Instead I would replace a test with a confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval. These have interpretations regardless of sample size and regardless of whether a null hypothesis is true.
