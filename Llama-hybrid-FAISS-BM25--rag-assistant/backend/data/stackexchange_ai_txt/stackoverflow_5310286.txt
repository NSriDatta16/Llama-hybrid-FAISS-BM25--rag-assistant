(iphone) how to show that imageview is tapped as uibutton?

With UIButton, you can see that a user clicked the button (image turns into gray). I'd like that behavior in UIImageView and wonder how it can be done. Another possible approach is to use UIButton, let it react visually(turns into gray) But pretend touch didn't occur.(because I need to pass the touch event to the superview or nextresponder). Thank you. Edit I actually ended up subclassing UIButton and implement touchesBegan/moved/ended - (void) touchesBegan: (NSSet *) touches withEvent: (UIEvent *) event { [super touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; [self.nextResponder touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; } first touchesBegan for highlightning, second one for the proper handling I need. Wonder calling two touchesBegan would be fine..
