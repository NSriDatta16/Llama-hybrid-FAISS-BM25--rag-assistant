Count your blessings, I'd say. Usually all the people standing between the developers and the users are just getting in the way of making successful software. I think it is a good idea to adopt some agile tooling to organize yourself, like a scrum whiteboard, and by defining sprint periods/iterations. That will allow to manage your boss's and users' expectations, and still give them control over what should get priority. Don't forget to schedule for SDLC tasks, so you can make them visible to your boss. You should feel free to consider agile tooling as a supermarket: take what you think is useful and keep the rest in mind for later consideration. As far as requirements documentation is concerned, I'd keep it very high level. I would not mind skipping it altogether but I can imagine that it feels sloppy, and it is perhaps also a way to document your achievements.
