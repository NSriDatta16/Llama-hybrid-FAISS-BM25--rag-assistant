I think this is a multivariate time series problem, for which simple regression might not be good choice as you want to predict future values. Although as far as the question of splitting dataset is concerned, you should split the data as: data = train + validation + test | | | V V V (2 years) (2 months) (2 months) Parse date column. Convert date column as index for the dataframe. The data must be split according to time/date.
