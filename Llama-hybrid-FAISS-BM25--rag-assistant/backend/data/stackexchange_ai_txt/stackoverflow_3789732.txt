First, sorry this isn't being posted as a comment. I don' tyet have the reputation to leave comments. With classes named things like "AddContact and EditContact" it seems to me you are building these classes to edit what is probably a Contact class? You may be going about your solution completely wrong and causing yourself a much bigger headache. Can you give more details on the code? If, for example, you have a GUI that displays contact information and you wish to edit it, there are much better solutions than having Add/Edit classes. The depencey properties should be a part of your contact class rather than their own separate edit class. Perhaps you may wish to read up on Model View View-Model and the WPF command framework Spending a half hour reading up on these two topics may lead you to a much more elegant solution that is less of a hastle for you.
