Let $\Theta$ be the RV for the probability of heads. Let`s denote the posterior with $f(\theta|X)$ . You now want $P(X_1=x_1, ..., X_n=x_n)$ . where $X_i$ is the RV for outcome of the $i-th$ trial and $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ . Then $P(X_1=x_1, ..., X_n=x_n) = \int_\Theta \Pi_{i=1}^n\theta^{x_i}(1-\theta)^{1-x_i} f(\theta|X)d\theta$ This means that you "take a weighted average" over all possible values for $\theta$ and the weighting happends according to the posterior probability.
