Autoencoders are data-specific, which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on. So, the usefulness of features that have been learned by hidden layers could be used for evaluating the efficacy of the method. For this reason, I think one way to evaluate an autoencoder efficacy in dimensionality reduction is cutting the output of the middle hidden layer and compare the accuracy/performance of your desired algorithm by this reduced data rather than using original data.
