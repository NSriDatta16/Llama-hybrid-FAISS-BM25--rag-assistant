ASP.NET is doing this on the server side using various methods. The most simple, it could be cookies. Typically people use the session state feature. A sliding scale is used to store update times. Though you could do it on Silverlight using something like isolated storage, it won't be secure: the isolated storage isn't encrypted and is on the local system, vs. with ASP.NET, where the server can store this information where it is secure. As to what to store: you really don't want to. You should let your user log in, which hits a web service on the host. Then you just rely on the ASP.NET or other server-side authentication system. You could create a "perma-cookie", but that's just duplicating functionality that already works.
