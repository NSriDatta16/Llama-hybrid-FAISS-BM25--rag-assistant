There is a great survey published by O'Reilly collected at Strata. You can see that SAS is not widely popular, and there is no reason why that should change at this point. One can rule that out. R is barely ahead of Python, 43% vs 41%. You can find many blogs expressing the rise of Python in data science. I would go with Python in the near future. But 5 years is a very long time. I think Golang will steal a lot of developers from Python in general. This might spill over to data science usage as well. Code can be written to execute in parallel very easily, which makes it a perfect vehicle for Big Data processing. Julia's benchmarks for technical computing are even more impressive, and you can have iPython like stuff with iJulia. Hence Python is likely to lose some steam to both. But there are ways to call Julia functions from R and Python, so you can experiment using best sides of each.
