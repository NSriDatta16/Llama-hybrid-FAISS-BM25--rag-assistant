According to the Zoopla API Documentation , what you are trying to do is to: Retrieve the average sale price for houses in a particular area. Retrieval is done using a GET method in the REST standard. By using CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS , cURL will automatically convert your request to a POST, which is invalid for retrieval. You should remove the post fields part, and do that instead: curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://full/url?'.http_build_query($sendData));
