I can not add navigation item to navigation bar

I add a Navigation Bar to an view, I noticed that there is no left side arrow(Navigation Item). so I drag a Navigation Item from library to Navigation Bar, the green mark "+" displayed, but the Navigation Item was not added to the Navigation Bar actually. Welcome any comment Thanks interdev
