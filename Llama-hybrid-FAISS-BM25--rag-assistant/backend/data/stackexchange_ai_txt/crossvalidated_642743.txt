I lack context for your question, but I don't see where a repeated drawing would be beneficial. One, if the process can be repeated many times then maybe it's even possible to get all the tickets and obtain the real average of all tickets in that box. Two, if you can only repeat the process M times where M would not exhaust all N tickets from the box - you could simply increase your sample size and draw N*M number of tickets one time instead of getting M averages. In other words, in order to justly compare the two approaches we have to compare them on equal grounds. In the question you are comparing one approach that is allowed to draw N tickets, with another that is allowed to draw N*M tickets. To have a fair comparison we have to make the conditions equal.
