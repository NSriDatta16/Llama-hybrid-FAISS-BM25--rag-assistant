A way to Identify tuning parameters and their possible range

I am a novice in Machine Learning. But when I started learning, I figure out that all the methods have some tuning parameters and those parameters take a range of possible values. By grid searching, we identify a set of these parameters that optimize some function. But is there any way to find the possible domain of the tuning parameters? This would definitely save my time and the computer's job. In addition, some methods such as xgboost have loads of tuning parameters. Is there any way to know which one to tune and which one to leave as it is. I have been using sklearn python library.
