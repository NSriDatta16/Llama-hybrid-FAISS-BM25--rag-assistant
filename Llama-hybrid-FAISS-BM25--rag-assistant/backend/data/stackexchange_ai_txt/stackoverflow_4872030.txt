I was faced with a similar dilemma and tested Cobertura, Emma and Clover. Cobertura and Emma. Clover was probably the best out of the 3 tools in terms of the speed and the level of detail one could get into. We could afford to pay for a tool at the time so we decided to go with Clover. Of the two open source ones, I loved the simplicity of using Emma. Also, Emma provided us with Method level coverage, something that Cobertura did not. At the end of the day. Code coverage metrics are just code coverage metrics, nothing fancy. Just use what you feel comfortable with. The pain point of using any of these tools is minimal.
