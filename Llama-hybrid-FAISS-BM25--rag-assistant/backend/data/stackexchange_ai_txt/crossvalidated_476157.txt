Different features for different models

Is it considered 'fair' to use different input features when comparing forecasting accuracy between models? For example, adding feature x1, x2 and x3 into a random forest while adding x2, x3 and x4 into a mlp? Are forecasting accuracy measures like MAE, RMSE and MAPE still valid?
