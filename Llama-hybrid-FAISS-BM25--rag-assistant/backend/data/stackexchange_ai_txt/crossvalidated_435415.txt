The 8-bits coding for each color level in each pixel is just a convention, you may also use 16-bits scheme, specially if you deal with professional or amateur photography or photo editing. Colours span on a continuous scale, the 256 levels of usual color coding ia just a matter of definition, like when you have some continuous measure rounded to some number of digits. Anyway, since traditional statistic methods (which put more attention on continuous/discrete variables) are rarely used on this kind of data, almost always there will be no difference in methods deployed. Also notice that even in linear models, predictors are taken as fixed and no importance is given to their domain, so it makes no difference if they are discrete or continuous.
