Finite population: CI of Normal Distribution same regardless of sample percent?

I am trying to wrap my head around the following. It seems that the confidence interval for a normal distribution does not rely on the sample percent. For instance, say I am trying to find the average number of dollars spent at a store on a given day. I do a sample of 100 with mean \$1000 and stdev \$200. My 90% CI is [\$967.10, \$1032.90]. What I cant understand is why this is the SAME regardless of the percent sampled. If there was a population of 101 customers or 10000, the CI is the same. If this is correct, can someone explain this to me in a digestible way?
