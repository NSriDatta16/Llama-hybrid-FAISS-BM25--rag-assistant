Standardize your target variable to bring it between 0-1 range. Then you can apply negative binomial to model them. Also you can try decision tree based methods like random forest and gradient boosting. We had implemented similar solution using neural network, which beat all the other model. So you can implement the methods whichever you have access to or maybe build all of them and compare the performance.
