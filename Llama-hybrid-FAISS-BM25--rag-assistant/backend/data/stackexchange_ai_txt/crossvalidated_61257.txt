You seem to be slightly misunderstanding the purpose of the weights in IPTW. You are right it would not make sense to have a fractional value for a binary outcome, but the goal of weighting here is not to get a "corrected" outcome value for each individual. Instead, you are creating a pseudo-population the composition of which is the individuals in the original population weighted by the inverse of their probability of treatment, given some covariates. In the pseudo-population, there is no longer any association between those covariates and treatment (and therefore no confounding). The goal of weighting, therefore, is to get a contribution to the average outcome value that each individual makes. You can now have fractional values, because these are fractional contributions, not fractional outcome values.
