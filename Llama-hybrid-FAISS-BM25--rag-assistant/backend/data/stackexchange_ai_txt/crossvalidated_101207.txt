There are a variety of situations in which this happens. Indeed, I'd say it's often to be expected. Consider the very simple example two time series subject to mutually and (internally) independent shocks and a common drift (i.e. of the form $y_t=\delta_t+y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ and $z_t=\alpha_t+z_{t-1}+\eta_t$ ), so that their differences are just $\delta+\epsilon_t$ and $\alpha+\eta_t$ respectively. Then the differences are uncorrelated, but over long time frames, the original series will often be very highly correlated.
