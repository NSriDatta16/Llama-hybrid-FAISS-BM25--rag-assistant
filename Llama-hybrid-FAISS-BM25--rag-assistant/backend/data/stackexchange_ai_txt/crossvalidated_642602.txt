Linear regression is for sure a basic concept in data science that forms the foundation for more advanced techniques. Understanding its principles is crucial for any data scientist, especially at a mid-level position where proficiency in statistical methods is To me, the main point to take into account when addressing such questions is the complexity of data science solutions across industries and use-cases. It is crucial to tailor solutions to specific environments, considering factors like computational resources and above all, identify correctly end-users' profile. Therefore, it seems equally important to me to assess a candidate's ability to adapt and apply statistical methods effectively in diverse scenarios. To further elaborate on that point, I would suggest to combine questions on linear regression with inquiries about more complex architectures like neural networks. This approach allows interviewers to gauge not only the candidate's understanding of basic statistical concepts but also their inclination towards more sophisticated solutions, and in which context do they consider using more complex models.
