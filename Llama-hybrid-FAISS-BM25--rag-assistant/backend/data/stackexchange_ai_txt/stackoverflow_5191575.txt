The way you asked your question I think you suffer from a misconception between texture objects i.e. the texture storage, and texture units i.e. the machinery behind multitexturing. OpenGL has texture object and texture units. Texture objects hold the data, texture units map the data of the texture object that's bound to them into the rendering process. Usually one uploads all the textures needed for a scene into texture objects. And for each render batch that makes use of common material settings binds the textures to the right texture units in the rendering process.
