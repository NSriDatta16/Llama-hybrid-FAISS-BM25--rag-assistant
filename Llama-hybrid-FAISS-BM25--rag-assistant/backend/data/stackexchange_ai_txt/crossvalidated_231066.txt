log-logistic regression model VS nonlinear regression in seed germination

*EDIT: I ran test again with data set provided and realized that the cause of problem is definitely rank deficiency, because estimated values of parameters in nonlinear regression showed non existing p values and there was no way to create confidence intervals with this data. Thank you all for reading and help! This question is closed. I researched seed germination. I took 75 seed replicates and put them in different ecological parameters (like temperature) and took data about sprouts in different time intervals. Reading statistical science papers about this topic, I found that I should analyze my data in a time-to-event model (dose response curve), where I can use log-logistic regression or nonlinear regression (Ritz et al., 2013 - http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2012.10.003 ). Two models (nonlinear and log-logistic) lead to quantitatively very similar fitted germination curves, i.e., similar parameter estimates, but qualitatively different statements about the precision of estimates. Nonlinear regression model yields an overly precise estimate of the proportion of seeds that germinated during the experiment, so the precision reported by the nonlinear regression is too high. Similarly, the 95% confidence intervals of the fitted curves also demonstrate the dramatic difference in precision of the two models: Accurate prediction of germination percentages is not warranted by the data unless very low percentages are of interest. Because of that I choose log-logistic regression as a model. First few data sets; treatments analyzed in R using analysis of Dose-Response Curves (drc package) went smooth, and I was able to plot and get final graph. Such data, which was successfully analyzed, contained treatments where max seeds germination was for example 50% of total seed number. Example: The problems arose when I entered the log-logistic model with treatment where all the seeds germinated in a short amount of time (meaning the treatment for this set of seeds is most adequate for their successful sprouting). For example, 100% of seeds germinated in only 5 days, so there are only two or three time intervals and a large number of sprouted seeds. The R program here reported convergence error: Error in optim(startVec, opfct, hessian = TRUE, method = optMethod, control = list(maxit = maxIt, : non-finite value supplied by optim Error in drmOpt(opfct, opdfct1, startVecSc, optMethod, constrained, warnVal, : Convergence failed Since I'm still a student in biology I have a very basic knowledge in statistics, so I tried to solve the problem with literature. At first I thought that convergence failed because of perfect or complete separation, but through longer research it seems that the problem lies in rank deficiency. When I analyzed the same data with nonlinear regression I've managed to fit curve and plot a graph without a problem. So, is there a way to make log-logistic model work even though I have obviously small data in cases of 100% germination? Should I switch to nonlinear regression even though the reported precision would be too high.
