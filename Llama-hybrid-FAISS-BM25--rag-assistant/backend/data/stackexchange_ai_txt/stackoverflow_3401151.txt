It's all based on the operating system, and the choice of C and C++ standard libraries. The days of slow ifstream are pretty much over, however, there is likely some overhead in handling C++ generic interfaces. atof/strtod might be the fastest way to deal with it if the string is already in the memory. Finally, any attempt you'd do at getting the file read into memory will likely be futile. Modern operating systems usually get in the way (especially if the file is larger than RAM you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your (already stored on disk) data as swappable). If you really need to be ridiculously fast (The only places I can think it will be useful are HPC and Map/Reduce based approaches) - try mmap (Linux/Unix) or MapViewOfFile to get the file prefetched into virtual memory in the most sensible approach, and then atof + custom string handling. If the file is really well organized for this kind of game, you can even be quirky with mmaps and pointers and have the conversion multithreaded. Sounds like a fun excercise if you have over 10GB of floats to convert on a regular basis.
