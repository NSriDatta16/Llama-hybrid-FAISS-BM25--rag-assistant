The USB protocol stack has several layers and is quite complex. You really need to read a good book on USB (e.g. USB Complete ) to get an understanding of how it all fits together. The bottom line though is that you want to go as high up the protocol stack as you can, ideally using a system level API (e.g. if it's a USB HID device then just treat it like any other HID device, rather than thinking if it as a USB device - ditto for mass storage devices, etc).
