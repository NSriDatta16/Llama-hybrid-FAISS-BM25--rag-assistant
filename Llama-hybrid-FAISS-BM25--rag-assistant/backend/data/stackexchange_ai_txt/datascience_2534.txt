Confused about description of YearPrediction Dataset

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD According to the description given in the above link, the Attribute information specifies "average and covariance over all 'segments', each segment being described by a 12-dimensional timbre vector". So the covariance matrix should have 12*12 = 144 elements. But why is the number of timbre covariance features only 78 ?
