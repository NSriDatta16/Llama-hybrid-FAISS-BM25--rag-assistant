Your final code example has the right general idea, but tread carefully: vector will not manage the allocations for you if you do that! objects.clear() will leak memory, for instance. You probably want to use std::vector > instead, but choosing the right smart pointer class requires care and attention to (for instance) what happens when you copy elements from one vector to another. boost::shared_ptr is a safe choice, but may have unnecessary overhead for your use case. boost::ptr_vector may be better.
