What is the best way to reduce false negative percent in the model?

My logistic regression model seems to identify successes very well (about 85% - 94%), but fails to identify the failures (only identifying 18% - 32% correctly). I have thought of weighting the success and failures differently, but I am not sure of how to do this R. I have tried: Fr but did not get any improvement this way.
