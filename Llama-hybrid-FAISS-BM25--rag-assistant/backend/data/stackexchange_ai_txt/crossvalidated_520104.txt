How cam I use linear regression coefficients to estimate logistic regression coefficients?

I am trying to come up with predictions for a logistic regression for the purpose of a power analysis. All I have to go off of is a linear regression result. Lets say there are 50 pictures and I want to know how likely someone is to remember them. (This is just a made up example.) I measure the brightness of the pictures and use that to predict the percentage of people who remembered each one. Lets say b = .5. Now, in my new experiment, I will be making predictions as to whether each image is remembered by a given person, using logistic regression. How do I go from the linear regression coefficient to the logistic regression coefficient? Again this is just for the purpose of estimating effect size for a power analysis. Edit: Could I do something like: compare the percentage of items remembered at baseline (form the intercept) to the amount remembered when the predictor is +1. And then turn that comparison into log odds?
