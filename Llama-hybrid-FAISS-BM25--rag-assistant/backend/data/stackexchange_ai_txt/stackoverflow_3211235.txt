CSS affected by Javascript for EasySlider 1.7

I'm trying to get a nice overlay effect going with a slider using EasySlider 1.7. Not only should this include images, but also text that represents the image. Now I'm having trouble lining up the text on the page where I need it. http://intranet.streamflame.com That is the home page, The section where you see the black overlay on the main scrolling image is where the text is supposed to sit. Now if I get rid of the code to scroll the text, the text sits where it is supposed to. However as soon as I add the script to scroll the text at the same time, it seems to make the text disappear. Here's my Code. HTML: {% for project in rotations %} {% endfor %} WaterTiger Project watertiger is a test project whilst we get all the site together, call it a filler if you must, there is no project watertiger your only dreaming. Dragonfly Project Dragonfly is a test project whilst we get all the site together, call it a filler if you must, there is no project dragonfly your only dreaming. Spacemunch Project Spacemunch is a test project whilst we get all the site together, call it a filler if you must, there is no project Spacemunch your only dreaming. CSS: .filler { position: relative; margin-left:20px; height:361px; width:559px; float:left; } .filler-mask { position: absolute; left:0; top:0; height:361px; width:559px; z-index: 100; } .filler-img{ position: absolute; left:0; top:0; height:361px; width:559px; z-index: 50; } .filler-text { width: 558px; height: 68px; position: absolute; z-index: 200; color: #fff; } .filler-text li { list-style-type: none; z-index: 1000; } .filler-text-left { width: 169px; float: left; height: 48px; padding: 10px; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: 100; } .filler-text-right { width: 340px; float: right; height: 48px; padding: 10px; font-size: 10pt; } EasySlider Javascript: $(document).ready(function(){ $(".filler-text").easySlider({ auto: true, continuous: true, speed: 1800, pause: 5000, nextId: "next2", prevId: "prev2" }); $(".filler-img").easySlider({ auto: true, continuous: true, speed: 1800, pause: 5000, nextId: "next2", prevId: "prev2" }); }); Note: I have tried putting the script for the text under the script for the image, this has no change to the look of it. Hoping someone can help.
