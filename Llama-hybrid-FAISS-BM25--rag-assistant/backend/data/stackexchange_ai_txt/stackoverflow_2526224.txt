Is there a jQuery webscraper out there?

I'm trying to pullout some info from an external site using jQuery and Adobe AIR. Right now I'm using a hidden div and jQuery's load function to load fragments of the external site, once the info is loaded I parse some info with selectors. This is fine but it's kinda dirty and I need to perform this several times (don't want to need many hidden divs). Just wondering if anybody knows a good webscraper written in jQuery or maybe another method I'm missing
