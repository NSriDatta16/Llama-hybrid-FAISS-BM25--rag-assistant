This link should help http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument758 In the example, I would look at this particular code. Imports DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid Private Sub GridView1_RowStyle(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.RowStyleEventArgs) Handles GridView1.RowStyle Dim View As GridView = sender If (e.RowHandle >= 0) Then Dim category As String = View.GetRowCellDisplayText(e.RowHandle, View.Columns("Category")) If category = "Beverages" Then e.Appearance.BackColor = Color.Salmon e.Appearance.BackColor2 = Color.SeaShell End If End If End Sub This code seemed to help the situation of helping the programming change the backcolor of two categoris of Bevarage. Please comment if I made a mistake
