One approach would be to use artificial neural networks. You provide the neural net with some examples for training and it should hopefully learn to correctly classify the voices. You will probably have to do some feature extraction using Fourier transforms to get the data into a suitable form. There are several papers about this kind of approach if you search on Google for "neural network speaker identification" but unfortunately I am not familiar enough with them to recommend any particular one.
