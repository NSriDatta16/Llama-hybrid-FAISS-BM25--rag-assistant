Auxiliary random experiment

This question is from Robert Hogg's Introduction to Mathematical Statistic 6th version exercise 8.5.2 page 461. The question is: Let $X_1, X_2,...,X_{10}$ be a random sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with parameter $\theta$. Let $L(\theta)$ be the joint pdf of $X_1, X_2,...,X_{10}$. The problem is to test $H_0:\theta=\frac{1}{2}$ against $H_1:\theta=1$ (a) Show that $L(\frac{1}{2})/L(1) \le k$ is equivalent to $y=\sum_1^n x_i\ge c$ (b)In order to make $\alpha=0.05$ï¼Œ show that $H_0$ is rejected if y>9 and, if y=9, reject $H_0$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$(using some auxiliary random experiment) The solution says (a) and (b) are straightforward, I think (a) is simple, but I cannot see straightforward at (b) My some thoughts on (b): since $X_1,...,X_{10}$ are random sample for a Poisson so $y=\sum_1^{10} x_i\sim Poisson (5) $ with $H_0$ and $y=\sum_1^{10} x_i\sim Poisson (10) $ under $H_1$ Under $H_0:$ $ y>9, \Rightarrow p=1-ppois(9,5)=0.03182806 $ $ y=9, \Rightarrow p=dpois(9,5)= 0.03626558 $ They are all less than $\alpha=0.05$ what is the meaning of "reject $H_0$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$"? Thank you very much.
