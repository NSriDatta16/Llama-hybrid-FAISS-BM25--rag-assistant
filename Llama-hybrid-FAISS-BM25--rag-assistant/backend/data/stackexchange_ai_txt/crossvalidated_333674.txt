Can I use Bayesian t-test instead of a standard frequentist t-test for small sample sizes?

I have a very small sample of n=19 students, divided into 2 groups with n=10 (native English speakers) and n=9 (ESL speakers). Each person in the overall sample rated their anxiety towards academic English on a scale of 1 to 5. I want to check whether ESL speakers have lower anxiety scores than native English speakers, but the sample sizes are too small for parametric tests. My colleague told me that it's too small for non-parametric tests too. He suggested I try a Bayesian independent t-test instead (using JASP). Would it be justified to use Bayesian statistics in this case?
