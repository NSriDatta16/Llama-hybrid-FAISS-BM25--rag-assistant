UPDATE : Facebook uses a special user agent. You can check for this user agent and show the generic page ( reference ): facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+https://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php) Well, Facebook (and basically all decent Web crawlers) try to view your websites the way a normal user would view it. And it seems that Facebook server that is scraping your page is in NY! :-) Your best bet is to capture from which IP Facebook is accessing your website and make an exception, now I wouldn't do this. You may want to promote your Facebook Fan Page instead of a regular Like Plugin pointing to the " Homepage ".
