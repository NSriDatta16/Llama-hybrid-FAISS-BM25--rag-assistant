Since this thread seems to attract very little attention, here's what I ended up doing: liJson was out of the picture pretty fast as it does not seem to be actively maintained. Between the remaining two (both released versions just a few days ago) I chose Json.NET as it seems to have a slightly simpler serialization API. be more popular. After a few experiments I have to say I'm happy with the results - I managed to achieve all I wanted and more, and writing custom converters was a breeze, taking 2 minutes and 4 lines of code.
