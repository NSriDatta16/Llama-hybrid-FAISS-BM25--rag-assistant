Firstly, you may be able to make more sense of your model, at least the fixed effects, by plotting predicted values rather than coefficients. The plot_model function you use can do this. Interpreting the fixed effects: The intercept is the average volume of Chilean rats at baseline (day 0). The coefficient CountryEngland says that, at baseline (day 0), rats from England have on average 1.37 units greater mass than rats from Chile. The coefficient for Day tells you that Chilean rats, on average, increase their volume by 0.04 units per day. Lastly, the CountryEngland:Day interaction coefficient tells you that the effect of Day (the rate of change of Volume) is on average -0.005 units lower amongst English rats compared to Chilean rats. Interpreting the random effects is a little more complicated. The standard deviation of the random effect Rat , 0.48, tells you how much between-rat variation there is in Volume, after accounting for your predictors. In other words, conditional on your predictors, you would expect most (68%) rats to be within around $\pm$ 0.48 units of volume. The statistical significance of this variation I don't think is really relevant - but consider that the standard deviation of the 'between-rat' variation (0.48) is considerably larger than the 'within-rat' variation (0.27), suggesting most variation in Volume is at the between-rat level. Note that your model can also be extended by allowing the rate of change in Volume to vary between rats. This would introduce a random effect of Day: m1 This way, you will also be able to estimate the amount of variation in the rate of change of volume between rats. Whether or not that's valuable for your experiment I don't know.
