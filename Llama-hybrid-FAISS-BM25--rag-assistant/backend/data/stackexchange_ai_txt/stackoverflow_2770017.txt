If you're feeling overwhelmed, stick with Python for a while. It's fairly easy to work with, and it's easy to read. Keep making small programs with it. Maybe do some Project Euler problems. Game programming is complicated , and if you start working with C++ now, you'll get discouraged and want to give up. I know I did :-P. Learn how to program well first, and get a feel for how to build larger applications before you tackle game programming (or at least start with extremely small and simple games. Like Pong). Beyond that, read, read, read. Read Stack Overflow. Read Wikipedia articles on programming topics. Go to your local library and read all their programming books. Focus on books that talk about programming, not specific languages. Focus on design patterns, algorithms, what the difference between good and bad code is, etc. Go to college/university and take programming courses. It's not impossible to go without formal education, but you'll learn much more much faster than you would on your own (and I'm sure a diploma/degree will help you get jobs in the industry).
