First, you might have an encoding issue, that's why äöüÄÖÜ are registered as invalid. I'm not a PHP user, so I can't answer your question directly, but taking a look at this page might help you. Also, using appropriate character classes could work better than explicitly writing all appropriate letters. Alas, this is also probably encoding configuration dependent. Second, you need a space in your regex, so /^[0-9a-z A-ZäöüÄÖÜ_\-']+$/ // note space after a-z should work. Note what I wrote in last paragraph about using character classes. \w might be sufficient instead of a-zA-ZäöüÄÖÜ
