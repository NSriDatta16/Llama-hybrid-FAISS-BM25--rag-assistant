how to scale an image to fill the screen

My issue is this: I use the android emulator, targeting android 2.2. I created a custom view which I want to handle the background of my application, in this view I only want to display an image but I want it to fill the entire screen. I initialize the view from my "Activity" like this: BackgroundView bw = new BackgroundView(this); The problem: On my HDD, the resource image I'm using is 500x375 pixels. After calling: Bitmap m_resourceBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.landscape_1); int nWidth = m_resourceBitmap.getWidth(); int nHeight = m_resourceBitmap.getHeight(); the returned nWidth and nHeight depend on where I placed the resource, if i place it in the "drawable-mdpi" I get the original size, otherwise I get other sizes. On the other hand if I ask the view for it's width and height via this.getWidth(); this.getHeight(); I get fixed values, but different from the resolution I expected from the device (I set a 480x800 device and I get 320x533) and finally if I try to create a scale matrix using view dimensions divided by the image dimensions, the result, on screen, is an image much smaller than the screen... My question is: What questions should I ask and from which objects so that inside a View I can draw a resource Bitmap so that it occupies the entire screen?
