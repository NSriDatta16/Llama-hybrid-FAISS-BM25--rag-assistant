I think you are rightly skeptical of the statement: a machine learning (ML) model is just a mathematical equation. What I particularly dislike is the careless use of the word "equation". The word equation has a specific meaning in mathematics: An equation is a statement of equality between (at least) two quantities or expressions. An equation always contains the reserved symbol "$=$". I hope you agree that this does not quite capture what a trained/estimated machine learning model is. There is however a mathematical concept that does capture what a large class of trained machine learning models fall into: A trained machine learning model is nothing more than a function . To recap the definition: we call $f$ a function from set $X$ into set $Y$, written $$ f : X \to Y, $$ if and only if each $x \in X$ is associated with a unique $y \in Y$. You could therefore view $f$ as a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ (with $x \in X, y \in Y$) such that each $x$ occurs exactly once. The previous does not capture the case where an input $x$ undergoes non-deterministic transformations before being returned as $y$. In that case, it would be better to call the machine learning model an algorithm ( or recipe). Or even, a machine â€“ in the conceptual meaning of that word. See also: Wikipedia: Equation . Wolfram MathWorld: Equation : "An equation is a mathematical expression stating that two or more quantities are the same as one another, also called an equality, formula, or identity." Personally, I would not use "formula" as equivalent for "equation". Wolfram MathWorld: Function .
