One way to tackle this problem would be to leverage the Worksheet_Change event. This way you do not need to have any formulas in your spreadsheet: Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range) If Application.Intersect(Target, Range("B:B")) Is Nothing Then End End If Target.Offset(0, -1) = WorksheetFunction.Max(Range("A:A")) + 1 End Sub To implement this code: In your workbook press ALT + F11 (this opens VBA editor) Open the Project Explorer (CTRL + R) Double-clik the sheet that you want the code to apply to e.g. Sheet1 In the left-hand dropdown menu select Worksheet and in the right hand menu select Change Cut and paste the code provided Hope this helps.
