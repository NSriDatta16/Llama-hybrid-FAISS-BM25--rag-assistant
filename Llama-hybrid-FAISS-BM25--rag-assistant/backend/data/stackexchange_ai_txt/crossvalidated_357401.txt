Getting sensitivity and specificity from a caret model

I have trained a caret model using bootstrapping and the default metric (accuracy, since I'm doing logistic regression). Now I'd like to know other performance parameters for the trained model: sensitivity, specificity, ROC etc. How do I do that?
