In the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field. An Object has to check internal rules that it hold only valid values. For example are null values possible? are empty strings possible? or negative values? or a zero value? or values from a list are valid? or is there a maximal value? or is there a maximum precision on BigDecimal values? The unit test should check if the behavior correct if there invalid values. This can not be automated. If you have no logic on the setter and getter then it must be used anywhere in your application. Write a test where your object is a parameter for a more complex test. You can test it then with different values from the list. Test your business logic and not the getter and setter. The result should also a coverage of the getter and setter. The methods should be any result in your business logic also if you have only a public library. If the getter and setter have no code coverage then removed it.
