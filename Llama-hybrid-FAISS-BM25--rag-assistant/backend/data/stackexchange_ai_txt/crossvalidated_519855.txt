Why 95%CI of OR in tbl_regression does not match p-value (and is different from 95%CI from logistic.display)?

I performed multivariate logistic regression with this dataset: https://justpaste.it/61vgo #build model library(gtsummary) library(epiDisplay) dataB #get output logistic.display(fit1) tbl_regression(fit1, exponentiate = T) As you can see below, 95% CI are not the same between both output (logistic.display from epiDisplay and tbl_regression from gtsummary, see below), and moreover, tbl_regression display 95%CI that does not match with p-value from Wald test (pvalue should be Do you know why? Which one is the good one? Logistic.display tbl_regression
