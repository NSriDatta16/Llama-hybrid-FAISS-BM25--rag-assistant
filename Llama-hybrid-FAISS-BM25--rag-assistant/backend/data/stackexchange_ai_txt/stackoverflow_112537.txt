For those doing this on iPhone 2.1 (maybe 2.0), you do NOT need to create any special services for local data storage. MobileSafari appears to support the HTML5/WHATWG SQL database API. This is the same API supported by recent versions of desktop Safari and Firefox. If you're using a toolkit like Dojo or ExtJS that offers a storage abstraction, your code should work on just about any modern browser, including MobileSafari. To test, open http://robertsanders.name/dev/stackoverflow/html5.html on your iPhone. If you open that page then look on the filesystem of a Jailbroken iPhone, you should see a database somewhere in /private/var/mobile/Library/WebKit/Databases/. There's even a directory of web-opened DBs there. root# sqlite3 /private/var/mobile/Library/WebKit/Databases/Databases.db SQLite version 3.5.9 Enter ".help" for instructions sqlite> .databases seq name file 0 main /private/var/mobile/Library/WebKit/Databases/Databases.db sqlite> .tables Databases Origins sqlite> select * from Databases; 1|http_robertsanders.name_0|NoteTest|Database|API example|20000|0000000000000001.db sqlite> select * from Origins; http_robertsanders.name_0|5242880
