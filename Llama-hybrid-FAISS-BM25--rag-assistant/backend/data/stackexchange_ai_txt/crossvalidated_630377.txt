Should I do PCA reduction before applying Mclust()?

I am doing some work where I am meant to apply Mclust() to my data set, with 50000 samples. I previously used PCA in order to reduce the dimension, which left me with 20 principal components (from 35 initial variables). Should I apply Mclust directly to my dataset or the transformed one from the pricipal components?
