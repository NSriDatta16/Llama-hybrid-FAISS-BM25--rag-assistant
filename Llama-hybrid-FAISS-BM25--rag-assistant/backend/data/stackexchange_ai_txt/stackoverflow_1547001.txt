I'm not an expert in the field of Java, but I know what went wrong. Firstly the host variable should only contain host of the URL. The host of the URL http://www.cyberspacei.com/englishwiz/library/name/etymology_of_first_names.htm is actually 'cyberspacei.com' So you connect to the host, then send HTTP headers to request for the page you are looking for. GET /englishwiz/library/name/etymology_of_first_names.htm HTTP/1.0 Host: cyberspacei.com Accept: */* Connection: Close Some web pages may need User-Agent or Referer headers to work. so add the fields appropriately.
