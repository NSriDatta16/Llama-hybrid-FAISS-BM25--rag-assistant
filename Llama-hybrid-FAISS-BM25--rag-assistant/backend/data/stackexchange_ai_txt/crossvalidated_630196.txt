Is this the correct approach? I don't feel confident, because $s$ and $\tilde{s}$ is correlated and the term above does not include any information regarding that. The $s$ and $\tilde{s}$ are not correlated when you condition on $a$ . They are independent distributed according to $$s|a \sim N(a,1/\eta) \\ \tilde{s}|a \sim N(a,1/\tilde\eta)$$ or if you take both together with inverse variance weighting $$\frac{\eta s+ \tilde{\eta}\tilde{s}}{\eta+\tilde{\eta}}|a \sim N\left(a,\frac{1}{\eta+\tilde{\eta}}\right)$$ In these three equations, you can regard the parameter $a$ as following a prior distribution $$a \sim N(\mu_a,1/\tau)$$ and you are finding the posterior distribution after observing $\tilde{s}$ and/or $s$ . $$\begin{array}{lcrcl} a|s &\sim & N(\mu_{a|s},&\sigma_{a|s})\\ a|\tilde{s} &\sim & N(\mu_{a|\tilde{s}},&\sigma_{a|\tilde{s}})\\ a|s,\tilde{s} &\sim & N(\mu_{a|s,\tilde{s}},&\sigma_{a|s,\tilde{s}}) \end{array}$$ That posterior can be found with the updating rules that are derived here: Bayesian updating with new data Also very useful is this section about Bayesian inference on the Wikipedia page about the normal distribution. It's a bit of work to write it down, but two update steps with the independent $s$ and $\tilde{s}$ should give the same result as one single update step with the weighted mean. You don't need to worry here about correlations between $s$ and $\tilde{s}$ . You just have the process of updating the distribution for $a$ based on the distributions in the first three equations. What changes with the sequential updating is that the posterior of the first step is the prior for the second step.
