Creating a subscription based website in ASP.NET

I'd like to update my website to make it subscription based. It's a ASP.NET Web forms project. I am looking for the following functionality: Ability to have users sign up for different plans (Gold, Premium etc) Ability to have users upgrade / downgrade to and from plans Ability to hook this up to a Payment processor Ability to have a credit based system (User buys x credits for $y) as an alternative to plans in (1) Most of this functionality (if not all) is supported by a large number of websites which makes me think I can leverage on an existing framework instead of re-inventing the wheel. Need more opinions. Thanks for reading.
