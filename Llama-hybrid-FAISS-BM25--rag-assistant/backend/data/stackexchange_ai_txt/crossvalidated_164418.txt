There are definitely many approaches how to cope with this. My first idea would have the following steps: To fit the histogram by a probability distribution (exponential, log-normal, gamma) $f(X)$. To transform the data you have to quantiles, using the cumulative density function $Y_k=F(X=x_k)$. To use a time series model with auto-regression (e.g. ARIMA) on $Y_k$ with the application of logit (for combination of logit and ARIMA see e.g. this ). Using this, you will have a time-series just the pointer $Y$ on the interval $[0, 1]$ and you will also have a way how to transform the pointer back to the original values $X$. A completely different solution could be just to apply logarithm on your data and use standard time-series models. The backward transformation would be then exponential. In both approaches you would use transformation-timeseries-backwardtransformation sequence.
