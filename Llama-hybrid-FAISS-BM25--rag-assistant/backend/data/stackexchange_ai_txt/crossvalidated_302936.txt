Enumerating actions for Q-learning

I have a Q-learning model that is for forex trading, so my initial thought is that there will be only 3 kinds of possible moves: Buy Sell Hold However, the reward for each action is different given the portfolio's holding position or market situation. For example, if we have a up trend and a buy position then we earn a reward; but if we hold a buy position in a down trend then we receive a penalty. I wonder if I have to split the actions into subdivided actions, like: Buy - Up trend Buy - Down trend ... Are there any strategies or techniques that can help me derive the best set of actions to model my environment?
