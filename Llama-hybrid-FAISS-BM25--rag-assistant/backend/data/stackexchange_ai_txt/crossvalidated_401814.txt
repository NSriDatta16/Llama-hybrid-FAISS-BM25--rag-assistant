You got off on the wrong foot by conceptualizing this as a classification problem. The fact that $Y$ is binary has nothing to do with trying to make classifications. And when the balance of $Y$ is far from 1:1 you need to think about modeling tendencies for $Y$ , not modeling $Y$ . In other words, the appropriate task is to estimate $P(Y=1 | X)$ using a model such as the binary logistic regression model. The logistic model is a direct probability estimator. Details may be found here and here . Once you have a validated probability model and a utility/cost/loss function you can generate optimum decisions. The probabilities help to trade off the consequences of wrong decisions.
