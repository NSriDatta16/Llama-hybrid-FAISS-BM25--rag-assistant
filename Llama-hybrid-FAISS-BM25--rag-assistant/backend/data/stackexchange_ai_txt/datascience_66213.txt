Removing junk sentences

I have transcripts of phone calls with customers and agents. I'm trying to find promises which were made by an agent to a customer. I already did punctuation restoration. But there are a lot of sentences that don't have any sense. I would like to remove them from the transcript. Most of them are just a set of not connected words. I wonder what approach is the best for this task? My ideas are: • Use tf idf and word2vec to create vectors from all sentences. After that we can do some kind of anomaly detection e.g. look for and delete vectors that are highly deviated from most other vectors. • Spam filters. Maybe is it possible to apply spam filters for this task? • Crate some pattern of part of speech tags that proper sentence must include. For example, any good sentence must include noun + verb. Or we can use for example dependency tokens from spacy. update Example of a sentence that I want to keep: There's no charge once sent that you'll get a ups tracking number. Example of a junk sentence: Kinder pr just have to type it in again, clock drives bethel. Another junk sentence: Just so you have it on and said this is regarding that.
