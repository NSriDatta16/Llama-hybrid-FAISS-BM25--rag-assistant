AR model notation for non-consecutive PACF values?

I am fairly new to time series analysis, and I was learning from this tutorial on AR. The process's PACF has non-zero values at lag t-1 , t-2 , t-4 , and t-12 , and the model is illustrated as a function mt=β0+β1mt-1+β2mt-2+β4mt-4+β12mt-12+εt . What would be the appropriate notation for this AR model? AR(12)? AR(1,2,4,12)? All the examples I have seen so far assumes that PACF values are consecutively non-zero, until it shuts off at a certain point, like at lag t-3 . In that case I understand it's going to be AR(3).
