Is there an alternative to PCA that produces a unique representation?

PCA produces solutions that are not unique i.e. the resulting representation could be recreated using a different set of points. This is where my problem lies. I was wondering whether anyone is aware of any other techniques that would produce unique representations when performing dimensionality reduction of some data points. There is a lemma known as Johnson-Lindenstauss Lemma that does dimensionality reduction while producing unique representations of data but it is dependent on the size of the data points. What I am looking for is a technique that would perform unique dimensionality reduction and is independent of the size of data points (similar to PCA which produces a fixed number of eigenvectors but isn't independent of data size).
