There are several built-in ways of doing this. One way would be: (remove-if-not 'good-enough-score-p word-list) And another: (loop for word in word-list when (good-enough-score-p word) collect word) And yet another: (mapcan (lambda (word) (when (good-enough-score-p word) (list word))) word-list) Etc... There's also SERIES and Iterate . The Iterate version is identical to the LOOP version, but the SERIES version is interesting: (collect (choose-if 'good-enough-score-p (scan word-list)))) So, yes, you're very likely to reinvent some wheel. :-)
