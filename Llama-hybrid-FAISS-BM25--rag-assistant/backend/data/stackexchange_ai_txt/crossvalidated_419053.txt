What you need is a Generative Model of you data. This will let you model and learn how to sample from the hidden/latent distribution that "generated" your data (or in some cases find exactly the hidden/latent distribution according to your model). Some examples of the SoA techniques that you could use are: GANs VAEs Wasserstein Autoencoders You can implement all of them with many Python Frameworks like: TensorFlow Keras PyTorch If you want to take this as a didactic task or if the data is simple enough, you can also explore the basic techniques like trying to fit your data to a model with things like: Maximum Likelihood, MAP, GMMs ecc... This is probably the approach you were going to use if I understand correctly from your question.
