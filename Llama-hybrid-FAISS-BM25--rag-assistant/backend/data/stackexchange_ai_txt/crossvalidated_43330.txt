PCA, as far as I can tell, is just looking at and doing stuff with the output of factorisation through the Singular Value Decomposition . $\bf{X=U \Sigma V^T}$. Just in case the question was about factorisation generally. Factorisation would be any breaking up / decomposing of a matrix into a product of other matrices. A different factorisation is the LU , $\bf{X=LU}$, which helps solve systems of equations through elimination.
