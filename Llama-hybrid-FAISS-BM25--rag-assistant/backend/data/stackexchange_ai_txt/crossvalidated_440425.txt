Understandable way of thinking about higher order tensors

I study deep learning and the one of the major problem I face is I can't imagine shape of higher order tensors in my head. for instance - A 2d tensor - (x,y) is a rectangle with x,y along its length and breadth. 3d tensor - x,y,z is a 3d figure After that, I just go into brain-freeze, how to think about them Is there a way which more experienced data-scientist use to think about them?
