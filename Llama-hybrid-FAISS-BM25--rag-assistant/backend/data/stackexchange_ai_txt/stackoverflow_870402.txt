I successfully migrated VSS 2005 to SVN several months ago. I used the "VssMigrate.Tim2" tool which is apparently on CodePlex now as vssmigrate . It worked fine with no major issues. It did seem like the revisions and timestamps weren't ordered quite like I expected, but it wasn't a big deal. EDIT: With vssmigrate, you can choose to migrate a specific VSS path (e.g. $/GroupA/ProjectB) which reduces the time for individual migration and makes the overall process less fragile. I didn't find the process too long although we only had about six months of data in VSS. I managed to complete the migration and Apache+SVN setup over a weekend. Depending on the size of your VSS repository, you may want to create multiple SVN repositories instead of a massive single repository. I am extremely glad we moved away from VSS, although configuring Apache+SVN wasn't too much fun (trial and error). I was considering Git or Mercurial , but neither had a reliable TortoiseXxx tool or VS SCC plugin at the time. Although now that Google code has supported Mercurial and TortoiseHg looks good, I'm tempted to try Mercurial soon.
