parameter optimization for classifier algorithm

It is said that different algorithms have different parameters. I don't really see this as true, say if it is a tree decision algorithm and naive bayesian algorithm, what is the parameter for each? Can someone give me an example.. If this is the case then doing a 5-fold cross validation for a data that is going to be run using a decision tree algorithm is different with bayesian? Also for the parameter optimization I will do a 5-fold cross validation. Is there a way to automatically do this to determine the set values key of parameters using weka?
