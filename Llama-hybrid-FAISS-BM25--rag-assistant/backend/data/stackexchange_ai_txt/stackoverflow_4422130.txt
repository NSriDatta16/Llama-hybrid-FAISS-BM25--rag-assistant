Is it possible to change z-Index of the draggable elements when mousedown?

I found that the stack option of JQuery UI draggable was very useful , but it only work when I dragging the elements .So, can I change the stack value of elements which draggable just when I **click the elements** or with the mousedown event ?? Thank you very much~~!! The way the draggable plugin to change draggable elements stack[z-index] order is dragging and moving the element.If you only click the draggable element it doesn't change the stack order.And I want it to change when I click.
