What is the right way to organize communication of two clients with one table?

I am using PostgreSQL as my database and C++ with Qt for my client. Several clients may connect to database at the same time and start editing one table. What is the right way to organize this process? The last thing I have come up to is to edit cached table on client side, have separate table in database with last time table was modified and make some kind of diff procedure on commit.
