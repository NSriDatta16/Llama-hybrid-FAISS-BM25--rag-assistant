struts2 localization by embedding the locale code in the action name rather than by using ...?request_locale=

hi all, i want to make localization feature in a website written in struts 2. as far as i know, the standard way of doing so is using get in the following manner: http://.../namespace/action_name?request_locale= however, my boss doesn't like such hairy url. instead, i'm required to write it in the following manner: http://.../namespace/a_param/ code>/another_param... i tried to change the action mapping in my struts.xml into something like {2} ... it doesn't work after i changed it into {2} ... it doesn't work either T_T by the way, i know there is trick of putting ActionContext.getContext().setLocale(new Locale(...)); in action which basically change the locale for that instance. however, it seems that the effect will only be transient (in contrast, i18n saves the chosen locale in session, which basically makes it quite persistent. so, how to change the locale by embedding the locale code in the url? Your help is highly appreciated =D
