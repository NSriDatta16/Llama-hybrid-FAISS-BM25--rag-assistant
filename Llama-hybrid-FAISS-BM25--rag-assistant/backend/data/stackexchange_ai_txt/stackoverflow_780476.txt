Are you getting any deadlocks in your database? A quick look at the Activity Monitor should give you some indication. What do you do to manage DataContext lifecycle - what sort of application have you written (a website, a Windows Client, other)? Once used in a query or operation, a DataContext will keep a connection so that entities loaded can lazy load & etc, so it's imperative that you plan how you use DataContexts in your application. WCF services.. In that case, I am a big fan of the "one context per request" approach. I'd encourage you to wrap your data operations within a using() statement so that the context is disposed when you're done.
