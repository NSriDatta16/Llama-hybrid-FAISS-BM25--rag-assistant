Using results of regression on raw observation values to approximate results of regression on relative change between observations (Simple, Linear)

this is my first time on Stack Exchange so if I did something wrong please tell me. I have a time series dataset. There is an observation $(y,x)$ for each continuous time $t$. Let’s say for each day since 2014-01-01, i.e. $t \in \left\{0, 1, 2, …, 108 \right\}$, where $108$ means today. I ran a regression on the model $y = \alpha + \beta x$ and found $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with $R^2 > 0.975$ My question is, can I approximate $\beta'$ in the model $y' = \alpha' + \beta'x'$ where $y'=\frac{y_{t+1}}{y_t}-1$ $x'=\frac{x_{t+1}}{x_t}-1$ without running regression on that model, just by using $\hat{\beta'}= \frac{\beta \times x_{108}}{\hat{y_{108}}}$ where $\hat{y_{108}}$ is estimated using the original model. I'm curious because I found that my $\hat{\beta'}$ is usually within 1% of $\beta'$ Even a simple Yes or No with help me a lot. Thanks!
