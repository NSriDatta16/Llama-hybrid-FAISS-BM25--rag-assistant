Out of memory exceptions can be tricky and maybe caused by fragmented memory, not actually running out of memory. Therefore they can be tricky to track down. Tess from Microsoft product support in Sweeden ( http://blogs.msdn.com/tess/ ) has got a good number of posts on tracking down memory where memory is going to help with this process. A good profile of your app could also help. JetBrains have a good one as is AQTime.
