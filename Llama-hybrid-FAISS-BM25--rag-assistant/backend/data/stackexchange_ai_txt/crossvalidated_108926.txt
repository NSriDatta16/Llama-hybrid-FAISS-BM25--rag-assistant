How to evaluate a statistical test for fairness of a coin?

I suspect that a given coin is not fair, i.e that the probability of heads is not $\frac{1}{2}$. My question is not how we can prove the unfairness, but if we derive a test to check the fairness, How we can evaluate the test? Say, for $n$ number of tosses, the coin always turned up heads. What is the minimal number $n$ in order to reject the fairness hypothesis at significance level of 1%? Thank you in advance for your attention.
