Solution to force a polynomial curve to end at a specific location

I require a solution (Python if possible) to force a polynomial to end at a specific point. I have read the solutions offered here to a similar question but have been unable to get any of these methods working on my data set as they are not defining end points but locations for a polynomial to pass through. I therefore require a solution to force a polynomial curve to end at a specific location. To put this in context the example that I need this for is shown in the image below, I require a line of best fit for the data below, the green points represent the raw data and the pink points are the mean of the green points for every x value. The best fit should be a 3rd order polynomial until the data becomes a horizontal linear line. The black line is my current attempt at a line of best fit using np.ployfit() , I have defined the polynomial to only plot until the location where I would then start the linear best fit line but as you can see the tail of the polynomial is far too low and hence I want to force it to end/go through a specific point. Additional Information Added The rated power of the turbine is 280kW so this is the max power which you can get out of it regardless of how high the wind speed is. There is also a cut in windspeed of 3m/s before this the turbine isn't generating any electricity and a cut out of 25m/s to prevent oil temperatures overheating in the gear box and mechanical failure occurring the turbine shuts down. The data seen plotted below is for a single turbine and the mean wind speed is the average in all directions. SCADA data - Supervisory control and data acquisition is just data that is automatically recorded in this case every ten minutes from the turbines internal sensors and logged in a database. EGen Mean as can be seen plotted on the graph is simply the mean of the electricity generated for each distinct windspeed. It is from these means that I attempted to plot the line of best fit. I am open to all options to get a nice mathematically sensible best fit as have been banging my head against this problem for too long now.
