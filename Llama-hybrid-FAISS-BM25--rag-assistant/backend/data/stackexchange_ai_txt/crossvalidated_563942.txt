Finding the maximum likelihood parameter estimates for a given bayesian network

I am studying the book by Adnan Darwiche (Modelling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks), specifically Chapter 17. I am unsure about how to proceed with this exercise. Since A leads to B and B leads to C, I know how to compute the maximum likelihood parameters for A leading to B. For B leading to C, we can write the probability $P(C|B,A) = \dfrac{P(A,B,C)}{P(A) P(B|A)} $ . But then, $P(B|A) = \dfrac{P(A,B)}{P(A)}$ . This means that $P(C|B,A) = \dfrac{P(A,B,C)}{P(A,B)} $ . Is this correct, how does this work out then?
