Likelihood over a arbitrary set of hypotheses

I have the following issue. I have finite, large, enumerated set $H$ of hypotheses that maps a time series to an integer, let's say days to integers i.e. $H \subseteq (\mathrm{Day} \to \mathbb{N})$. I now have another hypothesis $e:\mathrm{Day}\to\mathbb N$ that I want to match. A.k.a. I want to find the $h \in H$ that is the most probable given the evidence $e$ a.k.a. $\mathrm{argmax}_{h\in H} P(h|e)$. Using bayes' rule I convert this probability to $P(e|h)\cdot P(h)$ where $P(h)$ is constant if we assume any hypothesis is initially as likely to be selected. Next, I try to compute $P\big(e(a)\big|h(a)\big)$ for given $h\in H$, $a\in \mathrm{Day}$ and $e(a),h(a) \in \mathbb N$. I have no idea what estimator I should use here. After that, I was to compute $P(e|h)$ for each $h \in H$ and find the maximizing $h$, where $$ P(e|h) = \prod_{a\in\mathrm{Day}} P\Big(e(a)\Big|h(a)\Big) $$ I feel a bit wacky in my reasoning. Could you show me any weaknesses in it? Also, what should I use to get $P\big(e(a)\big|h(a)\big)$? Thank you for reading and helping!
