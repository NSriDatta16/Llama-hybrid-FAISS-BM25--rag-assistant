recommended data structure while designing something like a dictionary?

Is TRIE the most recommended data structure while designing something like a dictionary for storing words? Any other alternatives that improve either the time or memory performance? I believe a hash may be good if there's no collision but then memory requirements start getting bad for overlapping words: over, overlap, overlaps, overlapped, overlapping all occupy exclusive storage while we could share space in trie. EDIT: Thanks @Moron and to all of you for the very useful answers. I agree -- generating the hash key is O(n) and so is a TRIE search. However, for hash things can be worse with chaining adding to the time while for TRIE this will not happen. My concern remains that for every node in a TRIE I need to keep a pointer which may be blowing things if the dictionary size is small.
