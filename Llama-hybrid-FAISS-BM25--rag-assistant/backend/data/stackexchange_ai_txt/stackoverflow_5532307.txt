Is there a clean way to get the n-th column of an html table using BeautifulSoup?

Say we look at the first table in a page, so: table = BeautifulSoup(...).table the rows can be scanned with a clean for-loop: for row in table: f(row) But for getting a single column things get messy. My question: is there an elegant way to extract a single column, either by its position, or by its 'name' (i.e. text that appears in the first row of this column)?
