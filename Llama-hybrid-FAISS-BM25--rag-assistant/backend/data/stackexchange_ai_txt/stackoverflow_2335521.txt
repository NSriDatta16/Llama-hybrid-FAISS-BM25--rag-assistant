There is no general and portable way to tell if some process has an open filehandle to some arbitrary file. You must make a judgement with your local knowledge of the situation. In this case, it may be possible to query the process table on the Windows machine to see if the "Dazzle" program is still running. Or maybe your experience gives you other guidelines, like "Dazzle never takes more than 20 seconds to run when the input is reasonable" or "when Dazzle is running, it updates a file every couple of seconds. If the file hasn't been updated in, say, 10 seconds, then there's a very good chance that Dazzle is finished." But you don't necessarily have to wait until Dazzle is finished. It is perfectly OK to read the file at the same time Dazzle is writing to it -- see the perldoc for the seek function , paying attention to the part about "how to emulate tail -f ". Then you can update your database while Dazzle is running. This way, if you are too conservative about guessing when Dazzle has finished, your database will still be updated in a timely manner, and the only cost will be some useless seek and read calls on a filehandle at EOF.
