What methods could be used to determine the validity of results from meta analysis besides conflict of interest?

Based on the answers I've read to a question 1 on the Skeptics stack exchange, I began to wonder what methods besides the declaration of industry funding could be used to determine the validity of results from meta analysis? In other words, can we only trust meta analysis if there is no apparent conflict of interest concerning a topic, or are there other methods? 1. Does the artificial sweetener aspartame cause cancer?
