I might ask the client if reverse DNS is feasible... This way you could leverage the caching abilities of your DNS server to reduce the amount of internet traffic. Unless you don't have internal DNS, in which case you would utilize the caching abilities of your ISP's DNS server. There is a big difference between whois and DNS though, so it's up to client as to what they want. To answer you direct question though... Maybe you could create some sort of caching for this data to reduce the number of repeat searches you have to do for a single host surfing various pages of the site?
