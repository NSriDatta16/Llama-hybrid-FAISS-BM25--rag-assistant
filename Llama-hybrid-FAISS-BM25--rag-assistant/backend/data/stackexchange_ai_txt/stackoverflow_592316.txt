what impact on system resources does calling Send() every minute with no one to receive it have? Should be none - it should throw an error because the socket isn't open. Will this eventually eat up all my memory? No, it should simply throw an error. Is there some low level Standard Output (stdout) being performed and the data that does not get received simply goes into a black hole? The data is indeed thrown away, and if you're paying attention you'll see the error. You should first check to see if the socket is open before sending. If no one is connected, don't send. One extra if statement. -Adam
