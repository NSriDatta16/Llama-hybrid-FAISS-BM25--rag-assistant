Could I get help on how to get result as average and standard deviation instead of frequencies while cross tabulating in R. my data looks like this Treatment Stage Chlorophyll Salt Green 0.2 Salt Green 0.3 Salt Green 0.4 Salt Pink 0.5 Salt Pink 0.3 Salt Pink 0.2 Salt Red 0.5 Salt Red 0.6 Salt Red 0.7 Nitrogen Green 0.4 Nitrogen Green 0.6 Nitrogen Green 0.9 Nitrogen Pink 0.2 Nitrogen Pink 0.3 Nitrogen Pink 0.5 Nitrogen Red 0.4 Nitrogen Red 0.2 Nitrogen Red 0.3 Control Green 0.5 Control Green 0.6 Control Green 0.8 Control Pink 0.5 Control Pink 0.4 Control Pink 0.6 Control Red 0.2 Control Red 0.3 Control Red 0.1 I appreciate help from this community.
