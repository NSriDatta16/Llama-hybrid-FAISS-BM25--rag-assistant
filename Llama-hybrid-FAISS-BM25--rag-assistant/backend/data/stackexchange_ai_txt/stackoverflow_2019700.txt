Sharepoint allows you to save BLOBS (and documents) externally through the ISPExternalBinaryProvider interface which was added in SP1. Unfortunately, no provider implementation is provider so you have to write your own. Check the Creating an External Storage Solution for Sharepoint article from the June 2009 issue of Technet Magazine for a very good explanation and a sample implementation. A possible drawback of external storage is that it affects the whole farm. All BLOBs from all sites will be stored outside Sharepoint.
