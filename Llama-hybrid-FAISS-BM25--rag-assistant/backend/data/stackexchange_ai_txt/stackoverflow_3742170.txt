HTML5 localStorage apped new data to already existing keys

I have the following localStorage keys: localStorage.setItem(1, "some data"); localStorage.setItem(2, "some data"); localStorage.setItem(3, "some data"); . . . localStorage.setItem(600, "some data"); How can I append to those Keys new data in a loop? var i = 0 for(h=0;h This will overwrite my original keys and not append the "new data" to "some data". Thank you
