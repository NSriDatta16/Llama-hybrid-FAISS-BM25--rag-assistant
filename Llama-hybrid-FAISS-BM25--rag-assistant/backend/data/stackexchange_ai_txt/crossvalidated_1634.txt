There are two definitions of statistical independence: 1) P(A,B)=P(A)*P(B) 2) P(A|B)=P(A) 2a) P(B|A)=P(B). ( means if and only if) So to answer your question: both are valid. Pearson Chi-square test of independence is motivated by definition 1), logistic regression and multinomial regression are motivated by definition 2) of independence.
