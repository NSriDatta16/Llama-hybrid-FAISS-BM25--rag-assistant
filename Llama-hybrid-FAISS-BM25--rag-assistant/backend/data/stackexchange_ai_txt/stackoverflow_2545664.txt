I tried the following code : Hello When I drag-and-drop the text (after selection) from the first TexbtBox to the second one, the text is copied, but not removed from the first TextBox. I tried it under .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 targets. If you want to get rid of your bug without trying to understand it (since it shouldn't happen), you can just put an empty control (Canvas will be ok) on top of your TextBox, with its Background property set to transparent. But the text won't be selectable anymore...
