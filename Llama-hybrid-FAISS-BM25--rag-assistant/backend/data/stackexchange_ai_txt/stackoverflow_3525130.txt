How does one document class attributes using Doxygen?

I'm attempting to document class attributes using Doxygen. Currently, the protected attributes show up in the list at the top of the page for the specific class. I'd like to put an explanation for them. I've tried using @param [name] [description] both above the beginning of the class and right above the declaration of the attributes. I even tried putting them into the docblock for my constructor class and it just broke it. Is there something I'm just missing? -- Logan
