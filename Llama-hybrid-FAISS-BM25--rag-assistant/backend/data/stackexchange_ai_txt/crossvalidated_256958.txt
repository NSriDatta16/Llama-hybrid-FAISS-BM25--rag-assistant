Is there a best way to compare different classifiers?

I'm currently analyzing the same data using lasso, elasticnet and random forest classifiers. I'm just wondering if there is a best way to compare these three models(eg. AUROC, accuracy, mcnemar's test), or I should compare multiple features and trying to figure out if they all favour the same model?
