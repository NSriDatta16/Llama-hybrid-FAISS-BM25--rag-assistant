Inheritance helps generalization (which is upcasting in OOP terms), whereas Composition helps behavior definition (Inversion of Control - or Dependency Injection). One should use whichever grants more benefit; but favoring Composition also makes the code more extend-able. Thus, the code becomes "closed to modification, but open to extension" and thus "HAS-A is better than IS-A". Kind of like being a car yourself or owning a car (or not?)
