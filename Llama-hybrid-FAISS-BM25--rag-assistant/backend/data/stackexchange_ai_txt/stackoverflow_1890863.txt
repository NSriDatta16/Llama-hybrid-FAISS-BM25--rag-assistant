As for flickchart, I've been playing around with it a little bit, and I think the rating system is pretty unsophisticated. In pseudo-code, my guess is that it looks something like this: if rank(loser) == null and rank(winner) == null insert loser at position estimated from global rank insert winner at position estimated from global rank else if rank(winner) == null or rank(winner) Why do I think this? First, I'm completely convinced that their Bayesian priors are not based on a careful mining of my previous choices. They seem to have no way to guess that because I like Return of the Jedi that I like The Empire Strikes Back. In fact, they can't figure out that because I've seen Home Alone 2 that I may have seen Home Alone 1. After hundreds of ratings, the choice hasn't come up. Second of all, if you look at the above code you might find a little bug, which you will definitely notice on the site. You may notice that sometimes you will make a choice and the winner will slide by one . This seems to only happen when the loser wasn't previously added. My guess is that what is happening is that the loser is being added higher than the winner. Other than that, you will notice that rankings do not change at all unless a lower ranked movie beats a higher ranked movie directly . I don't think any real scores are being kept: the site seems to be entirely memoryless except for the ordinal rank of each movie and your most recent rating.
