The aim of Doc2Vec is to produce document level embeddings, thus even if words are sentence-separated if you include them in the same document it has to be considered part of the same semantic source for word similarities. If you don't want such a behavior, you might want to separate your documents in a sentence-level and maybe aggregate the embeddings later in different groups to form your initial paragraphs (depending on your plans)?
