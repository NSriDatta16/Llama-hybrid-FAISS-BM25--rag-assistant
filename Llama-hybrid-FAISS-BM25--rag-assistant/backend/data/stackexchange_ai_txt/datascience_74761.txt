There is an open issue in pomegranate for this in github . In the issue, they mention an ongoing pull request that implements rejections sampling and Gibbs sampling; the last comment in the PR discussion is from 7 days ago (2020, May 17th), so it is not abandoned but actively developed. You could use the version of pomegranate from that PR to sample from your Bayesian Network.
