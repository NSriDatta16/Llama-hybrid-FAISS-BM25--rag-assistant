Conditional Required Attribute for validation

We're trying to get a conditional attribute to work, case in point, there's a boolean (checkbox) that if checked, its related text is required. So, ideally we'd have something like ... public bool Provision { get; set; } [ConditionalRequirement(IsNeededWhenTrue = Provision)] public string ProvisionText { get; set; } Is this even possible? Alternate idea (not as elegant?) public bool Provision2 { get; set; } [PropertyRequired(RequiredBooleanPropertyName = "Provision2")] public string Provision2Text { get; set; } I'd hate to use the magic string method ... but any other ideas?
