Resize iframe by mouse drag

I have a page that consists of two iframes where they divide the page into two parts. Is there a way to resize the division of the page using mouse drag? I would prefer a solution that does not require JQuery as we're not using it at the moment (We are using Microsoft AJAX library but I couldn't find a solution that leverages it). Thanks.
