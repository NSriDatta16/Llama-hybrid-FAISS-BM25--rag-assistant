why is an optimizer used in something that is not a neural network?

why is an optimizer used in something that is not a neural network? in the neural style transfer architecture the image is updated instead of the neural network weights. in stylegan encoder (find image in latent space), the latent space is updated instead of the weights of a neural network. Why does it work in these cases, since it is not the weights of a neural network that is updated?
