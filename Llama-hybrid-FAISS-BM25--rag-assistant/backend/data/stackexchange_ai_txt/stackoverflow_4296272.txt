You can pass a function to the accept option for .droppable() so it only accepts those elements in the same row, like this: $(".MyClass").closest("tr").children(":not('.column-1')").droppable({ accept: function(draggable) { return $.contains(this.parentNode, draggable[0]); } }); In the function draggable is the jQuery object that is the draggable, we're just using $.contains() to see if the .parentNode (the ) contains that draggable...meaning the you're trying to drop came from this row. You can test it out here .
