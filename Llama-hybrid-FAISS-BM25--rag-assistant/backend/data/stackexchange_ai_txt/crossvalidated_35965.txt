Tsochantaridis et. al. discuss this problem in "Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables." They compare a number of structured max-margin formulations and observe that the "slack rescaling" formulation is scale invariant while the "margin rescaling" formulation is not (Section 2.2.5). So the $\Delta(y_i,y)$ function in margin scaling formulation does need to be adjusted according to the scaling of the feature function. Feature function scaling, though, is probably not a real problem in practice because the feature function is usually used to decompose a large output space and wouldn't be used to hide arbitrary scaling factors. The factor of $.5$ that you mention may be due to mapping the standard two-class svm formulation to the structured formulation. The feature mapping portion of the constraint in the structured problem can be written as: $$ w_{y_i} \cdot \Psi(x,y_i) - w_{\neg y_i} \cdot \Psi(x,\neg y_i)\\ \quad=(w_{y_i} \cdot x) y_i - (w_{\neg y_i} \cdot x) \neg y_i\\ \quad=(w_{y_i} + w_{\neg y_i}) \cdot x \; y_i $$ If you assume that $w_{y_i}=w_{\neg y_i}$ and the equivalent regularizer from the standard 2-class svm is $||w||^2\dot = ||w_{y_i} + w_{\neg y_i}||^2$, then this would penalize the weights twice as much as the structured regularizer, $||w_{y_i}||^2 + ||w_{\neg y_i}||^2$. Hence, you would want the value of the structured constraint to be $(w_{y_i} + w_{\neg y_i}) \cdot x\;y_i/2\ge 1$ (if you assume a 0-1 loss).
