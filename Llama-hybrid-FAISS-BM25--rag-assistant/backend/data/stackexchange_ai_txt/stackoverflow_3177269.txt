Even Spaced Primary / Secondary Columns in Rails

I have a set of regions and cities (nested) and want to be able to output them in a few even length columns ordered alphabetically . For example: [Alberta] [Ontario] [Quebec] Calgary Hamilton Hull Edmonton Kitchener Laval [Manitoba] Ottawa Montreal Winnipeg Toronto Waterloo I took a look at ' in_groups ' (and ' in_groups_of ') however, I need to group based on the size of a relationship (i.e. the number of cities a region has). Not sure if a good Rails way of doing this exists. Thus far my code looks something like this: However, certain regions are extremely unbalanced (i.e. have many cities) and don't display correctly.
