I am not sure you need any special tricks as long as the relevant factors are captured by the model. To keep things simple I will discuss the issue in the context of linear regression. The same intuition carries over to the time series setting. Suppose, that you want to predict the monthly sales of cell phones for brand X and to illustrate the ideas suppose that you use linear regression to do so. The issue you have is that there are some factors that impact sales every month (e.g., weather of the month to take a silly example) and some factors that are idiosyncratic to a month (e.g., launch of a new cell phone). You wish to account for both factors consistently. Denote the factors that impact sales every month by $C_m$ (where 'C' stands for common and 'm' for month) and idiosyncratic factors by $I_m$ (where I stands for idiosyncratic and m for month). Then, your model would be: $S_m = \beta_c C_M + \beta_i I_m + \epsilon$ In the months where there is no idiosyncratic factors $I_m$ would be 0 and hence the impact on sales would be captured by $\beta_c$ and in the months when you do have idiosyncratic factors the impact on sales would be $\beta_c + \beta_i$ with $\beta_i$ presumably being negative if the idiosyncratic factor dampens sales for brand X. Thus, the coefficients 'automatically' adjust themselves provided all the necessary factors are present in the model. Thus, it seems to me you do not have to worry about the issue you raise if you do account for all factors whether they are idiosyncratic to a time period or common across time periods. Edit in response to comment Your example of concert and increased cell phone usage by young consumers is an example of an interaction effect. To put it in different words your example is saying that the effect of the concert on cell phone use is higher for younger consumers rather than older consumers. Basically, your model is saying the following: Minutes = beta1 age + beta2 * concert + beta3 * age * concert + error Thus, the beta3 parameter will capture the differential impact how younger/older consumers respond to the concert.
