One very simple way I have measured non-linearity before is based on the variation of the gradients between data points (using the difference in their x and y values). I then take the relative average deviation of the gradients, giving a value independent of the scale: $$ Nonlinearity = RAD\bigg(\frac{diff(Y)}{diff(X)}\bigg) $$ Which is the same as doing $$ Z=\frac{diff(Y)}{diff(X)} \\ Nonlinearity=\frac{MAD(Z)}{mean(Z)} $$ where Y and X are the vectors from the pairs of values. diff() means the difference between one value and the previous (i.e. x[n+1]-x[n] ). mad() is mean absolute deviation. This measures non-linearity because any two points on a line have the same gradient between them, therefore the mad() or std() of the gradients between points will be zero if the points are on a line, and larger the more the gradients deviate. I created this measure independently, so it may already be described with an actual name or there may be a similar but better approach, but it's intuitive and simple. You can also use std dev instead of RAD, which results in taking the coefficient of variation of the gradients, cv() : $$ Nonlinearity = cv\bigg(\frac{diff(Y)}{diff(X)}\bigg) $$ Measures like CV, SD and correlation coefficient weigh outliers more heavily, so under some circumstances you may prefer RAD, which gives a more linear measure of non-linearity. You can also calculate the ratio of RAD to CV, which gives further information about your data. Either of these can easily be adapted to give a measure of linearity between 0 and 1: $$ Linearity = \frac{1}{1+\frac{MAD(Z)}{mean(Z)}} $$ or $$ Linearity = \frac{1}{1+cv(Z)} $$
