You have OS meta-information (size and timestamps). Other meta-information includes permissions. You could compare inode and dnode information, but that doesn't mean much. You have a summary (checksum). You have byte-by-byte details. What else could there be? Are you asking for other summaries? A summary is less informative than the byte-by-byte details. But you could easily invent lots of other summaries. A summary is only useful if you save it somewhere so you don't recompute it all the time. If you want to save summaries for the "master" copy, you can invent any kind of summary you want. Line counts, letter "e" counts, average line length, anything is an potentially interesting summary.
