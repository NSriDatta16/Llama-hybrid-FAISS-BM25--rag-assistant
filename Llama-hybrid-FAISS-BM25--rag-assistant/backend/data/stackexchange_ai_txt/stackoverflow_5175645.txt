If the average has to be around the the given number but not exactly it you can use the random.gauss(mu, sigma) from the random module. This will create a more natural random set of of values that have a mean (average) around the given value for mu with a standard deviation of sigma . The more runners you create the closer the mean will get to the desired value. import random avg = 10 stddev = 5 n = random.gauss(avg,stddev) for r in range(100): r = RunnerStat(miles=avg+n) r.save() If you need the average to be the exact number then you could always create a runner (or more reasonably a few runners) that counter balance what ever your current difference from the mean is.
