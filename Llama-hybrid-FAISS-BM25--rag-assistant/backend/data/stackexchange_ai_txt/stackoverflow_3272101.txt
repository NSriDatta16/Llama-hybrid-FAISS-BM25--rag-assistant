The content you put in a VCS can matter for: storage: the way the delta is stored can differ for simple texts, Microsoft Word documents, UML models (Rational .rose files), html pages, ... See for instance ClearCase type manager as an example of VCS managing the storage based on element content. merge: merging can be done differently based on the content of the versioned files through: internal algorithm (if the VCS has type manager) external third-party merge tools which can infer some "intelligent" merge tactics based on the extension and content of the file. Regarding your question, the programing language within versioned files is to my knowledge never a criteria for storing or merging: they (the files) are just text. If they are treated differently, it would be only during the merge process, and only if an external merge tool is smart enough to perform an "intelligent" merge of some kind based on the file content. But the VCS itself is generally not involved in that special merge (for source files considered as text).
