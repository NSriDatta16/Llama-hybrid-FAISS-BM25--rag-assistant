Would you be able to post a sample online somewhere that demonstrates this problem? Double buffering is not something that is necessary in Silverlight, and will not help in this situation. One thing which you could try is to set enableGpuAcceleration="true" on the Silverlight plugin object and set CacheMode="BitmapCache" on the "ship" element. Without knowing what the problem you are running into is, I can't know if this will help or not, but it is worth trying.
