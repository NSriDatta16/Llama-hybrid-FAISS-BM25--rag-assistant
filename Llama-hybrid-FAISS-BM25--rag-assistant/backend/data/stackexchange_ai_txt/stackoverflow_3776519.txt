If you have to store history, make a shadow table with the same schema as the table you are tracking and a 'Revision Date' and 'Revision Type' column (e.g. 'delete', 'update'). Write (or generate - see below) a set of triggers to populate the audit table. It's fairly straightforward to make a tool that will read the system data dictionary for a table and generate a script that creates the shadow table and a set of triggers to populate it. Don't try to use XML for this, XML storage is a lot less efficient than the native database table storage that this type of trigger uses.
