When AJAX began to hit it big, late 2005 I wrote a client-side template engine and basically turned my blogger template into a fully fledged AJAX experience. The thing is, that template stuff, it was really easy to implement and it eliminated a lot of the grunt work. Here's how it's was done. And then in JavaScript: var response = // The instantiate function makes a deep clone of the template then searches the clone for identifiers to replace with data found in the response. The end result is a populated DOM tree which was originally defined in HTML. If I had more than one result I just looped through the above code.
