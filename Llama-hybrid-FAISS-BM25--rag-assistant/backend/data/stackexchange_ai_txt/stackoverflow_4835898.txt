Problem organizing code in asp.net MVC 2

I'm new to MVC and I borrow a book from library yesterday on asp.net MVC 2. I'm a bit confused about what kind of code should be included in Model, view and controller. I was working on user input validation from the book and if I understand correctly, it seems they declare variables in "Model", validating user input in "Controller" and display the web page in "View". Model: -Declaring variables e.g: class Contact: public string Name { get; set; } public string EmailAddress { get; set; } Views: -Contain HTML, HTML Helper code, displaying contents and use variables from "Model" e.g: model.Name) %> model.Name) %> Controller: -"Playing"/"Manipulating" variables from Model + Call "View" to display web page at the end (return View()). (Validating user input for this example) e.g: if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(contact.Name)) ModelState.AddModelError("Name", "Please enter your name."); I'm not sure but it seems to me that "Controller" is the "heavy coding" part to me. On the other hand, "View" is the good old HTML, markup that display the web site and "Model" is a place that store data (declaring variables for example.) Please let me know whether I'm on the right direction. Thanks :)
