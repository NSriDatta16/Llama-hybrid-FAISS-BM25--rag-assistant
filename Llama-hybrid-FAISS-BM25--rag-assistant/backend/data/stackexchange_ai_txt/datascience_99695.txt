How is the connection between Text Mining, NLP and Tasks like Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stop-word Removal etc.?

I am new to the whole world around Big Data and Text Mining. It took me a while to understand all the connections and to be able to classify the buzzwords. But there's one thing I still don't understand. The connection between NLP, text mining and tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, stop-word removal etc.. I refer to these two papers for example: https://www.elderresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Whitepaper_The_Seven_Practice_Areas_of_Text_Analytics_Chapter_2_Excerpt.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311394659_Text_Mining_Techniques_Applications_and_Issues how do I connect this? Option 1: Tasks like tokenization, lemmatization etc. are tasks of NLP and NLP is an application field of text mining Option 2: Tasks like tokenization, lemmatization etc. are tasks of Text Mining which find their usage in NLP? Can someone explain this to me?
