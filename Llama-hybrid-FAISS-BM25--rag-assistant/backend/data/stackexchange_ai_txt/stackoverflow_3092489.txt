Representing a "radiomatrix" question from a survey

Hi I am making a report of a survey where we have what we call a "radiomatrix" and it looks like this. alt text http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/9288/radiomatrix.png Then we import the answers is a table in R into something that looks like this: user tiramisu cupcake chocolate carrot test01 loves_it loves_it loves_it hate_it test02 likes_it likes_it loves_it likes_it test03 likes_it loves_it loves_it hate_it What would be the best and most meaningful graphical representation for this?
