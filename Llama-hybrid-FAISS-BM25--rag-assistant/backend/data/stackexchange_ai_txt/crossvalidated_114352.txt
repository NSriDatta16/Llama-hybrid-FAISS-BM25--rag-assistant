Average may not be the best statistic in this case. Use box whisker plots as shown below. Take at least 10 runs for each feature set (FS). Say you have 6 feature sets (FS1 to FS6) and the metric on the $y$ axis should be low for good performance of the model. In this example, FS1 has low median but is not very consistent over the 10 runs. On the other hand FS5 has low relatively low value for the metric and is also fairly consistent. Note that even though FS6 is highly consistent, it has a higher value for the metric and therefore should not usually be preferred. Thus, the user can choose the best feature set by trading-off between the accuracy of the model and its consistency.
