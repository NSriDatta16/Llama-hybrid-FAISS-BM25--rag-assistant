Neural network library for Python for Microsoft Windows

I have been having trouble with selecting a good library for Neural network algorithms in Python. TensorFlow isn't supported on windows. Theano is still in the beta phase of development. PyBrain too is in the beta phase of development. Scipy supports machine leaning in terms of regression and clustering. But neural networks aren't present. Please suggest me a reliable and robust library.
