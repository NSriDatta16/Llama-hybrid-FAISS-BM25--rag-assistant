How to derive prediction equations for classification in a bayesian setting?

I'm following Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning course on Coursera and the following equations are given for training and prediction without derivation: Training: $$ P(\theta | X_{tr}, y_{tr}) = \frac{P(y_{tr} | X_{tr}, \theta), P(\theta)}{P(y_{tr} | X_{tr})}$$ and Prediction: $$ P(y_{ts} | X_{ts}, X_{tr}, y_{tr}) = \int P(y_{ts} | X_{ts}, \theta) P(\theta | X_{tr}, y_{tr}) d \theta $$ where $ts$ refers to test data, and $tr$ to training. I was able to derive the expression for training but I'm stuck on the prediction equation References Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning, Coursera, Week 1, "Bayesian approach to statistics".
