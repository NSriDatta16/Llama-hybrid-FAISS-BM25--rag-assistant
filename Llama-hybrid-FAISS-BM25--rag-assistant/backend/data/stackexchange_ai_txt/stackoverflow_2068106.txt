WPF drag distance threshold

I have a program with two WPF treeviews that allow dragging and dropping between the two. The problem is, it can be annoying to open / close items on the treeviews because moving the mouse just one pixel while holding the left mouse button triggers the drag / drop functionality. Is there some way to specify how far the mouse should move before it's considered a drag / drop?
