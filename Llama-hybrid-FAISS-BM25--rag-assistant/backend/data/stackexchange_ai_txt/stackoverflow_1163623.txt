Debugging Nant Build scripts in VS 2005

HI, We are using NANT build scripts in our project. The scenario is as follows, In my Application I create an application( this is basically UI based, the user drags, drops widgets etc, these are stored as xml internally). then while I say Build application, we use NANT scripts to call XSLT transform, I do not know if it is possible to debug the NANT scrips and the XSLTs called from NANT script in VS or some other debugging tool, Can anybody suggest a way to debug this. Thanks, Sid
