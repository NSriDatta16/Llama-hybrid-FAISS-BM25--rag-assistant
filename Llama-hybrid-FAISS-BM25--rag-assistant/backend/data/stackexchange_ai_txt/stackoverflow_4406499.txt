Not an answer to exact question... Why were you convinced to put your smaller tables into one large one? What you were doing is called "Vertical Partitioning" and can actually be very useful, depending on your situation. With many large TEXT or BLOB fields, a vertical partition can keep your more queried data physically together and faster to access. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(database ) Vertical partitioning involves creating tables with fewer columns and using additional tables to store the remaining columns. Normalization also involves this splitting of columns across tables, but vertical partitioning goes beyond that and partitions columns even when already normalized. Different physical storage might be used to realize vertical partitioning as well; storing infrequently used or very wide columns on a different device, for example, is a method of vertical partitioning. Done explicitly or implicitly, this type of partitioning is called "row splitting" (the row is split by its columns). A common form of vertical partitioning is to split (slow to find) dynamic data from (fast to find) static data in a table where the dynamic data is not used as often as the static. Creating a view across the two newly created tables restores the original table with a performance penalty, however performance will increase when accessing the static data e.g. for statistical analysis See also: http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/performance-partitioning.html
