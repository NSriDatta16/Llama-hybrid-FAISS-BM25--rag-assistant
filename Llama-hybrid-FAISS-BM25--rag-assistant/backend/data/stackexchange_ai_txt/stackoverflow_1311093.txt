ALWAYS put JavaScript in a file external to HTML. The problem with JavaScript that exists in page is that it typically exists in the global namespace, which could easily cause namespace collisions that makes code crash. So, always put JavaScript in an external file. With that said you should organize your code in an object-oriented manner. Try to capture an entire application representing a single point of execution to a single named function. Always write your code using a single var command per function, which should go at the top of the function, so that your code is easier to read. Ensure all variables and functions are declared with a var command or they will into the global namespace, which is potential failure. Put sections of execution of a giant function into smaller child functions, because this makes code easier to maintain when you can point to a particular named block when debugging or writing enhancements. Also, always run your code through JSLint to verify syntax accuracy.
