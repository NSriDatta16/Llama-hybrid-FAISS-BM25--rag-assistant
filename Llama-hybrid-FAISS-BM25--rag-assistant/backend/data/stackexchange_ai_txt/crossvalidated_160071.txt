P-value of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and KPSS test

I would like to test if the time series of the US 3-month treasury bills (monthly data from 1934 to 2015) is stationary. I'm using the ADF test in R (from the package tseries ), but I get contradictory results: if I change the alternative hypothesis the p-value is always high. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: x Dickey-Fuller = -2.0698, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.5488 alternative hypothesis: stationary Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: x Dickey-Fuller = -2.0698, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.4512 alternative hypothesis: explosive The same thing happen if I use the KPSS test (p-value is always low): KPSS Test for Level Stationarity data: x KPSS Level = 3.3275, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.01 KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity data: x KPSS Trend = 2.1869, Truncation lag parameter = 7, p-value = 0.01 What am I doing wrong?
