tradingeye JS error

Can anyone help me, I have a IE javascript issue. I am really stuck and the client has just brought it to my attention. The site is http://www.fleurofengland.com/ , its the check out page so if you would be kind enough to goto the site, add anything to your basket and go through to the checkout. The problem is when you get to the checkout page ( https://www.fleurofengland.com/eaction/checkout.billing/ ), under the 'Billing and Delivery Details' heading you will see a dropdown called country. Below that is another dropdown called County/State, this dropdown is meant to be populated from the values of the 'country' one above however its not working. Please help or suggest a fix. Thanks in Advance, Kyle
