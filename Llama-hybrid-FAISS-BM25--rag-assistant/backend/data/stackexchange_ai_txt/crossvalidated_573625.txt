I originally thought this could be done with a binomial approximation, but I've since changed my mind. Because you have a finite sample (N=200 documents) then we can do Bayesian inference to determine the probability no documents have errors given we observe our entire sample is error free. This question asks something similar and offers the posterior distribution. Following Tim's answer in the linked question, let's make our "target" state an incorrect documents and determine the probability there are 0 incorrect documents given we have only observed correct documents thus far. Using this model, it looks like you'd have to sample almost all documents before there is a 99% probability that all documents are correct, which means you might as well sample them all.
