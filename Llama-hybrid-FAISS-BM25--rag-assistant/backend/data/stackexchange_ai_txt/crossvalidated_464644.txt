PCA with principal(): no rotation, varimax rotation, and oblimin rotation all give same results

I ran PCA with the principal() function of the psych package on some data with 2 variables and 15 observations . I ran PCA thrice, first with no rotation , then with the varimax rotation , and lastly with the oblimin rotation . I didn't eliminate any factor/component and kept both factors/components. However, in all 3 cases my output was exactly the same. Why are the varimax and oblimin rotations ignored? Is it because I have only 2 variables? Or because the data is highly correlated? Here is the code: library(psych) library(GPArotation) dummyData
