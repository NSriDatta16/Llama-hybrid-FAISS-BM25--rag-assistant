SetAuthCookie() works with the Forms Authentication framework within ASP.NET which you can then adapt for integration with a membership provider. Do the Membership and Role Providers have their own data storage? They can, yes. There is an abstract implementation that you can subclass for your specific data needs. There is a SqlMembershipProvider you can use right out of the box, you just need a database to point to and create the needed tables. There is quite a bit of information on that class, like here or here . What if I want to use my own data storage? The SqlMembershipProvider does, but check out this alternative MySQL framework if you're interested in seeing how another DBMS does it. Do I need to implement my own membership/role provider, and how would one go about doing that? Using the built-in ones is pretty easy, but a lot of shops roll their own so that they can use existing tables. You'll need to implement this class . Or is my way of just setting the auth cookie and then using my own retrieval methods, etc, the best way of doing a custom membership/role provider? In all likelihood you'll need a stronger system, and a custom membership provider is a good idea.
