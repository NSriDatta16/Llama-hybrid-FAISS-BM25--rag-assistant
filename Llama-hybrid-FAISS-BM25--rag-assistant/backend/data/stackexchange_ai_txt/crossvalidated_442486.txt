How to get the actual mean absolute error in cross validation after transforming the target variable y?

For a target variable y , it is transformed using np.log1p . Then a random forest regression model is trained using the transformed y . Then I tried to use cross_val_score in sklearn to compute the neg_mean_absolute_error . The mean of the returned scores is -0.17 . Should I convert it back by using np.emp1(0.17) ? But the error is too small. As I am predicting housing price. The error should be much larger than this.
