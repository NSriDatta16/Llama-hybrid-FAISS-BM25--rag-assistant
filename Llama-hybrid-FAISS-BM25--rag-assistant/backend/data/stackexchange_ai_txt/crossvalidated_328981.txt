There is one main question, but is open to many possible answers. The question is: Is a model that better reflects the data is superior to a model that falls somewhat short but has good theoretical backing? There is a second part to it: for a business decision such as this? The simplified answer is: No. Or rather: Mu -- ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan ) The real answer lies in the definition of "better". If the figure of merit is the return of investment, you have a clear definition by which you can decide. Hypothetically do both and evaluate the difference. But the determination of the "best fit" of a certain model is a much more involved question. The "goodness-of-fit" can only be determined within certain models, and only in special cases exactly (e.g. chi square fitting). But the comparison of different models, especially of some of which cannot be subjected to this procedure is simply not possible. It is a common concept in science, that one can find the "right" theory by testing it under the light of data. Or express this in the easy to understand Bayesian expression P(theory|data) = P(data| theory) * P(theory)/P(data), although it's a bit more involved to do an actual calculation. The fundamental problem with the concept is that it's wrong. It may be possible to falsify a certain theory by data (e.g. theory: "no cow ever dies", data: "look at my steak"). But with everything involved there is no way to prove that some theory might be true. So who is right now? In all probability you are addressing the question from two different directions. My guess is that the statistician is only concerned about the data itself and tries to describe it the best (= shortest, most simple) way; so that technicalities like overfitting etc. don't matter. The scientist starts with the reasoning of what is happening, maybe even from first principles (scientists are known to do this). Everything boils down to the questions how can the probability of cow death (because of disease xYx) be expressed and compared between vaccinated and un-vaccinated animals. Without more information on the actual problem, it is not possible to say who's right. But clearly you only have the data that you have available. And certainly one would need this data to form/calculate an answer. But if the data is insufficient to extract all needed features, then the statisticians approach might yield a better result. But if the data is sufficient, then the scientist can prove (with a lot of work!) that his theory is statistically the least wrong.
