Problem with cocos2D for iPhone and touch detection

I just don't get it. I use cocos2d for development of a small game on the iPhone/Pod. The framework is just great, but I fail at touch detection. I read that you just need to overwrite the proper functions (e.g. "touchesBegan" ) in the implementation of a class which subclasses CocosNode. But it doesn't work. What could I do wrong? the function: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{NSLog(@"tickle, hihi!");} did I get it totally wrong?
