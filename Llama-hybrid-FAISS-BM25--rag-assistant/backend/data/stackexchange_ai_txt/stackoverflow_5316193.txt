block access to certain pages in magento

i have a category in my store, lets call it Program , this category will only have 1 product, lets call it Program product , so, i've developed a module only to show this category and product, the view is diferent from the others categories, so, if i write in my browser the url myweb.com/index.php/program.html or myweb.com/index.php/program-product.html i can see the custom categories page or the product view page and i don't want that, i want that if someone write this url he will be redirect to another one, how can i do that, if it is posible thanks
