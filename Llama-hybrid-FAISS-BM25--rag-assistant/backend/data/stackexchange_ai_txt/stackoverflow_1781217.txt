I'd store such hierarchical data in XML on the storage. You can use the xml.etree.ElementTree standard module to load such an XML file into a hierarchical data structure in Python, make changes to it, then save it back to a file. This way you don't have to bother with the actual data structure, since it is built by ElementTree automatically. See xml.etree.ElementTree in the Python Manual. More information can be found here : (There're other mature solutions in Python to load an XML file into various data structures. Just pick one which is the easiest to use for your task. Google is your friend. :-) )
