I think checked exceptions are a failed experiment. The original goal of exception was to eliminate the need to validate every function call return, which was resulting in programs programs that are difficult to read, and probably inefficient as well, thus discouraging programmers from signaling and handling exceptions. While great on paper, in practice the checked exceptions reintroduced the very same problem exception were supposed to eliminate in the first place. They add a tightly coupling between the layers of application. They make it impossible for libraries to change their implementation in subsequent versions. The link posted by crausher goes into details and explain the problems much better than I ever could.
