Information needed with Time Series Data

My Time Series Data, doesn't have a proper trend (neither upwards nor downwards). Its more of like a seasonal component, goes ups & downs for a span of 10 years. Which method/process we should apply here, or is there any way out from it ? I am trying it in R Studio, tried to decompose the data which shows clearly the trend, more of like a parabola.
