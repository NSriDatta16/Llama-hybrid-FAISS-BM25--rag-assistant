Mark, I've seen WinGraphViz used in a corporate .NET application that used custom workflow- .NET assembly dependency analyser uses it. The application probably won't be suitable for your needs as I assume you want to let the users drag/drop items as opposed to merely viewing the workflow? Whilst this is possible, I'm not sure how smooth it would be! Anyhow it might open up new doors/new avenues to explore in your quest to find a suitable library.
