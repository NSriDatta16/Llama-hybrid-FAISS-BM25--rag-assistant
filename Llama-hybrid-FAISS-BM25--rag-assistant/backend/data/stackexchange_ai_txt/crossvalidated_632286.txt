Interpreting Regression coefficients where Y is an index

I am having trouble with the correct interpretation of my regression coefficients. My independent variable is fund allocation which is a continuous variable. I have two output variables on which I regress separately. I construct an index for infrastructure by combining the normalised value of the number of schools and hospitals and averaging across the two. The coefficient is 0.079. Can I say 1 unit increase in funds causes a 7.9% increase in my index for infrastructure. Similarly I have another index for sanitation where I average across two variables (both binary). The coefficient is 0.037. So can I say a unit increase in funds causes a 3.9% increase in my sanitation index?
