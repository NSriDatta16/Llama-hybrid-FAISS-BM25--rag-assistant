extract text from tag

Hi I've got these lines here, I am trying to extract the first paragraph found in the file, but this fails to return any results, if not it returns results that are not even in tags which is odd? $file = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; $hd = fopen($file,'r'); $cn = fread($hd, filesize($file)); fclose($hd); $cnc = preg_replace('/ (.+?) /','$1',$cn);
