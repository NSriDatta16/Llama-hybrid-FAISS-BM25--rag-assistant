(Ruby, Rails, Javascript) Drag and Drop without bugging the server...?

Is there an equivalent of "link_to_function" (instead of ":action") when using "draggable_element"? Basically I need to drag and drop some items and have it reflected locally without contacting the server. My current setup is that I have two DIVs with various list items. I have one full of items with domids "points[selected][name]" and another div with domids "points[available][name]". I need to drag and drop between them without consulting the server. Only on save do I wish to bother the server. I've watched all the RailsCasts on similar items, but it doesn't seem to cover having a non-standard action (i.e. Helper Function) triggered from a "draggable_element" method. Thanks in advance!
