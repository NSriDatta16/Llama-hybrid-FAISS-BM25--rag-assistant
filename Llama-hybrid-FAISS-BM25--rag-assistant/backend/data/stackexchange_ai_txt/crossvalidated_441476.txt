Integrate PCA factors in a regression

I am a beginner maybe that will seem obvious, I have a regression looking as : yt =α+βxt+σεt From another data set I have calculated the PCA factors. Now I am asked to create a regression such as : yt = α + βxt + βjFt,j + σεt My question is: how can I integrate my PCA factors into my new regression ? In other words, am I supposed to know beta in order to multiply it to my factors ? Thanks for your answers! Florian
