Constructing a User Profile for Music Taste

My goal is to construct User profiles based on positive (and maybe also negative) interactions with songs. A User has the option to like a song. This would give me a list of likes for each user. With for example the Spotify API I can extract different features of songs: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features So for each song i would have categorical features (like genre) and numerical features (like danceability). I want to create a good user profile that represents the musical taste of the user with a certain confidence that includes the mentioned features. I have been doing a lot of research but I mainly find info on recommender systems and not on user profiles. Would it be as simple as computing the average over all liked tracks for numerical features and the top ranks for the categorical features? This approach seems a little bit to simple for me, any ideas?
