How are you opening the popup window? Javascript? A link? I think, probably when the popup window opens it ends the execution This can't be true, any opening of pop-ups happens client-side this can't possibly stop any execution server-side. it throws the exception "null object referrence" Which object? Have you instantiated it? If so have you possibly nullified it? if I use a try/catch, the exception doesn't occur - but I don't get any information This isn't true - I expect you're just handling the exception (within your catch) so that it no longer being left unhandled. If you can answer these questions I suspect you'll figure out the problem yourself. However I suspect you're posting back (and getting the server to provide the popup code) and by doing this you're inadvertently affecting your excel object. So direct your attention there.
