There is no general method which works equally well for all kinds of data. Your task will be to find a model which is a good match for the time period you have. I would start by exploring the data, starting with plotting $x$ against time. Maybe looking into standard time series models would be a reasonable next step? Using simple linear regression with the year as input and $x$ as response corresponds to fitting a linear trend to the data. This may work well, if the plot I suggested above looks approximately like a straight line.
