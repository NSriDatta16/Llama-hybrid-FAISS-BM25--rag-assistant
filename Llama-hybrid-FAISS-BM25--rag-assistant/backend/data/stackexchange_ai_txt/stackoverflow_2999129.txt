How do I sort an ArrayList lexicographically?

I am trying to sort an ArrayList of Strings that represent card values. So, some cards contain letters ("King") and some contain Strings containing only a number ("7"). I know to use Collections.sort, but it only sorts Strings that contain letters. How do I get the ArrayList to be sorted by number as well as alphabetically? Edit: Sorry, I must not have been paying much attention when I looked at the sorting. The sort works correctly, I must have just been thrown off by the fact that a 10 will come before a 2. Thanks
