I guess that OpenMP in gcc was still quite experimental in the old days when 4.1 came out. What happens if you replace the macro name in the OpenMP pragma by the numerical constant? I am not quite sure what the standards say about macro replacements inside pragmas, maybe this older version of gcc has a different strategy for that than newer ones.
