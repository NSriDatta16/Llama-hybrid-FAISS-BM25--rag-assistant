You're probably looking at the Tag Wrapping option inside the Text Editor -> HTML options under the text editor settings. You can either disable it altogether or extend it beyond the 80 character default. However, there is still some level of code reformatting that happens behind the scenes when you drag new controls into the page that I haven't found any solution to other than just staying in the text editor as much as possible. Two good things to note: 1. VS2K8 does a MUCH better job that VS2K5 when it comes to formatting HTML. 2. With the new intellisense built into VS2K8, it makes it really easy to stay in the text editor while adding tags. I think I do most of my HTML stuff there now. You can keep your display in "split view" and just refresh every now and then to see how your controls are coming up.
