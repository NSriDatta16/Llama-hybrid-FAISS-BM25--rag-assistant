Use #pragma when you are addressing a specific compiler (or set of compatible compilers) to guide its code generation or if you are using a standardized #pragma like FP_CONTRACT or -CX_LIMITED_RANGE- that any standards-compliant compiler is going to support. Use #ifndef and ilk if you are addressing the standard C (or C++) pre-processor and wish to have your code rendered portable across all standards-compliant compilers. Use of any #pragma that is not defined in the C (or C++) standard renders your code non-portable. #pragma once is a bit of an exception in that it is one of the most commonly-implemented of the non-standard #pragma constructs. Its implementation, however, is not universal across standards-compliant compilers. #ifndef is.
