For the cost , a simple metric is going to be the man-hour cost, plus the cost of tooling (probably negligible if it's a large project), plus ancillary facilities. Someone in your organisation will have the figures for the cost of a developer per hour. It's not the same as how much you pay them. It will include equipment, office space, heating, additional benefits etc. You'll probably find this is quite high, and why I say for anything more than the most trivial project, costs of tooling (e.g. IDEs) is going to be negligible. Do you have shared servers/a machine room etc.? Someone will have the figures for this and you need to determine what proportion you used. I don't think you can derive any meaningful cost figure simply by looking at the code. Now, if you're looking at pricing , then all the above doesn't matter, since you've already spent it. You have to look at what the market is prepared to pay. For that, I can direct you to no better article than one written by Joel Spolsky himself, which discusses some basic economic theory including the concept of consumer surplus .
