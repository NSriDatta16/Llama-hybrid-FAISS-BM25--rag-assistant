Although having the parameters in the path has some advantages, there are, IMO, some outweighing factors. Not all characters needed for a search query are permitted in a URL. Most punctuation and Unicode characters would need to be URL encoded as a query string parameter. I'm wrestling with the same problem. I would like to use XPath in the URL, but not all XPath syntax is compatible with a URI path. So for simple paths, /cars/doors/driver/lock/combination would be appropriate to locate the ' combination ' element in the driver's door XML document. But /car/doors[id='driver' and lock/combination='1234'] is not so friendly. There is a difference between filtering a resource based on one of its attributes and specifying a resource. For example, since /cars/colors returns a list of all colors for all cars (the resource returned is a collection of color objects) /cars/colors/red,blue,green would return a list of color objects that are red, blue or green, not a collection of cars. To return cars, the path would be /cars?color=red,blue,green or /cars/search?color=red,blue,green Parameters in the path are more difficult to read because name/value pairs are not isolated from the rest of the path, which is not name/value pairs. One last comment. I prefer /garages/yyy/cars (always plural) to /garage/yyy/cars (perhaps it was a typo in the original answer) because it avoids changing the path between singular and plural. For words with an added 's', the change is not so bad, but changing /person/yyy/friends to /people/yyy seems cumbersome.
