predictive model that includes previous predictions and models time dependence

I'm trying to predict counts of dengue fever from climate and environmental data. I'm predicting total weekly counts of dengue and the data is time-series in one week intervals over the past 20 years. I need to predict the next 10 years (dengue weekly counts is absent from that dataset). I'm using python and find that negative binomial regression, support vector regressor, and random forest regressor work fairly well, but they cannot account for the large outbreaks and contagiousness of the disease. Does anyone know how to build a model that progressively predicts a new value while taking into account the previous prediction? Thank you!
