The two seem to be based on different experimental setups, or at least in terms of what parameters are considered known vs. uncertain. Your Binomial approach assumes the number of objects $N=100$ is known with no uncertainty. Then it is assuming the number of detected objects $n$ is Binomial distributed, $n|N\sim\mathrm{B}_{N,p}$, and making inferences about the unknown detection probability $p$. The Poisson distribution is characterized by the average occurrence rate of events in time $\lambda=\mathbb{E}\big[N|T\big]$, where the time interval $T$ is known. (This would be a length, if the events are distributed in space rather than time.) So in the Poisson model, the number of events is unknown, $N\sim\mathrm{P}_\lambda$. In this case *, given the above Binomial detection model for $n|N$, then $n\sim\mathrm{P}_{\lambda p}$ is the marginal distribution of $n$. That is, your Poisson approach appears to be using a marginal distribution for $n$, which integrates over all possible values of $N$, i.e. assuming $\lambda$ is fixed, but $N$ is unknown. This likely accounts for the greater uncertainty. (*Assuming I have interpreted the Wikipedia link correctly!) If $N$ is truly known, then $\lambda$ is simply a nuisance parameter , because even if object occurrence is Poisson, this has no bearing on $p$. Therefore the Binomial approach would be more appropriate. (Note however that your version is not the only possible one for the Binomial case.)
