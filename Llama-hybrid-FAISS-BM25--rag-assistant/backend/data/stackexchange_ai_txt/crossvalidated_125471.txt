How to find optimal penaltyparameter C for SVM (regression)

I am training an svm regressor using python sklearn.svm.SVR From the example given on the sklearn website, the above line of code defines my svm. svr_rbf = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=1e3, gamma=0.1) where C is "penalty parameter C of the error term." My question is, how to find optimal value for C. Is there a method or some libraries which could help me with this. Thank you
