Your ACF has strong spikes at lags 24, 48, 72, 96 etc... which is not surprising, since this is driven by intradaily seasonality. Consider modeling this, e.g., by including lag 24. In general, I would start out with a much simpler model. Start with a seasonal model as above, and nothing else. Then add a single lag 1. Then a lag 2. In forecasting, very simple models suprisingly often outperform more complex ones. Compare your model to a seasonal naive model (which simply forecasts the last observation for the corresponding hour in the future). Because of the seasonality, I would not try the even simpler nonseasonal naive model. Also, try fitting an exponential smoothing model. Yes, it's misspecified for count data... but it may still be competitive. You may also have multiple-seasonalities in your data, with weekends differing from weekdays. The tag wiki contains pointers to models for such cases. Again, such a more complex model will not necessarily yield better forecasts. why is the predicted peak much higher? To find this out, you would need to recalculate the forecast based on the parameter estimates. And then you would need to understand just why the parameter was estimated the way it was. In general, strongly varying forecasts without underlying causal drivers hint at overfitting. Simplify your model. some of the peaks in the ground truth are not covered. That is not suprising. Predictions should vary less than observations , because modeling tries to separate explainable from unexplainable variation and only forecasting the explainable part - the rest is noise. Peaks in the observations are evidence for unexplained noise. Unless you have causal drivers that allow you to explain and predict them, of course. when should I be satisfied with my forecast? How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
