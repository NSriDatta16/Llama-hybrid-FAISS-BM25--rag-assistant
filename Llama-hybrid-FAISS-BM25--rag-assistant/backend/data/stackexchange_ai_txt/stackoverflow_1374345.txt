You are cutting yourself off at the knees using a relational database model for this. Relational databases are built around the idea of a static structure of data and being able to query easily and quickly. Even adopting a EAV structure as "New in town" suggests goes against this, though it's arguably better than a simple XML data dump into the column. If customer is an oddity and the rest of your data is OK, then it's probably fine to do this, though I would definitely go with the EAV approach. If most of your tables look this way, then it's time to rethink your approach to data storage.
