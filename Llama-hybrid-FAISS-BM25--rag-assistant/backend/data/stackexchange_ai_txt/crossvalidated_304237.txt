For people who know how to edit text and implement code in Jupyter, what advantages would writing a Machine Learning textbook in a PDF file offer? Especially if the targeted consumer is assumed to be knowledgeable enough to have dealt with either Jupyter directly or just Python, I can't really see any benefits in PDF format other than conventionality (which is honestly quickly changing for books of this nature in this field).
