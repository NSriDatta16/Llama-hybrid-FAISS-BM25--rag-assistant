How do I use the vxWorks debug agent to perform pre-kernel debugging?

The vxWorks documentation states: The WDB agent itself is independent of the target operating system: it attaches to run-time OS services through a virtual-function run-time interface. The WDB agent can execute before VxWorks is running (as in the early stages of porting a BSP to a new board)." How can I use the debug agent before the vxWorks kernel is running?
