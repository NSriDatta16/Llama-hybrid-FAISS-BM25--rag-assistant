How to implement a weight map for a U-Net

I have a question regarding the convolutional neural network known as U-Net (see link below) and hope somebody can help me out. https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/ In the paper, the authors mention a map with a pixel-wise loss weight to force the network to learn the border pixels. I assume this weight map is intended to initialize the weights but I have failed to find the code showing how these weight maps are used to initialize the weights of the U-Net. I am not familiar with Caffe and instead use Keras to implement the U-Net. My current code is partially based on https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet . In this implementation, no pre-computed weight map is included Can somebody please point out to me how this weight map described in the paper was used to initialize the weights of the U-Net? Any Help would be greatly appreciated!
