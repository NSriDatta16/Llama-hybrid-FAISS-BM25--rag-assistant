DIVs don’t vertically align in horizontally scrolling DIV

I’m trying to make a with horizontal scroll only, and I achieved this by using s with white-space: no-wrap; within a with overflow-x: scroll; . The problem is that I can’t use paragraphs with wrapping text within these s, because it breaks the layout in Chrome. These are what I want (works in Firefox) and what I’ve got in Chrome: The problem happens every time a paragraph text wraps inside the s. This is my HTML and CSS: .info { width: 250px; height: 200px; float: left; } .list { height: 200px; overflow-x: scroll; overflow-y: hidden; white-space: nowrap; } .item { height: 175px; width: 175px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 5px; overflow: hidden; /* without this, the layout breaks in Firefox, too */ } .item * { white-space: normal; } Info regarding this list of items text more text, in another line, now wrapping and etc and etc second item third item and more Does someone know how to fix this? Or does someone know another way to make this with horizontal scroll? (I’m using fluid layout, so my orange div does not have a fixed width).
