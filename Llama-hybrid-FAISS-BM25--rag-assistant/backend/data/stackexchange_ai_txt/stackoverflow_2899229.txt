First: One Table with 1.6 billion entries seems so be a little too big. I work on some pretty heavy load systems where even the logging tables that keep track of all actions don't get this big over years. So if possible, think, if you can find a more optimal storage method. Can't give much more advice since I don't know your DB structure but I'm sure there will be plenty of room for optimization. 1.6 billion entries is just too big. A few things on performance: If you don't need referential integrity checks, which is unlikely, you could switch to the MyISAM storage engine. It's a bit faster but lacks integrity ckecks and transactions. For anything else, more info would be necessary.
