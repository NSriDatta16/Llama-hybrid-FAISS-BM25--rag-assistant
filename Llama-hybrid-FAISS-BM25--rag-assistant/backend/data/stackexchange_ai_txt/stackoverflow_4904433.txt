You are performing O(n*m) lookup on n being the size of your categories and m being the size of a title. You could try organizing them like this: const $DINING = 0; const $SERVICES = 1; $categories = array( "food" => $DINING, "restaurant" => $DINING, "service" => $SERVICES, ); Then for each word in a title, check $categories[$word] to find the category - this gets you O(m).
