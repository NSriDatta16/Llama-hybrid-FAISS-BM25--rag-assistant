As I heard from Jerome H. Friedman methods developed in Machine Learning is in fact not belong to Machine Learning community by itself. From my point of view Machine Learning is more like a collection of various methods from another fields. From point of view of Statistical Learning the three main questions for regression and classification are: What is function family from which you pull approximator What is a criteria how you pull a function What is a method to find the best function To operate in some constructive way on (1) - it's not so obvious how use math optimizaion can help To operate in some constructive way on (2) - it's obvious that objective is the goal. And math optimizaion can help on it. To operate in some constructive way on (3) - you need math optimization. There several parts of math optimization: Convex Optimization/Convex Analysis - very cool area of math. Non-differentiablity is not a problem. And there are 50 generalization of convex functions from which more two usefull in terms of application is quasiconvex and log-concave. Also there are ways how to deal "stochasticity" in some way, even "Nobody know how to solve stochastic convex optimization" NonConvex Optimization - usually people by this mean something which is continious objective, but curvature can vary. People in this planet don't know how to solve it precisely. And in fact all mehtods make leverage into (1) Combinatorial optimizaion - it's even more wild then (2), now for parameters that you find you even can not apply minus operator. One example is "regions" in Decision Trees. So there are two way how to deal with it: a) Convexify problem and use methods from (1) b) Make brute force. Doesn't work for huge number of parameters. c) Make brute force but with some greedy steps. It's something that CART do. So at least I think I convice you that: I) Convex Optimization is central thing for most optimization problems. II) "01:15 Optimization is in fact more bigger subject then ML or AI, but it's bigger subject in fact." ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF3htLwUHn0&t=992s )
