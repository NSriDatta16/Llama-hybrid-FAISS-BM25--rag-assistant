Easiest way to script the spotlight menu is to just send the keys via GUI scripting. I don't think it can be accessed in the fashion you want. As for why your icon won't list I'm not sure. Does it have a menu associated with it? It's easy to list all the menulings. Here's a Python script to do so. You can then use that data to access them directly with Appscript. http://www.libertypages.com/clarktech/?p=2193
