It is difficult to say what you mean by "(2) is not [confirmed]," so let's begin by describing what is going on. The code begins by generating realizations of $n$ independent standard normal variates $X_t,$ $t=1,2,\ldots, n$, and computing their cumulative sum $Y_t = \sum_{s=1}^t X_t$. Therefore the variogram of $Y$ is $$\gamma_Y(t, h) = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(\left(Y_{t+h} - Y_t\right)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(\left(\sum_{s=t+1}^{t+h}X_s\right)^2\right) = \frac{h}{2}$$ for $h=0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-t$ and $t=0, 1, 2, \ldots, n.$ Notice that $Y$ has no nugget for any value of $t$: $\gamma(t,0) = 0$ for all relevant $t$. The code next generates data from a derived process y2 which I will call $Z$, where $$Z_{t + 1/2} = \frac{Y_{t} + Y_{t+1}}{2} = Y_{t} + \frac{1}{2}X_{t+1}$$ for $t=1, 3, 5, ..., 2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor - 1.$ The variogram of $Z$ therefore is $$\gamma_Z(t+1/2, h) = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(\left(Z_{t+1/2+h} - Z_{t+1/2}\right)^2\right) \\ = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}X_{t+1}+\sum_{s=t+2}^{t+h}X_s + \frac{1}{2}X_{t+h+1}\right)^2\right) = \frac{h - 1/2}{2}$$ for $h=2, 4, 6, \ldots$ and $t=1, 3, \ldots.$ When $h=0$ the variogram is obviously $0$. Thus the second plot (of an estimate of $\gamma_Z$ based on the single realization of $Z$) should, on the average, be approximately $1/4$ lower than the first plot (of an estimate of $\gamma_Y$). This difference is too small to detect reliably in the plots, which is why they look almost identical. For instance, re-running the R script after executing set.seed(17) n for reproducible results with a larger realization and computing mean(vario$v - vario2$v) results in an estimate $0.22$ for this difference of $1/4$. More runs of the code (without resetting the seed) yield $0.43, 0.19, 0.26, 0.17, -0.01, 0.76, 0.23, 0.26, 0.08$. The mean of all 10 iterations is $0.258$ with a standard error of $0.067$: significantly different from zero but indistinguishable from $1/4$, consistent with the foregoing calculations. This is indeed a (very simple) example of change of support, which uses the same kinds of calculations to relate the variogram of a process $Y$ to the variogram of a related process obtained from the convolution of $Y$ with some (fixed, deterministic) kernel $K$. In this case the kernel is $$K(-1/2)=K(1/2)=1/2.$$
