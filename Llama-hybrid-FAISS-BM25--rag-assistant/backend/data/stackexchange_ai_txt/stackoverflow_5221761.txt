Windows reading a file over network path open a socket?

When you have a network path open in Windows explorer, and you drag it to a local folder does it open a socket? Also, when you use c# FileStream fin = new FileStream(@"//networkpath/file); does that open a socked? my question is this, would it be just as fast to stream a file over a socket manually as it would be to read it over a network using c#'s filestream?
