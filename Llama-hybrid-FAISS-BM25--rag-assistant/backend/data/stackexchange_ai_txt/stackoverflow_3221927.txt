jquery-ui sortable connected lists with hidden overflow

I have two fixed hight divs each containing a sortable list which are connected to each other. Is there a way to hide the overflow while still having the lists connected? E.g. if the overflow is set to hidden then the li doesn't show when it is dragged outside of the div. I know a possible solution would be to calculate the maximum number of li that the div can contain and dynamically add/remove elements based on the number of visible elements, but I was wondering if there was a better solution?
