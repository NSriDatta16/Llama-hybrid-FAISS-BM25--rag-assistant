Test of independence with three levels on 6 observations on a 1-7 Likert rating

I've data from an in between subject study asking participants to rate features in respect to 3 objects, let's say a plant, a stone and a bottle. Each participant gets shown one object and subsequently is asked to attribute a set of 6 features (like "Organic", "Spontaneous", "Complex", ... "Spiritless" - for simplicity here 'a' to 'f') on a Likert scale ranging from 1 "not at all" to 7 "Very much". First participant rates the set of features to the plant, second participant to the stone, third to the bottle, fourth to the plant again and so on. This results in the following data: #for the plant(20 participants): a.1 Subsequently the data is transformed into a 6x7 contingency table representing the count or frequency measures of each of the feature's ratings for each object: df.flower as.data.frame(df.flower) V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 a.1 7 3 3 1 5 0 1 b.1 4 2 0 3 2 6 3 c.1 1 0 1 3 6 3 6 d.1 0 1 1 2 7 4 5 e.1 1 0 4 7 5 2 1 f.1 7 2 2 5 4 0 0 > as.data.frame(df.stone) V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 a.2 6 5 3 4 1 0 0 b.2 0 1 5 6 4 3 0 c.2 1 1 2 3 9 1 2 d.2 1 2 2 10 3 0 1 e.2 3 4 6 3 2 1 0 f.2 3 1 5 2 3 3 2 > as.data.frame(df.bottle) V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 a.3 4 2 3 1 4 3 1 b.3 0 0 3 7 5 3 0 c.3 1 1 4 5 4 1 2 d.3 0 3 5 6 1 3 0 e.3 4 3 5 2 2 1 1 f.3 1 4 2 4 6 1 0 I then apply a chi-square test to check whether there's significant difference between the features and the rating-frequencies for each of the objects: chisq.test(df.flower) chisq.test(df.stone) chisq.test(df.bottle) Ultimately, my question and intend is to find a possible method to determine the (significance of the) difference between the ratings of the three objects. Thus, in an ideal world I would like to be able to conclude something along these lines: participants ratings of the feature-set in respect to the flower are significantly different to the ratings for the stone and the bottle. However the ratings for the stone and the bottle are not significantly different. (This result is made up just to illustrate the point and not based on any calculation)
