If you care about the organizations (the clusters), then use type=twolevel and estimate a within and a between part of your model. If you were not concerned about the clustering level but wanted to control for within-cluster correlation (you should do that), you would use type=complex to make Mplus use a sandwich estimator. These two solutions are different in that they will estimate different models (two-level vs single level), and you can expect that they will produce different results for the within part (which would be the only part estimated if you use type=complex model).
