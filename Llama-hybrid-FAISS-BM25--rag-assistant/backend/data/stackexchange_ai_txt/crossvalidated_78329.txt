"optimum" tree from random forests

You can get sample trees from random forest (e.g., see: How to actually plot a sample tree from randomForest::getTree()? ) However, rather than getting a single tree from random forest, is there any way to get an "optimum" or "recommended" tree which is generated considering the many trees? Basically, I would like to replace decision tree models with random forest but would like to know what would be the best splits.
