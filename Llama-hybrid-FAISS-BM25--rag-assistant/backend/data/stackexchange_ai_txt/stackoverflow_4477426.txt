There must be a good reason for other people to use ORMs in their Rails apps. :) Especially with Rails 3, ORMs are pluggable - you can easily use DataMapper, or Sequel instead of ActiveRecord. In any case, models are important (and very powerful) part of any MVC framework. Lot of business logic is placed within models - "fat models" is kind of recommended way of development. Another good point about existing ORMs is that they actually allow (but not encourage) you to write SQL by hand - you could freely write all your queries by hand if you like. But even then, I'd recommend that you leave your queries parametrized and let the library interpolate your parameters (you do that in PHP as well, don't you)?
