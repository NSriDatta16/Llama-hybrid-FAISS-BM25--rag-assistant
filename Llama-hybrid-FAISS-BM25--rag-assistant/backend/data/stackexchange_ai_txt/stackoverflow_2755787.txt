How to cache and store objects and set an expire policy in android?

I have an app fetch data from internet, for better performance and bandwidth, I need to implement a cache layer. There are two different data coming from the internet, one is changing every one hour and another one does not change basically. So for the first type of data, I need to implement an expire policy to make it self deleted after it was created for 1 hour, and when user request that data, I will check the storage first and then goto internet if nothing found. I thought about using a SharedPrefrence or SQLDatabase to store the json data or serialized object string. My question is: 1) What should I use, SharedPrefrence or SQLDatabase or anything else, a piece of data is not big but there are maybe many instances of that data. 2) How to implement that expire system.
