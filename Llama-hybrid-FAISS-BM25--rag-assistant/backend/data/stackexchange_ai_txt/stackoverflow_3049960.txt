This is a job for ajax, as others mentioned. If I may elaborate, if you're starting out, I HIGHLY recommend using a javascript library to make your life easier. With prototype , here's what your button might look like: Button Here's what your javascript might look like: $('button_foo').observe('mousedown',function(e){ new Ajax.Request('handler.php',{ method:'post', onSuccess:function(t){ $('table_bar').update(t.responseText); } }); }); This may seem a little daunting at first, but I think basic js has a pretty manageable learning curve when using a library. The above code would take whatever handler.php outputs, and replace the contents of an element with and id of "table_bar" with the returned html. if you do decide to use prototype, the docs are really helpful and easy to understand, and there is a really excellent book by pragmatic press on the subject that'll have you understanding it very quickly. Hope that helps!
