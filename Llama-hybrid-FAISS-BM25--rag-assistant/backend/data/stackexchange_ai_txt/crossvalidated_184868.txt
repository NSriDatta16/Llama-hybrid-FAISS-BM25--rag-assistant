For density estimation purposes what you need is not $\theta_{n+1}|x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}$. The formula in notes $\theta_{n+1}|\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n}$ reffers to the predictive distribution of the Dirichlet process. For density estimation you actually have to sample from the predictive distribution $$ \pi(dx_{n+1}|x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}) $$ Sampling from the above distribution can be done either with conditional methods either with marginal methods. For the conditional methods, take a look at the paper of Stephen Walker [1]. For marginal methods you should check at Radford Neal paper [2]. For the concnetration parameter $\alpha$ Mike West [3] proposes a method for inference in the MCMC procedure including a full conditional distribution for $\alpha$. If you decide not to update the concentration $\alpha$ in the MCMC procedure, you should keep in mind that if you choose a large value for it, then the number of distinct values drawn from the Dirichlet process will be larger than the number of distinct values when a small number for $\alpha$ will be used.
