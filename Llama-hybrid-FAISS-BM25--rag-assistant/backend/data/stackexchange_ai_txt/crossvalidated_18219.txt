Dealing with nuisance variables in a MANOVA situation

I have a study in which participants facebook profiles were rated by a group of students. The participants were then randomly allocated into one of three groups: the uncertain condition (where they could have been assigned either a liked-best or liked-least rating but they are not told which one), the Liked-Best condition (where they assigned the highest rating) and the Liked-Least condition (where they are assigned the lowest rating). Once they saw their ratings they completed a measure of mood and then in turn were able to rate how attractive they found the facebook profiles of those who rated them. After this they completed a measure of attachment style (ECR-S), self-esteem (RSES), the mood measure for a second time, and a measure of how much they had thought about the rating group in the last 15 minutes. The dependent variables in the study are attraction levels and reported thoughts of the participants to the rating group of students, as well as an overall measure of mood (mood across both time points summed and averaged). Please bear with me as I am a complete novice at statistics, but the analysis of the data has me extremely confused. My IV in the study is Condition , in that I want to see whether there was a significant difference between groups on the dependent variables. However I also have the measures of attachment style and self-esteem, the data for which my supervisor is planning on using in future studies but also wants me to include in mine. The problem is, I do not know where they fit in! Originally I thought that any effect of uncertainty on the DVs may be mediated by attachment style and self-esteem, BUT because the measurements were taken after the ratings had been given, they aren't exactly IVs as they may well have been affected by the ratings given. Please any help on how to analyse this would be much appreciated. I have been told I should use separate ANOVAs, but I do not feel this is justified due to the familywise inflation of the Type I error rate. I was thinking of using MANOVA to analyse Attraction and Reported thoughts (correlated at r = .34, p
