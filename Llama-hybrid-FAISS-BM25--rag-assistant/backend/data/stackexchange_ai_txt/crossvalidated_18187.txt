How to compute simulated differences of means repetitively?

I would like to run a 1000 simulations of $X-Y$ where $X$ is the average of 100 random observations with mean of 69.5 and SD 2.9 and $Y$ is the average of 100 random observations with mean of 63.9 and SD 2.7. I did the following: x And now I would like to somehow run a 1000 simulations of $X-Y$.
