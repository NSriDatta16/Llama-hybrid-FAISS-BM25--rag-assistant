There is no reason to use the Normal distribution as a default prior for a real parameter and there are many instances in the Bayesian literature where another prior is used. For instance, when testing for a zero mean in a Normal sample, Jeffreys (1939) uses a standard Cauchy distribution as a prior. The "uniform" prior does not exist as a probability distribution but it can be used as an "improper:" prior, provided the posterior is well defined. This is also a choice found in Jeffreys (1939). Note that using a Normal prior with a large variance is a poor idea, as large may not be large enough.
