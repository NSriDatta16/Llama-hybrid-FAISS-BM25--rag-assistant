You do not have to take the difference in measurements in order to compare before/after treatment. Use a binary indicator variable to represent before (0) and after(1) and then simply run a regression on those data. Here is an example of what your data might look like period count 1 0 7 2 1 4 3 0 4 4 1 4 5 0 2 6 1 5 7 0 4 8 1 3 9 0 5 10 1 3 Again, 0 represents before the treatment and 1 represents after the treatment. Conditional on period, all the counts are non-negative, so we can still apply negative binomial regression. In R... fit = MASS::glm.nb(count~period, data = d, control = glm.control(maxit=100)) summary(fit) Call: MASS::glm.nb(formula = count ~ period, data = d, control = glm.control(maxit = 100), init.theta = 0.9889630259, link = log) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7268 -0.8516 -0.4340 0.3434 2.8197 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.96241 0.03732 25.785 We see that post treatment, the average countk changed by a factor of $\exp(0.28)$ (the expoenntial of the period coefficient). The estimate is statistically significant as well. There is no need to take differences if your intent is to compare means and you are willing to make assumptions about the likelihood of the data. Alternatively, if you have lots of data, a t-test would also be applicable despite the discrete nature of the data. If neither of these are interesting to you, you could always bootstrap the differences.
