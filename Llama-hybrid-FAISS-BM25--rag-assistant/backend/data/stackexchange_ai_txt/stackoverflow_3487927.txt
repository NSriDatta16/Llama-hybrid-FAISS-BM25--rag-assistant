CodeIgniter works on any virtual hosting service but IPOWER?

I've been working on a case using Pyrocms, a CI-based CMS, on my local WAMP server for couple months. Recently, I'm starting to deploy on client's webhosting server of IPOWER (www.ipower.com). The installation process stops after step one. And the error message is below. ON CHROME Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET) I've also tried on IE, Firefox, and they all stops on step one. So, I've began a LONG investigation, I've found several CodeIgniter-based CMS can NOT work well on IPOWER. They all show the Error 101 in Chrome. That's why I start to wonder is there something wrong on the setting of IPOWER web hosting. Then I've check all the setting, including .htaccess / sessions / rewrite mod...etc, none of them have problem. I don't know if this is another ignorantly frustrating. Would somebody help me? Or any possible suggestion will be much appreciated.
