A few issues straight off the bat related to your SVM code: you are using linear SVM, which probably won't perform very well given the low dimensionality (but better than random) you did not set the misclassification penalty C ($\approx$ regparam in Spark), so I guess you're using the default value (whatever that may be). This parameter needs to be optimized by you. you are usingn 1000 SGD iterations, which is probably not enough for the SVM to converge. If you use more appropriate software, you wouldn't have to deal with these kinds of parameters, which only really become relevant for huge data sets. As I mentioned in the comment, you should consider more suitable libraries for such small data sets.
