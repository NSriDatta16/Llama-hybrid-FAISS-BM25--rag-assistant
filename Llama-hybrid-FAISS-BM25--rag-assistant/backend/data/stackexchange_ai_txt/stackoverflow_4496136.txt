pragma directive in UIViewController

When i create a UITableViewController class, the template has some #pragma directives: #pragma mark - #pragma mark View lifecycle at the start and: #pragma mark - #pragma mark Table view data source at the beginning of the implementation of the data source methods. I know that #pragma is a compiler directive, but why do we need to notify the compiler of the above? Does this mean that we have to give a #pragma directive every time we implement any kind of data source/delegate protocols?
