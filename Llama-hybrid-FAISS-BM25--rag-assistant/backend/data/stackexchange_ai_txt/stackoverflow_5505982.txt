Let me begin by saying that being a self-taught engineer when I started working in NLP several years ago, I completely understand your frustration. I would suggest that you read the NLTK book which is a wonderful introduction to applied NLP. In particular, read Chapters 3-7 which deal with processing raw text data to extract information and use it for tagging. The book is available online . With regards to your specific question: I think that it might be much easier to create a small list of animals and then extract sentences from a corpus that contain these animal names. Wikipedia sentences is one obvious example. You can build your corpus using this method because you already know the names of the animals in each sentence. // PSEUDO CODE Dictionary animals = ["dog","dogs,"cat","cats","pig","pigs","cow","cows","lion","lions","lioness","lionesses"]; String[] sentences = getWikipediaSentences(); for(sent: sentences){ for(token: Tokenizer.getTokens(sent)){ if(animals.contains(token){ addSentenceToCorpus(sent) } // else ignore sentence } } You can then train your algorithm on these sentences so that you can use the trained model to extract newer animal names. There are caveats with this approach since your "training data" is artificially collected but it will be a good first experience nonetheless.
