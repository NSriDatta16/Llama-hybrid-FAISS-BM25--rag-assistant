Time-based clustering methods are beginning to get the attention they deserve. They can be distinguished based on whether or not they are moment-based vs non-moment based. Here are a few references: Moment methods based on global statistics: Rob Hyndman's paper Dimension Reduction for Clustering Time Series Using Global Characteristics available here: http://www.robjhyndman.com/papers/wang2.pdf Moment methods based on hidden markov models: Steve Scott's papers, e.g., Hidden Markov Models for Longitudinal Comparisons available here: https://sites.google.com/site/stevethebayesian/googlepageforstevenlscott/home Oded Netzer's paper A Hidden Markov Model of Customer Relationship Dynamics available here: https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/2618/HMM%20of%20Customer%20Relationship%20Dynamics.pdf Non-moment based methods , which are typically rooted in complexity and information theory: Andreas Brandmaier's permutation distribution clustering, as well as his R modules, pdc: An R Package for Complexity-Based Clustering of Time Series available here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdc/pdc.pdf For an excellent overview of time series clustering that is now a few years old see Aggarwal and Reddy's book Data Clustering http://www.amazon.com/Data-Clustering-Algorithms-Applications-Knowledge/dp/1466558210/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457449361&sr=8-1&keywords=reddy+data+clustering
