Reinforcement learning is your best bet to solve this kind of problem. The logic behind reinforcement learning is that you will start off with an initial belief (such as how much time will pass before an event's next occurrence). As you observe what is happening, that belief will either change or stay the same based on the observed results. So, for example, if you initially believe that an event will happen in 10 seconds, but it happens in 20, maybe now you will believe it will happen in 15 seconds. Reinforcement learning will automatically allow you to change your classifications over time as if the popularity changes, you will see a change in your predicted results.
