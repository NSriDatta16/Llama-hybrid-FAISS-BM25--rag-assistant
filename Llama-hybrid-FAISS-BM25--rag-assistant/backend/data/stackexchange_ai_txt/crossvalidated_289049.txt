How can you get median from aggregated excel data?

I have sets of aggregated evaluation data with the counts for each question (Q1/Q2/Q3) / response (scores of 1-5) option. 1 2 3 4 5 I'm trying to find a way to easily calculate the median of the score for each of these questions. Finding the average is easy, but the median function wants a range of values. Is there a way to programmatically dis-aggregate this to a separate sheet to point the function at? Thanks! Chris
