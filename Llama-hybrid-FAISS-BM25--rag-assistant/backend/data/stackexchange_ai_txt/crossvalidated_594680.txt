Interpreting coefficients of a two-way logistic regression

I have the following binary variable Y to be predicted as a function of two factors, say X1 and X2. The whole file is available here . X1 is binary and X2, categorical. When compiled, we find these proportions of 1s: X2=0 X2=1 X2=2 X1 = 0 75/89 (84.3%) 62/77 (80.5%) 40/52 (76.9%) X1 = 1 84/92 (91.3%) 52/72 (72.2%) 42/63 (66.6%) Running with R a logistic regression using M we obtain the following coefficients: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.6713 0.2661 6.280 3.39e-10 *** X1 0.3995 0.3957 1.009 0.313 X2 -0.2382 0.2186 -1.090 0.276 X1:X2 -0.5308 0.3022 -1.757 0.079 . The intercept is straigthforward to interpret: un-logit this number $e^{1.67} / (1+ e^{1.67}) = .843$ is indeed the proportion obtained in the cell with factors X1,X2 = 0, 0. To predict the result where X2 is 0 and X1 is 1, the log odd change is $e^{0.3995} = 1.49$ , that is, that condition is 49% more present than the intercept. However, this equals $1.49 \times 0.844 = 1.257$ which is more than 100% of ones in that condition. I must be doing something wrong, because this is a very poor fit to the data. Likewise, if I continue looking at the predictions for the other cells, I find more bad fits along with some accurate fits. Any help appreciated.
