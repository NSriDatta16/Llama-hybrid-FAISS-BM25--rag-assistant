How can I use COCOAPI/PyCOCOTools to evaluate the performance of Tensorflow Lite models

I have used the Tensorflow Object Detection API to train models on a custom dataset. The tensorflow object detection API also allows evaluating the trained models on a test set and gives results in the COCO eval format . An example output from the evaluation can be seen here: Evaluation output from Tensorflow Object Detection API reporting the MSCOCO metrics In this image, there are results such as mAP @ 0.5 IoU and mAP @ 0.75 IoU. It also reports the AR (Average Recall). It also reports an overall mAP. After training my model, I have converted the models to Tensorflow Lite and I have applied post-training quantization on the model. Now I want to calculate similar metrics for my tflite model on my test set. Can someone guide me on how I can go about doing this? I am trying to understand how I can use the COCOAPI to do this but so far I am not sure how. A related question is, can someone please tell where I can find documentation for the COCOAPI ? I have searched everywhere and I cannot seem to find it. Thanks
