The simple answer is that the boot sector has a valid (and probably small) stack which was used by the BIOS. The happy answer is that 3FFh is a valid stack location for some BIOS. The fact that in this case it is the lower part of the IVT is because those interrupt vectors are not used by the BIOS. It is no secret. BIOS Stack Area The BIOS uses 30:0000h - 30:00FFh (on top of the interrupt vector table) as a stack area. This area is used for BIOS calculations and temporary storage. The addresses for INTs C0h through FFh, not supported in the AMIBIOS, would ordinarily occupy this space. Programmer's Guide to the AMIBIOS 1993, page 181
