The UnifiedMap table approach certainly makes more sense. If you wish to persue the two seperate UnifiedSet tables idea, you'd need to change the seed value of UnifiedSetTwoMap when an insert happens on UnifiedSetOneMap and vice versa using a trigger on each. Like I said the UnifiedMap approach is simpler, and more elegant.
