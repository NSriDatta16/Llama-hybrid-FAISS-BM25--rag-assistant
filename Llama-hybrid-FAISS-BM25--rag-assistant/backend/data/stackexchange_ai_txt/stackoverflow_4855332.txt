Yes, the delay is caused by UIScrollView trying to detect a scrolling gesture, and yes, you can solve it by setting delaysContentTouches to NO. Moreover, you should always use UIControlEventTouchUpInside rather than UIControlEventTouchDown with UIButton because that allows the user to "change her mind" by dragging the finger farther away from the button.
