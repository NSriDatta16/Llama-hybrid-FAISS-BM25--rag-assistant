I think you want to use the very simple one sample Z-test and its relative the one sample Z-test for proportion . Also, that link shows you how simple it is to do in R. To be clear, the one sample portion of those names refers to the very fact that you only have one group (ie. no control group). Suggested Method 1 If you want to consider each question individually, you may consider the one sample proportion test for each question. I think I'm describing what you called a two proportion test. For a question that has a list of answers ranging from 1 to 5 like $$[1,3,2,5,4,1,...]$$ If you consider a successful intervention as being a very effective one, you might say that the extreme answers of 4 and 5 are considered a "success" (coded by 1) while 1,2 and 3 are considered a "fail" (coded by 0). Then you would transform the list according to this rule and get $$[0,0,0,1,1,0,...]$$ From here on out it is just a regular Z-test, since the mean of the transformed list equals the proportion of 1's in the transformed list. A null hypothesis might be that the intervention is successful 30% of the time (equivalently, the proportion of successes is 0.3). You could then calculate a one-tailed p value from the Z-test to indicate whether the mean of your transformed survey answers is significantly greater than 0.3 (or, significantly less). Suggested Method 2 You may also want to consider the questions together, in which case you could calculate a score for each survey taken and use a one sample Z-test. So, each question has a list of answers in order of survey (ie. the first item in each list corresponds to the first survey taken), $$\begin{align}\text{q1 answers} &=[1,4,2,5,3,...] \\ \text{q2 answers} &= [3,2,5,2,1,...] \\ \text{q3 answers} &= [4,5,2,3,1,...] \end{align}$$ Then you score each survey taken by considering its mean across questions $$\text{scores for each survey taken} = [2.66,3.66,3,3.33, 1.66,...]$$ A null hypothesis might be that the mean score is 4, and you test whether the mean of the survey scores is significantly different than 4 with a regular Z-test. This is basically addressing your concern, I thought about just comparing our mean to a null hypothesis of m=3 (or m=1 -- we debated about what the null should really be) but I've read that Likert data doesn't work that way. When doing it like this, I think doing this with your data perfectly reasonable. When choosing the null, consider the scale and meaning of your questions. Since answering 1 on the survey seems to be the same as answering "no change" (or similar), testing if the average survey answer is significantly greater than m = 1 is like testing if there was any significant change at all. Testing if the average is significantly greater than m = 3 is like testing if the intervention had a significantly extreme effect. The same goes for choosing your "rule" for success when doing a proportion test.
