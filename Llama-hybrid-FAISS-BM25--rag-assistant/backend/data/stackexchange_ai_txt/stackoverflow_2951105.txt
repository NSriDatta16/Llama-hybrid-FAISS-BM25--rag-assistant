Rails render partial with block

I'm trying to re-use an html component that i've written that provides panel styling. Something like: Some Title .. content goes here So I see that render takes a block. I figured then I could do something like this: # /shared/_panel.html.erb And I want to do something like: #some html view '/shared/panel', :locals =>{:title => "Some Title"} do %> Here is some content to be rendered inside the panel Unfortunately this doesn't work with this error: ActionView::TemplateError (/Users/bradrobertson/Repos/VeloUltralite/source/trunk/app/views/sessions/new.html.erb:1: , unexpected tRPAREN old_output_buffer = output_buffer;;@output_buffer = ''; __in_erb_template=true ; @output_buffer.concat(( render :partial => '/shared/panel', :locals => {:title => "Welcome"} do ).to_s) on line #1 of app/views/sessions/new.html.erb: 1: '/shared/panel', :locals => {:title => "Welcome"} do -%> ... So it doesn't like the = obviously with a block, but if I remove it, then it just doesn't output anything. Does anyone know how to do what I'm trying to achieve here? I'd like to re-use this panel html in many places on my site.
