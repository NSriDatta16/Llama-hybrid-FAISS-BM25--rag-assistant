Averaging Ripley's K or L function for several samples

Would much appreciate to hear your opinion about the following strategy: I have several samples of point patterns, witch are results from somw replicated experiment. The number of points and area of observation vary from experiment to experiment. I would like to test a null hypothesis on CSR for this set of data using Ripley's function and make a conclusion for the overall population. For each experiment I compute L function and corresponding confidence envelopes. In the end I average all the L functions and CEs and look at the behavior of the this averaged quantities. Do you think that averaging can lead to misleading results? Thank you!!!
