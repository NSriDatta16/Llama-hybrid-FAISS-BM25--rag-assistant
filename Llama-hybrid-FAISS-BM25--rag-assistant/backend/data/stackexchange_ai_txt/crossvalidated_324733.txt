Unbiased estimation of variance of autocorrelated time series

Let's say I have $n$ measurements (let's assume monthly measurements) of some underlying random variable $X_{t}$ for $t\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Now, let's say I then construct a new measure $$Y_{t}=\tfrac{1}{12}\big(X_{t}+X_{t+1}+\cdots+X_{t+11}\big)$$ which is the forward 12-month average of the underlying random variable. Now, due to the introduction of the new measure, we have reduced much of the original volatility in the time series $X_{t}$. So when we estimate the variance of this new time series $Y_{t}$, the estimate will be biased downward. We would like to get an unbiased estimator of the variance that reflects the volatility of $X_{t}$. Now, according to this , we can calculate our unbiased estimate of the variance using the provided equation. It also states in a caveat that we need the analytical expression for the ACF function and it cannot be estimated from the biased data. This leads me to my question , is it correct that my process $Y_{t}$ is a $\text{MA}(11)$ process $$Y_{t}=\mu+\epsilon_{t}-\sum_{k=1}^{11}\theta_{k}\epsilon_{t+k}$$ and that, as a result, I can calculate the analytical ACF for my data given that I know the parameters of my process are all equal. Is this intuition correct? Additionally , is the analytical ACF of this $\text{MA}(12)$ process $$\begin{align} \rho(\tau)=\frac{\gamma(\tau)}{\gamma(0)}&=\frac{\sigma^{2}\sum_{j=0}^{12-|\tau|}\theta_{j}\theta_{j+|\tau|}}{\sigma^{2}\sum_{j=0}^{12}\theta_{j}\theta_{j}}\\ &=\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{12-|\tau|}\theta^{2}}{\sum_{j=0}^{12}\theta^{2}}\\ &=\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{12-|\tau|}}{\sum_{j=0}^{12}}\\ &=\frac{13-|\tau|}{13},\quad\quad\quad |\tau|\le 12 \end{align}$$ correct?
