Assuming that by "window" you mean the application window, that is because the drag-n-drop implemented by controls is for drag-n-drop within an application only. For drag-n-drop from one application to another, you need to use OLE drag-n-drop. Either implemented yourself (it isn't too hard), or by using a library. MSDN documentation on OLE drag-n-drop is pretty good. Starting point for reading: Data Transfer (COM) Two libraries I am aware of: Raize DropMaster: http://www.raize.com/DevTools/DropMaster/Default.asp Anders Melander's Drag and Drop Component Suite: http://melander.dk/delphi/dragdrop
