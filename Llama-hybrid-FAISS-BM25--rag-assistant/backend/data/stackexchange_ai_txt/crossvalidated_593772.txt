Here, the outcome of interest is the difference between the pre- and post-treatment period, $Y1 - Y0$ . This difference is influenced by the treatment, unobserved factors $U$ , and observed covariates $X$ . The dashed arrow between $U$ and $A$ indicates a statistical dependency between the variables, but where we remain agnostic to the precise causal mechanism. For example, in the minimum wage example, $U$ might be the average income in restaurantâ€™s neighbourhood, which is dependent on the state, and hence also the treatment.
