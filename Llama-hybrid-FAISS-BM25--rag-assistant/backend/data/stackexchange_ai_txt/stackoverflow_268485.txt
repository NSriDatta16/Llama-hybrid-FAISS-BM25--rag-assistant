Consider using NTFS junction points so you can have both organizations at once. Quick definition: "a junction point is Microsoft's implementation of symbolic links but it only works for directories." Use Convention 2 for the "real" layout, because it makes the projects easy to move around. Then make a Convention 1 view: mkdir /solution/test linkd /solution/test/prj1 /solution/prj1/test linkd /solution/test/prj2 /solution/prj2/test Now you have ... /solution /test /prj1 /prj2 ... which was the desired result. You could do the same thing for /src or the other directories if you find it beneficial. Test scripts that benefit from a Convention 1 view live in /solution/test.
