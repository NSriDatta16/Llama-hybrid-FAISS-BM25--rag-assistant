Pickle should be cross-platform, there are versioning/protocol issues, (see http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format ) but in general if you're using the same release of python on your windows and unix boxes, they should be interoperable. If you're using pickle as a data transport mechanism, you might want to consider less-implementation specific formats for data storage, such as json, xml, csv, yaml, etc.
