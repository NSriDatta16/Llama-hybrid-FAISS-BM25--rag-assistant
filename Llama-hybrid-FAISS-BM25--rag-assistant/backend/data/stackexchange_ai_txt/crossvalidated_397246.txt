I really liked Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. Papers listed in its bibliography develop and get deep in most mathematical aspects. In this post you can find a pair of suggestions from a more rigorous perspective. But if you really want to be rigorous to the fundamentals, I encourage you to read Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by MacKay, there is a free official electronic copy in author's website .
