You said 'jump box' so I'm assuming you need to connect to your jump server and then start your rdp session. How are you copying the files once you logon to the remote server? Drag and drop (copy/paste) via Explorer? If so this can be hideously slow through a jump server. It's best to use a command line copy utility and the \tsclient mappings. robocopy \\tsclient\C\somefolder C:\temp *.exe or whatever. Unfortunately this is all predicated on establishing the remote desktop session first so there is no way I'm aware of to initiate a copy from your local workstation to the remote host using a jump server. One thing we're trying to do is to get our security people to allow firewall rules into our secured zones so we can automate BITS to do the copies for us.
