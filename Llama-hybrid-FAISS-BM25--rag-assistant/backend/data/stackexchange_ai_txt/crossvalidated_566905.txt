If you run ICA without pre-decorrelating the data, as may be done with the Infomax/Maximum Likelihood algorithm (by me in 1995) then the resulting independent component transform is non-orthogonal. The point about ICA is that it is a non-orthogonal decorrelating transform who's solution is constrained by higher-order statistics. You mustn't confuse orthogonality (which is a geometric property of the matrix transform) with decorrelation (which is a statistical property of the transformed data). In PCA, which is the orthonormal decorrelating transform, the two coincide.
