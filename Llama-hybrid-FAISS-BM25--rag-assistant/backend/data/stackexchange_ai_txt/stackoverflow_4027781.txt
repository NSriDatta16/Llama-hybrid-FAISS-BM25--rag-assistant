The DieHarder test battery by Robert G. Brown --- which reimplements and extends the old DIEHARD by Marsaglia et al -- has been wrapped into the R package RDieHarder which you could start with. Note that RDieHarder versions need their particular matching DieHarder releases -- and we're not there yet for the most recent development version of the latter. Edit Also, for the subset of cryptographioic tests, the NIST suite (which is included in DieHarder) should be appropriate as that is what it was designed for.
