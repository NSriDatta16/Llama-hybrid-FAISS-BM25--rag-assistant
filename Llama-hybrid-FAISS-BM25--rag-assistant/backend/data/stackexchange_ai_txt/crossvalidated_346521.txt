How to weight composites based on PCA with longitudinal data?

My aim is to construct a composite index for job quality from 33 indicators. I would like to set variable weights through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and my data are longitudinal. My questions are: Do you know how to manage PCA for panel data? Can PCA be applied for binary and continuous data? only with binary data? How can I define weights from PCA? I think correlation coefficients with the first Principal Component. But what about if I have more Principal Components?
