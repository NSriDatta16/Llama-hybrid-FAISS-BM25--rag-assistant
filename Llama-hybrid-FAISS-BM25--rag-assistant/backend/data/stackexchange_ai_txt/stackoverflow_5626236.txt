Inside the Run On Agent scope you need to have a GetBuildAgent activity that assigns the BuildAgent details to a variable of type IBuildAgent. You can then access the properties of that variable to get access to data about the Build Agent: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.build.client.ibuildagent.aspx Note: The default build workflow does this already.
