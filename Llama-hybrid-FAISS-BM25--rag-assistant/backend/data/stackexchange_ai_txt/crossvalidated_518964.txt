The first thing to do is run a correlation between all the independent variables to determine which ones are correlated. Those can be omitted as knowing one gives all the information about the other. If there is correlation between independent variables additional regression analysis can be carried out to see how are they correlated (linearly? exponentially? etc.) In summary, if A is a function of B, there is no need to include both A and B in the model, just one of them is sufficient. But is always good to know how A and B relate to each other. After the variables that are not correlated are selected, the relevant variables can be identified with univariate logistic regression. Those with p values =
