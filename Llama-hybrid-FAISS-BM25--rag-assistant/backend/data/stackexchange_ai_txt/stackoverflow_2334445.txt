Using Magento 1.4's WYSIWYG editor on custom admin pages

Anyone know how to get the new 1.4 WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) working with custom admin pages? I have some modules I made that have input fields in the admin->system->config section, and Iâ€™d like to get the new editor to show on the textareas there, but I can't find where they are defined.
