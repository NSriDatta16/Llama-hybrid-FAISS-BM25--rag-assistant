Your approach is not really wrong, but naive. There's a huge mathematical foundation for such tasks - called, unsurprisingly, filters. You can get much better than 'averaging last N values'. For one, Kalman filters are easy to implement and tweak and are generally good enough for practical tasks. Also, don't try to smooth or average GPS signal - GPS receiver does that itself. Instead, base filter on expected accelerations of the vehicle (or human). Finally, momentary velocity can be calculated from frequency shift, if you can get that information.
