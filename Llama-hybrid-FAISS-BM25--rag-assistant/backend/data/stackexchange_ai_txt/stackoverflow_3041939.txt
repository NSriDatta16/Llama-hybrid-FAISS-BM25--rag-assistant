jQueryUI dialog won't go modal

I need a modal dialog to open ontop of an tinyMCE editor and other jQuerified items. I followed the jquery site but its not modal, I can still change and access the rest of the page. $('#sureDelete').dialog({ modal: true, buttons: { "Yes": function(){ $('li#'+$id).remove(); }, "No":function(){ } }, draggable: false }); Are you sure you want to delete this page? Also I don't have any styling added to the dialog. Can that be an issue?
