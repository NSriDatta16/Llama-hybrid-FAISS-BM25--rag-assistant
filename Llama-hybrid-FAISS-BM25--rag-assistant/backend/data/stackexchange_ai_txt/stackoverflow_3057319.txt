Having a inside a is malformed HTML, and all bets are off how any browser/user-agent/javascript-engine/dom implementation is going to handle it. Expect wildly different or equal results between different visitors. Just don't have a in a . Period :) Most likely scenario in your observed behavior: starting a tag inside a form is probably 'discarded' as invalid, including any actions/events (but probably not s), the first closes the 'main' form.
