FreeMarker is a bit old (latest release in December 2008 ). Can you check you reproduce the problem with eclipse Ganymede 3.4(.x), that is older version, or eclipse 3.5.1 (more recent)? SWT might have evolve in non-compatible way since then. Or it might just be an old bug still un-resolved (like the 115253 one , or the 287886 , which should have been fixed in 282218 , but for Mac and probably only in 3.5.1).
