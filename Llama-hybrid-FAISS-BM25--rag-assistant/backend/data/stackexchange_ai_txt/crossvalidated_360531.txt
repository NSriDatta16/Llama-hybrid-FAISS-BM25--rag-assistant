If you want to predict things like probability of default as a function of time, then you are interested in survival analysis models, so check the questions tagged as survival-analysis . As about your general question, with binary data we use logistic regression that enables us to predict the probability of success by assuming Bernoulli distribution , with multiple categories we assume multinomial distribution , and for continuous data, we assume an appropriate continuous distribution. In case of linear regression, the probabilistic model behind it assumes normal distribution , so if know the parameters of the distribution, you can estimate the probability densities for a particular outcome, given the estimated parameters. Same with other distributions, so basically the all you need is a probabilistic model.
