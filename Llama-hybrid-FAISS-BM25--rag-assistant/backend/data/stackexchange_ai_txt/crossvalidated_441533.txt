Correaltion between sparse variables

I have an Events x People matrix M, where a cell (e,p) gives the score of person j at event e. Let E be the total number of events. Each person has attended a lot of events, say 0.3*E at an average. However, the number of common events between 2 persons is very small ( I am interested in the Pearson correlation between the scores of each pair of individuals. As the common attendance of any two persons is small, the correlation values computed using the common data points are off and rather noisy. Consider an alternate approach, where I first normalize each persons score across all the events that the person attended and then take the pairwise covariance using the common data points. Note that if there are no missing values, this approach yields the pairwise correlation between people and is effectively the same as the first. I have 2 questions related to this approach: This second approach is similar to the first except that the mean and variance is computed from all the data points of a person rather than only the common data points, and hence, they will be more accurate estimates of the population mean and variance, and the approach will, therefore, yield more accurate correlation. Is this justified? In my implementation of this approach, I am getting some correlation values outside [-1, 1] though just slightly (1.2, -1.3, ..). There could be a bug in my code, but I was just wondering if that should even be mathematically possible?
