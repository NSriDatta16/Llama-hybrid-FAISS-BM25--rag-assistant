Do the filters in deconvolution layer same as filters in convolution?

I am trying to understand how the deconvolution works in Convolutional Neural Network for image segmentation problem. I have seen this definition: Filters used in deconvolution is just the transpose of the convolution matrix. Does this mean that the convolution layer and deconvolution layer shares the same filters? Do we train a separate set of filters for deconvolution layer?
