You can make sure the content is freshly loaded each time in at least 2 ways: Add the "pragma: no-cache" header to your http response. This should make the http client not cache the response. Add a random query parameter to the request like: url = "http://myhost.com/controller/blabla?rand=" + Math.random(...). This would make the url unique each time but the server would probably not care about the parameter so it would still be safe. Hope this helps
