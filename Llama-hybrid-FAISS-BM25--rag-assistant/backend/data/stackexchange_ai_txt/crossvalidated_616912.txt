The probability of making a Type S error, and the average amount of magnification (type M error) as a function of power

When you filter on only viewing results with p Type S errors are more common, and effect magnification is larger, when the power of a study is low. My question is: What are the equations that compute the probability of type S error and the average magnification factor from power? Gelman, A. & Carlin, J.
