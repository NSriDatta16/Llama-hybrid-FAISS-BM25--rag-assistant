Should models be namespaced in Rails?

Usually there are a lot of models in a Ruby on Rails project, so: Is it a good practice to namespace them (in modules/folders)? What are the downsides? EG: Shop category.rb details.rb Products category.rb base.rb etc (instead of ShopCategory, to have Shop::Category?) Should also the controllers be namespaced in the same manner?
