Has open source ever created a single file database that auto handles transactions?

Has open source ever created a single file database that has better performance when handling large sets of sql queries that aren't delivered in formal SQL transaction sets? I work with a .NET server that does some heavy replication of thousands of rows of data from another server and it does so it a 1-by-1 fashion without formal SQL transactions. So, therefore I cannot use SQLite or FirebirdDB or JavaDB because they all don't automatically batch the transactions and therefore the performance is dismal. Each insert waits for the success of the previous one, etc. So, I am forced to use a heavier database like SQLServer, MySQL, Postgres, or Oracle. Does anyone know of a flat file database (that has a JDBC connect driver) that would support auto batching transactions and solve my problem? The main think I dont like about the heavier databases is the lack of the ability to see inside the database with a one-mouse-click operation, like you can with SQLLite. I tried creating a SQLite database and then set PRAGMA read_uncommitted=TRUE; and it didn't result in any performance improvement.
