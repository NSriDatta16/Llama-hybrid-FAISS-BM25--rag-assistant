Exclusion of 0 in 95% Credible Interval

In Bayesian regression, does the exclusion of null value (0 or 1, depending on difference or ratio) in the 95% HDI implies significance (like in frequentist), and what's the relation with ROPE? Is it possible for a null to be excluded but the ROPE to be large? Or for a null to be included but the ROPE to be small?
