How to handle this scenario when deploying C# application?

Yesterday I was trying to get a list of files opened by a particular process but it seemed to be a gigantic task to do using C#. Someone pointed me to this nifty program called Handle by Mark Rusinovich. The program seems to suffice my needs but the licensing prevents me from redistributing it (which from what I understand means that I cannot compile my program along with that binary because then I would be redistributing it). I was initially thinking of just using the program to generate the output and then parse the output for my own use but now I guess that's not possible. So what should I do now? When my program starts, pop up a box telling the user to first download this program from Microsoft's website first before using my program? Can someone suggest a possible solution that I could use if I want to deploy it? PS: My application is a freeware
