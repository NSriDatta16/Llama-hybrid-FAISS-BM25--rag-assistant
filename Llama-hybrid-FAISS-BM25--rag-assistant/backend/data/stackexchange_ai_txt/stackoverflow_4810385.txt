Class resides in different directory than what the package specifies - how come?

The following statements seem to disturbingly function: robert@neghvar:~/tmp> cat org/foo/Bar.java public class Bar { } robert@neghvar:~/tmp> javac org/foo/Bar.java robert@neghvar:~/tmp> javap org.foo.Bar Compiled from "Bar.java" public class org.something.Bar extends java.lang.Object{ public org.something.Bar(); } Although the Bar class file is in the org/foo directory and declares the org.something package, the compiler does not complain. I was under the impression that java mandated a directory hierarchy which follows the package name. Was I mistaken? If so, what are the consequences of mixing up package names?
