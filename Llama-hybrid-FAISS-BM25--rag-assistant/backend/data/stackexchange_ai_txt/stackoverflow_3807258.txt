Aside from the reasons already mentioned (assignment chaining, set-and-test within while loops, etc), to properly use the using statement you need this feature: using (Font font3 = new Font("Arial", 10.0f)) { // Use font3. } MSDN discourages declaring the disposable object outside of the using statement, as it will then remain in scope even after it has been disposed (see the MSDN article I linked).
