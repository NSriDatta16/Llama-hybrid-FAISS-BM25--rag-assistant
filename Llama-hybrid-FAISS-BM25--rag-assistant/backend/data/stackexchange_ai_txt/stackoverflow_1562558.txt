Well, powtac pretty much gave you the answer : Facebook doesn't reload the whole page when you click a link, it requests the new content via XMLHttpRequest and refreshes only those portions of the page that change. It's pretty slick about this: a naive implementation might not use real links at all, thus preventing you from opening, say, a different Facebook tab in a separate browser tab. This technique - intercepting link navigation - also allows Facebook to use custom prompts when you try to navigate away without saving , and re-write paths as fragments, allowing it to track the current location in the URL without reloading the page. FWIW, this question has already been asked and answered - see: How are the facebook chat windows implemented?
