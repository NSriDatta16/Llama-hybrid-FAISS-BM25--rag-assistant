How to "snap" a directional (2D) vector to a compass (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)?

I have a bunch of vectors normal to window surfaces in a 3D modelling software. Projected to the XY-Plane, I would like to know in which direction they are facing, translated to the 8 compass coordinates ( North , North-East , East , South-East , South , South-West , West and North-West ). The vectors work like this: the X axis represents East-West (with East being positive) the y axis represents North-South (with North being positive) thus (0, 1) == North (1, 0) == East (0,-1) == South (-1,0) == West Given a vector (x, y) I am looking for the closest of the 8 compass coordinates. Any ideas on how to do this elegantly?
