I'm confused from your comments when you say you can't fetch data from another site. Are you saying that you can't make HTTP calls from your server because it's prohibited by a firewall policy or some other constraint? Or, are you saying you simply don't know how to make HTTP calls from your server? If it's the latter, you should be able to very easily find a .NET library for making HTTP GET calls (I don't use .NET so I can't say exactly what library to use). Once you've figured that out, then you need to figure out how you're going to parse the response. Is it data from a HTML table, is it a CSV file, is it an XML feed, or...? They are all going to have different parsing needs, so it's hard to explain how to do it without more specificity. There are likely to be libraries available that you can use for that too, but it certainly depends on what your data source looks like. If this is truly the case, it sounds to me like maybe you have only a shallow understanding of how HTTP works and could perhaps benefit from learning how HTTP 1.1 works before going any further. You don't have to understand the whole specification, but enough to distinguish the role of the user agent, server, content types, etc. Otherwise, if you are saying that you can't get around firewall policies and the like, then you will have to give more information about your server environment before we can help.
