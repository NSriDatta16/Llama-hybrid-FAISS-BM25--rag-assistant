What are appropriate heteroscedasticity tests to use with robust standard errors?

I am using a sample of roughly 325,000 immigrants from the American Community Survey to assess the impact of years in the U.S. on income levels. I ran the Breusch Pagan test on my regression model but the income levels are heteroscedastic because there is a strong left skew. To correct for this, I ran my regression with the vce(robust) option in stata. I now want to test my regression for heteroscedasticty but when I attempt to run estat hettest I get an error: hettest not appropriate after robust cluster() r(498); my question What are appropriate tests to run to test for heteroscedasticity of the error terms when using robust standard errors?
