can you create a lib or dll in VS 2005 and link with VS 2008

I am using visual studio 2008 SP1. And I am creating a desktop application using MFC. I have a library I want to link with my application. However, the library was written in WIN32 visual studio 2005. I am been having a trouble linking: fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'AgentLib.lib' I am wondering if it is because I am using MFC 2008 and the library was written and compiled with 2005? Many thanks for any advice,
