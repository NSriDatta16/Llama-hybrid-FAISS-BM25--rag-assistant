Curve of MAPs to evaluate training progress of Mask RCNN on synthetic data

Is MAP (Mean Average Precision) a good substitute for measuring training and validation accuracy at different stages of training a machine learning model for object detection? I am retraining a Mask RCNN (pretrained on MS-COCO) on synthetic images(with five classes) and the validation loss seems to fluctuate up and down till the 1600th epoch although the training loss goes down. I have calculated the Mean Average Precision at every 100th epoch on both training data and validation data as well and I don't know what to make of it.
