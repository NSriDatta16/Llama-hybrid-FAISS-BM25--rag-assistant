db2 storage error when running stored procs

I am seeing the above error when running a small number of stored procs in our application. The actual error that we get is sqlcode=-930, which according to the db2 documentation is: 'There is not enough storage available to process the statement.' Question: how can i increase the storage available to these procs? has anyone else encountered this error and if so did you find a solution? thanks
