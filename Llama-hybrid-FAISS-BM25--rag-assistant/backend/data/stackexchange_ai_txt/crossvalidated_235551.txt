Apparently residual networks share something in common with LSTMs and RNNs, however by definition residual networks are more of a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). The key difference between a residual network and an unrolled RNN/LSTM is, as mentioned in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03640.pdf unrolling in (discrete) time the feedback system gives a deep residual network with the same (that is, shared) weights among the layers.
