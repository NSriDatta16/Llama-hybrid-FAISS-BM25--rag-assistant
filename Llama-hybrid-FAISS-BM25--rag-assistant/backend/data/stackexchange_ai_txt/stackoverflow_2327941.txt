how to use dll?

i have have a program/project in vs2008 that uses a third party static lib. Now, it has come to my attention that i need to offer some api's via a dll. Apparently a thrid party program will use my dll via the apis i will provide. Can anyone give me some direction as to what I need to do? would i need to just create a dll in vs2008 and just copy and paste my method logic in the apis that i provide? are there any potential issues i need to worry about? thank you
