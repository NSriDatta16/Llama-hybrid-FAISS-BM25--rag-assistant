Why do you need a sampling plan? 30,000 isn't a particularly large data set, unless there are a lot of variables for each i. If this were me (and, if so, this would be time series data collected on equal time intervals), I wouldn't sample at all if 30,000 were too many. Instead, I'd stratify by time (say, 4 groups of 7500), simultaneously shrinking the data set and providing a replication and enabling a test for the stability of the model parameters over time. This ducks the issue of appropriate sampling in the presence of autocorrelation. Caveat: Force sensors aren't something I'm familiar with, so it's possible that this lack of domain knowledge renders this answer faulty.
