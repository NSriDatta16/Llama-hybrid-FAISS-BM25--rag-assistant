Basically what caused the issue is the line ts(data[1:96,4],start=1, end=96,frequency =7 ) , when you specify both start and end with frequency = 7 , R is trying multiply the series so that it has a length of 96 weeks. Recall R defines the start and end time in seasons (weeks in your case). Since you are fitting daily data, only specifying start = 0 or start = 1 should be sufficient. Instead of running View(saledata) , try to use saledata to debug yourself and you can see wrong length of time series is outputted . Start = c(1, 1) End = c(96, 1) When you do ARIMA forecast with xreg , basically you will need to create a matrix newxreg for your next 48 days with the same structure as xreg , then specify newxreg = newxreg in the forecast function. A good habit for the xreg and newxreg matrix would be to include a Day column that acts as an ordering for the data.
