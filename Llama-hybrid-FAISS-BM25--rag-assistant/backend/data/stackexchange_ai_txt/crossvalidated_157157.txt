Evaluating parameters of a time series model on multiple experimental sessions

I'm trying to evaluate a model for a time series, given many time series (plural). For example, i'm using the forecast package and in particular the ets function to forecast based on a time series. My data was not continuously gathered, so I have around 50 sessions of 1-2 hours each, where each session was recorded on a different day. How do I evaluate the parameters of a time-series model using multiple experiment sessions data? concatenating the time series is obviously not a good idea because the last samples of session k-1 have no affect on the first samples at session k . This is a special case of an irregular time series, but I don't think it should be treated as one. Here is an example code: # original time series, one per recording session: ts1 So the model assumes that this is a regular time series, even though it is not. Is there a way to iteratively evaluate the parameters of the model given multiple sessions of data? This is actually a general question regarding time series analysis in chunks. This problem can happen with any analysis and any package.
