How to best implement software updates on windows?

I want to implement an "automatic update" system for a windows application. Right now I'm semi-manually creating an "appcast" which my program checks, and notifies the user that a new version is available. (I'm using NSIS for my installers). Is there software that I can use that will handle the "automatic" part of the updates, perhaps similar to Sparkle on the mac? Any issues/pitfalls that I should be aware of?
