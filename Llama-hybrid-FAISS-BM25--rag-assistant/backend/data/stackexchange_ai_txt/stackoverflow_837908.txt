Getting the values of elements that have been dropped on eachother with jQuery?

I have the following jQuery: $(document).ready(function () { $(".element").draggable(); $(".element").droppable({ drop: function () { alert('dropped'); } }); }); Anything with the class of 'element' can be manipulated and dragged around the page. I want to be able to find the HTML contents of the element that is being dragged and the element that is being dropped and use them where "alert('dropped');" is, so I could do something like: alert(firstelement+ ' was dropped on ' +secondelement); Any Ideas?
