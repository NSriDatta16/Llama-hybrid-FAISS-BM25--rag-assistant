Techniques for hyperparameter search in non-stationary environments

I'm tuning a supervised machine learning model over time, also called incremental learning. I do not want to assume the environment is non-stationary. Grid search and random search do not appear to be the best choices. Bayesian optimization has been used previously for this challenge. Contextual bandits could possibly be used. However, I could not find any examples. What are the best options for hyperparameter search in non-stationary environments?
