Having not learned how to write packages yet, I have always organized by sourcing sub scripts. Its similar to writing classes but not as involved. Its not programatically elegant but I find I build up analyses over time. Once I have a big section that works I often move it to a different script and just source it since it will use the workspace objects. Perhaps I need to import data from several sources, sort all of them and find the intersections. I might put that section into an additional script. However, if you want to distribute your "application" for other people, or it uses some interactive input, a package is probably a good route. As a researcher I rarely need to distribute my analysis code but I OFTEN need to augment or tweak it.
