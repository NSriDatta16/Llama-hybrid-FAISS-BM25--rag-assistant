One thing to be wary of in your example is that ASP.NET apps should not use ThreadStatic storage, as a thread can be re-used, and if you do not clean up all your objects you end up with a connection hanging around. In an ASP.NET app I'd use the HttpContext.Items collection instead. You are implementing IDisposable, but I've seen scenarios where devs forget to call Dispose or place the code in a using block.
