With uncorrelated errors, the linear regression coefficient estimates and standard errors should still be correct; tests and confidence intervals will not be correct in general ― e.g. the significance level and coverage respectively may differ from what you want ― but in large samples this might not matter all that much. "Dependence" ― even under the restriction of 0 correlation ― can cover a very wide variety of possibilities. Consequently, if you don't have a specific form of dependence in mind to check for, it can be hard to detect (very large samples may be required to get good power against very broad alternatives).
