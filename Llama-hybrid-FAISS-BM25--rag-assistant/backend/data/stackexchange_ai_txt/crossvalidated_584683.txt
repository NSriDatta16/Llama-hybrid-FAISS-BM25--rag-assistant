The are many variants of the bootstrap and, on the surface, the nonparametric or re-sampling bootstrap has a similarity to drawing from a multinomial distribution. See @Dave's answer. The bootstrap uses the plug-in principle: we replace an unknown distribution $F$ by an estimate $\widehat{F}$ . There are many possible choices for $\widehat{F}$ . If $\widehat{F}$ is a parametric distribution, then the bootstrap is parameteric or model-based . Moreover, as @Tim exaplains in Bootstrapping and ECDF , the bootstrap refers to the entire statistical procedure for estimating uncertainties. That is, once you've sampled $n$ times with replacement from the original dataset of size $n$ , the bootstrap also explains how to do inference (estimate standard errors, calculate p-values, compute confidence intervals, etc.) So drawing an analogy (actually, false equivalence) between bootstrapping and sampling from a multinomial distribution will take your understanding of bootstrapping methods only so far.
