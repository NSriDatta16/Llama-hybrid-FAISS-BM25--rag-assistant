multiclass classification and unbalanced dataset

I have a five-class SVM multiclass problem. The dataset is small (about 160 examples) and unbalanced i.e. I have classes with few examples. So far I further limited the dataset to 110 examples in order to work with a balanced training set... Is this a correct approach? Or should I work with an unbalanced training set? What are the advantages in this latter case? Thank you in advance!
