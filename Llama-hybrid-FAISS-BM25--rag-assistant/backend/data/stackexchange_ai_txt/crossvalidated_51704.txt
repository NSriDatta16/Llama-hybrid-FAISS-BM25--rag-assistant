There's really no way to tell apriori which algorithm will be best for a given problem. The best approach is usually to try several different algorithms, validate them out-of-sample on a test set or through cross-validation, and then choose the algorithm with the lowest out-of-sample error. Weka is a great Java machine learning library. I'd also add logistic regression to your list, as it's one of the simplest and most common approaches to binary classification.
