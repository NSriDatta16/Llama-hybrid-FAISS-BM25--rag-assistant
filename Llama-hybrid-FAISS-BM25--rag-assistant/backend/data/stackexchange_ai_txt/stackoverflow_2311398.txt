For detecting critical situations when some program is hogging the CPU perhaps looking at load average is better? Take a look at "uptime" command. Load average number tells you how many processes on average are using or waiting on CPU for execution. If it is close to or over 1.0, it means the system is constantly busy with something. If load average is constantly raising, it means that system cannot keep up with the demand and tasks start to pile up. Monitoring load average instead of CPU utilization for system "health" has two advantages: Load averages given by system are already averaged. They don't fluctuate that much so you don't get that problem with parsing "ps" output. Some app may be thrashing disk and rendering system unresponsive. In this case CPU utilization might be low, but load average would still be high indicating a problem. Also monitoring free RAM and swap would be a good idea.
