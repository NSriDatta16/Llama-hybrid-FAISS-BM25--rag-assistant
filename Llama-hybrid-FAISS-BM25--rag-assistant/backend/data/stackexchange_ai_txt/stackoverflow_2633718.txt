What's the best way to use NHibernate for objects without ID?

I have some classes in my app that don't require an ID to be persisted. These could be things like user logs or audit records. I can add an arbitaty id to them but I would like to avoid that as they don't mean anything. The retrieval of these objects is always on another key (like UserId) which is not unique to the record.
