The issue with this question is that "statistically similar" is quite ambiguous. There are a lot of things that can be similar by one criteria, but different by others. For example, if series A is just series B with each element increased by 10, then the two series are identical if you're looking at how they move, but very different if you're looking for things that move around the same mean. Another example is if you take a time series A and then shift that time series by a few periods to make A', then the two series will be identical if you look at them as "leaders/laggers", but often when using simple measures like correlation it will tell you that these two series are completely different. So long story short there is no general method to say "these two series are similar" because your definition of "similar" may be very different from somebody else's. You'll need to refine what you're looking for before you can start making comparisons.
