So taking a step back, I think you might want to consider a different method from t -tests, altogether. Your unit of analysis is county, and you have various statistics at the county level, including population, presumably what state it is in, health metrics (sounds as though you may have different stats for males/females even), and race breakdown. So this is a multivariate set of research questions and you almost certainly want to control for other properties of the county when making inferences about the target phenomena. So with that in mind, I would toss out the idea of paired t -tests. Instead, I think mixed-effects models could be the best way go, and it should be configurable for both your scenarios above. Let's take a quick toy data set as a starting point for Scenario 1: county state sex outcome 1 county 1 AL M 0.65 2 county 1 AL F 0.55 3 county 2 AL M 0.45 4 county 2 AL F 0.48 5 county 3 AL M 0.71 6 county 3 AL F 0.49 ... Using the lme4 package, and considering the properties of your outcome variable, you could set the model up as follows: fit Sometimes, referred to as a linear mixed effects model or a multilevel model, this approach would give you an estimate of the population-level difference in the outcome value for males and females in the U.S. One thing to call out is the (1 + sex|state) term in the model syntax. These are random effects and function as follows. When counties are in the same state, there is reason to believe that their average level ( 1 - the "intercept") of outcome and the association between sex and outcome are more similar on average than when counties are in different states. You may have heard the terms correlated errors or maybe "nested data." The flexibility of this modeling approach is that you can explicitly account for correlated errors using these random effect terms. And lastly, there is a weights argument that you can use to adjust each county's contribution to parameter estimates based on population, which may be important given your analysis design.
