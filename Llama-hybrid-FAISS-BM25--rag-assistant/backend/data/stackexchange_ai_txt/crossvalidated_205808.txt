There is no real problem with getting a model-averaged estimate and confidence interval (and p-value, if you must) of the effect of age_class by model averaging the estimates and standard errors. The question you refer to deals with other concerns. I would assume sensible journals would be fine with you presenting the model averaged inference regarding age_class (the other covariates are presumably nuissance parameters, I assume?). If you insist to look at how much weight models with the variable age_class in receive versus those without, then you need the models without the variable for comparison. Regarding what you consider at the end: Ignoring the model selection (or only stating that it has taken place) invalidates any confidence intervals, p-values, estimates you present. Btw. since you did not state what software you use, I have no idea what those commands you intersperse mean.
