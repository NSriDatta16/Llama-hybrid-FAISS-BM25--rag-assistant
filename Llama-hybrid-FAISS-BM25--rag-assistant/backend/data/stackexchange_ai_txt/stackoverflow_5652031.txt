Wrong type argument to unary minus 2

Am getting this error in my WhereamiAppDelegate.m file: #import "WhereamiAppDelegate.h" @implementation WhereamiAppDelegate @synthesize window; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Create location manager object - locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc]init]; //Make this instance of WhereamiAppDelegate the delegate //It will send its messages to our WhereamiAppDelegate [locationManager setDelegate:self]; //We want all results from the location manager [locationManager setDistanceFilter:kCLDistanceFilterNone]; //And we want it to be as accurate as possible regardless of how //much time/power it takes [locationManager setDesiredAccuracy:kCLLocationAccuracyBest]; //Tell our manager to start looking for its location immediately [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]; [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]; - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mv didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation *)userLocation { MKCoordinateRegion region = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance([userLocation coordinate], 250, 250); [mv setRegion:region animated:YES]; } if(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR){ [newLocation initWithLatitude:37.33168900 longitude:-122.03073100]; } [mapView setShowsUserLocation:YES]; - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mv didAddAnnotationViews:(NSArray *)views { MKAnnotationView *annotationView = [views objectAtIndex:0]; id ,MKAnnotation> mp = [annotationView annotation]; MKCoordinateRegion region = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance([mp coordinate], 250, 250); [mv setRegion:region animated:YES]; } [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation { NSLog(@"%@",newLocation); } - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didFailWithError:(NSError *)error { NSLog(@"Could not find location: %@", error); } - (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application { /* Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.

Can you tell me what the problem is? TIA
