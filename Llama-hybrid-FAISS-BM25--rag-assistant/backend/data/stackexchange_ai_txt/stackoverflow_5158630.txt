If you are adding your own version of MooTools or subsequent dependent scripts into the head of your template then you should go into the Joomla! plugins and disable (unpublish) the MooTools plugin. Joomla! 1.5x by default uses an older version of MooTools and it often has conflicts with other libraries such as jQuery or newer versions of MooTools. The other option is to use an extension such as this one: Disable Joomla! core mootools implementation This will allow you to turn off the default MooTools header tag that is inserted by the Joomla! template parse. Then your site (content pages, modules, et cetera) should be able to properly leverage the custom MooTools and subsequent scripts you have inserted into the head. Cheers Aaron
