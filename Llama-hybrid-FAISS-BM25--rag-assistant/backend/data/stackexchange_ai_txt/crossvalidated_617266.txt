Different p values of interaction terms in a logistics regression model obtained by two methods

I would like to obtain the p-value of an interaction term in a logistic regression model. I have tried two methods to accomplish this. First, I fitted a logistic model that includes the interaction term and obtained the p-value returned by the model (SELECT_GroupGene12:CDKiY, p-value = 0.994). Here's the code and summary of the model: fit1 The output is as follows: Call: glm(formula = CDKi_Response3 ~ SELECT_Group * CDKi + Patient_Dx_Age + Histology, family = "binomial", data = tmp_Clin) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.1448 -0.9129 -0.7868 1.3027 1.6270 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.41881 1.80366 0.232 0.816 SELECT_GroupGene12 18.67230 3761.85360 0.005 0.996 CDKiY -0.46924 0.61670 -0.761 0.447 Patient_Dx_Age -0.01417 0.03301 -0.429 0.668 HistologyILC -18.03547 6522.63863 -0.003 0.998 HistologyOther -18.19134 6522.63862 -0.003 0.998 Histologyuk 19.05416 6522.63863 0.003 0.998 SELECT_GroupGene12:CDKiY -36.34491 4978.39200 -0.007 0.994 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 75.025 on 56 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 60.682 on 49 degrees of freedom AIC: 76.682 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 17 Another method I tried involves fitting two logistic regression models, one with the interaction term and one without. I obtained the p-value (0.01513) using the anova function: fit1 The output is as follows Analysis of Deviance Table Model 1: CDKi_Response3 ~ SELECT_Group * CDKi + Patient_Dx_Age + Histology Model 2: CDKi_Response3 ~ SELECT_Group + CDKi + Patient_Dx_Age + Histology Resid.

Upon reviewing this distribution, it appears that there is a significant interaction between SELECT_Group and CDKi. table(tmp_Clin $CDKi_Response3, tmp_Clin$ SELECT_Group, tmp_Clin$CDKi) The table output is as follows: CDKi = N Gene1 Gene12 0 16 0 1 11 3 CDKi = Y Gene1 Gene12 0 16 4 1 7 0 I'm wondering why different pvalues were obtained by these two methods and which method should be used. Thank you.
