While it's reasonable to give more weight to near-term data, the first question you need to answer is : what's the objective of my modeling exercise? In a lot of time series problems, the objective is prediction. That is, given x(:t) , I want to predict x(t+1) . If that's the case, you're better off by letting your data tell you whether recency matters in your model. Instead of fitting a model like f(x(:t);theta) , you may want to consider f(w(:t)x(:t); theta) . A proper walk-forward validation can tell you whether w(t1) > w(t2) for t1 > t2 .
