If your score is a predicted probability for whether some target condition is present or not, you can assess the quality of this prediction using proper scoring rules. My answer here may be helpful. Common scoring rules are the Brier and the log score. You can find arguments for and against both here . If your score is not a predicted probability but just some number that correlates with such a probability, you can run a logistic regression of the target outcome against the score. The predictions from this model, with the score as input, are probabilistic predictions, and you can feed these into your proper scoring rules.
