So the questions asks for how to compute similarity between the organisation description and project titles. One initial thought would be to use a Doc2Vec model ( concept , implementation ), which will take the organisation descriptions and project titles as input and output a n-dimensional vector in semantic space for the given text. From this, you can at least has a baseline which you can use with cosine similarity to see how similar the organisation description is to the project title.
