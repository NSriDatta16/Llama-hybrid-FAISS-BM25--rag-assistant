Implementing Bayesian classifier in Ruby?

I would like to implement a simple Bayesian classification system to do rudimentary sentiment analysis on short messages. Practical suggestions for implementing in Ruby would be welcome. Suggestions for other approaches besides Bayes would also be welcome.
