The most rational and linear approach would be to put Bayesian priors on the amount of non-PH for all variables, before making use of information you get from examining fit to the observed outcome variable. This will give you the correct uncertainties for "final" effects in the model. Less satisfactory but simpler approaches are (1) use the unitness correlation $\rho$ that goes with the test of PH to gauge the extent of the violation, instead of using P-values, which can detect trivial violations, or (2) fit an overall PH model then fit an overall non-PH model (e.g., log-normal survival time model) and see which one "wins" by some global goodness of fit assessment. I'm less inclined to pick and choose covariate-by-covariate.
