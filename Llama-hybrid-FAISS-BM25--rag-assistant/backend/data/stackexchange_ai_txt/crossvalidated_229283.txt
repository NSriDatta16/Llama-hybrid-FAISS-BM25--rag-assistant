Why you probably want to use log returns in this case... Let $R_t = \frac{P_t + D_t}{P_{t-1}}$ be the gross return from $t-1$ to $t$. If you buy and hold an asset, what you probably care about is the geometric average $$ \bar{R}_{geom} = \left( R_1\cdot R_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot R_T \right)^\frac{1}{T} $$ Let $r_t = \log R_t$, that is, log return $r_t$ is the natural logarithm of the gross return. Then: $$ \log \bar{R}_{geom} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_t r_t $$ The log of the geometric average gross return is the arithmetic average of the log return! Do what Carl says, take the log of your returns Other stuff to be aware of... If your returns are stuff like $.01$, $-.02$, $.003$, then you want to add 1 to get a gross return before you take the log. For gross returns near 1 (i.e. gross return of 1 is no change), you have: $$ \log R \approx R - 1$$ For returns near zero, returns and log returns are basically the same number. Why? The first order Taylor Expansion of the logarithm around 1 is simply subtracting 1. A corollary is that it often doesn't matter whether you use log returns or arithmetic returns. Another note is that returns are pretty close to uncorrelated over time, and it's basically fine to take the average over time and compute t-stats etc... assuming independence across time.
