In a standard 3D matrix you only need the top left 3x3 values to give the rotation. To apply the matrix as a 4x4 later on, you need to make the other values 0 apart from on the diagonal. Here's a rotation only matrix where the values vXY give the rotations. [v00 v01 v02 0] [v10 v11 v12 0] [v20 v21 v22 0] [ 0 0 0 1] Interestingly, the values form the bases of the coordinate system you have rotated the object into, so in the new system, the x-axis is along [v00 v01 v02], the y-axis is along [v10 v11 v12] and the z-axis obviously [v20 v21 v22]. You could show these axes beside the object and let the other drag them around to change the rotation, perhaps.
