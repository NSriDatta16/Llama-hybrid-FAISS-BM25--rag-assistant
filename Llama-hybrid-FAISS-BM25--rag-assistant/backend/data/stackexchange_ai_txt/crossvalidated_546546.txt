The central limit theorem applies to a sequence of IID random variables with a fixed distribution . If you have a fixed distribution for the underlying sequence of random variables then a suitably standardised version of the sample mean will converge in distribution to the standard normal so long as its variance is finite. In the example given in your question, the distribution is dependent on $n$ so the underlying distribution for each random variable is changing as $n \rightarrow \infty$ . The example is of course a case where the average converges in distribution to something other than the normal distribution, so it effectively shows that you cannot dispense with the assumption of a fixed distribution in the CLT.
