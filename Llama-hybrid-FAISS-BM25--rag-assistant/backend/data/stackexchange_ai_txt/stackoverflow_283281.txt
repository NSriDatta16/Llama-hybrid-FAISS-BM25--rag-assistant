How long has EStackOverflow been deprecated and what replaces it?

I noticed that EStackOverflow, as defined in SysUtils.pas is marked as deprecated in Delphi 2009. I checked and it was also marked as deprecated in 2007. I have a Delphi 7 install disk here, but I thought I would ask if anyone knows when it was deprecated. Additionally, does anyone know why, and what replaces it? I wrote a test application that causes a Stack Overflow through recursion, and I still get an EStackOverflow exception, but if I add a handler specifically for it then I get [DCC Warning] Unit57.pas(85): W1000 Symbol 'EStackOverflow' is deprecated I know that EStackOverflow descends from EExternal, and that I could trap EExternal and check ExceptionCode for STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW, but that seems unnecessary since it still throws the EStackOverflow exception. Is this just to discourage me from throwing an EStackOverflow in my own code? (Yes, I realize the irony of asking a question about EStackOverflow on a website called StackOverflow , and yes I am completely serious .)
