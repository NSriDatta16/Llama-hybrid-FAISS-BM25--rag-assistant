Best DNN approach for datasets without spatial structure

I have a clinical dataset that consists of 5 independent test results and a truth (diagnosis) flag for each sample. The feature vector is 830,000 x 5; i.e. 830,000 samples x 5 tests. Using 75% of the data for training, I have successfully evaluated a multinomial logistic regression (84.4% accuracy), weighted k-nearest neighbor (90.4%), DNN w/ 2 hidden 512 neuron layers (84.1%), and a CNN (86.9%). Theoretically, my understanding is that there should be no advantage to the CNN with spatially (or temporally) unstructured data, yet it has the 2nd best accuracy while the DNN has the worst. I would like to implement the DNN "correctly", i.e. go beyond the default model I started with and use the optimal number of layers and neurons. How would I determine this for my data set? Thanks, Jason
