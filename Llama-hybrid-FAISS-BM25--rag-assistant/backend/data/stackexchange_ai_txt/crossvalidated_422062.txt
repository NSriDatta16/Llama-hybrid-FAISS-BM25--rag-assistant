Can I use a t-test on percentage data?

I have fundraising data on two different types of groups, let's call them Group A and Group B. I am looking to perform a hypothesis test on whether organizations in Group A raises more money from Source X as a percent of their total fundraising compared to organizations in Group B. My initial idea after dong some reading was to perform a two-tailed t-test comparing the proportions of organizations in Group A to that of Group B. However, I have seen some other posts saying that a binomial test would be more appropriate since the data is bounded by 0 and 1. However, I am not measuring "successes" in any real sense. Is it still appropriate to test this hypothesis with a t-test? Thank you all for your help!
