How to assess correlation when each variable is measured by independent replicates?

I frequently measure multiple variables, in multiple replicates, at many sites. For instance, I might measure bacterial abundance and bacterial growth rates, each in 3 replicates, at many sites. Each replicate is independently sampled and each variable is measured in a different sample (i.e., I can't measure both bacterial abundance and growth rate in the same sample). I'd like to test for correlation between those variables. The problem is, since the variables are measured independently, the variables are not paired. Replicate 1 of variable A is not related to replicate 1 of variable B, any more than it is to replicate 2 of variable B. I could test for correlation among the average of replicates at each site - but that seems blunt, since you lose information about variation among replicates for each parameter. I can imagine some kind of resampling approach, where I randomly select one replicate for each variable at each site. Is there a better way?
