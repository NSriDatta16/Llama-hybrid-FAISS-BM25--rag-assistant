There's nothing in the base class library. Many, many developers have this in their own common library, however, and we have it in MoreLINQ too. It sort of goes against the spirit of LINQ, in that it's all about side-effects - but it's really useful, so I think pragmatism trumps dogma here. One thing to note - there's really no point in using a query expression in your example. (It's not entirely redundant, but if you're not exposing the value it doesn't matter.) The select isn't doing anything useful here. You can just do: IDB.Entities.ForEach(foo => foo.status = "Complete"); Even if you want to do a single "where" or "select" I'd normally use dot notation: IDB.Entities.Where(foo => foo.Name == "fred") .ForEach(foo => foo.status = "Complete"); Only use query expressions where they actually make the code simpler :)
