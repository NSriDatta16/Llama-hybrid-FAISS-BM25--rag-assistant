We do something like this all the time when we do t-testing of means. Remember that a t-test of means is a two-sample ANOVA, meaning that we do a regression like: $$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i$$ where $x_i$ is a $0/1$ indicator variable for group membership. When you do a t-test, you often leave lots of variance unexplained. set.seed(2020) N The p-value is tiny, $8.48\times 10^{-5}$ , and the correct value of $\beta_1=0.5$ is within the $95\%$ confidence interval, yet the $R^2 = 0.03057$ . So yes, it can be acceptable to do the same when you do a logistic regression instead of a linear regression. It might be a terrible idea, but poor fit alone is not a reason to keep from interpreting the coefficients. Consider the situation where the true conditional probabilities are all around $0.5$ . You shouldn't be able to do much better than guessing. Finally, be leery of using improper scoring rules like AUCROC. There are many posts on here about this topic, some of which are mine. This linked post has an excellent answer with some links. The "Frank Harrell" I mention says that ROCAUC can be used for diagnostics of a model on its own---does it perform well at all---but is not for model comparisons.
