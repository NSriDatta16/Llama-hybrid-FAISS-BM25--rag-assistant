While you may be right that a different name might be more suitable for sentiment analysis , it is better to stick with it . The term Sentiment analysis has been actively used since ~2004 and it is a well established term [1]. If you talk to other NLP researchers, sentiment analysis makes it clear what you are talking about, even if the actual words don't describe perfectly what it is. On the other hand, sentiment recognition is a confusing term half-way between sentiment analysis and emotion recognition —a similar but broader problem involving also analysis of facial expression. See also What is the difference between emotion recognition and sentiment analysis? [1]: Mäntylä, M.V., Graziotin, D. and Kuutila, M., 2018.
