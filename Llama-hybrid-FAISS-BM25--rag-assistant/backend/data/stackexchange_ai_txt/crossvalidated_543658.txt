Method of moments estimate of Pareto Distribution

The Pareto distribution has the following $cumulative \ distribution \ function$ : $$F(x;\alpha ,\Theta ) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 - (\frac{\alpha}{x})^{\theta}\ \ if \ \alpha \leq x\ & \\ 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ otherwise & \end{matrix}\right.$$ where $ 0 and $ 1 are the parameters. Using moments method, find the estimates of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ based on a sample of size $5$ for value $3,5,2,7 \ and \ 8. $ To solve this question I began by determining the expectation using the CDF. I found that you can compute the expectation directly from CDF when integrating as follows link $$E(X) = \int \left( 1 - F_X(x) \right) \,\mathrm{d}x$$ $$ = \int_\alpha^\infty \left( (\frac{\alpha}{x})^{\theta} \right) \,\mathrm{d}x$$ $$ = \frac{\alpha}{\theta -1} $$ $$ = \overline{X} = 5$$ How do I proceed from here?
