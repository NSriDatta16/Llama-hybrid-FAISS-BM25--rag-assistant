Should I use keras or sklearn for PCA?

Recentl I saw that there is some basic overlapping of functionality between keras and sklearn regarding data preprocessing. So I am a bit confused that whether should I introduce a dependency on another library like sklearn for basic data preprocessing or should I stick with only keras as I am using keras for building my models. I would like to know the difference for scenarios like which is good for production which will give me better and faster response is there any issue with introducing dependency over other libraries for just 1 or 2 functionality which has a better compatibility with other tools like tensorboard or libraries like matplotlib, seaborn etc. Thanks in advance.
