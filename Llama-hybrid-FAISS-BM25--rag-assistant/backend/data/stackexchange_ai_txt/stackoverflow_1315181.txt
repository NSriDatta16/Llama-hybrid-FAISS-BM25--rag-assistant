yes you can. A rebuild will rollback and the index will be in the exact state it was in before the rebuild was started. A reord (aka defrag) will stop where it is, and start back up where it left off (or pretty close at least) the next time you start it. I actually have a job which looks to see if my maintenance job is running, and stops it if it is come 5am.
