Servers window in Eclipse

I need to create an ODE server inside my Eclipse workspace, in the tutorial I'm following, it says to use the Server view under Window->Show View->Other->Server->Servers . However, I cannot find this option under 'Window->Show View->Other->Server->Servers', any ideas how to get it? I am using Eclipse 3.4.2 Ganymede (classic).
