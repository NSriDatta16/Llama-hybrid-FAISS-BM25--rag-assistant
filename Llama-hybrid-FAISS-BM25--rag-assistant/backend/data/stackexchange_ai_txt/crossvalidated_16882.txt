What methods of statistical analysis can be used for time series data?

I have done many 1-sample T-tests before, but I can't figure out if I am able to use one in this situation. In our experiment, we took 12 individual insects and placed them in a chamber where they could choose to be on whatever side they pleased (One side had sugar in it and the other did not). We recorded the number of insects on each side at 30 second intervals for 20 minutes. Is it possible to use a 1-sample T test here? It seems the data wouldn't be random, violating one of the fundamental assumptions for the test. The number of insects on one side at any time strongly influences the number that will be there at the time of the next reading. What exactly is data like this called? How can I analyze it and potentially reject the null hypothesis that the insects have no preference to the side with sugar vs. the side without?
