The trick is to use a single UIPanGestureRecognizer. Add one to your original "icon" (UIView) and use it to detect the initial touch and beginning of the pan. When the UIPanGestureRecognizer enters UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan create the view that will animate the drag. The original icon view and handler will continue to receive callbacks. You can test for UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged and translate the new moving view from within the original handler.
