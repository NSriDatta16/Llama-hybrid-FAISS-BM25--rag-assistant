According to MATLAB's help , deviance is the value of the loss function for the type of model that you are using. It is the value of negative log-likelihood (MSE for linear regression) for your model averaged over the validation folds in the cross-validation procedure. According to MATLAB's help, the two points marked in the graph are: Plots the value of Lambda with minimum cross-validated MSE. Plots the greatest Lambda that is within one standard error of minimum MSE (so makes the sparsest model within that region).
