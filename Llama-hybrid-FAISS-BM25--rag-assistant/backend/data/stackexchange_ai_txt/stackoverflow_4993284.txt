That's pretty much what's its rigged to do right now. routing http posts isn't a common usage. In your situation, I might try to create a port bridge. It requires an agent on both ends, but once created, you can essentially forward any TCP/IP based traffice. The examples that are out there are a bit dated, but they should still work. They also allow for the multi-plexing of connections to help manage the connection costs. Alternatively, have you looked into Azure Connect? If allows a server-to-server trusted connection that may also accomplish what you need. You can find out more about the port bridge at: http://vasters.com/clemensv/PermaLink,guid,3e35d8bd-b755-453f-8c63-1a57c570eb4c.aspx
