The average of a random varible with pdf in the form of an parametric inegral

The pdf of a random variable $T$ in the interval $(0,1)$ in a certain problem I was trying to solve is given by : $$ g(t)= c\int_{0}^{1-t} t^{m-1}\left[(u+t)^{m}-u^{m}\right]^{n-2}(u+t)^{m-1} d u $$ where c is some constant.We know the average $E(T)$ is given by : $$E(T)=\int_0^1t g(t) dt.$$ In order to evaluate this integral I tried integration by parts by taking $g(t)$ as the first function and calculating $g'(t)$ .It however did not help.I want to know if there is some way of calculating the above integral for the expectation of T.I would highly appreciate if somebody could help me with this integral.\ PS: To be specific , $g(t)$ is the range of the distances from origin of n iid points in the n-dimensional ball and $c=m^2n(n-1)$
