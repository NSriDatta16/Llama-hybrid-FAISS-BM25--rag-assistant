The autoregressive correlations of order 1 of the residuals of model m3a of the two time series were pretty high (A: ca. 0.4 and B: ca. 0.6), and both are significant at 0.05 level. As such, the results from summary() are invalid. The autocorrelation coefficients for the two ts can be visualized by: acf2(residuals(m3a,type="normalized")[seq(1,187,2)],max.lag=50) (note: acf2 from pkg astsa) acf2(residuals(m3a,type="normalized")[seq(2,188,2)],max.lag=50) Increasing AR order p and MA order q won't help mitigate the significant first order autocorrelation coefficients. To reduce first autocorrelation coefficient, one approach is to incorporate frequency domain methods. Here is what I do. dTMP$time = rep(1:94, each = 2) m3a Check autocorrelation of the new model acf2(residuals(m3a,type="normalized")[seq(1,187,2)],max.lag=50) acf2(residuals(m3a,type="normalized")[seq(2,188,2)],max.lag=50) The first order autocorrelation coefficients for site A and B are reduced to about 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. These are much better. If you check the results by summary(m3a), you will see the significant effect of site (the p = 0)
