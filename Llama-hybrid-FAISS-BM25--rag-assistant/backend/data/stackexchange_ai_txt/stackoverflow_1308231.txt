Fixed by reinstalling Visual Studio. P.S. This has happened again; here's what I observed this time: Visual Studio was running when a major disk defrag occurred. Halfway through the major disk defrag the UI (and the Find dialog in particular) started taking a long time to appear. During the slowdowns the Visual Studio process spends a lot of CPU time in the kernel (according to ProcExp) A Windows Update was pending. Restarting Visual Studio did not help fix the problem. Applying the windows update and restarting the OS fixed the problem.
