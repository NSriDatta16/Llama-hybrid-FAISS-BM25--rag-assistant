How do I prevent IVsBuildPropertyStorage.SetItemAttribute from escaping special characters?

I am working on a Visual Studio 2010 extension and I want to add an attribute to an MSBuild Item, as follows: %(Filename)%(Extension) So, far the only way I found is using the method IVsBuildPropertyStorage.SetItemAttribute . This works fine for simple strings, but when i try to use characters that are special to MSBuild, I get this result: %29%25%28Filename%29%25%28Extension%29 This means that SetItemAttribute automatically escapes from MsBuild characters and I don't want that.
