Confidence measures for Gaussian mixture models

When generating Gaussian mixture models using expectation maximization with Bayesian Information Criterion, is it necessary to report a confidence measure? How do you know that the algorithms are returning the optimal models? I'm playing around with densityMclust in the mclust R package, and it doesn't seem to be returning any confidence measure (analogous to a p-value).
