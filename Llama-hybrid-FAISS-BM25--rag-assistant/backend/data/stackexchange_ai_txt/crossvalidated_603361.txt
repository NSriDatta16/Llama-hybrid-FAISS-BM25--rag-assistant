Interpretation of coefficients in a linear regression model with two binary predictors and their interaction

This is the output from a linear regression model that is trying to predict math scores based on the student's gender and whether or not they took a test preparation course. It is just a toy example for me to understand how to interpret the coefficients. > str(StudentsPerformance) 'data.frame': 1000 obs. of 8 variables: $ gender : chr "female" "female" "female" "male" ... $ test.preparation.course : chr "none" "completed" "none" "none" ... $ math.score : int 72 69 90 47 76 71 88 40 64 38 ... The model includes an interaction term between gender and test preparation course. lm(formula = math.score ~ 1 + gender * test.preparation.course, data = StudentsPerformance) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -61.671 -9.671 0.329 9.804 38.329 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 67.1957 1.0857 61.889 I made the following statements : the intercept is the average math score for female students who completed the test preparation course males have a math score that is 5.1434 points higher than females between those who completed the course females who didn't take a test preparation course have a math score that is 5.5250 points lower than females who took the course the effect of a test preparation course is different for male and females. Male students who did not take the test preparation course have a math score 3.1258 points higher than female students who took the test preparation course is that a correct interpretation?
