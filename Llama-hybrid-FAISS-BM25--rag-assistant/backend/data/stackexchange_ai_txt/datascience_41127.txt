Using deep learning or random forest

I am very new to machine learning, and I am trying to build a model to classify this data set (UCI heart disease) . I have built a simple model using random forest and got an 80% accuracy. The size of the set is about 900. To get the best value possible, should I continue with random forest or go with deep learning (such as TensorFlow)? Thanks!
