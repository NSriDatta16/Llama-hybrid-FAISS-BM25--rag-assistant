How to represent audio data in a format that can be used for preprocessing and modelling?

I have a project that I am working on currently. The project is to classify audio data. The data is in two folders train and test . In the train folder, there are multiple folders like cat , dog , elephant etc and these folders contain multiple audio files. For example, there are multiple audio files inside the folder dog , cat etc. The folders are also the class names representing the class the audio belongs to. The audio is in .WAV format. How to represent this data in a format on which I can use Machine learning models? To explain my question a bit: let's take a .csv file. We have rows and columns. Rows are data points and columns are features and training machine training models on this data makes sense. So, How do I represent this audio data that I can work with and fit ml models?
