Intervention variable does not show in the result output in ARIMA using spss

I am new to ARIMA. I want to add an intervention variable into arima model using SPSS time series analysis function. I made sure that I checked the box indicating the independent variable included in the model is the intervention variable. Once I ran the model, the result did not include this intervention variable in the result output. I was wondering if anyone might be able to kindly offer some insights into this situation? Thanks! Here is the output table where it only showed the constant and AR1 but the intervention variable was omitted. I don't know if the system dropped the variable due to certain reasons.
