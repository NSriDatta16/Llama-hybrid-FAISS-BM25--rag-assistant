My suggestion is starting by decomposing your time-series data to understand the type of periodicity that you have. Statsmodels have one very cool: from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose On the other hand, I'm not clear on what is your downstream application. That influences a lot the type of data preparation that you are expected to apply. Markov chains? RNN? There are several ways that you can address the separation, my preferred is based on Fourier transformations.
