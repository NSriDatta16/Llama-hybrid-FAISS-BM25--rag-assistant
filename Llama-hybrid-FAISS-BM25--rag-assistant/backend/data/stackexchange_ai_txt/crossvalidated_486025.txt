Which form of SVD is most commonly in stats/ML (e.g., PCA, least squares)?

SVM comes in several forms: e.g., the full form and the reduced forms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Reduced_SVDs . Is there one that is more commonly used in stats? If so, why is this particular form used more often than others? I have seen it used for things like PCA and I've also seen SVD applied to least squares.
