Retrieving Facebook-like link summaries (title, summary, relevant images) using Python

I would like to replicate the functionality that Facebook uses to parse a link. When you submit a link into your Facebook status, their system goes out and retrieves a suggested title , summary and often one or more relevant image s from that page, from which you can choose a thumbnail. My application needs to accomplish this using Python, but I am open to any kind of a guide, blog post or experience of other developers which relates to this and might help me figure out how to accomplish it. I would really like to learn from other people's experience before just jumping in. To be clear, when given the URL of a web page, I want to be able to retrieve: The title: Probably just the tag but possibly the , not sure. A one-paragraph summary of the page. A bunch of relevant images that could be used as a thumbnail. (The tricky part is to filter out irrelevant images like banners or rounded corners) I may have to implement it myself, but I would at least want to know about how other people have been doing these kinds of tasks.
