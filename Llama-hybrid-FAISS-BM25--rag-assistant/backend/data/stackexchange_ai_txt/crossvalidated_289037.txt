Can I use proportions as continuous independent variables in a regression?

I was assuming I can until I come across the concept of compositional data. Now I'm confused. My DV is a binary outcome, my IVs are proportions, say: A, B, C where A+B+C=1. I was going to run a logistic regression of DV on A B, as if treating C as the reference category in a logistic regression of DV on an IV with 3 categories. And I was also thinking I can interpret the odds ratios the same way. Has anyone read a paper that use such approach? If so, can you kindly post the reference? Thanks. I read a little about compositional data analysis and am not sure I understand it. For one thing, my IVs can be zero, so I can't do log ratio transformation unless adding a small arbitrary constant. But even if I do so, how do I interpret the result? And how come I can't use the original proportions as IVs but once transformed it's ok? Anyone can explain it in simple language? Thanks so much! Edit: Here's an example of my data: Y A B C 1 0.5 0.1 0.4 0 0.6 0 0.4 1 0.2 0.3 0.5 0 1 0 0 ... Sunny
