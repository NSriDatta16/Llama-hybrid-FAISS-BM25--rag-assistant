Here is a simple test: Suppose your assumption is incorrect and each program size $(n_i)$ has the same enrollment rate $p$ . Also, assume each program is independent. Then the # of enrollments of program $i$ , $x_i \sim Bin(n_i,p)$ . Suppose there are $m$ programs. Let $L_{H_0} = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{x_i}(1-p)^{n_i-x_i}$ denote the likelihood under the null hypothesis of identical enrollment rate. To see if the enrollment rate depends on $n_i$ we could model $p_i$ as a function of $n_i$ through a simple logistic regression model (using a linear term for program size $n_i$ ). Specifically, we model the enrollment rate as $p_i = \frac{\exp \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 n_i \right)}{1+\exp \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 n_i \right)}$ . Let $L_{H_1} = \prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{x_i}(1-p_i)^{n_i-x_i}$ denote the likelihood under the alternative hypothesis that enrollment rate depends on program size. Calculate the likelihood ratio statistic. In this case it will have an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. This is equivalent to testing for the inclusion of the $\beta_1$ in the simple logistic regression model. One can modify the approach by fitting a smooth function of $n_i$ instead of the GLM set-up (see for instance a GAM).
