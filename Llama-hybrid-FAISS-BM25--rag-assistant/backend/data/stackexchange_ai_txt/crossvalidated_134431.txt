Conditional logistic regression with random effects - glmer with 'strata'?

I have matched pairs of cases and controls and would like to perform a conditional logistic regression including random effects. Is it possible to use the strata command like in the clogit function? Would glmer(Y ~ X + (1|Z) + strata(Pair), family=binomial("logit")) give correct results?
