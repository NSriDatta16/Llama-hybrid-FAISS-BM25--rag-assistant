The environment.rb is the main Rails environment file. It requires the boot.rb file but the boot.rb is run before Rails::Initializer.run. In fact, the last line of boot.rb contains the following statement # All that for this: Rails.boot! Please note that while the environment.rb file belongs to your Rails app, the boot.rb file is automatically updated each time you run the rake task rake update:rails You should never modify that file. To better understand how Rails initialization works, Sven wrote a really helpful article called The Rails startup process from a paragliders perspective .
