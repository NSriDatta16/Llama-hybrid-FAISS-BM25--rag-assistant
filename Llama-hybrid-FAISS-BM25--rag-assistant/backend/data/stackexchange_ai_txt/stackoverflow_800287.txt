Windows Installer isn't really designed for "self updating" software. If you don't need MSI, or really need the application to "pull" it's own updates then use NSIS or some other tool and write your own updating routine/service. However if this is being installed on a large number of desktops within a single organisation, then the better solution would be to deploy an MSI via Active Directory. You can then "push" out updates using Group Policy. This is going to be much more robust than any application that updates itself.
