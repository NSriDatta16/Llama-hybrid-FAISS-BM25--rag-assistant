What is the best way to extract load average float values from a string in Python?

If I have a string such as "17:31:51 up 134 days, 11:26, 1 user, load average: 0.22, 0.15, 0.10" what is the best way to extract just the x3 load average values at the end? I have written a regexp that does this but is this the most efficient / fastest method? >>> s = "17:31:51 up 134 days, 11:26, 1 user, load average: 0.22, 0.15, 0.10" >>> print re.findall(r"([0-9]\.\d+)", s) ['0.22', '0.15', '0.10']
