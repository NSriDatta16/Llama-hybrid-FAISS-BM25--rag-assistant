No, you are limited what the host OS can see. If you open up task manager in the host OS, the guest OS's memory is mapped within there, so having memory that's mapped outside of the host OS is not possible. That shouldn't discourage you from getting the extra ram, however. If you upgrade to 4 (or 3.5GB) then you'll still have about ~3.2GB of addressable memory to use, which is a substantial increase over 2GB especially if your memory usage is already near 2GB.
