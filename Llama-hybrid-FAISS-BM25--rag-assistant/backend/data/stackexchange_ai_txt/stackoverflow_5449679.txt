The question is where you should put the CallPercentage. First of all, is it a good question? Yes, it is very good question because it is important where you put a piece of code in. I think the OOP design is actually about “how to get it organized”. To your specific question, I guess, most likely, you want to put it with the Form1 if it is purely serve the Form1’s functioning. But if you think it would be as general as the Function of Percentage, and it would be called in many cases, you may want to put it in the Module. Usually, you want to keep a Module from frequent changes. One more advice, since VB.Net already has “Math”, you’d better call the module with a specific name, like “XiaMath”.
