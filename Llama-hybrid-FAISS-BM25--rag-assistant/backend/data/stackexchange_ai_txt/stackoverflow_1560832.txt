Don't try and do it yourself - there are far too many tricks for getting bits of script and general nastiness into a page. Use the Microsoft AntiXSS library - version 3.1 has HTML sanitation built in. You probably want the GetSafeHTMLFragment method, which returns a sanitised chunk of HTML. See my previous answer .
