Spectral density and Riemann Stieltjes Integral

I am confused with a part about spectral densities. I found it in Time Series Theory and Methods by Brockwell and Davis. I don´t understand how is applied the Riemann Stieltjes Integral in this case, I have seen the definition of Riemann Stieltjes in Wikipedia but I can´t get that conclusion. How is it concluded?
