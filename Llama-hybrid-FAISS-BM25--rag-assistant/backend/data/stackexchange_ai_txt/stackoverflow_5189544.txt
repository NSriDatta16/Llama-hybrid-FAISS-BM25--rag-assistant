Dragging values onto labels

I have an iPad app I'm developing where a random number is generated when a user clicks a button, and it appears on a label over the button, so the user thinks that value is on the button. The user can click the button again to get another random number if they want it. Is there a way for me to allow a user to drag a number from a source (say, a label) to another label - so that instead of a user having to click the button a number of times to get the number they want, they can simply drag it from a 'menu' onto the label. Any help would be appreciated Thanks Baruugh
