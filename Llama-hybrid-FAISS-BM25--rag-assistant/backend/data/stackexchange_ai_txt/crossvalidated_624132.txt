If both pred1 and pred2 are level 1 predictors (i.e. both measured and modeled at the level of the individual respondent so that you have many values for these variables for each Region), you don't actually have a cross-level interaction but a Level1 x Level1 interaction, and therefore you don't necessarily need a random slope. You can probably just have the random intercept of Region, as in fit (possibly you don't even need to use lmer if region ICC is that low, you might be able to just use single-level regression). On the other hand, if you want to study the effect of Region average pred2, and don't care about the individual level pred2, you probably want to use the pred2 Region average in your model instead of the individual-level pred2. In this case you do have a cross-level interaction - but then you can't have Region-specific random slope of pred2 because you only have one value per Region for pred2. However, in this case you could and probably should include pred1 random slope: fit
