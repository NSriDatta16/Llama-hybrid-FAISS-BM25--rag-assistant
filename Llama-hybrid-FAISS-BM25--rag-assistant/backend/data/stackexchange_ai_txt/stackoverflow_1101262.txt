Sun allows you to buy support packages for depreciated software such as JRE 1.4. For banks and some other organizations, paying $100,000 per year for support of an outdated product is cheaper than upgrading. I would suggest only offering paid support for JRE 1.3. If anyone needs support for this, they can pay for a hefty support package. You would then shelve your current 1.3 code base, and if a customer with a support contract requires a bug fix, then you could fix the 1.3 version for them, which would likely just mean selectively applying a patch from a more recent version.
