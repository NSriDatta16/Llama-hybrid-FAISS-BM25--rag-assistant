@Ben is absolutely right. Here is MSDN article Exploring SQL Server Triggers A paragraph from the article: That syntax is also acceptable in older versions of SQL Server. However, now that there are two types of triggers in SQL Server 2000, I prefer to refer to FOR triggers as AFTER triggers. Thus, for the remainder of this article I will refer to either AFTER or INSTEAD OF triggers. Like the AFTER trigger you saw earlier, this trigger prevents changes from being made to the lastname field. However, it implements this business rule differently than the previous example. Because the INSTEAD OF trigger fires in place of the UPDATE statement, the INSTEAD OF trigger then evaluates if the business rule test passes or not. If the business rule test passes, in order for the update to occur the INSTEAD OF trigger must explicitly invoke the UPDATE statement again.
