I'd certainly go for some scripting language, with Ruby/Mechanize being my favorite, take a look at some examples ... Perl and Python are also good choices, for sure. Unless there's a plan for it to be a part of some other application, I'd avoid statically typed languages - too much boilerplate code IMHO. require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new page = agent.get('http://google.com/') google_form = page.form('f') google_form.q = 'ruby mechanize' page = agent.submit(google_form) pp page Mechanize is really great library, as it's not just plain HTTP GET/POST request-and-fetch: it's keeping track of cookies thus closely emulating real web browser behavior.
