I think that you are doing this correctly. onResume would be the perfect time to update your views, I assume you are only updating if there is actually new data to be displayed? If retrieving the data during the updateView method takes a long time then you should do it in an AsyncTask to avoid clogging the UI Thread which will make your app hang. In fact any data retrieval like getting data from the web or reading from your apps database should be done in an AsyncTask. This is because even if your data retrieval seems to take milliseconds on your device it may conceivably take longer on another, less powerful device.
