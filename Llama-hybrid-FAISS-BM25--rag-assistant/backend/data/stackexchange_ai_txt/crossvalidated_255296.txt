I am not entirely sure of the method, could someone confirm to me that it is the right way to calculate conditional probabilities on a logistic regression? You almost have it. But before correcting it, think about what your formula is saying: The left hand side is a probability. We know these are bounded between 0 and 1. The right hand side is taking the mean of some expression. Are we sure that the mean of that expression is bounded between 0 and 1? In this case actually we are because that expression itself happens to be bounded between 0 and 1. But in general we aren't... What does it even mean (sorry) to take the average/mean of that expression? Aren't we calculating the probability that $Y=1$ given some value for $X_1$? In which case that expression returns a single number. So taking the average doesn't really apply. Hopefully that provides some intuition as to why taking the mean isn't correct. The correct form is: $$P(Y=1|X=x) = \frac{e^{\alpha + x\beta}}{1 + e^{\alpha + x\beta}}$$ I suspect that you're taking the mean because you want the mean response ($Y$) to following a logistic/sigmoid function: $$E[Y|X=x] = P(Y=1|X=x) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\alpha + x\beta)$$ The reason this works is because $Y$ only takes on values of 1 (with probability $\pi(X)$) or 0 ($1 - \pi(X)$). So: $$E[Y|X] = 1 \times \pi(X) + 0 \times (1 - \pi(X)) = \pi(X) = P(Y=1|X)$$
