To get started with web crawling, consider the Scrapy framework. http://scrapy.org/ "Scrapy is a high level scraping and web crawling framework for writing spiders to crawl and parse web pages for all kinds of purposes, from information retrieval to monitoring or testing web sites." It's still edging towards a first release, but is usable and has decent documentation. For very basic web scraping, check out Mechanize (for basic web "browsing") and BeautifulSoup (for parsing "html soup"): http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ One fun thing to do would be to combine these interests with some natural language processing projects. The NLTK book recently published by O'Reilly is available online as well: http://www.nltk.org/book Lots of fun to be had combining these interests. :-)
