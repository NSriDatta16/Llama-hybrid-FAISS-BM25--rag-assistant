The question really comes down to the scope of use. If the PKI will only be used internally within your organization, then Microsoft's Certificate Services product provides a decent PKI platform. However, if you're certificates may be used externally -- customers, vendors, etc. -- then you probably want to investigate using a trusted third-party PKI provider like VeriSign, Cybertrust (Verizon Business), etc. We run Microsoft CS internally and it works well, particularly since one of our primary use cases is auto-enrollment of certificates via Active Directory. It allows IIS, VPN clients, etc. to automatically get certificates issued to them on an as-needed basis. It's not the most full-featured PKI product I've worked with. If you're looking for a really advanced feature set, then you should look at Red Hat's Certificate Services product. It's also open-sourced as the Dogtag PKI project.
