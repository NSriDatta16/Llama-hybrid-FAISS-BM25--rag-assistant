Thanks Yuji. I ended up with a launched plist like this: Label com.myAppDomain.MyApp ProgramArguments /bin/sh -c /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp -hideOnLogin YES RunAtLoad I added the bash script as strings in the ProgramArguments key, as Apple does in the following plist: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.FTMonitor.plist the hideOnLogin key is only accessible through the launchd plist, and is reset when myApp is quit. I have a checkbox bound to another key "hideOnLoad", and when this is changed, I rewrite the launched plist to either: /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp -hideOnLogin YES or /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp depending on the circumstances. On startup I then check to see if both defaults are true, if they are, I hide myApp, like so: [NSApp hide:self]; thanks again for pointing me in the right direction!
