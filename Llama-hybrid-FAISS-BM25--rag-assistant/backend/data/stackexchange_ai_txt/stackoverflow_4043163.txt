Your code with some comments : def Save(self): filename = "record.txt" data = "{0}:{1}".format(self.Level,self.Name) isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication() try: isfs = IsolatedStorageFileStream(filename, FileMode.Create, isf) try: # These try is useless.... sw = StreamWriter(isfs) try: sw.Write(data) finally: sw.Dispose() finally: # Because next finally statement (isfs.Dispose) will be always executed isfs.Dispose() finally: isf.Dispose() For StreamWrite, you can use a with statment (if your object as __ enter __ and _ exit __ methods) then your code will looks like : def Save(self): filename = "record.txt" data = "{0}:{1}".format(self.Level,self.Name) isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication() try: isfs = IsolatedStorageFileStream(filename, FileMode.Create, isf) with StreamWriter(isfs) as sw: sw.Write(data) finally: isf.Dispose() and StreamWriter in his __ exit __ method has sw.Dispose()
