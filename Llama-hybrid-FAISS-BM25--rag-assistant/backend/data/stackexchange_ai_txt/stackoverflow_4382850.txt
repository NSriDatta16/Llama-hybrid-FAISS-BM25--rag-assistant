Magento newsletter not posting

I wish to have a newsletter on my home page. I found the following code, which I have copied into my "Content" tab. {{block type="core/template" template="newsletter/subscribe.phtml"}} This is rendered on my page, however I cannot find the response. That is, the receipts are not entered into the newsletter section. It doesn't seem to post anywhere. Here is the HTML produced. Sign Up for Our Newsletter: Subscribe //
