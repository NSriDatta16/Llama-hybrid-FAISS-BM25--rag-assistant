How to make an scrollable UITextField Inside UItableViewCell?

I created a bunch of editable UITableViewCell by embedding an UITextField inside, but I have seen some apps that allows you to scroll the UItableview by scrolling inside an inactive editable cell. How can I do that? And how can I also dismiss the keyboard when tapping somewhere else? I know about the method: - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if (touch.tapCount == 1) { [self resignFirstResponder]; } else { }} I put it inside my custom table view controller but the method doesn't seem to be called upon a tap, and I don't know if even if it gets called will dismiss the keyboard. Any help will be appreciated.
