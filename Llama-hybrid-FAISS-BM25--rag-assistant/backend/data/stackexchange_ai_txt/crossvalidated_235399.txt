Writing a target vector in code for a pattern recognition model

I am trying to build a pattern recognition neural network model. I was told that the target for pattern1 is 1, pattern2 is 0, and pattern3 is -1. However, I am not sure how to create my weight, bias and target vectors? My input vectors are the following: pattern_1 = [1 1 1 -1]; pattern_2 = [1 -1 -1 1]; pattern_3 = [1 -1 1 -1]; How do I write the target vector for the patterns? Is it: weight = [0 0 0]; bias = [1 1 1]; target = [1 0 -1]; I will eventually want to perform: a = weights * pattern_1 error = target - a But I am unsure what sized matrix my target vector needs to be, given the fact that I was just told that it is either 1, 0 or -1.
