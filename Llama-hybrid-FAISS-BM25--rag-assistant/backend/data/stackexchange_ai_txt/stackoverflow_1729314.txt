It is correct that you can roll-out your own ETL scripts written using a development tool of your preference. Having said that, ETL jobs are frequently large (for a lack of better word) and demand considerable administration and attention to minute details (like programming). ETL tools allow developer to focus on ETL tasks -- as opposed to writing and debugging code, although that's part of it too. There are some open-source tools out there, so you can get a feeling of what an average tool does, before jumping into custom development. For example, more expensive tools provide data lineage, meaning you can (graphically) track every field on a report back to the originating table through all transformations (versions included); after a corporate merger that's quite a task to do. For example Pentaho has community edition ; if you have MS SQL Server, you can get SSIS. Also see if you can find something here .
