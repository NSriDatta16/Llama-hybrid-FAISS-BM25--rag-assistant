Change units in posterior MCMC Bayesian summary

I have 4000 iterations from an MCMC summarizing the posterior distribution. In the model used to estimate the posterior (a GLMM), my response variable was in g/m2, but I need to report the result in mg/m2. Can I just multiply each iteration of the posterior by 1000, or do I need to adjust the raw response unit and re-run the model? I assume the former is correct (just multiply), but I have not found direct examples of this approach on this site or in my Bayesian lit.
