If you want your application to be mainstream then your almost forced to go with PHP. Going from Django to PHP is alot easier than going from PHP to Django. You know the standards, you just need to learn the PHP syntax and functions. I would definitely use a PHP framework. Symfony and akelos are very similar to Rails (close to Django). On the other than theres Code Igniter which does what it should - organise your code.
