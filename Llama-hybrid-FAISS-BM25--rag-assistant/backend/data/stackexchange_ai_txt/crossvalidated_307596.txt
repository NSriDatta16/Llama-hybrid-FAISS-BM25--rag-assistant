Is random walk a good metric to compute distances of two sets of nodes in the graph?

I have a big graph and I have three sets(A,B,C) of labeled nodes on it. I would like to compute on average how fare each sets are from each others. In other word, I want to compute distance matrix for these sets. My primary thought was to use random walk, but I'm not sure whether random walk will necessarily give me symmetric distance matrix. Would someone give some suggestions about how can I compute distances of this sets in the graph ?
