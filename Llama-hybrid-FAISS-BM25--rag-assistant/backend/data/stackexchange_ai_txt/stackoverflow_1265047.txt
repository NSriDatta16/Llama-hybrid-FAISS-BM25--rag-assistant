mySQL - results per number of seconds

Im trying to work out (and failing) how I can get the number of sessions (just using that term generically, dont worry too much) per second. I.e. im looking for retention. I have a table that is updated periodically with the number of seconds that a session is active. I want to get a list of:- MAX(`time) - i.e. the highest number of seconds for a session. RESULTING IN: seconds : number of sessions on that second The way I've been faffing with is SELECT `projID`, COUNT(`sessionID`) AS `noSessions`, MAX(`time`) as `endTime` FROM `MetricsLive` GROUP BY `sessionID` ORDER by `endTime` ASC But that's nowhere near what I need, but I'm wholly lost. Any ideas? FORGIVE FORMATTING:- THE TABLE ROW DATA I HAVE IS AS:- SESSSION \\ SECONDS ebsvmcrbob2irbobsrvu2hcfi5 \\ 4 ebsvmcrbob2irbobsrvu2hcfi5 \\ 12 ebsvmcrbob2irbobsrvu2hcfi5 \\ 18 ebsvmcrbob2irbobsrvu2hcfi5 \\ 24 ebsvmcrbob2irbobsrvu2hcfi5 \\ 32 etc. It's rolling inserting a new row everytime a new entry is made. The idea here is to deduce after how long the session ended. So, I want the result of NoSessionsEnded \\ ATSECONDS 4 \\ 12 8 \\ 24 etc.
