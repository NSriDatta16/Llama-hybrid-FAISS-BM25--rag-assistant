How can a NN guess the velocity of an object from a video source?

In the case of a video stream, I'd like to detect the speed (an approximation) of an object, that is moving. What would be the best approach to take? I am thinking of 3 methodologies to take, though I've not found a lot resources to read about. Method 1: I could feed Frame images to my CNN and pinpoint the object in the frame. Then calculate the difference of the position boxes. Frame 1: [ o ] ---> NN --> 3 Frame 2: [ o ] ---> NN --> 7 7-3 = 4 -> so dX = +4 between 1 frame, so I can estimate the dT (if I know the sampling rate of the frames) Method 2: Is there any way where the NN can take as a feed-input the context of the previous frame and make the calculation itself? video lapse 1sec: [ oooo ] ---> NN --> 4m/sec Method 3: What if I can control the shutter speed of my camera, could I calculate the velocity of an object by the motion blur? Frame image: [ ---o ] ---> NN --> 4m/$shutterSpeed Any relevant resource to read would help a lot.
