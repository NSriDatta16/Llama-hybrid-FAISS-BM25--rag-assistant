Entity Framework 4: Problem mapping column to complex type

I have a table with about 30+ columns, so i decided to group them using complex types. When trying to build the assembly, i get the following error: Error 3023: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 933:Column TableName.ColumnName in table TableName must be mapped: It has no default value and is not nullable. One of my complex types includes a property with that exact name, and that exact data type. Any ideas on how i can approach this?
