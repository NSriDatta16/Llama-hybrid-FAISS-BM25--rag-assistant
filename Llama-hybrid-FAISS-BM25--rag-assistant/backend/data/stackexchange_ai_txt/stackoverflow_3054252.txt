Since the message is stored in the core sub-array, you'll use the Magento core message block to retrieve it. In your layout, you should be able to see this line (in page.xml): This means that the page calls the message block and retrieves messages from that core array. Then, in your layouts, you should be able to see the line that actually invokes the output: getChildHtml('global_messages') ?> This actually echos the normal message blocks for any messages in the session. If you cannot find those blocks, add them in. If you need to get the message in a different context (this may interfere with other site operation), try this in a phtml file: getLayout()->createBlock('core/messages')->toHtml(); ?> Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
