Is there an R package for continuous time longitudinal binary responses?

The bild package appears to be an excellent package for serial binary responses. But it is for discrete time. I would like to specify a smooth function of time for the odds ratio connection of the current response Y with binary responses measured at earlier times, or at least a first-order Markov version of this. I believe this is called alternating logistic regression. Does anyone know of an R package that handles continuous time, i.e., measurement times can be at any follow-up time? I don't need random effects in the model.
