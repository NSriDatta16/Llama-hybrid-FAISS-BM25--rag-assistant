Shifting in the plot of the time series and its ARIMA model

I am a self learner, and I am trying to learn how to do times series analysis in R. I generated a sythentic data, and try to recover its model using ARIMA modeling. Here is my code: library(tseries) library(forecast) a Every thing was fine (as I supposed), however the plot of the obtained model is just a shift of the real data (as appeared in the following graph). Is there an explanation of such obtained result ? Thank you in advance.
