How to deal with large proportion of missing values in categorical variable

I have a dataset of around 5,500 observations. One of the variables is Gender for which at least 25% of the observations are missing. Dropping the missing values seems a bit brute, however I have not found a good way of interpolating binary data. Other variables of the data are Country , Date of birth , and Revenue . None of them with relevant correlation with Gender . What is the best way to handle these NaN s? I was thinking of using a logistic regression function with Gender as the target and the rest of the variables as the predictors, but I am not sure whether this is a good choice. Thanks.
