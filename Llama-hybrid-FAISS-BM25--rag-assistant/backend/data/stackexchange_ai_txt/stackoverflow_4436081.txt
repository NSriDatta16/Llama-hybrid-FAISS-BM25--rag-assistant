If you try to access a key that is not in the dictionary, python will raise an exception that will crash your program. Instead of this, you should "catch" the exception and do something more graceful. it's better practice to catch the exception: try: value = my_dic[100] except KeyError: print("key not found in dictionary") #or handle the error more elegantly I haven't read the article, but you can learn more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling
