Solving L1-Minimization problem with [R]NN

I want to solve $$ \min \:\: \vert \vert x \vert \vert_1 \:\:\:\: s.t. \:\: Ax=y $$ using a Neural Network or Recurrent Neural Network. I found only this paper , but there $x$ has to be greater or equal zero. Do you know any other good papers, tutorials or other projects about how to solve this problem using a network?
