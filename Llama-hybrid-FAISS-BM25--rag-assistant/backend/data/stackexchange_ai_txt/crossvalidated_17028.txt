How to calculate quartiles with only standard deviation and mean assuming normal distribution?

I am trying to understand how, using only the standard deviation and mean, you are able to determine the first and third quartiles on a normal distribution. I get that the area under the curve equals one; I understand that Q1 accounts for 25% of the area, and Q3 75%; but I do not understand how to leverage this information to calculate (with my TI-89) where Q1 and Q3 are... I was able to reasonably estimate these values by looking at a z-score table for areas representing 25% and 75%, and I got z-scores of Â±0.68. However, I need a greater degree of accuracy than manually estimating from a table, but I do not know how to go about this formulaically or through my TI-89.
