Can anyone help me understand how to simulate fluids?

I'm trying to make a program that simulates the physics of fluids in Processing. In the IDE there's an included example: /** * Fluid * by Glen Murphy. * * Click and drag the mouse to move the simulated fluid. * Adjust the "res" variable below to change resolution. * Code has not been optimised, and will run fairly slowly. */ int res = 2; int penSize = 30; int lwidth; int lheight; int pnum = 30000; vsquare[][] v; vbuffer[][] vbuf; particle[] p = new particle[pnum]; int pcount = 0; int mouseXvel = 0; int mouseYvel = 0; void setup() { size(200, 200); noStroke(); frameRate(30); lwidth = width/res; lheight = height/res; v = new vsquare[lwidth+1][lheight+1]; vbuf = new vbuffer[lwidth+1][lheight+1]; for (int i = 0; i 0 && x 0 && y 0 && i 0 && u 0 && i 0 && u 255) col = 255; if (i>0 && i 0 && u It's not really commented and I'm somewhat new to programming, so I have no idea where to start as far as understanding it. Is there any good reading on fluid physics? I'm more interesting in the visual effect than the accuracy of the simulation.
