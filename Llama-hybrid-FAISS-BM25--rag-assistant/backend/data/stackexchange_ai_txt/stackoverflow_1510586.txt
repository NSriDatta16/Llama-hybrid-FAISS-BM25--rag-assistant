GhostDoc has a nice extra feature that infers a description of what the method does by parsing the method name and providing this as skeletal documentation. For example, using GhostDoc on a method named GetDocumentName() might return the phrase "Gets the document name". While this is hardly more information than provided by the method name, it adds method documentation where previously none existed. Some might argue that this is barely useful. I argue to the contrary because it supports generating documentation from the source code (e.g., for tools like NDoc or SandCastle). In my opinion the greatest benefit of GhostDoc over eclipse's "Generate Element Comment" is that it encourages programmers to begin adding documentation comments by adding an extremely fast and reliable way create this. The programmer can accept the inferred text, (suitable in 50 - 80% of cases), or expand on this for more complex methods. For the junior programmer who is not as familiar with how documentation comments are used, this can quickly shorten the learning curve and encourage good programming practices.
