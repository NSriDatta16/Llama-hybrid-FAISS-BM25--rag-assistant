Advice on code scanning / penetration testing tools

As far as I can see the offerings fall into two categories – scanning services such as McAfee, Comodo, etc. and tools such as Burp Proxy, HP’s WebInspect,CodeScan, etc. In an ideal world, I’d use something that actively scanned a certain URL (the target being a LAMP stack) on a daily basis (or as required if it’s a standalone tool), but I’m a bit wary of standalone tools in terms of their coverage and frequency of updating. (The ‘remote’ scanners such as McAfee are presumably updated as required.) I’ve also had issues with some standalone tools (can’t remember which one unfortunately) that managed to get themselves lost within our URL rewriting system (there’s a facetted search in play, so you can imagine things get fairly deep on the URL front). As such, I’m just wondering what experiences people have had with the offerings out there and whether the standalone tools stack up against the scanning services. (Incidentally, I'm aware of Penetration testing tools - I'm just wondering if the situation has changed since then)
