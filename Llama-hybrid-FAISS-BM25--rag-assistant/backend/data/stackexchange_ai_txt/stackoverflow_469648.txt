There are two generation schemes that are used (from Pragmatic Programmer ): Those that are used once to generate code Those that are used all the time to have some code synced The ones that are used for syncing, the results should not be modified, since they could be overridden at a later date when the generation gets done again. In the case of your generated asp.net database, there is no reason for you to rerun the generation, so it would be OK to edit it. The only scenario under which you would rerun the generation of the db is if microsoft releases a new version of the users database and you want to use the new one (in this case you might have to edit some parts of your application, so you could readd those two fields), or if you want to regenerate the database with different options. Both of these happen if you are not happy with your current db.
