FIPS-compliant Isolated Storage in WinXP?

I've read (but not tested) that Isolated Storage uses Sha1Managed, which is not FIPS-compliant? Is that accurate, and can anything be done to use Isolated Storage on a FIPS-compliant WinXP SP2 box? I've seen mention of "Isolated Storage" within both the ClickOnce and Silverlight spaces. I'd appreciate an informed answer regarding either (or both!).
