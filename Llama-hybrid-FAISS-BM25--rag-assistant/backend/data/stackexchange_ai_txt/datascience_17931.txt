Predict the date an item will be sold using machine learning

I would like to predict the date a item will be sold using features such as: Product ID Price Days_since_first_post Last_repost Type First_Post_Date Sold_Date How would machine learning principles be used in such a way to do this task? If so, what is the proper means by which to design such an algorithm? What would be the different steps which would be involved. More generally, what are the logical steps that should be taken when tackling a machine learning problem. Thank you
