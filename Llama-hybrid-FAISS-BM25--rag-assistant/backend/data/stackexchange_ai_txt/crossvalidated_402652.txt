Generate yearly time series

I've 5 years of historical hourly wind-speeds for a certain location available. What I need to do is to estimate the distribution of the yearly average wind speed. What method do I need such that I can generate, for instance, 1000 samples for which I can calculate the yearly average wind speed? Thanks in advance, Kind regards, Matthijs
