Most of your basic NLP parsing techniques will be able to extract the basic aspects of the sentence - i.e., that chicken and turkey a NPs and they are linked by and adjective 'like', etc. Getting these to a 'topic' or 'concept' is more difficult Technique such as Latent Semantic Analysis and its many derivatives transform this information into a vector (some have methods of retaining in some part the hierarchy/relations between parts of speech) and then compares them to existing, usually pre-classified by concept, vectors. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis to get started. Edit Here's an example LSA app you can play around with to see if you might want to pursue it further . http://lsi.research.telcordia.com/lsi/demos.html
