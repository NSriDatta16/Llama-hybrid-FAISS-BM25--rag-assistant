This issue arises when one wishes to estimate the proportion of variance explained by different parts of a mixed logistic model. Unlike standard linear models, there is a fundamental, fixed contribution to the total variance of the underlying latent variable in logistic regression, arising from the assumption of binomial sampling with logit link, of $\pi^2/3$ (approximately 3.29, the value used by the OP). This is a constant regardless of how many other contributions to the variance are being considered. Thus the overall scale of the variance changes at different levels of modeling, due to this fixed contribution to the variance, and there is ambiguity in what is meant by the proportion of variance explained. Hox et al * recommend scaling regression coefficients and variance components to overcome this problem. Quoting from page 137 (with $\sigma^2_F$ the "level 1 variance" from the fixed part of the model, $\sigma^2_{u0}$ the "level 2 variance" from random intercepts, and $\sigma^2_R$ the fixed variance from the logit link): For the null model, the total variance is $\sigma^2_0 = \sigma^2_{u0} + \sigma^2_R$ , with $\sigma^2_R$ â‰ˆ 3.29. For the model $m$ including the first-level predictor variables, the total variance is $\sigma^2_m = \sigma^2_F+ \sigma^2_{u0} + \sigma^2_R$ . Hence, we can calculate a scale correction factor that rescales the model m to the same underlying scale as the null model. The scale correction factor equals $\sigma_0/\sigma_m$ for the regression coefficients and $\sigma^2_0/\sigma^2_m$ for the variance components. Next, we can rescale both the regression coefficients and the variance estimates $\sigma^2_{u0}$ and $\sigma^2_R$ by the appropriate scale correction factor, which makes them comparable across models. The scale corrected variance estimates are useful for assessing the amount of variance explained separately at the different levels... In this context, the value of $\sigma^2_F$ would simply be the variance (on the logit scale) among the predicted values for the modeled data set based on the fixed effects alone, with random effects set to 0. In R, all you should need to do to get those predicted values is to use the predict function on the object returned by glmer together with the original data set, specifying that random effects are to be omitted (set re.form=NA ).
