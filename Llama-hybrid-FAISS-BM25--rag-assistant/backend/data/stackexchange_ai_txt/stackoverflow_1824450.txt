I don't know how best to deal with some of the more invasive changes you're describing, but... Use these options to git blame and git diff to filter: The -w option causes git to ignore changes in whitespace , so you can more easily see the real differences. The -M and -C options make it follow renames and copies ; in the case of git blame also moving and copying of fragments of code across files. See: explainshell.com - git diff -w -M -C
