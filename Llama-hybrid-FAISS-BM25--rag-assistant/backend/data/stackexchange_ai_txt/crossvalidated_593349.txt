Does mulligan matter?

I'm a TCG player, and in the game in question you work with a 50 card deck and with the limit of 4 copies of a single card, the game proceeds as follows: Draw 5 cards from your deck Decide if you like your hand or put the 5 cards into your deck again and shuffle, then draw 5 again. After steps 1 or steps 1&2 you add 5 cards from your deck to your life deck. With 40 cards left in your deck you draw 1 card each turn. So my questions are? How can I calculate the probability of 1 copy of an specific card being in the first 5 cards of my 40 card deck if I decide to mulligan my hand first?
