Try submitting the relevant comments, writeup, etc. via the "Send comments about this topic to Microsoft" link from a top-level CryptoAPI MSDN page (which just generates an email). EDIT: If you're a TechNet subscriber, you have two free incidents you can use to contact Microsoft about this. You'll also get guaranteed forum replies from Microsoft with a subscription. If you don't subscribe, you can pay some money for a one-time incident . Or, if you can phrase it as a Vista SP1 issue, you might be able to get some attention for free .
