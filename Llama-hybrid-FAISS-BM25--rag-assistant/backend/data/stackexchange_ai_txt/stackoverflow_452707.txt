Quick and acceptable MP3 streaming solution

I have to do a job overnight to enable a very simple interface for users listening to a radio channel over the internet. I am wondering what is the best soluition for streaming. I thought of QuickTime, but it requires users to have it installed and I am not quite sure Quicktime is as spread as flash. So I tend to implement something in flash. Do you have any suggestions on a good tool (it may be really simple, the simpler, the better)? I don't want playlists and nothing like that. The website is built with DotNetNuke and it manages all the interactions. I just want to insert in the page that little bar that allows users to play/pause and drag to another part of the show. I will pass a parameter with the file URL and the player should manage the rest. It won't be a live streaming, but rather streaming of MP3 files hosted in the server. By the way, I found this project ( http://www.sean-o.com/jquery/jmp3/ ) which is a jQuery plugin and it seems interesting. Does any one know it? Thanks a lot.
