I am clueless about the difference coming both the implementation yet, but found how to find a decision boundary for the problem. At First step I scaled the data to a range [0,100] which earlier was [0,1] for the input. (Still do not know why scaling creates a difference) And then used a RBF kernal with low gamma and high C value. svc = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma=.004, C=1000). This gives me the following result.
