Is ngen used to compile .NET code into an binary that will not require .NET framework to be installed when running the code?

I read the following paragraph on Wikipedia article about the CLR: Alternatively, the CIL code can be compiled to native code in a separate step prior to runtime by using the Native Image Generator (NGEN). This speeds up all later runs of the software as the CIL-to-native compilation is no longer necessary. Does this mean that I can take any .NET program and compile it to a binary that will then be able to run on machine that doesnt have the .NET framework installed?
