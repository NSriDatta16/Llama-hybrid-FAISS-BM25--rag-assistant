Building independence maps (I-maps) from data

I am just getting into Bayesian networks, and I am having a hard time understanding how this algorithm works: http://pgm.stanford.edu/Algs/page-79.pdf (The algorithm is from Probabilistic Graphical Models by Koller and Friedman. I couldn't find an online pdf version, and reluctant to buy the book from amazon just yet...) I am especially lost on lines 4 and 5 of the algorithm: In line 4, how do I pick the subset U'? (I guess this is also a question of how to search this variable space) If i assume to just remove one variable at a time, would that work? Since I am not looking for a P-map but just a potential set of I-maps? This is probably a very silly question, but I don't really understand how I determine the independence in line 5. Especially assuming this is strictly derived from some data with no real known network structure. I think I have seen a similar idea in some other places also as: As long as the following holds true, $$ P(X_i|\{X_1, ... , X_{i-1}\}) = P(X_i|U') $$ keep dropping variables from U'. However, I am not quite sure how to test this? Some suggest to use chi-squared if the variables are binary. And for the sake of simplicity let's say that is the case. But I don't understand how these probability distributions can then be compared in this way, given the lengths wouldn't match? Let's say I have 4 binary variables: $\{A, B, C, D\}$ , how would I determine line 5 for $ (B \perp \{A, C, D\}\ âˆ’\ \{A,C\}\ |\ \{A,C\}) \in I$ ? Thanks in advance for any help or other reference suggestions.
