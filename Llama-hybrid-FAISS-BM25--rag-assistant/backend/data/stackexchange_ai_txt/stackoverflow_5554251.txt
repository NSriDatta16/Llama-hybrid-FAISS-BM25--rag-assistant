Is it possible to leverage WPF property system in a server application?

We have legacy code which consists of business objects with over a hundred properties and a couple of layers in hierarchy. Our goal is to translate it into a C# server application which will be invoked with WCF. WPF property system however seems to be a good tool to employ because it is more efficient and some other bonus features like property inheritance which would be useful for our library. However, I am not aware whether it would be feasible to use it in a non-WPF application. Could someone please tell if it would work, and if there are example projects of using in non-WPF applications?
