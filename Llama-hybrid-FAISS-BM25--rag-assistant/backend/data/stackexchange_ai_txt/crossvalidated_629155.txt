"Decade" variable ranging over 130 years - Can I treat this as continuous? I've seen it done with 8pt scales...but it doesn't past the smell test

My dataset includes "decade founded" but not "year founded" for organizations. I need to include some "maturity" variable in the model. Decade is the best I have. The span is 130 years, so over a dozen categories. How do I treat decade ? I've enjoyed trying to find an answer. I now know a lot more about year variables and their treatments. But I can't find a good answer for decade . A colleague said I should just treat decade as continuous, because it has "enough" categories. I need a better rationale behind any approach I take. I'm a stickler for knowing "why" ;)
