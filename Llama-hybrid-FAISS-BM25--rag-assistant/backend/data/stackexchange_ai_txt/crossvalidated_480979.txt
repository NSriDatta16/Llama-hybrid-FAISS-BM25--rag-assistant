When there are three competing hypotheses $w_1, w_2, w_3$ that are assumed to be equally likely to be true, then the Bayesian decision rule: decide in favor of the hypothesis which has the maximum a posteriori probability $$p(w_i\mid x) = \frac{p(x\mid w_i)p(w_i)}{p(x)}\tag{1},$$ is the same as the frequentist decision rule: decide in favor of the hypothesis for which $p(x\mid w_i)$ is largest. Note that on the right side of $(1)$ , $p(w_i) = \frac 13$ for $i=1,2,3$ while $p(x)$ is the same regardless of whether $i$ equals $1, 2$ or $3$ . So, instead of laboriously calculating the right side of $(1)$ and comparing $p(w_1\mid x), p(w_2\mid x), p(w_3\mid x)$ to see which is the largest, the canny Bayesian can just skip all that and just compare $p(x\mid w_1), p(x\mid w_2), p(x\mid w_)3$ and thus arrive at the same decision and by the same calculation as if he were a avowed frequentist. If the three hypotheses are not assumed to be equally likely to be true, the canny Bayesian can look at $(1)$ and choose to just compute $p(x\mid w_1)p(w_1)$ , $p(x\mid w_2)p(w_2)$ , and $p(x\mid w_3)p(w_3)$ and choose the largest; no need to compute $p(x)$ and divide each $p(x\mid w_i)p(w_i)$ by $p(x)$ before choosing the largest.
