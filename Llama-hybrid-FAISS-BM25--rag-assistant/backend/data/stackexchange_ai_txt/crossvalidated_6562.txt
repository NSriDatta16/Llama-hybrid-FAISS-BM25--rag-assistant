Collapsing categorical data easily for regression in R

I have read an article from Christopher Manning, and saw an interesting code for collapsing categorical variable in an logistic regression model: glm(ced.del ~ cat + follows + I(class == 1), family=binomial("logit")) Does the I(class == 1) means that the class variable has been recoded into either it is 1 or it is not 1 ? After that, I am thinking of modifying it a bit: glm(ced.del ~ cat + follows + I(class %in% C(1,2)), family=binomial("logit")) I am planning to merge the variable class from c(1,2,3,4) into two groups, one group contains c(1,2) , another group contains c(3,4) , can the code above give me the result I want?
