Without seeing your code, it's hard to tell, but I suspect that you are attempting to write tests at too high a level. You might want to think about breaking your methods down into smaller components that are deterministic and testing these. Then test the methods that use these methods by providing mock implementations that return predictable values from the underlying methods (which are probably located on a different object). Then you can write tests that cover the domain of the various methods, ensuring that you have coverage of the full range of possible outcomes. For the small methods you do so by providing values that represent the domain of inputs. For the methods that depend on these, by providing mock implementations that return the range of outcomes from the dependencies.
