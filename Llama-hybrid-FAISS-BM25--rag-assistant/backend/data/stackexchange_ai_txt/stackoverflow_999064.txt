How to keep public and private versions of a git repo in sync?

I'm releasing an open-source Rails app on Github (probably MIT license). I also want to maintain a private branch/fork of the project that we will use as part of a pay service. What is the best way to organize the repo(s) in this scenario? And, how can I keep the projects in sync when I have updates that should go to both?
