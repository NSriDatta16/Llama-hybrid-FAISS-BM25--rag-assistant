How to organize common schemas referenced by multiple biztalk applications in a same group?

I have a situation were I need to reference a schema in two different BizTalk applications. I could either: Put the schema in one application and make the other applications have a reference to it. OR Put the schema in a common application and all other applications have a reference to this common application. However, in both the above cases if there are any changes to the schema I end up having to rebuild/redeploy all the applications having a reference to the schemal. Is there a better way of organizing the applications?
