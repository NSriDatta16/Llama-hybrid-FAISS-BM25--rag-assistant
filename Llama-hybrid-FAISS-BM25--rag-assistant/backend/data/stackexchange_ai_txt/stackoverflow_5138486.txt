You're best bet is Berkeley DB , via the C# API (which uses key-value pair storage). Berkeley DB is a library, so it links into your application. There is no separate server to install and no client/server overhead. Berkeley DB is extremely fast, scalable and reliable and is designed to do exactly what you describe here. Disclaimer: I'm the Product Manager for Berkeley DB, so I'm a little biased. But I'm serious when I say that this is exactly the scenario that Berkeley DB is designed for.
