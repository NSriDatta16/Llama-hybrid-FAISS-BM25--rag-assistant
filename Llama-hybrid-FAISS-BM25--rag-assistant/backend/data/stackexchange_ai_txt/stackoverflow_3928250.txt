You are probably not sending the request exactly as the website expects it. I would do the following: 1) use firefox. 2) install firebug plugin 3) use firefox to execute your scenario. 4) Look at the actual requests sent from firefox (use the firebug plugin for that) 5) Now, duplicate the exact same requests, down to the user-agent,cookies and request headers in code. 6) profit?
