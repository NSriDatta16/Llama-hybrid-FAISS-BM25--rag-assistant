SQL 2008 introduced a switch for DTExec that allows you to run the packages in 32 bit mode using the native SQL Agent task for SSIS. On the execution tab of the job step properties there is a check box for 32 bit, which translates to the "/X86" switch when looking at the command line view. If you are stuck using SQL 2005 then the CMDEXEC option is the only one I know of.
