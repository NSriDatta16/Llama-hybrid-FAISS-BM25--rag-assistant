Suppose we know $\mu_X<\mu_Y$. How can that information be used to improve estimates of the mean of $X$ and $Y$

Suppose there are two distributions which we know nothing about except that the mean of second is greater than the first and each can be sampled. Intuitively, the estimate of both means should be able to be improved upon with this knowledge. For example if $X_i\sim N(a,1)$ and $Y_j\sim N(b,1)$ all i.i.d then one might consider the sample means. But given $a , if the sample means have instead $\hat a> \hat b$ , then one could imagine revising the means towards each other would not just be better, but would be necessary. I suspect the answer of how to revise these estimates specifically would be using some bayesian parameter estimation. Still it's not clear to me how. More generally I suppose this problem could be studied with stochastic ordering, not just mean. That is, if we know there is some stochastic ordering of random variables and can sample from any of them, we should be able to extract some information about any of them from a sample from any of them.
