I commented out some lines and build some heavy for-loops around certain code fragments to isolate and find the problem. It turned out that I have deleted a line in a smaller method which was supposed to clear up after the computation: CGImageRelease(result); So when generating a new image, the old result got leaked. I wonder why Clang or Instuments didn't find this leak. But thanks for your help!
