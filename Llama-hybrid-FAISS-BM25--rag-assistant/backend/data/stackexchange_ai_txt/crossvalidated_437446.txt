Deutsch and Journel (1997, pp. 16-17) opined on the misleading nature of the term "non-parametric". They suggested that ≪...the terminology "parameter-rich" model should be retained for indicator based models instead of the traditional but misleading qualifier "non-parametric".≫ "Parameter rich" may be an accurate description, but "rich" has an emotional loading that lends a positive view which may not always be warranted (!). Some professors may yet persist who refer collectively to neural nets, random forests, and the like as all being "non-parametric". The increased opacity and piecewise nature of neural nets (especially with the spread of ReLU activation functions) makes them non-parameteric- esque .
