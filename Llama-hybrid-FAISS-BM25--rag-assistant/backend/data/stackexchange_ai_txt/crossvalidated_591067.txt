The answer is yes. One can use sequence or timeseries generated by PCA for fault classification in transmission lines. Here is the story. I generated a fault sample in Simulink/MATLAB, saved data to workspace and exported to Microsoft Excel (6 columns matrix). The length of any column is the fault duration which may be added a separate column in the matrix but I did not. Then standardized, scaled data and PCA. PC1-PC6 were six principle components of the original matrix. Plotted the first PC1 which had waveform like the original one. All features were shown by the first two PCs.
