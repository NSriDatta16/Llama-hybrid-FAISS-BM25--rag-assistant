Saving an Array to a Text file in Java

I'm trying to print the values of an int array to a local file. However, I can't seem to find a way to print the integers out in their standard form ( 1,2,3 ) instead of a heap address: ( [I@1befab0 ) My code fragment is below: PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter("file"); for (int i=0; i What could I be doing wrong?
