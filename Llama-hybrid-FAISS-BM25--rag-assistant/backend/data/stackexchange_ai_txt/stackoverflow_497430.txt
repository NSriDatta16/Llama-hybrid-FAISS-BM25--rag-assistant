If you can't use a CheckBoxList, you'll have to handle the values manually. You can manually .Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(" ")) between them, but that's a bit on the tacky side. You could use a DataGrid with a TemplateColumn to hack your way into it, but that's not elegant. Why does this need to be in a list? Doesn't the CheckBoxList provide the functionality you require? Also, try myCheckBox.Parent.Controls.FindControl("MyHiddenField").Value . How do I access the Category id from the hidden field control in the parent repeater so I can look up the correct RSS Feeds?
