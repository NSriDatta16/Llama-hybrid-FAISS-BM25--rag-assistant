Try using the free Hyper SIGAR API. It is a cross platform API for calling system information. It uses JNI for Windows/Linux/Unix/Mac/etc. http://www.hyperic.com/products/sigar I wrote a JNLP task manager/information monitor with it and it's a decent API. http://www.goliathdesigns.com/2009/12/sixth-post/ Source code: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sysinfomonitor/
