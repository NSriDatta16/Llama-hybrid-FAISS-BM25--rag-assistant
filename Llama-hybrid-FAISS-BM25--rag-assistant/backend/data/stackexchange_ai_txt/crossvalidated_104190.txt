I used "Engineering Statistics" by Montgomery and Runger. It's pretty good (especially if you have a strong math background). I'd also highly recommend checking out CalTech's online Machine Learning course. It's great for an introduction to ML Concepts (if that's part of your data analysis). https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html .
