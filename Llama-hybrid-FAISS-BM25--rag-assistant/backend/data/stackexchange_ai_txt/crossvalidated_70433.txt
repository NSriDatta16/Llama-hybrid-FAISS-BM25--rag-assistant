Moving average ARIMA error term

Lets say that I have a time series data $Y_{t}$. I'm trying to forecast using am moving average MA(1) model using Box Jenkins methodology. The following is the equation for an MA(1) obtained from a textbook. $$ Y_{t} = \theta_{0} + e_{t} + \theta_{1} e_{t-1} $$ I assume we would use some type of nonlinear optimization to estimate coefficients $\theta_{0}$ and $\theta_{1}$ via maximum likelihood or conditional least squares. My question is about the very first error term $e$ when $t = 1$. Does the very first error term $e_{1}$ is also automatically determined by the optimization ? What would be the value for $e_{0}$ ? Thanks so much
