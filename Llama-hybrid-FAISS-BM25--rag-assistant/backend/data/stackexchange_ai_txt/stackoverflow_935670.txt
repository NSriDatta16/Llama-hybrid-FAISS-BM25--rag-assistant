Render HTML table on Windows Mobile 6.0

I am trying to render a HTML table to display on Windows Mobile 6.0 device. I use Mobile Device Emulator to view the output. Here is my html, am I missing something? The table display each cell on it own row. Test Blah12 Row 1, Col 1 Row 1, Col 2 Row 2, Col 1 Row 2, Col 2 @DanHerbert's answer is user can switch the browser on the phone to "Desktop" mode. The second part of this question is there a meta tag to instruct the mobile to use "Desktop" mode instead of "Column" mode?
