I don't really think you'll find anything that's been superceded by SOA. You will find that there's been progress in organizing computer programs to take advantage of the SOA type principles. As for programming models that have been in reasonably common use, well, let's see... CORBA , RPC , more generic client-server applications. Of course, computer-to-computer communications were preceded by process-to-process communication using a wide variety of conventions. SOA as a philosophy of breaking large problems into smaller ones and then composing the results has been known and applied since humans started making bricks instead of building complete walls. Of course, that was mostly implicit. Explicit statements for SOA really started to come about with CORBA and, while SOA is independent of Web Services, the advent of HTTP and XML, and then SOAP, really started to make development of non-specialized "services" easier, more worthwhile and thus common.
