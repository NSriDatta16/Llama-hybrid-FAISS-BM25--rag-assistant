Essentially, since you assume no noise on the curve, there will be no additional information on $(a,b)$ from additional observations of $(x,y)$ , since all information is already captured in the first observation. You could say that, even with data $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ , $(y_1, \dots, y_n)$ , just the observation $(x_1, y_1)$ is a sufficient statistic for this model. You can see it in your example: $abc^2 = y_1/x_1$ gives a condition on $a b c^2$ given a single observation and more data will not help to gain further information. In practice if $y$ is a measurement value it makes more sense that there is some noise and then again a Bayesian approach might be suitable to understand the posterior uncertainty in $a$ conditional on the data and a suitable prior on $b$ and $c$ .
