As explained in this document, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9988/59d48216848def1c97db875d6f923aa257a6.pdf , if the number of trials n is low, you should at least have larger values of the number of observations N. One way to go about your problem would be to analyze the data on your R variable separately from the data on your D variable. For each variable, you can use the N corresponding proportions of successes k/n as a basis for conducting a binomial logistic regression with condition as a predictor variable. This will help you estimate the probability of success p in a single trial under each condition, separately for each variable. Let's say you have two conditions only: C1 and C2. The above strategy will give you the estimated probability values phat(R, C1) and phat(R, C2) for the variable R, along with estimated probability values phat(D, C1) and phat(D, C2) for the variable R. You can now construct the ratio phat(R,C1)/phat(D,C1) and use it to estimate the true ratio p(R,C1)/p(D,C1). Similarly, you can construct the ratio phat(R,C2)/phat(D,C2) and use it to estimate the true ratio p(R,C2)/p(D,C2). Recall that p(R,C1) represents the (true) probability of success in a trial corresponding to the variable R under condition C1, etc. You can then use bootstrapping to compute percentile confidence intervals for each of the two true ratios. If the confidence intervals exclude the value 1 for both conditions, that will suggest evidence of a difference between R and D at each condition. (With more than two conditions, you may need to do some multiplicity adjustments to your confidence intervals.) You may need to log transform the ratio first, then do bootstrapping and look at whether the resulting confidence interval excludes 0. Of course, there is a problem with this approach if the variables R and D are correlated. See here, for example, for some references on how you might handle correlation between R and D in your modeling: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2798811/ . As always with research, you can start small and build from there.
