Optimistic locking batch update

How to use optimistic locking with batch updates? I am using SimpleJdbcTemplate and for a single row I can build update sql that increments version column value and includes version in WHERE clause. Unfortunately the result int[] updated = simpleJdbcTemplate.batchUpdate does not contain rowcounts when using oracle driver. All elements are -2 indicating unknown rowcount. Is there some other, more performant way of doing this than executing all updates individually? These batches contain an average of 5 items (only) but may be up to 250.
