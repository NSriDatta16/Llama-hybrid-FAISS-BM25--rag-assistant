Which are outliers?

I am in the process of solving a Machine Learning challenge, and I want to do it the right way. I did some exploratory data analysisand I wanted to check the distribution of the data. As displayed in the figure below, the box plots of each of the numerical continuous dataset features. According to my understanding, several features do contain outliers, but after reading some articles, I encountered cases where outliers are mistaken for a Pareto distribution, and removing them leads to information loss. Could you please explain which contain and which do not contain outliers?
