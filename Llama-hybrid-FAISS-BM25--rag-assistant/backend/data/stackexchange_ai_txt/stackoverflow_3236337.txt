The difference is the environment in which you use them: in JavaScript, the DOM you are manipulating is on the client-side - the browser that has loaded the HTML page you are looking at. If you are manipulating a document using the DOM API in PHP, you are doing that that to a document on the server-side. It seems confusing because the DOM is used in both. This is done just for convenience: PHP implements the DOM commands simply so that one can easily write the same kind of code in PHP as in JavaScript. You cannot use the DOM API support in PHP to manipulate the browser DOM. (There's an analogy with the local storage APIs here: now that the browsers have local storage APIs, you can use SQL in the browser to store things in the local database - but just because you are writing SQL in the client-side code and in the server-side code doesn't mean they are operating on the same data.)
