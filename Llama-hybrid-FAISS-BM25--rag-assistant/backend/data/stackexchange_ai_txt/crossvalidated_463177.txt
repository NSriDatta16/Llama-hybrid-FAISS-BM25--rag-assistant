Consider to build the generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in SPSS. Since it was aforementioned that the data were "FLAT," before running the GLMM procedure, we have to use VARSTOCASES to convert the data to a long format. Here is an example you can refer to. https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLVMB_23.0.0/spss/base/syn_varstocases_examples.html Analyze -> Mixed Models -> Generalized Linear... Select a variable to denote the Subjects, and "Course grades or Grade Point Average" to be the Repeated Measures. Then you can move on to the other settings. Make sure you toggle "Binary logistic regression." I think you may also want to go to Model Options/Save Fields, and check "Predicted values" and "Predicted probability for categorical targets." Based on your Example, as far as I can understand, you may need to build different models by including different number of levels in the repeated measure, and predict the probability for each model.
