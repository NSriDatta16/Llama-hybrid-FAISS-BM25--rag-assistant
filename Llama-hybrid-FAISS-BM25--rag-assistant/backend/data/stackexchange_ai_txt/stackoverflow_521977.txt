Is it possible to change headers order using HttpWebRequest?

I need to change the order of headers, I'm using this: HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(URL); request.Method = context.Request.HttpMethod; request.UserAgent = context.Request.UserAgent; The output for that is: GET /* HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: My Server Host: 127.0.0.1:1080 But it should be GET /* HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:1080 User-Agent: My Server Any ideas? Thanks for your time. EDIT: Maybe there's a way using other object ... it's also an option
