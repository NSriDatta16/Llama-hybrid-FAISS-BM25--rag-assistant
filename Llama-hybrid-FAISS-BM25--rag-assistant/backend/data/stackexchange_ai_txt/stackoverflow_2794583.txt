android SQLite vs Flat Files

im creating a game right now and im a bit stuck on how to implement storage of levels. i need to be able to download level files from the internet ota. im not so familiar with transferring files ota, but i have some experience with databases ( mysql ). what would be a better way of storing the game's level data?
