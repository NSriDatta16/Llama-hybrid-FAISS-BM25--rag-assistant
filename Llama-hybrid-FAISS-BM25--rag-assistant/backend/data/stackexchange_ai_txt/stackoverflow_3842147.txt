You could use scrollTo to achieve this. The difficult part is that the hash needs to be persisted across from the HTTP request to the HTTP response - this could be done using a cookie or possibly local storage (HTML 5) , if supported by the browser. I would probably handle it by checking if JavaScript is enabled, preventing the default anchor behaviour checking the href for a hash value. If one exists, persist the value in the storage of choice. If one doesn't exist, it would probably be a good idea to clear the stored value as we don't want to try and scroll to something when the requested page loads. upon loading the next page, check the value in storage and use the scrollTo plugin to scroll to the element.
