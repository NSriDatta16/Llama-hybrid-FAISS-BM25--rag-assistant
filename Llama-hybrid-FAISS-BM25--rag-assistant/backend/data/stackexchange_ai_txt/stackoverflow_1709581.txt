Whilst using drag and drop, can I cause a Treeview to Expand the node over which the user hovers?

In brief: Is there any built-in function in .Net 2.0 to Expand TreeNode s when hovered over whilst a drag and drop operation is in progress? I'm using C# in Visual Studio 2005. In more detail: I've populated a Treeview control with a multi levelled, multinoded tree (think organisational chart or file/folder dialog) and I want to use drag and drop to move nodes within the tree. The drag drop code works well, and I can drop onto any visible node, however I would like my control to behave like Windows Explorer does when dragging files over the folder pane. Specifically, I'd like each folder to open if hovered over for 1/2 second or so. I've begun developing a solution using Threading and a Sleep method but I'm running into problems and wondered if there was something in place already, if not I will knuckle down and learn how to use threading (it's about time, but I was hoping to get this app out quickly) Do I need to write my own code to handle Expanding a TreeNode when hovered over in drag-drop mode?
