Looking at BIC's formula $$ BIC = -2 \log\left(\sup_\theta f(x\mid\theta)\right) + k \, \log n $$ you will see that there is no trace of the prior $\pi(\theta)$ on it. That's because the derivation of the BIC by Schwarz is based on an asymptotic result under which his prior (a formal prior which puts mass on subspaces of the parameter space) is "washed out". So, to argue that the BIC is truly Bayesian ammounts to saying that it is possible to do Bayesian inference without any priors (not even improper/default/reference/whatever priors). The question is if, in certain cases, we may see the BIC as an (useful) approximation, in some sense, of a full Bayesian criterion. Schwarz original paper is very short and worth reading.
