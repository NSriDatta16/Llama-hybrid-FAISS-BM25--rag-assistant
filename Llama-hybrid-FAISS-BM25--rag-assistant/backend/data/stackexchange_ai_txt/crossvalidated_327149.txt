Prior comparison: Uninformative vs informative

I have a question about prior choice that has arisen from some analysis I have been doing. I don't think the particular details of the model are necessary for this question, but my Bayesian knowledge is relatively limited so apologies if I have omitted something crucial. I have run a model twice, once with a relatively uninformative prior, and one with a more informative prior. Both times the priors are exponential. The likelihood for the uninformed model is higher than for the more informed model. Is it appropriate to infer from this that the informed prior is a poor choice? EDIT Here are the MCMC chains from the two different analyses 1) Prior with exp(1) 2) Prior with exp(10) I do think something strange is going on in both of these, but I don't know why they aren't in the same likelihood space.
