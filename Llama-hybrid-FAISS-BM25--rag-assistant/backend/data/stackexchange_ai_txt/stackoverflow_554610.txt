Check out the jQuery live event. When you bind a "live" event it will bind to all current and future elements on the page (using event delegation). For example if you bound a live click to all "li" elements on the page then added another li at a later time - that click event would continue to work for the new element (this is not the case with bind which must be re-bound on all new elements). Example: $("p").live("click", function(){ $(this).after(" Another paragraph! "); });
