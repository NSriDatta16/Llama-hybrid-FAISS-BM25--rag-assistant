svn stat says folder uncontrolled, but won't let me svn add it!

Running into a weird problem with svm. I do svn stat in my controlled directory, lists something like: ? myproject/foo ? myproject/zoo so I do: svn add myproject/zoo and then I get this message back: svn: warning: 'myproject/zoo' is already under version control I don't get it, why is it showing it as uncontrolled then? I tried running svn cleanup, svn update, nothing though. I am also looking at my svn project in tracker, and I don't see the /zoo folder as present. What can I do to convince svn it's not really added? Thanks
