I think you're better off using a CASE statement for each possible value of the unit column, since it is a finite universe. You can choose whether to keep the column as a varchar, or use an integer code instead. I would discourage use of dynamically executing SQL statements, even when generated from an existing table unless you are 120% careful in restricting the values that get inserted in the table. What would you do if you somehow got the following values in the table? Oops! +------------+------+------------------------------------+ | date |value | unit | +------------+------+------------------------------------+ | 2009-01-01 | 2 | DAY | | 2009-02-01 | 3 | MONTH | | 2009-03-01 | 4 | DAY) FROM table; DROP TABLE table; | +------------+------+------------------------------------+
