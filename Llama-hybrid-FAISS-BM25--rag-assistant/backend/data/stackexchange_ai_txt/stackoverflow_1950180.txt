It isn't pretty but I found this in the Qt mailing list archives : The sleep method of QThread is protected, but you can expose it like so: class SleeperThread : public QThread { public: static void msleep(unsigned long msecs) { QThread::msleep(msecs); } }; Then just call: SleeperThread::msleep(1000); from any thread. However, a more elegant solution would be to refactor your code to use a QTimer - this might require you saving the state so you know what to do when the timer goes off.
