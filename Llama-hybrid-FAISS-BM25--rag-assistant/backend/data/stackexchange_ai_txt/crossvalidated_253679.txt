You can read a nice description of PCA here . The advantage of PCA (one method of dimension reduction) in the context of ML (ie. neural networks) would be to reduce the risk of over fitting and reduce computational complexity. You could also phrase your question as: what are the alternatives to PCA? For PCA vs Partial Least Squares, see this Cross Validated post For PCA vs random subspace projection see this Cross Validated post
