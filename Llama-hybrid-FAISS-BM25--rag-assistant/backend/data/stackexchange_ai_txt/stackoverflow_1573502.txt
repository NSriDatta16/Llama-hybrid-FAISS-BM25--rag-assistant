http://tineye.com/ may be useful if you're just comparing your own images. You should probably do some research on image similarity algorithms, though anything advanced isn't going to suit a scripting language like PHP. The most simple comparison method would work like this: Make both images the same size if they are not already. Compare each corresponding pixel and decide how similar they are. Simplest method is to take the difference between the red values, then the blue values, then the green values, and average them. Take the average difference from all the pixels. If it's below some threshold you decide, then the images are the same or similar. You'd need to test with various images to decide on a threshold. I'm not totally familiar with ImageMagick and PHP's image functions so not sure if you can do all of this.
