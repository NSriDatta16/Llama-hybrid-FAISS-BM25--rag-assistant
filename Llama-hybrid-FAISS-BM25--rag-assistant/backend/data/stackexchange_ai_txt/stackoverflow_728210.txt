After seeing multiple requests from an odd non-browser User-Agent string, it's possible that they are blocking users not being referred to from the site. For example, PHP has a feature called $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERRER'] IIRC, which will check the page which reffered the user to the current one. Since your program is not including one in the User-Agent string (you are trying to directly access it) it is very possible they are preventing you access based upon that. Try adding a referrer into the headers of your http request and see how it goes. (preferably a page which links to the one you're trying to access) http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ can assist you in building your spoofed user agent. you then build headers like so... headers = {"Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "Accept": "text/plain"} and then send them as an additional parameter with your HTTPConnection request... conn.request("POST", "/page/on/site", params, headers) see the python doc on httplib for further reference and examples.
