Does Cohen's Kappa sample size calculation need a check for "true kappa" feasibility?

The sample size computation require(irr) N.cohen.kappa(rate1 = 0.9, rate2 = 0.5, k1 = 0.7, k0 = 0.5, alpha=0.05, power=0.8, twosided=FALSE) successfully runs and gives a result ... but shouldn't it fail with some kind of warning? Consider the pattern of missing values in Table 1 and the second sentence of the left-bottom paragraph of the second page here , which reflect an upper bound for Kappa when rate1 is not the same as rate2. For example, Kappa must be less than 0.2 if rate1 = 0.9 and rate2 = 0.5, right? So shouldn't the function fail when I use those two rates with k1 $ = 0.7$, since that "true kappa" is not feasible?
