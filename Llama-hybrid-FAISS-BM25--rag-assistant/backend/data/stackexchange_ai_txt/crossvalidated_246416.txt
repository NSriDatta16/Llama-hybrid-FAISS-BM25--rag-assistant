While you need an explicit form to run a nonlinear regression, why do you need nonlinear regression rather than something else? For example, why not fit a nonparametric model of the relationship between y and x? (e.g. spline smoothing, local linear regression/LOESS, or local-mean nonparametric regression like Nadaraya-Watson etc etc) I'd also suggest you consider that as a proportion approaches 1 or 0 the standard error must tend to become smaller than when it's near the middle because it can't go outside the 0-1 bounds. It may make more sense to work on a transformed scale, whether using a variance-stabilizing transform or (perhaps better) by using a model for the data that takes account of the fat that the response is a proportion. Do you know the denominators for the proportion of males for each point, at least approximately? Here I fitted a smooth curve (lowess rather than LOESS though the differences aren't that major, and I chose that simply because I could remember the arguments) on the arcsin-sqrt scale then transformed the fit back. Because the variation from linearity was small for most of the range I used a large fraction (5/6) in the width parameter ($f$): However by the look of it I could probably have gone higher. (If you're wedded to a nonlinear fit, his suggests a broken line or bent cable fit might be visually pleasing, but if you just need a fitted curve some nonparametric fit should be fine) It would likely have made little difference if I'd directly calculated a lowess smooth on the original proportions (i.e. ignoring the fact that the ones near 1 will have smaller uncertainties). Note that in the absence of information at the time of calculation, I pretended the denominators of the proportions were all similar here. Given the possibility of getting denominators on the proportions, a GAM based on logistic regression might be highly suitable. You'd certainly avoid the issue of predicting proportions outside [0,1] as in your plot.
