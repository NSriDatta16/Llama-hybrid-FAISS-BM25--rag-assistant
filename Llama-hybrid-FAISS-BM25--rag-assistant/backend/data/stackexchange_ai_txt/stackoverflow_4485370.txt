Good question. Microsoft Azure is attempting to address this by allowing you to put applications "in the cloud" and not have to be as concerned with scalability up/down, redundancy, data storage, etc. But this is not accomplished at the hypervisor level. http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/ Hardware-wise, there are some downsides to having everything be one big VM rather than many smaller ones. For one thing, software doesn't always understand how to handle all the resources. For example, some applications still can't handle multiple processor cores. I've seen informal benchmarks showing that IIS performs better spreading the same resources over multiple instances rather than one giant instance. From a management perspective, it is probably better to have multiple VMs in certain cases. Imagine that a bad deployment corrupts a node. If that were your one and only (albeit giant) node, now your whole application is down.
