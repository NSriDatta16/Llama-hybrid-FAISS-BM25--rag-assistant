I've been trying to accomplish the same thing, with exactly the same problem - the "forms-authenticated-me" is not the same as the "windows-authenticated-me" to sharepoint, and I can't see how to map the two. After a lot of frustrating efforts, I think I've finally realized it's not possible. In retrospect, this isn't too surprising. here's an excerpt from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb975136.aspx (my emphasis added)... Deciding to Use Forms Authentication Some organizations want to use Windows users and groups in SharePoint Products and Technologies, but enter credentials via forms authentication. Before using forms authentication, determine why to use forms authentication in the first place: What is the business driver? If user accounts are stored in a location other than an Active Directory domain controller, or if Active Directory is not available in a particular environment, using forms authentication with a membership provider is a good choice. But if you want to force logon only via forms authentication, but still use Windows and all of the integrated features it provides, you should consider an alternative such as publishing the SharePoint site with Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2006. ISA Server 2006 allows users to log on by using a forms authentication Web form, but treats them like Windows users after authentication. This implementation provides a more consistent and compelling experience for end users.
