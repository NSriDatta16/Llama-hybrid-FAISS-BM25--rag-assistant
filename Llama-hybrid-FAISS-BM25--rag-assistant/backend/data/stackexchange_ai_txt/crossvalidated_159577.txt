I would suggest to look on Mixed Effects Logistic Regression . I believe it's a common way to approach this question. The idea is that the probability of having a positive read : - Is influenced by the population (fixed effects) - Get noised by random effects. The most obvious one is at the scale of the individual : Some people would have a tendency to get more positive read than others, even if they are in the same population. Your goal is to assess the significativity of your fixed effects. In r you would end up with something like m The first term ($Population$) is the fixed effects, the second term ($(1 | Individual)$) is a random intercept grouped by individual which explains the disparity between individuals by a random effect. Disclaimer : I am currently a noob in Mixed Effects Logistic Regression. However I feel it's a legitimate way to address the problem. Maybe the specification of the random effects is incomplete, I picked the simplest form but I do not know if more sophisticated random effects could be specified here.
