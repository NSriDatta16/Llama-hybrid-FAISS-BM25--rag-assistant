How about making anyone who changes a component's interface also responsible for making sure that all components depending on it also still work, i.e. a single commit contains the API change, the implementation change and the changes required to make all other components build against the new version. This encourages thinking long and hard about incompatible API changes, and also leads to explicit conflicts in the version control when committing a component that would no longer compile. Depending on your internal policy, you can also make it acceptable to introduce new APIs and at the same time mark the old version as deprecated while still leaving the functionality intact; however I find that to be somewhat impolite towards your fellow developers.
