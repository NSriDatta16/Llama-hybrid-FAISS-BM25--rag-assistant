What does the number after a machine learning model name mean?

I'm not sure if this is off-topic, but I'm posting here anyway. So I saw lots of machine learning models have like an ID after their names, for example, resnet101 , resnet152 , densenet201 etc. What exactly do those numbers 101 , 152 and 201 mean? And how it's determined?
