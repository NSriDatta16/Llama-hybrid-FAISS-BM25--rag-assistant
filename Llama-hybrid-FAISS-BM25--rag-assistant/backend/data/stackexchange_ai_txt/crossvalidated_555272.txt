How to understand the formula：patient score = ∑PC1A−∑PC1B?

Today I read a paper (doi: 10.1016/j.omtn.2020.08.030), in this paper, they used many methods and finally they got a matrix, and each row represents a gene, each column represents a patient sample. The genes were split into two groups, called gene set A and gene set B. Then they used the PCA(Principal component analysis) to give each patient a score, and the formula is as followed: patient score = ∑PC1A−∑PC1B, the PC1A represents the first component of gene set A, and PC1B represents the first component of gene set B. So how can I understand this formula, and if I also have a matrix like this, how to get the score using R language? You can find the article in First, unsupervised clustering was employed to categorize the patients in TCGA as per the DEG [differentially expressed gene] values. Furthermore, DEG values that were positively and negatively correlated with the clusters signature were termed as the ICI gene signatures A and B, respectively. Furthermore, the Boruta algorithm was employed for the dimension reduction of the ICI gene signatures A and B, and principal component 1 was extracted as the signature score by employing the PCA. Lastly, we applied a method similar to Gene expression grade index to define the ICI score of each patient: $$\text{ICI score} = \sum \text{PC1}_A -\sum \text{PC1}_B $$ The above describes how they get the score using PCA, but it's hard for me to understand.
