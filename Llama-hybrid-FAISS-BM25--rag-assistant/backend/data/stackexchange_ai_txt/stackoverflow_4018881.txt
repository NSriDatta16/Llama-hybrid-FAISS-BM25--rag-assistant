How do I modify the Magento Order Slip to show a custom product attribute?

I need to display an additonal custom attribute from a product on the Order Slip PDF so that our distributor can find the proper product id. We have 3 different types of SKUs being used; one is our own, the other is from our supplier and another is from the manufacturer. Which part of Magento do I have to change in order to add the custom product attribute? Is there an extension that lets me do that or do I have to write some code?
