I prefer leaving out this. because it's less typing and less clutter and only use it when necessary because the identifier would be ambiguous otherwise. As a sidenote I like the way member acces is handled in Cobra. It requires them to be prefixed with a . (or _ for privates). So you'd use .member=parameter . And the first is obviously a member and the second a local variable. An elegant way to remove the ambiguity without becoming verbose.
