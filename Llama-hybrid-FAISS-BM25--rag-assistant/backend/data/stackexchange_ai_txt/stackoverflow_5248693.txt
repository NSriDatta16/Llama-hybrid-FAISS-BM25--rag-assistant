Sorry for the vague answer, I really never experienced this. I would try to approach this problem using ResultTransformers: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/javadocs/org/hibernate/transform/ResultTransformer.html Unfortunately, there's little documentation about it, so, your best option is to look at the test suite and see how it's used.
