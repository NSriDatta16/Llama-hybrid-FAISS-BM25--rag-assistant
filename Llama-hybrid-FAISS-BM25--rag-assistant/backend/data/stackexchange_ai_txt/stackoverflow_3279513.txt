Have a look at Quince, a UX pattern repository that can help you lift some inspiration : http://quince.infragistics.com/ Regarding the viewstate, if you're not doing MVC without state, have you considered the following tricks: Disable ViewState on non-context elements (ie: labels) Compress the ViewState by defining a custom handler that bzips>base64 encodes. You'll be surprised at the amount of space you end-up saving on the client Store the viewstate on the server, create a request id, and tie this id to the app cache with an expiry window = to the session lifespan (non-sliding), then substitute the viewstate with your guid back and forth.
