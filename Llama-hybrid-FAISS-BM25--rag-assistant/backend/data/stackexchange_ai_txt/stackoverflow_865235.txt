As for the divide-et-impera, be sure to keep track of value that you known are not present. Also I'd not go with a, b, c , but with frequency order. Some sort of markov chain from that might make it even faster. One thing to watch out for is that you can't assume that a given literal will always match the same location in the input. This will be of particular interest regarding removing the wild cards at the end. c a b a -------- * a * match * b*a* woops!
