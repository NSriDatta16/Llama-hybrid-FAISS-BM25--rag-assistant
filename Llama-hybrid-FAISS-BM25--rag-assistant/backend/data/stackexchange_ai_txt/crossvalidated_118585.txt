Generally it depends on algorithm and software you use. In probably any software you can start your algorithm with some starting values. However consider that you already fitted some model that is somehow "optimal" for the data. If you'll ask your algorithm for one more Gaussian than you already start in some local optima so it could get messy. It could be hard for the algorithm to find a "better" solution than the one that already is "the best of possible choices". If you think of it in Bayesian way, you can consider it as if you were using some highly informative prior on your data and in this kind of cases sometimes it is hard for your data to overcome information coming from the prior. Unfortunately I do not recall any literature that is dealing especially with this case. In his book Sivia (2006, Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial. Oxford University Press.) argues that in Bayesian case using posterior from a previous analysis as a prior in a subsequent one is a bad idea in most cases.
