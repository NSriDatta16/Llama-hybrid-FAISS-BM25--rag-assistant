What are the pros + cons of Link-Time Code Generation? (VS 2005)

I've heard that enabling Link-Time Code Generation (the /LTCG switch) can be a major optimization for large projects with lots of libraries to link together. My team is using it in the Release configuration of our solution, but the long compile-time is a real drag. One change to one file that no other file depends on triggers another 45 seconds of "Generating code...". Release is certainly much faster than Debug, but we might achieve the same speed-up by disabling LTCG and just leaving /O2 on. Is it worth it to leave /LTCG enabled?
