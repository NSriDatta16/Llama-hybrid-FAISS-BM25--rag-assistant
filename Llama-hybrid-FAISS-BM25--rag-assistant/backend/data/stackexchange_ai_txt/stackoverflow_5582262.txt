Adam, Not sure how much coding you've done already, but if you're not that familiar with connecting things in IB and setting delegates you might be better off starting over with a TabBarController template. Here's what you do: Define new IBOutlet for UITabBarController in AppDelegate and Add TabBarController to IB Connect UITabBarController to IBOutlet in AppDelegate in IB Set Delegate for UITabBarController in IB to AppDelegate Change rootViewController to tabBarController in AppDelegate Drag All ViewControllers into Tab Bar Controller in IB Setup other Tabs using NavigationControllers or UIViewControllers depending on your design Run, Fix, Repeat
