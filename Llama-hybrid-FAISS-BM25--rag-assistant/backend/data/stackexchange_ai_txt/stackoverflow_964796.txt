JavaScript XML Comment Documentation

I'm building a custom library of composite controls that include their own JavaScript files as web resources. I've got DocProject running to generate my XML documentation CHMs and it's working great. However, when I set my solution to "Release" configuration, the runtime is still not extracting the XML comments from the embedded JavaScript files and including them in the generated comments.xml file or the .org reflection file. Therefore, when I run my DocProject build, the comments I have included in my JavaScript files are excluded making my documentation imperfect. Any thoughts? I'd love to be able to include the JavaScript documentation directly in the generated CHM. I have since looked at AjaxDoc on CodePlex, and haven't had success with it after about 6 hours. Yes, I've contacted Bertrand LeRoy already (creator of AjaxDoc) and hope to hear something back, though I'm sure he's quite busy.
