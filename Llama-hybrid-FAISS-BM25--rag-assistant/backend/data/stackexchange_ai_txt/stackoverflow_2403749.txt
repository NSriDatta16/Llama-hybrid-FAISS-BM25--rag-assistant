You should just print everything to console with echo. Then you can redirect that to a log. For example: # my_file.sh echo "Doing stuff" # Do stuff # Invocation: my_file.sh > my_log.log This gives you the most flexibility and elegance. You can also write to log directly from script, like: # my_file.sh echo "Doing stuff" > my_log.log # Do stuff
