Salesforce/SOQL - Given child, how to return "top level" parent account?

I have an issue where I need to find the top level parent account for a child. The best I've been able to do is filter up from the child w/ SELECT id, name, parent.id, parent.parent.id, parent.parent.parent.id, FROM Account WHERE id=CHILD_ID Then iterate through until you find a null parent.id indicating top level account. Not very elegant and doesn't guarantee "top level" account, I would have preferred something like SELECT id, name, (SELECT id, name, FROM Accounts WHERE id = CHILD_ID) FROM Account WHERE parent.id = null But that doesn't work as salesforce apparently does not let you traverse parent-child relationships from account to account. Anyone have any suggestions here?
