Google Analytics Retrieve data

In one page on my personal site, I like to be able to see some data get from Google Analytics. I like to have a list of all my site and the average visitor per week or per month over the current year I have check some solution: Yahoo Pipe (look complicated) Google Analytics PHP API class(look nice) Google Analytics API (look official) Dimension Analyzer for Google Analytics(look fancy) So at this point, it have done my research, but none give me something i like to have. Getting a JSON from google would be nice. I will have to parse a XML maybe, but i like to see simpler solutions. ANYthing would be nice too see
