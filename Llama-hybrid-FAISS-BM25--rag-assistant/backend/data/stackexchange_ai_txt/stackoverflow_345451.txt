Mitchell's Machine Learning is an extremely important primer in the area of AI. It covers Bayesian Networks, devoting, as I recall, an entire chapter to it. I'd also check out Weka's Bayesian Network class to understand a practical implementation. If you don't know about Weka, check it out here: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
