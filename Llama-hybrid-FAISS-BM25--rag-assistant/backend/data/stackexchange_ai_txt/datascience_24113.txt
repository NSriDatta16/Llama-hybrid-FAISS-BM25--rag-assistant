XGBoost now has a histogram binning option for tree growth similar to the one LightGBM uses. It provides about the same level of speedup and similar accuracy characteristics, although the algorithms are still not exactly the same. There are some plots and tables here showing how they are right on top of each other now. https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/1950 To be fair, LightGBM cites their own performance tests showing them still edging out XGBoost (hist), though not by an order of magnitude any more. https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Experiments.rst#comparison-experiment
