django avatar custom template tag

My site is quite visual and I would like to make use of users avatars all over the site so I think that writing a custom template tag is the best way to go. My UserProfile is associated with a User and has an profile_pic . I am making use of django-imagekit and hence the ImageModel comes into play class UserProfile(ImageModel): profile_pic = models.ImageField(storage=cloudfiles_storage, upload_to='avatars', default='avatar-blank.jpg')` On my front page I am listing news and information that people have posted through calling all my latest posts. and each user is associated with a post. so in my profiles I have created my templatetags folder and also a file called myavatar_tags.py in my avatar_tags.py I render the following from accounts.models import UserProfile from imagekit.models import ImageModel from django import template register = template.Library() @register.simple_tag def my_avatar(request, user): avatar = UserProfile.objects.get(pk=user.id) my_avatar = register.tag(my_avatar) Now this is my first tag that I am writing and I am not sure which way to really go with this.
