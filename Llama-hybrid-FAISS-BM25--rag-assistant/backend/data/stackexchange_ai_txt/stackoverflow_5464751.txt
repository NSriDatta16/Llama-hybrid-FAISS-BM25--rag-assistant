Creating a Selection tool using PyGtk

Can anyone help or point me in the right direction for figuring out how to create a drag and draw rectangular box to be used as a selection tool in PyGtk? I am presently using an event box with a drawable window and the user can click once in the upper left and once in the lower right corner of the portion of image they would like to choose which will then draw a rectangle over the selection, but a drag and draw rectangle will allow the user to better adjust and get better accuracy. I have looked quite a few places for information or a tutorial on this but I haven't found much. I am relatively new to Gtk+ so perhaps this is so simple that no one has to ask.
