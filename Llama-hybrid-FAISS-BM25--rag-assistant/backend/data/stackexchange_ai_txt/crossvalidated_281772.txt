Logistic regression assumes the response is conditionally Bernoulli distributed, given the values of the features. $$ y \mid X \sim Bernoulli \left( p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k)}} \right) $$ The Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, the probability of the positive class. Logistic regression also specifies a specific functional form for this probability in terms of the features.
