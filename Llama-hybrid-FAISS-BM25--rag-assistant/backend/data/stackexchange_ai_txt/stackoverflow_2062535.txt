If you install the JavaEE version of Eclipse, it comes with a lot of tools that are useful for web development. You can also add server adapters quite easily (and even install Tomcat when adding servers). Here is a quick WTP Tutorial that goes through installing Tomcat. In my opinion, WTP is a must have for Java EE developers using Eclipse! Eclipse already comes with Ant built in. Cheers, Shane
