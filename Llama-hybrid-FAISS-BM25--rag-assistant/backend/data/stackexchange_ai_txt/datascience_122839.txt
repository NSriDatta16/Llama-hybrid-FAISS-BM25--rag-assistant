The approach I would go for is to take a step back and ask, " how are the features and target related?" This is the science part of data science; blindly searching for a magic algorithm which your dataset can suck in is not science. We have to understand the problem. A few questions first: For each day, there is only 1 target. Is this correct? (I assume yes) Does the target of each date have any relationship with each other? (I assume no) For each date there can be multiple experiments. Does the order in which these experiments are carried out affect the target? Is there any rationale on why each experiment is carried out, e.g. 'first we test with A, if the result is X, then we do B, otherwise do C'? Or completely random? How does the results of the experiments contribute to the target together? Does each experiment contributes a part, or only a selection of experiments finally count? Is it possible that some experiments are not related to the target at all? These questions are a start in order to find the appropriate approach. And as always, any domain knowledge is beneficial.
