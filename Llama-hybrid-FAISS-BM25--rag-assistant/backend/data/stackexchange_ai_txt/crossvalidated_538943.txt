The confusion stems from considering marginals rather than joint. When $X$ depends on $\theta$ and $\theta$ depends on $\eta$ then marginally $X$ depends on $\eta$ , which makes empirical Bayesian estimation feasible. To consider that \begin{align} X &\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \\ \theta &\sim N(\tau,\eta^2) \end{align} means that $X$ does not depend on $\theta$ hence that $\theta$ cannot be estimated based on the observation of $X$ .
