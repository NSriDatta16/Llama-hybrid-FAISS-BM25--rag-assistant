In general, it is better to deal with missing values first because there could be data loss or additional noise applying operations like a log that could impact classification or prediction algorithms. To deal with missing values, you can use regressors to have good results but it depends on the data quality. It could be done using algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost or Deep Neural Networks. Note: you can measure the model quality by hiding some known values and see if they are well predicted. See also: https://cardoai.com/handling-missing-data-with-python/
