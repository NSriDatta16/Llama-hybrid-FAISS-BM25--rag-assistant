Access localStorage in iOS apps

I'm serving up remote html/javascript content into an iPad app. Javascript code runs great and html renders fine, but any attempt to access localStorage throws "Security_err: dom exception 18". I was attempting to use localStorage because Safari by default won't accept third party cookies. Is there any way to set cookies or store values in localStorage from remote content to maintain state when served into an iOS app?
