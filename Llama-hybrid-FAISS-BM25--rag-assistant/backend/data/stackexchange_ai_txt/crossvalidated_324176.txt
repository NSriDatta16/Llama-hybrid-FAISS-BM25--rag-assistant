Trying to understand a question and its supposed answer

Question: Suppose that the average income in the population in city X is 50,000 with a standard deviation of 10,000. Calculate the z-score for a person that earns less than 45,000, assuming that income is normally distributed. My answer: Z=(45000-50000)/10000=-0.5 Stated "correct" answer: P(X I thought the "z-score" was just -0.5, aka how many std dev's the value was from the mean, which is one half std dev from the mean in the negative direction. Also, the probability value with a z-score of -0.5 is 0.3085. Any help on where this "correct" answer came from?
