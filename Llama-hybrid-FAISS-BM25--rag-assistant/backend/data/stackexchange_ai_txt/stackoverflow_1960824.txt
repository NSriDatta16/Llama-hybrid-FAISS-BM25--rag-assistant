Do you mean something like Class.forName(String) ? Quoting the javadoc of the method: Returns the Class object associated with the class or interface with the given string name. Invoking this method is equivalent to: Class.forName(className, true, currentLoader) where currentLoader denotes the defining class loader of the current class. For example, the following code fragment returns the runtime Class descriptor for the class named java.lang.Thread : Class t = Class.forName("java.lang.Thread") A call to forName("X") causes the class named X to be initialized. And then, call Class#newInstance() on the returned Class (it must have an empty constructor). Creates a new instance of the class represented by this Class object. The class is instantiated as if by a new expression with an empty argument list. The class is initialized if it has not already been initialized.
