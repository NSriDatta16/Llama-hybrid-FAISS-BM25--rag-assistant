This can happen when the web.xml is not properly configured as at least Servlet 2.4. The EL expressions (those #{} things) won't be evaluated then. Since you're using the vintage JSF 1.1, I bet that you're using a vintage servletcontainer as well. Ensure that it supports Servlet 2.4 and ensure that the web.xml is declared at least as: Or if you're using a Servlet 2.5 compatible container, then ensure that web.xml is declared as follows: (and consider upgrading JSF to 1.2 or, better, 2.0) You also need to ensure that you don't have any servletcontainer specific libraries like servlet-api.jar , j2ee.jar , javaee.jar , jsp-api.jar , etc..etc.. wandering around in webapp's /WEB-INF/lib folder or even worse, in the JRE/lib/ext folder. The /WEB-INF/lib folder should contain only the JSF libraries (and any other libraries specific to the webapp itself). The JRE/lib/ext folder should be kept untouched.
