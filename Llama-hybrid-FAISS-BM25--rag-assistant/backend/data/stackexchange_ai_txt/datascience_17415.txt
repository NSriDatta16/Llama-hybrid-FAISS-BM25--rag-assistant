Using Generative Adversarial Networks for a generation of image layer

Has anybody seen any application that would use GAN that would take input image and would output image of the same size, that could be used as a layer for the first image. The layer would contain in eg. point of interest in the input image. Would that even be a good practice of the GAN usage? I am looking for articles, examples of application that used something similar.
