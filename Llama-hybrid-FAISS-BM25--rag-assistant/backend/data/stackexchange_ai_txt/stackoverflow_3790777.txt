How to manipulate Data Transfer Object if sql join 2 tables?

I have a query in Data Access Object DAOComments that joins users table and comments table and then store the result into Data Transfer Object DTOComments: private static final String SQL_FIND_WITH_USERNAME = "SELECT u.username, comments.* FROM users u JOIN comments ON u.id = comments.id ORDER BY created_date DESC LIMIT 10;"; However, DTOComments does not have property "username" since it is the property of DTOUsers. Option 1 So I decided to use Map In this case the map has username as KEY, DTOComments as VALUE. But this approach will fails, because I care about the ORDER of result and that's why my query returns result in descending order. If I iterate the map on JSP page, the order is not consistent, so my JSP page would output the comment in random order. (Even if order doesn't matter, I don't know if JSTL can display map's KEY. I know displaying the VALUE though) Option 2 I could put the query result into ArrayList But I don't see any room to store the "username" now. Maybe I can add new property to DTOComments like private String username; hmm... this would violate the concept of having DTO since it SHOULD reflect the database table schema. Option 3 Create new class that hold all the information I need (ie. username + properties of DTOComments). But just because I need one more property "username" in addition to the properties of DTOComments, creating new class seems not right way. Could anyone give me advice how can I store all info returned by the query above in more organized way?
