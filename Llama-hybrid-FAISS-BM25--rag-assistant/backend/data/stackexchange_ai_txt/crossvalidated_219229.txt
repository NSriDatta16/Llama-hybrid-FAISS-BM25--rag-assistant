Upon reading about Kohonen Self Organising Maps, my initial thoughts were the same. It seems there has been some research on it, but I don't know enough about the area to comment more. There is a paper called Extending the SOM Algorithm to Non Euclidean Distances via the Kernel Trick , but it is behind a paywall so I can't comment on the content. I've requested the paper on Research gate so we'll see how that goes. With regards to the code: could you inherit from existing solutions and implement a different distance metric? Alternatively, could you transform the data set via feature scaling, say, and see how your results differ?
