Short version: use BindingList ... Long version: A DataSource is typically either: an individual object (for simple binding) a list source ( IListSource ) a list ( IList ) Since you are using it for a drop-down, it sounds like you want one of the second two, typically IList ( IListSource is relatively rare, except for DataTable ). For changes once you have bound, you need notifications. For simple bindings (individual objects), either INotifyPropertyChanged or *Changed events are the way to go - but for lists you need to implement IBindingList and raise the ListChanged event to tell the control what happened. To be honest, this is a lot of non-interesting work that it is very easy to make a mess of. The pragmatic approach is to work with BindingList (possibly inheriting from it). This gives you all the list notifications, including support for items in the list changing if you implement INotifyPropertyChanged on the items (it doesn't support *Changed events, though). Caveat: not all controls care about notifications... and if they don't there isn't a lot you can do about it. So if you don't see additions/swaps/etc even when using BindingList - or you don't see item updates when implement INotifyPropertyChanged , then... er, tough?
