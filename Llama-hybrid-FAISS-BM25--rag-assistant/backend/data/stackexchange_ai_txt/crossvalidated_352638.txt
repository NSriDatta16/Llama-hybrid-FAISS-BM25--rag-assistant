Logistic regression for repeated measures

I have data corresponding to reports of "mind wandering", i.e. thinking about something unrelated to the task, and I want to look at the link between these reports and trust (regarding a system capability). For each subject, I have 25 values of mind wandering (binary variable) and trust (range between 1 and 5). I firstly used a Kendall rank correlation, however someone told me that it would not account for repeated measures. That same person told me to use logistic models. I am not entirely sure that looking at logistic models would tell me the same thing as correlation test. However I have never done logistic regression, and so I am a bit lost with the possibilities offered by the technic. Is there a possibility to make correlations accounting for repeated measures?
