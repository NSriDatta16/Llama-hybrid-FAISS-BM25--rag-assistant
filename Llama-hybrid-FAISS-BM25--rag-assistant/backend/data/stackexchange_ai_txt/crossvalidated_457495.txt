I am working on one Anomaly detection problem (unsupervise problem) Data set have 1) 15 columns and around 8k rows , including normal and abnormal(outlier ) rows, without label , all are numeric following are my query : 1) can i implement k means on this dataset , if yes then how as there are 15 columns (usually online tutorials only explain k means with 2 columns ) and how i will evaluate k means ? 2) which is best algorithm to implement on this type dataset i) Local Outlier Factor ii) isolation Forest iii) one class SVM iv) Multivariate Gaussian Any suggestion/pointers will be helpful , please add your comments Thanks :)
