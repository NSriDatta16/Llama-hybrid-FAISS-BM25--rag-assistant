Why should we compare estimates of generalized linear model with its corresponding standard errors?

There is one concept in Statistics that I don't feel clear, and I could not find it in textbooks. Why sometimes do people compare coefficient estimates with corresponding standard errors? Here is the context: I am reading the book An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis by Alan Agresti (2nd edition, the thin version). In Chapter 5 section 5.1.2, it talks about an example for logistic regression with multiple predictors. After getting the results, the author was explaining how to interpret coefficient estimates. Two predictors are continuous variables (weight & width). The author says "The estimates for weight and width are only slightly larger than their SE values." Then the author starts to explain other coefficient estimates. So what does it say? "The estimates for weight and width are only slightly larger than their SE values." --- What does it say exactly? Is there any rule for comparing coefficient estimates with their corresponding standard errors? Thank you! P.S.(edited) By saying "The estimates for weight and width are only slightly larger than their SE values", the author is indicating width and weight are weak effects. I don't understand Why they are weak effects. -- Only because their magnitudes are slightly larger than their SE values?
