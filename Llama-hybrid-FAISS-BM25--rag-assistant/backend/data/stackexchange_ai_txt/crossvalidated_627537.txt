I think one of the issues here is that you have potentially several categories here with the number of players involved, which makes interpretation with the chi-square difficult to ascertain. If you run a $\chi^2$ test on something with 10 categories against some other categorical variable (this is specifically a chi-square test of independence), you have to remember that this functions like an omnibus test...sure it will tell you there is some general difference in hand x player associations, but it won't tell you specific differences other than some vague inspection of your counts. What's more, because it only tests the overall association, you are more likely to have a flagged test with many heterogenous groups, but what this means in practice is vague without something quantifiable like phi-coefficients, which are still generalizations that are not going to tell you exactly the relationship between the categories here. What may be a lot more illustrative is running the simulations but replacing it with a regression model instead. One option may be an ordinal logistic regression , with hand type as your outcome and number of players as your predictor. Number of players could be treated as continuous or categorical. I imagine it would be much more illustrative to use a continuous analysis, as it will give you a better idea of the overall trend (I doubt for example you have any specific hypotheses about $n_{players} = 6$ ). From there you could obtain probabilities from the model and make an approximation of what predictions your model should illicit. You may be interested in the book Analysis of Categorical Data in R . R is particularly well suited for both simulation and statistical analysis, so this book may be a good compliment for your use case, and I believe that Chapter 3 covers multinomial cases such as these (one example I recall is a wheat kernel analysis where they treated the kernel type as response and several predictors of each).
