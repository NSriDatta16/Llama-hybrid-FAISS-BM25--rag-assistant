Variable (frequency) transformation in R from (0;1) range

I have variable with a range (0;1). I want to do a transformation, so that later I can use this variable as a dependent variable in my multiple linear model. For example, can I use logit transformation? And if I use, what are my Linear model coefficients interpretation with that transformation? I want to transform, because later I will use this variable as a time series object in ARIMA model and if I use original variable I am getting 95% confidence interval starting from negative values, as I know this variable is in range from 0 to 1 all the time, because it is frequency. I am using R software. I am not sure, but I hear something about "scorse space", but I have no idea what it is. The idea WHY I want to use linear regression, cause later I want to assess how independent variables affects Y response and I want to do that quantitavely. Not the sign, but also the coefficient value. Cause later I devide Y response into two dependent variables Y_1 and Y_2 and see which one is affected more by independent variables (X1,X2). You can provide code with any random values from 0 to 1. Thank you for any ideas and thoughts. My data is in range (0;1), but the interval is not closed. The minimum value is above 0 and the maximum is below 1.
