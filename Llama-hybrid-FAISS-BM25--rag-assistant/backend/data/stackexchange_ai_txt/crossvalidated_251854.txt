How to model and make predictions on time series data in R?

I have a dataframe in R with two columns, each row represents a ratio in a year. There're a total of 130 rows. It looks like this: When plotted out, it's like this: I am currently using the below code in R to model this time series: myts Basically, by eyeballing the plot, I thought there's some cyclical effect every 20 years, so just use frequency as 20. I am wondering: Is this the right way to do it? If not, what's the right approach? Does it make more sense just to use a non linear regression model to represent? If yes, which one? Thanks! EDIT -- adding full dataset in csv format: "","yearID","sb_ab_ratio" "1",1886,0.0444691266609075 "2",1887,0.0849011159579308 "3",1888,0.0697252084465595 "4",1889,0.0629723580637569 "5",1890,0.0606468167942309 "6",1891,0.0536301933360757 "7",1892,0.0500970630596781 "8",1893,0.0483672536820275 "9",1894,0.0544773638065905 "10",1895,0.0510463800904977 "11",1896,0.0550107070234475 "12",1897,0.0476847430047048 "13",1898,0.0330189432023109 "14",1899,0.0425104442389259 "15",1900,0.0430849432689359 "16",1901,0.036962583490046 "17",1902,0.0351642002704938 "18",1903,0.0362544572436008 "19",1904,0.0337018717874115 "20",1905,0.0358242510141244 "21",1906,0.0374214661320743 "22",1907,0.0345810918509663 "23",1908,0.033874566187407 "24",1909,0.037860368183397 "25",1910,0.0400402241762015 "26",1911,0.0413440147822176 "27",1912,0.0412608637355404 "28",1913,0.0400167454688731 "29",1914,0.0372878037638575 "30",1915,0.0337375928482219 "31",1916,0.0336047263894145 "32",1917,0.0294071049905551 "33",1918,0.0295476491123821 "34",1919,0.0278153500020088 "35",1920,0.020421012616123 "36",1921,0.0174587892734702 "37",1922,0.0170013826072692 "38",1923,0.0183857607152495 "39",1924,0.0177284860510713 "40",1925,0.0162468395917221 "41",1926,0.0152235170503391 "42",1927,0.0170137696688412 "43",1928,0.0150213068181818 "44",1929,0.0155967609435512 "45",1930,0.0124753092837093 "46",1931,0.0125600295530107 "47",1932,0.0113555550457663 "48",1933,0.010091290981202 "49",1934,0.0105807172539023 "50",1935,0.0102155327001168 "51",1936,0.010988384034323 "52",1937,0.0118772029826786 "53",1938,0.0105395645371884 "54",1939,0.0112748736436574 "55",1940,0.0110810088020185 "56",1941,0.0102616069140634 "57",1942,0.0114772306553128 "58",1943,0.0119242984144225 "59",1944,0.01073950855075 "60",1945,0.0115812284628228 "61",1946,0.0104822548705726 "62",1947,0.009000900090009 "63",1948,0.00961959934131807 "64",1949,0.00865133917990045 "65",1950,0.00766301592728387 "66",1951,0.0101686945277141 "67",1952,0.00915731337965437 "68",1953,0.00785910090944386 "69",1954,0.00828011818528403 "70",1955,0.00830242852015791 "71",1956,0.0085742224766266 "72",1957,0.00903351942147787 "73",1958,0.0088396340081358 "74",1959,0.0101193442000617 "75",1960,0.0109862641940629 "76",1961,0.0107799488828428 "77",1962,0.0121783752529633 "78",1963,0.0112553954869142 "79",1964,0.0106460023174971 "80",1965,0.0132040568986413 "81",1966,0.0132916769437365 "82",1967,0.0125726844008974 "83",1968,0.0139474507926571 "84",1969,0.0140912657003359 "85",1970,0.0144392311185107 "86",1971,0.013520345630592 "87",1972,0.0144759188643574 "88",1973,0.01531394725112 "89",1974,0.0185927292523591 "90",1975,0.0191826458664517 "91",1976,0.0232199201672686 "92",1977,0.0209551724616945 "93",1978,0.0211843155537661 "94",1979,0.0208695164995238 "95",1980,0.0228496115427303 "96",1981,0.0213937142070776 "97",1982,0.0220327577714726 "98",1983,0.0231506639356825 "99",1984,0.0210805887547018 "100",1985,0.0216459898654552 "101",1986,0.0231436837029894 "102",1987,0.0248794198271973 "103",1988,0.023146849222827 "104",1989,0.0218175198325176 "105",1990,0.0230443796929284 "106",1991,0.0218230653013262 "107",1992,0.0228419468840757 "108",1993,0.0210522920094197 "109",1994,0.0204777537953676 "110",1995,0.0211660448434377 "111",1996,0.0206567560155866 "112",1997,0.0212817972439172 "113",1998,0.0196510208477943 "114",1999,0.020468361095156 "115",2000,0.0174786299240839 "116",2001,0.0186664581252933 "117",2002,0.0166080854199128 "118",2003,0.015425490443033 "119",2004,0.0154643179387283 "120",2005,0.0154206871674633 "121",2006,0.0165291231676636 "122",2007,0.0173915116549352 "123",2008,0.0167892318581523 "124",2009,0.0179078559412478 "125",2010,0.0178829534390062 "126",2011,0.0197821429649075 "127",2012,0.0195399725266413 "128",2013,0.016210031914253 "129",2014,0.016689410315553 "130",2015,0.0151370492120275
