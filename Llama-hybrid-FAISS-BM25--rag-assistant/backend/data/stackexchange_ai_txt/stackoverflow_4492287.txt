There are at least three reasons I can think of. If you save the session in the DB you can: access it easily on any Rails instance you execute. So if you have more than one machine, you don't have to worry about distributing the session data. You don't have the 4kb session limit session that only aplies when using cookie session store. Although you are not supposed to use the session to store objects, you may that functionality some day. When using and RDBM (and not Memcached, or any other non persisted storage) you don't have to worry about loosing session data.
