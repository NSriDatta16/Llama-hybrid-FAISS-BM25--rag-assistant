if you are speaking about the IBOutlet keyword that you put in the @interface part of the class like this: @interface Myclass { IBOutlet SomeOtherClass *myObj; } , this tells Interface Builder that you will use this class member to connect to o a "SomeOtherClass" object in Interface Builder. After you write this member, you will be able to drag a connection from this object to a "SomeOtherClass" object in interface builder and select the "myObj" outlet, and when the .nib will be read at runtime, you will have both the objects and the connection between them available. The "UILabel" that you mentioned is indeed the class of the object.
