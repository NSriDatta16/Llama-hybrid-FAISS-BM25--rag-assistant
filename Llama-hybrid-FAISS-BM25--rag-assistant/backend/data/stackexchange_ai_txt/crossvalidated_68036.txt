I disagee that all analyses of pre-existing data are exploratory. The scenario you described seems like a textbook-perfect example of a hypothesis test, assuming the investigators generated their hypothesis without looking at the data first. If it was truly an a priori hypothesis, then what would have changed if they went out and made measurements instead of just downloading the data? Issues with exploratory analysis (data dredging, multiple comparisons, etc) arise when the hypothesis is formed from the same data it is subsequently tested on. If your hypothetical researchers had thumbed through the data and noticed a potentially interesting relationship between two factors, a subsequent test of that relationship provides somewhat weaker evidence for it than if it were tested on an entirely new set of observations. In some cases, it might be possible to collect additional confirmatory data; you could also potentially use one subset of the data for developing your model and then test it on the rest of the data (there are also things like cross-validation if your 'exploration' is automated). I would be interested to hear how (for example) macro economists deal with this, as they often work with data that is collected over long timescales, can't be re-observed, and the researchers are often aware of many trends in the data. As a practical matter, I think you more or less have to take the authors at their word. Ideally, the authors would explain how they arrived at their hypothesis; it is, of course, possible to come up with some tortured post hoc rationalization too, but those often stick out from the text. Pre-registration would definitely help--it's been going on for a while for clinical trials and some psychologists are advocating for it for basic science-type experiments--but that raises some big logistical hurdles too. Finally, my inner Bayesian wants to point out that individual studies are rarely worth much in isolation; there's nothing wrong with updating your beliefs somewhat less if the study was either overtly exploratory or you think the authors may have peeked.
