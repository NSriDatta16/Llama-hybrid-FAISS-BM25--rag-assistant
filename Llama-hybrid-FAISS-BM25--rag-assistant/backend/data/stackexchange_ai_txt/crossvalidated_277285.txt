Factors or dummy variables? Which approach is better for Machine Learning in R?

I am a beginner in Machine Learning. I have been inspecting some kernels at Kaggle. Some of these answers use factors in their predictive models while others split them into dummy variables (this happens especially when the code is written in Python). I am using R. Which approach is better?
