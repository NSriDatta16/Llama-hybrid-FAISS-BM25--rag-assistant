Independent variables minimum counts for logistic regression

I have about 100 samples collected to know the knowledge status of people and it's distributes almost 50 50. The problem is some of my indipendent variables while making 2x2 the cell value is very less .... All my indipendent variables are binary. Is there any minimum cell count to run Univariable logistic and multivariable logistic?? like for ChiSquare we used to see the expected cell count
