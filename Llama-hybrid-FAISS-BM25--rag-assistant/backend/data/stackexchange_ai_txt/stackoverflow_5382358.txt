How to Implement Business Related Schedules in Relational Databases (e.g. Employee Schedules, Appointments, Courses and etc.)

I wasn't sure how I should word the title; I apologize if it is unclear. I’m developing a relational database for a vocational school. I want to provide students with their class schedules online. I would like to make the design as flexible as possible. I want to store exact dates and times including the term and year. I am interested in learning how any of you would approach this. Also I’m searching for a book, training video, tutorial or discussion on this specific topic. The part I’m unsure of is how to have the amount of days vary from one schedule to another. I understand it is a one-to-many relationship; however, I’m unsure how I should set it up in this scenario. Also what about leap year? My Approach is to make a Month/Day Table, Year Table and Term Table with foreign keys in a Schedule Table. To Address Leap Year I would just make the Month/Day Table 366 days. I’m unsure if this idea is overkill, I’m looking for the most elegant solution for handling any practical variation in a schedule. I apologize if I’m way off, I’ve been trying to teach myself Relational Database Development but I’m just getting started. I would like the schedule to output partly like this: Example Class A Schedule: 01/02/2011 1:00pm-3:00pm 01/03/2011 2:00pm-4:00pm 01/04/2011 1:00pm-3:00pm 01/05/2011 2:00pm-5:00pm 01/08/2011 1:00pm-4:00pm Example Class B Schedule: 01/02/2011 1:00pm-3:00pm 01/03/2011 2:00pm-4:00pm
