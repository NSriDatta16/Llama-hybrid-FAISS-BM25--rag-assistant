How can I organize each scraped item into a csv row?

What is the best way to organize scraped data into a csv? More specifically each item is in this form url "firstName middleInitial, lastName - level - word1 word2 word3, &amp; wordN practice officeCity." JD, schoolName, date Example: http://www.examplefirm.com/jang "Joe E. Ang - partner - privatization mergers, media &amp; technology practice New York." JD, University of Chicago Law School, 1985 I want to put this item in this form: (http://www.examplefirm.com/jang, Joe, E., Ang, partner, privatization mergers, media &amp; technology, New York, University of Chicago Law School, 1985) so that I can write it into a csv file to import to a django db. What would be the best way of doing this? Thank you.
