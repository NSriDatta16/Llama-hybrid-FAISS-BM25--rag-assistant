After you're done with $this->parser->parse , you want to look at the paragraph that starts "Lets add the _getXML function to our controller" to see how to iterate through the parsed XML object. As for attributes, they're stored in the "@attributes" property of the node with the attributes. Just do a search on the page for "attributes" and you'll get the very basic snippet of the library that assigns the attributes as well as comments asking your very question. A good idea when you have a question about a blog post is always to try a search (on Windows, it's Ctrl+F) for your keywords. "attributes" shows up a number of times to answer your question.
