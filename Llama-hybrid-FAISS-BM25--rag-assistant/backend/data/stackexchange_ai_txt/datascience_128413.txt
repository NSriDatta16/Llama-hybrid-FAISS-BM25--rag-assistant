Which Experiment Results Should Be Included: Reproduced or Original?

I am currently working on a research project in the field of machine learning where I am attempting to reproduce the results of a specific paper. To ensure accuracy and transparency, I have utilized the code provided by the original authors for this purpose. However, I am encountering a dilemma regarding which experiment results to include in my paper: should I present the reproduced results obtained from the code provided by the original authors, or should I rely solely on the results as reported in the original paper?
