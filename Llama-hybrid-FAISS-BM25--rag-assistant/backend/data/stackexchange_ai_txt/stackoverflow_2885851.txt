Here's a page from UCLA's Academic Technology Services that describes looping over lists of variables . Quote, "Because we are looping through more than one variable, we will need to use Python." In my experience, UCLA ATS is probably the site with the best coverage of all of the major statistical computing systems. If they say you need Python... you probably need Python. Er... sorry for being that guy, but maybe it's time to switch to a different stats system.
