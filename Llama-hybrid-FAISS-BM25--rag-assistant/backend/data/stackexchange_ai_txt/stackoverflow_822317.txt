In my experience, Scrum can still be relevant for projects in small teams of a couple of people with existing responsibilities. Here’s why: It still encourages task breakout and granular estimation. Sprints are still set units of work which should not change in scope or duration. Daily stand-up meetings still encourage regular discussion. You still deliver in iterative cycles. There is still a burn-down chart to track to. You still have the retrospective continuous improvement phase. All of these are equally relevant for a 2 member team or an 8 member team. Don’t be brow-beaten by people saying “there’s only one way to do Scrum” or that you need more than a handful of people to make it work.
