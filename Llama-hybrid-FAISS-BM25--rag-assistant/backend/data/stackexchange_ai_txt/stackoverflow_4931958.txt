How to create packages for different configurations of the same product in PackageScript?

we call Mac PackageMaker from an Ant script, to build our product installation package. I would like to pass a parameter 'productConfiguration', that will direct the package to include or exclude certain components, e.g. in order to create a smaller Trial version package. What is the correct way to achieve that? Notes: In Windows we use InstallShield's Features, Conditions, Release Flags, Configuration Flags. Are there similar concepts in PackageMaker?) Where is the documentation of pkmkdoc spec 1.12? The only way I can think of, is to generate [some of] the xml files inside the install.pmdoc smart folder, using templates. But it looks very inelegant to me.
