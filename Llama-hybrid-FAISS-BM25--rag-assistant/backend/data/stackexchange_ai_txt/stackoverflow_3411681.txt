This is based on Evan Carrol's answer, but I'm going to elaborate in case this is useful for someone else. I stubbed out the response section; I doubt that part of my code will be interesting. #!/usr/bin/perl -w require HTTP::Date; require LWP::UserAgent; require Date::Parse; my $lastChecked = '2009-01-01'; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->default_header('If-Modified-Since' => HTTP::Date::time2str(Date::Parse::str2time($lastChecked))); my $response = $ua->get('http://example.com/'); if ($response->code == 304) { print "No changes.\n"; } elsif ($response->is_success) { print $response->decoded_content; } else { print "Response was error " . $response->code . ": '" . $response->status_line . "'\n"; }
