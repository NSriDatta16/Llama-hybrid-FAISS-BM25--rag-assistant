Use the source, Luke. :-) Find a theme you like and read the source code to figure out what it does. Copy it to your own theme package and change what you want to change. You will need to need to read Part III (Changing the Way Things Look) of the manual very carefully, probably several times, to learn how beamer uses templates to place things on the page, colors, and fonts. I used beamer for several years before I figured out enough about to start hacking at themes. So don't get discouraged.
