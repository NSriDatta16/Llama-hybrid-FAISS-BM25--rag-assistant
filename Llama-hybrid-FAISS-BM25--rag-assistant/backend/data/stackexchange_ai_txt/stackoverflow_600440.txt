A sequential read is always faster than one that requires a head seek (not position seek). Typical hard drive perf for sequential read is 50-60 MB/sec, seeking drops that down to a worst-case ~0.4 MB/sec. Once the drive heads are positioned, you essentially get the data in the cylinder for free. The file system cache takes advantage of that by pre-reading sectors from a cylinder. However, you have no control over the placement of your data on disk cylinders. Nor can you guess the drive geometry. Note that throughput can get significantly worse over time when the volume gets fragmented. You'll need to look for perf by caching data in memory. At that point, you worry about locality of reference.
