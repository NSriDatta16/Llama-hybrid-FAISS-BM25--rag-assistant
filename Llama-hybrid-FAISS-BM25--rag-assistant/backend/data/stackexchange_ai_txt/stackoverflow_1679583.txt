The storage structure of oracle is well described in the documentation: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10713/logical.htm#CNCPT304 A tablespace is a logical storage container made up of one or more data files. a tablespace is defined with a particular block size and in general all tablespaces in an Oracle database will have a common blocksize. 8kb is the most commonly chosen one. Storage of indexes, tables, clusters etc, is represented as segments. A single segment will be assigned to a single tablespace but can be spread over multiple data files. An unpartitioned table or index will have a single segment. For a partitioned table or index each partition or subpartition will be a single segment. Segments are built of extents, which are logically contiguous sets of blocks. New extents are allocated to segments either manually or automatically as required by growth patterns.
