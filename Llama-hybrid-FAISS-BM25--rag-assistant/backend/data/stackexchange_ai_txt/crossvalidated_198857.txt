How to formulate a formula using logistic regression

So I used SPSS for the possible RGB of fire and I got this as a result. How do I make a formula to predict the possibility of fire using another set of data (RGB) I tried using the formula P = -14.039 + (0.101*red) + (0.034*green) + (-0.119*blue) but I keep getting answer above 1 or below 0. I thought the answer should be in between 0 and 1?
