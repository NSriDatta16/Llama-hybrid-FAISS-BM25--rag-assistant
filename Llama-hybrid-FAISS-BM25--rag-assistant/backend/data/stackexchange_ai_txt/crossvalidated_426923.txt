How do I get the covariance of a time series

I have the following time series: $$y_t = \mu_t + \sigma_tx_t$$ I want to get the covariance from this time series. How would one proceed with this? I have found the following formula: $$cov(x, y) = E[(x - Ex)(y - Ey)]$$ However, I am clueless on how to implement this formula to my series. Many thanks.
