Estimate null hypothesis for correlation of linear combinations of variables?

Setting up the problem Suppose I have a variable $x$ of length $n$ and I have another $p$ variables $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_p$ , where $y_i$ is also of length $n$ . Based on the y's, I can make a linear combination to estimate $x$ . Let $\hat{x}$ be the best linear fit: $\hat{x} = a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 + \dots + a_p y_p $ I can now calculate the correlation between $\hat{x}$ and $x$ . The question: My question is how do I calculate whether this correlation I get can be explained by the null hypothesis in this case. My own insights The answer to this question will for sure depend on the size of $n$ and $p$ if $p>n$ then I would expect a correlation of 1 always since even random variables should be able to fit exactly in that case, but for the more interesting case of $n > p$ how would I go about estimating this? Unsatisfactory solution My own idea for a solution would be to do a permutation test as detailed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#Inference , but I feel like there should be a more elegant solution. Summary In summary, I'm looking for the probability that a linear combination of random variables has a correlation of $c$ or higher with another another random variable, given $p$ variables and a sample size of $n$ .
