You can use a statistical Named Entity Recognizer (NER), such as Stanford's NER , or LingPipe's . These are machine learning-based recognizers, that do not require huge dictionaries of names as input. Alternatively, you can get a list of person names from the Web (there are plenty), and use the Aho-Corasick string searching algorithm to efficiently extract names from the list from text.
