Deep learning - rule generation

I wanted to know if there is any methodology in Deep/Machine learning, where given a set of input/output values, it can derive rules for the same. Lets say I generate training input and output by $y=x^2$ i/p | o/p 0 0 2 4 . . 1000 1000000 It sort of generate rule like, $y=x*x$
