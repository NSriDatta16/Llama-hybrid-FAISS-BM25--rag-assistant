Problem with GDataXMLParser for iPhone app

Im receiving an xml format data from a CMS to my iPad app. The data in my CMS has paragraphs. The para break is represented in the XML data i receive as &nbsp; Now when i try to build a GDataXMLDocument by xmlDocument = [[GDataXMLDocument alloc]initWithData:webData options:0 error:&error]; it throws an error saying: Entity: line 2: parser error : Entity 'nbsp' not defined I tried replacing the nbsp; with a space or \n character in the webData NSString object. But still whenever i try to build the xmlDocument using the above code it throws the same aforementioned error. Any ideas on how to resolve this? I need to have paras in my content but the GDataXMLDocument isnt getting built if there are paras present. What do i do?
