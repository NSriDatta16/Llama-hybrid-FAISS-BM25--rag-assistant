In the MVC pattern, what goes in the model and what goes in the view?

I'm using the MVC pattern to design some data analysis software (in Python ). I'm not sure whether some functions should go in the model or the controller. The way I've designed it, the user supplies the program a configuration file which contains the parameters for analysis. The program parses this file to find out what data files to look at and what kinds of calculations to do. Should the function(s) that do this configuration file parsing be in the model or the controller? Is there a standard way to organize things in Python when using MVC? I've made the model, controller, and view into separate classes. The controller class contains instances of the model and view classes. What kind of communication should there be between the model and the view? The way I'm structuring things is so that the controller takes stuff from the model and passes it to the view. The two only communicate through the controller.
