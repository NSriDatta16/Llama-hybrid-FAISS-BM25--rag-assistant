Same story here, I'm certifying application for Win7 Logo in order to get the points for MS Partnership program. I bought the Comodo code signing certificate. The application passed the test and now I'm trying to setup a Winqual account and after initially getting pissed off about having to buy another signing certificate I got into a 5 days delay trying to actually buy this "Organizational Certificate" for $99. No way, " VeriSign SSL Certificate Enrollment is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. ", and the support might as well be the worst I ever encountered. OMG ... please try at least to read the problem description or even try to reproduce the steps, don't just give me some stupid knowledge base solution for another problem. Or just say the service is unavailable, it will be available in 5 days. So frustrating ... Just an update if anyone has the same problem, I finally got the answer to the enrollment problem and made the order. (I guess u need to get the right guy in tech support :) "Our sincere apologies. This error occurs due to a bug in the Organizational Certificate enrollment. This error will occur if any country other than the US is entered into the "Certificate Info" (3rd step) section of the enrollment. This has been escalated to the engineers who are working on fixing it now. In the meantime you can do the following to get past the error and complete your enrollment: On the "Certificate Info" part of the enrollment, enter the country as "US" and the state as "California". All other information can be correct. Once the enrollment is complete go ahead and send us the order number for your certificate as well as the correct Country and State values for your company in reply to this email. We will edit the order in our system and enter the correct company and country values for you before we issue the certificate. The certificate that we issue to you will then contain the correct information."
