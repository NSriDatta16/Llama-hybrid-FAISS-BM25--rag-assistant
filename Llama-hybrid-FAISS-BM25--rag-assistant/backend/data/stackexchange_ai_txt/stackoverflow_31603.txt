Map is more general than mapcar, for example you could do the following rather than using mapcar: (map 'list #'function listvar) How do I keep scheme and CL separate in my head? I guess when you know both languages well enough you just know what works in one and not the other. Despite the syntactic similarities they are quite different languages in terms of style.
