If you are reading/writing this, I would simply translate it at the Stream level, somthing like: int b = source.ReadByte(); if (b > 4) & 15; b = source.ReadByte(); if (b > 3) & 31; b = source.ReadByte(); if (b > 3) & 3; int tar = (b >> 5) & 7; If you are doing lots of it, you could wrap it up into something more elegant, perhaps using attributes to specify the offsets - but for 10? meh... not worth it. Writing a robust generic converter is lots of hard work.
