I found that @ tystanza's answer (Tableman's equations) give a too conservative confidence interval -- that is, they are too wide. When I did a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the coverage of the Tableman confidence interval, I found that nominal 95% CI's gave 100% coverage. I found another option from the package flexsurv. I don't think they directly expose the confidence intervals, but they can be found from "summary". Here is the hack workaround I found to get CI's. I did verify through MC sampling that the coverage of these CI's is just about right (I found the CI's contained the true value in 930/1000 cases for 95% confidence intervals -- pretty close). require(flexsurv) require(survival) sWei = flexsurvreg(Surv(samples, rep(1,N)) ~ 1, dist='weibull', cl = 1-alpha) s = unlist(summary(sWei)) lowerCI = s[(2*N+1):(3*N)] upperCI = s[(3*N+1):(4*N)]
