One Hot Encode and Logistic Regression

When using Logistic Regression, and the categorical variables are one hot encoded, do we always have to drop a variable to avoid the dummy variable trap? If I recall it correctly, I have seen somewhere that if you use regularization, you don't need to drop 1 variable, but I can't find seem the find the article back. I'm a newbie. Many thanks
