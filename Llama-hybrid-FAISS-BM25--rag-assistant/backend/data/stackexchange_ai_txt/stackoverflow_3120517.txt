Get Current Top Level Category with Magento

How do I get the current (active) top level category and its subcategories?? I do not want the root category, just the highest level category and all of its subcategories. If I am in the Womenâ€™s Category for instance: Women - Apparel -- Shirts -- Pants - Accessories -- Handbags -- Jewelry Even if i am looking at shirts, i would like the category tree to remain the same. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
