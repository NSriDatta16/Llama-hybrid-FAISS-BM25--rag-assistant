MCMC beginner question at an example chain plot: Do I need more steps? How much burn-in do I need, if I can tell already?

I am using the emcee python library to fit a model to data via MCMC. Below an example plot for the chain of one of my parameters. Here I ran 1000 steps with 100 walkers. Now I have two beginner questions: (1) Do I need more steps? (2) Can I already tell how much burn-in would be appropriate, and if so, how much would that be? I think I know the answers, but I am new to the matter and don't yet feel save with my judgement. Here is what I think: to (1): I would say I do need more steps, as the walkers are still spreading out over the target distribution; i.e. the width of the sampled region is still increasing. This means that the outer region of the target distribution is still under-sampled, and this might end up in an underestimation of the errors. to (2): If I am right with (1) then I don't know yet how much burn-in I need, since I have to wait until I see when the width of the sampled region stays approximately constant. The step when this starts to be the case then is the minimum burn-in which I need. Am I right with this assessment? For comparison, here the chain for another parameter, which already looks perfectly converged to my MCMC beginner's eye, and for which I might need a burn-in of about 100 steps, correct? EDIT: This is a corner plot to the fit with 200 burn-in. The parameter rho0, for which (amongst others) the walkers still spread out corresponds to the bottom row.
