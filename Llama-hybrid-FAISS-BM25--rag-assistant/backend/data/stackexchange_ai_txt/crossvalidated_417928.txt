Ok to use PSM to create treatment groups and then plug into CausalImpact?

Is it ok to use propensity score matching to create treatment and control groups and then plug these two time series into CausalImpact to estimate your treatment effect? I might want to do this, for example, if I had many covariates I could potentially match on and no obvious time series (eg different markets) to include as controls in my model. However, I haven't been able to find any examples of people taking this approach.
