How do you organize DB layer, business logic and cross-platform API of your information management system, if uploading and processing 500000 data records in one session is a normal operation (C# .NET 3.5 + MS SQL 2005)? I’m specifically interested in production-proven paging patterns that behave well with the concurrency, scalability and reliability. Does anybody have any ideas, in what direction to dig? Open Source Projects (don’t care about the language or platform, as long as it is not Ook) books articles Google keywords forums or newsgroups Any help would greatly appreciated! Update: simple paging (i.e.: rownumber in SQL 2005) does not work, since there are a lot of concurrent changes to the database. Item, that is deleted or inserted between the page requests, automatically makes current page index invalid.
