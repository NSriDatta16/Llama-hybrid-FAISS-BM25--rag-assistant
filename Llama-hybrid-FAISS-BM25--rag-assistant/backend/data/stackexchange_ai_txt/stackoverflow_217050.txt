The "magic" in Rails involves method_missing and the concept of metaprogramming . Dave Thomas of The Pragmatic Programmers created a set of screencasts on metaprogramming Ruby . PHP has a somewhat-equivalent function called __call , and PHP 5.3 introduced __callstatic . You might take a look at those, as well as search Google for "php metaprogramming", for some reading material on implementing Rails-like behavior in PHP.
