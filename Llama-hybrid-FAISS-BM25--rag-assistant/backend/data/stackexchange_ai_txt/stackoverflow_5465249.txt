The short answer is Item Moniker . You need to implement IOleItemContainer to do this. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693722(VS.85).aspx When combined with a file moniker, an item moniker forms a complete path. Item monikers thus extend the notion of path names beyond the file system, defining path names to identify individual objects, not just files. The long answer is no, Word does not make use of secret knowledge about Excel (or vice-versa), though I am sure it helps that OLE was built with embedding Excel into Word as a major use-case. You can also embed an Excel Range in Internet Explorer, or pretty much anything that supports embedding. And you can access a range object and alter its properties from VBScript, by using Set oRange = GetObject("c:\path\to\spreadsheet.xls!Sheet1!R2C1") or similar.
