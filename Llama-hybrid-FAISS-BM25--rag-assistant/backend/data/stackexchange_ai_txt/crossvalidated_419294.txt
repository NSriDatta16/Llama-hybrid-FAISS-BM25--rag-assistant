ARMA Estimation Efficiency of the Mean

Usually in books related to ARMA Time Series, it is assumed that the series is 0 mean. If not, the recommended standard procedure is to simply subtract the sample mean from the series and continue business as usual. My question is whether there is a difference in estimation efficiency of ARMA parameters and the mean parameter when estimated altogether with MLE procedure vs first subtracting the sample mean and then estimating only ARMA parameters with MLE procedure.
