Round robin algorithm in operating system

I just wanted to make sure that what I am doing is right. I am working for my midterm and I got old midterms from my friend, there is one question in regarding Round Robin secluding algorithm. It has following information. Time slice is 2. Job No Arrival Time CPU Time 1 0 8 2 4 4 3 5 3 4 6 1 5 7 5 I am asked to draw Gantt chart from above information. (I am not sure how I can show it here, but bellow is one try. I am not good at formating tools) Job 1 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 5 || 1 || 5 || Time 0-2| 2-4 | 4-6 | 6-8 | 8-9 | 9-11 | 11-13 | 13-15 | 15-16| 16-18 | 18-20| 20-21 You can read like below (Sorry for inconvenience) Job 1 starts at 0 and ends at 2 at first interval and then it continues till 4, later job 2 starts at 4 and ends at 6. Thanks for help in advance.
