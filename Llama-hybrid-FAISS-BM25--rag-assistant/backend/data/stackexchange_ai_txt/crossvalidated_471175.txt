add linear trend back into time series prediction (in R)

I have the following GARCH(1,1) model ymod1 = lm(Jobs ~ Month, df) resid =ymod1$residuals library(fGarch) fit = garchFit(~garch(1,1), cond.dist="sged", data= resid ,trace=F) I plotted the expected values with a confidence interval based on the variance predicted by my GARCH model using the predict function: predict(fit, n.ahead = 12, plot=TRUE,conf=.9,nx=100) https://i.stack.imgur.com/At3C8.png But it has plotted it on the residuals of a linear trend that I removed, instead of the actual data. How do I obtain a confidence interval for the actual data and plot it on that instead?
