Do memcache clients of different languages hash the same way?

We would like to some processing in a Java application, store the results in our pool of memcache servers, and read it back using memcache in PHP. This is easy enough to try, but I though I would ask and see if anyone else has done this. As long as both the Java and PHP clients connect to the same pool of memcache servers, will both clients hash to the same server location making retrieval from PHP possible?
