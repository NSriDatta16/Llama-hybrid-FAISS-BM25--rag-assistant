Table displays in one line

The problem is in my CSS file: * { font-size: 8px; float: left; } The universal property makes a simple HTML table (loaded later) render in one line. What's a good way to prevent this from happening without bothering my (imo) elegant CSS too much? edit: I have tried changing the style property of the returned table to look like style="float: none;" but the table elements still default to floating left... I'm not exactly clear on the precedence of the css file vs style attributes.
