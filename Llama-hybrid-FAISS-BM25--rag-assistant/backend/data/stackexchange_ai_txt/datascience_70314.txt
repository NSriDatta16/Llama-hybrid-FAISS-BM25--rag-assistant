How to use External Data Sets in test set

I have a doubt regarding usage of external datasets like gdp rate, unemployment rate... etc., in test set for time series prediction. These datasets are historical and can be used along with train set, but how can it be used along with test set ? Do we need to predict it first and then use it along test set or are there any better ways to do it ?
