HTML5 localStorage with a textarea

I've been trying to use localStorage with a textarea in my webpage (to no avail). My save script is as follows: $(function() { var editor = document.querySelector("#editor"); editor.addEventListener("keyup", function() { window.localStorage["TextEditorData"] = editor.value; }); }); My load script is as follows: $window.load(function () { var editor = document.querySelector("#editor"); if (window.localStorage["TextEditorData"]) { editor.value = window.localStorage["TextEditorData"]; } }); My HTML5 code is as follows: But it doesn't seem to work. Am I missing something obvious here? I did manage to get it to work when I used a contenteditable div instead of a textarea and with editor.innerHTML instead of editor.value but I need to use a textarea for this particular webpage. Any suggestions?
