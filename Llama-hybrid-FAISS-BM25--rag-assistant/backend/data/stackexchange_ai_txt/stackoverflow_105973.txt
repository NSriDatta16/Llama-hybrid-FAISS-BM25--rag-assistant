I think that this really depends upon the language. In some languages, Lisp for example, recursion is often the natural response to a problem (and often with languages where this is the case, the compiler is optimized to deal with recursion). The common pattern in Lisp of performing an operation on the first element of a list and then calling the function on the rest of the list in order to either accumulate a value or a new list is quite elegant and most natural way to do a lot of things in that language. In Java , not so much.
