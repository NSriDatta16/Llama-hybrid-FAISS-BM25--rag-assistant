jQuery Dialog theme not being applied

I'm using jquery-1.4.2.min.js and jquery-ui-1.8.1.custom.min.js. According to Firebug, both minimized scripts have been loaded. They both appear in the dropdown list on Firebug's Scripts tab. The dialog is launching, but there's no background and so the text below it shows through, and there's no "window" stuff at all, no titlebar, no X button. Just the floating/draggable text with a -close- link at the top left corner. I was under the impression from reading these pages http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ that the UI theme-driven appearance would be automatically applied to the dialog when it was invoked using this barebones call: $('#dialog').dialog() I would be grateful for suggestions on how to troubleshoot this. Thanks
