IMHO this would always be a hard core solution. Mapping ORM classes with some internal ones will always lead to "double work" and problems. Some DB schema change will require changes once again in this mapping class, for some reason this will demand extra attention to not be forgotten. Also other things to have in mind: transactions, lazy loading, for some reason some ORM behave differently from others, or have or not that functionality. Assuming that all are similar is not correct. Taking this in consideration, I think, this isn't so trivial to do.
