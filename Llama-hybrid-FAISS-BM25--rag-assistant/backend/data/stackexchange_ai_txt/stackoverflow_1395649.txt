It turned out that it was the Eclipse plugin I was using to start Tomcat. Our whole team has become reliant on it, never starting Tomcat from the command line on our local machines. It does something with the classloader that broke LTW. When I finally got Tomcat started from the command line, everything worked perfectly. For the record, you do NOT need -javaagent:path/to/spring-agent.jar if you specify TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader in server.xml.
