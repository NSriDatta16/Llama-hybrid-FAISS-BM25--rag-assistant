Alternatives to writing an ODBC driver

We are storing allot of time series data into our own proprietary "database". In the next version of our system we want to give our users a simple query mechanism to extract the raw data from the database (as a complement to the reports our system can create) by using standard tools. I have looked at the possibility to write an ODBC driver, but it looks like quite a daunting task, especially when the use will be very simple select statements. I would be grateful for any tips, ideas and/or recommendation of libraries, that could make this task a bit simpler. Our platform is Windows and our dev. env. is visual studio 2010 (nativ C++)
