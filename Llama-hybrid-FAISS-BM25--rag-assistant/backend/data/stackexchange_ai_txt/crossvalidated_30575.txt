To use seasonal dummy variables, the period of seasonality must be an integer. When you convert a to a time series using as.ts(a) , the period is set to 1/86400 (seconds in a day). So if you want to use seasonal dummy variables you will have to specify what the most appropriate period is first. For example, if you want to use a day-of-week seasonality, use seasonaldummy(ts(a,f=7))
