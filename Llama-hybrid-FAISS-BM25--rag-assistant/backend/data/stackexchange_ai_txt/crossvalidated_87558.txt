I have made some assumptions that were not explicitly stated in your question. Correct me if I'm wrong. Let me rephrase your situation. If I understood correctly, you have three variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$. Your observations are one instance of $x1$, paired with one instance of $x_2$, which is paired with $N_y$ instances of $x_3$ (number is not certain based on your comment). Each observation can be written as: $$X = (x_1,x_2,x_3^1,x_3^2,...,x_3^{N_y}) $$ Where there are actually $N_y$ observations of the final variable for each observation of the other two. From what I see, there is no sense in keeping the last observations as separate variables. They do not represent the same people, nor is there a specific order to the observations, nor are they necessarily the same size for each $x_1,x_2$, so it makes no sense to create a model from them separately. One idea can be to take the average of these observations (suppose there are $N_y$ observations) to create a new variable, or: $$X = (x_1,x_2,y) $$ Where $y=1/N_y\sum_{i=1}^{n_y} x_3^i$. If you construct a model, you will have 100 samples of each variable. Your three models now become: $$ x_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_2 + \epsilon$$ $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2+ \epsilon$$ $$ x_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 y + \epsilon$$
