Many larger open source projects that request donations have incorporated as a non-profit corporation, and the donation goes to the non-profit. A great example is the Apache project . Often, a single developer-led project will accept donations. Technically, in this case, the developer (in most countries) should treat the "donation" as income. This gives complete freedom to do nearly anything with the money - but usually it should be funneled back into the project in some form. Normally, I'd recommend using the money to pay developers, pay for infrastructure (like hosting), or potentially even use it for something like stipends for student contributors. The latter is my personal favorite - I enjoy giving money to groups that help fund new development and encourage students to contribute. However, whatever you choose to do with the money, I believe it is very important to be public about that information. If there is no mention of how the money is spent, I'd expect it to stop coming over time... People are more willing to donate when they know how their contributions will be used.
