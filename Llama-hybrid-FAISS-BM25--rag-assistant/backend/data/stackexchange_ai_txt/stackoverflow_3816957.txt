Hmm, I was also thinking about this. Having a table per table-to-keep revisions for would not be that much of a problem for me personally, but hey. Username can be kept with user-defined variables I believe, (after a session start issue something like SET @user='someone' , and use that. As longs as there are triggers after INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, getting the previous / next values is a simple query, I'll only store the OLD values. In short, for a table with coluns (a,b,c) I'd create a table with columns (user_id,modtime,a,b,c). Major drawbacks: batch updates are slow (so choose your tables to keep revisions for carefully) data duplication deluxe, you'll / I'll have to have enough storage space 'related' data does not trigger a revision (i.e: altering a group_members table doesn't really alter a groups table, while you may want to keep that as a point in time for groups rather then delve through group_members alterations. All in all it seems a good deal to me, but as I've seldomly seen it in practise there must be compelling reasons why its bad, so I'll await those answers.
