I asked a similar question when I was using Hibernate, Getting column length from Hibernate mappings? No idea how to pull this information under JPA however, but if you are using Hibernate as your underlying layer you could try access Hibernate directly and implement the solution above. However the Hibernate solution is just as in-elegant as the solution that you outlined in your answer, with the added disadvantage that it ties your JPA implementation to Hibernate.
