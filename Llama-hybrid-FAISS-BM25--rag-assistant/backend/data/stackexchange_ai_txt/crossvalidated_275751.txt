Xgboost cv evaluation metric - unbalanced data

I'm using Xgboost for some binary classification and so it makes sense for me to use log loss as my evaluation metric within cross validation. My data is highly unbalanced though. Would log loss still be relevant? Is there a better metric for unbalanced data?
