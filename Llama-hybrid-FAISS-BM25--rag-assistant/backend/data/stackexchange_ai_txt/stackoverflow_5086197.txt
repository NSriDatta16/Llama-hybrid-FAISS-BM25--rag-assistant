The best way to store a large blob of data into memcache is to split it up into chunks and use set_multi and get_multi to efficiently store and retrieve the data. But be aware that it's possible for some parts to drop from cache and others to remain. You can also cache data in the application instance by storing it in a global variable, but this is less ideal as it won't be shared across instances and is more likely to disappear. Support for uploading to the blobstore from within the application is on the GAE roadmap , you might want to keep an eye out for that, as well as integration with Google Storage.
