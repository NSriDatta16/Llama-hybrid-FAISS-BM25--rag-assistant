Do we have to model spurious auto-correlation in time series?

I am analyzing a data set of power consumption with the aim of forecasting. The times when there is consumption are rather sparse. If there is consumption then there is likely one in the next time step too. The result is a significant auto-correlation at lag 1 and as there are seasonal patterns at other lags too. I would say that the lag 1 auto-correlation is spurious in the sense that it is not causal. Consumption at $t+1$ does not happen because of consumption at $t$ it just happens together. Thus I would not model this relation. Furthermore forecasting such a relation seems dangerous to me. Can you point me to some reference about such a situation? EDIT: In practice and rather high frequency data (hourly) one does n-step ahead forecasts. Thus given data up to $t$ we have to forecast up to $t+n$ e.g. $t+24$. If we model an AR coefficient, then we would plug in the most recent value and $23$ subsequent forecasts. Isn't this really dangerous if the correlation is rather spurious? EDIT 2: EDIT 3: a sample of data very similar to my data is available here .
