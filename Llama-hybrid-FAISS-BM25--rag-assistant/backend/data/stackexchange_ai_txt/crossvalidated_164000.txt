Why are SVMs hard to fit?

I often hear the following complaint from people: "SVMs work really well WHEN they actually work." By "work" I mean that the algorithm will actually finish running. Are SVMs difficult to fit in practice versus other models, or are these people making a (I assume common) mistake while attempting to use SVMs?
