Test Statistic of Transformation

The two tests below seem to be the same to me. But when I tried an example and constructed the test statistics I couldn't see how they are the same. $H_0: \lambda=1~~~~H_a: \lambda\not=1$ $H_0: \ln(\lambda)=0~~~~H_a: \ln(\lambda)\not=0$ Use exponential distribution with form $\lambda$=mean Then the MLE of the mean is sample average $\bar X$, with asymptotic variance $\lambda^2$ Consider the transformation $\ln(\lambda)$, then we get the MLE is $\ln\bar X$ with asymptotic variance 1. So the test statistics should be: $\sqrt{n}\frac{\bar X-1}{\bar X}\to Z$ $\sqrt{n}\ln(\bar X)\to Z$ So did I make an error (I asked somebody else and they said it looked fine) or do these tests just converge to the same thing while looking different the whole time? Edit: I should be using Wald test here instead I think.
