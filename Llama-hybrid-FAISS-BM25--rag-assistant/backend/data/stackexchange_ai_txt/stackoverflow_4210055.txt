Let's see, in FoxPro you could use SCATTER and GATHER :-) But here, you can do this: UPDATE Table1 SET Field_one = a.Field_one, Field_two = a.Field_two, Field_three = a.Field_three FROM (SELECT TOP 1 field_one, field_two, field_three FROM some_table WHERE user_ID = 500 ORDER BY ID) a WHERE user_ID = 296 For an extra tip. You can get a list of all the fields of a table, comma separated, in SSMS by opening up the Object Explorer pane showing the table, then click on the plus(+) sign to show the folders under the table. Then just click on the Columns folder and drag it to your query pane.
