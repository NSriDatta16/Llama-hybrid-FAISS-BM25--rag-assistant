Well that's a classic AI problem (machine learning/pattern recognition) Have a look at the Wikipedia article But basically you'll need already classified data that you feed into your algorithm so that it can learn how to classify new data. But beware, 100% correctness is something that's illusive for almost anything in this field, although for your simple problem it could be possible (depends on your exact definition of the problem)
