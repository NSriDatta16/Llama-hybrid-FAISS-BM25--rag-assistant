In-browser Silverlight apps are constrained by the sandbox, so from a file I/O perspective it's not much different from SL3 in the sense that you really have no access to the file system outside of Isolated Storage. Of course, a user can specify whatever directory they want to save a file in but you cannot specify it for the user - it's 100% the user's call on where a file is stored, and client-side file storage outside of Isolate Storage must be user-initiated.
