I haven't done any fancy automated testing or programmatic number crunching, but using good old Firefox with the Firebug plugin and a pair of JS variables to tell the time difference before and after all GA code is executed, here is what I found. Two things are downloaded: ga.js is the JavaScript file containing the code. This is 9kb, so the initial download is negligible and the filename isn't dynamic so it's cached after the first request. a 35 byte gif file with a dynamic url (via query string args), so this is requested every time. 35 bytes is a negligible download as well (firebug says it took me 70ms to dl it). As far as execution time, my first request with a clean browser cache was an average of about 330ms each time and subsequent requests were between 35 and 130 ms.
