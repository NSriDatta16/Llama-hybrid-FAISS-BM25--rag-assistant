This kind of metric was actually pretty popular several years ago, before PCs got more powerful and tabbed browsers became popular, and it became harder to measure as accurately. The standard way to do it in the past was to assume people are usually just loading one page at a time, and just use server log data to determine the time between page views. Your standard analytics vendors like Omniture and Urchin (now Google Analytics) calculate this. Normally, you set a tracking cookie to be able to identify a specific person/browser over time, but in the short term you can just use an IP address/user-agent combo. So, basically you just crunch the log data and count the delta between to page views as how long the person was on the page. You set some rules (or your analytics vendor does this behind the curtain) like discarding/truncating times beyond some cutoff (say 10 minutes) where you assume the person wasn't actually reading but left the page open in a window/tab. Is this data perfect? Obviously not. But you just need enough "good enough" data to do statistical analysis and draw some conclusions. It's still useful for longitudinal analysis (readers' habits over time) and qualitative comparison between different pages on your site. (i.e. between two 700-word articles, if one has a mean reading time twice as long as the other, then more people are actually reading the first article.) Of course, your site has to be busy enough to have enough data points for statistically sound analysis after you throw out all the "bad" outlier data points. Yes, you could use Javascript to send keep-alives to improve the data. You could just poll at given intervals after document.onload or set mouseover events on sections of your pages. Another technique is to use Javascript to add an onclick event to every that hits your server. Not only do you then know when someone clicks a link to take them off your site, really sophisticated "hotspot" analysis looks at the fact that if someone clicked a link 6 paragraphs down a page, then they must have read that far.
