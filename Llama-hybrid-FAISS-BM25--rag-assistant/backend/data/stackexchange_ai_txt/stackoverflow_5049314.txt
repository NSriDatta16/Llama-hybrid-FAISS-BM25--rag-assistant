You have an interesting configuration. What would be the Disk IO for the NAS storage used by you? Make your decision based on the following: Map Reduce paradigm is used to solve the problem of handling large amount of data. Basically, RAM is more expensive than the Disk storage. You cannot hold all the data in the RAM. Disk storage allows you to store large amounts of data at cheaper costs. But, the speed at which you can read data from the disks is not very high. How does Map Reduce solve this problem? Map Reduce solves this problem by distributing the data over multiple machines. Now, the speed at which you can read data in parallel is greater than you could have done with a single storage disk. Suppose the Disk IO speed is 100 Mbps. With 100 machines you can read the data at 100*100 Mbps = 10Gbps. Typically processor speed is not the bottleneck. Rather, the Disk IOs are the big bottlenecks while processing large amount of data. I have a feeling that it may not be very efficient.
