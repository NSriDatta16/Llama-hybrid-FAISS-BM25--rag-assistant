From the PSU website "Almost by definition, it may be necessary to examine differenced data when we have seasonality. Seasonality usually causes the series to be nonstationary because the average values at some particular times within the seasonal span (months, for example) may be different than the average values at other times. For instance, our sales of cooling fans will always be higher in the summer months." https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/4/4.1 That made sense to me, the mean always changing over time which I thought always created non-stationarity. What was said on this page (what IrishStat said) makes sense to me. I think running an ADF and KPSS test and looking at the ADF and PACF is required, right?
