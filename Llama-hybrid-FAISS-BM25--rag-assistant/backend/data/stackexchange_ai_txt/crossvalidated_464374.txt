One way to find where a topic has been deployed is a Google search. For example, if we search https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=log-cosh+loss&btnG= we find a promising article " Log Hyperbolic Cosine Loss Improves Variational Auto-Encoder " Pengfei Chen, Guangyong Chen, Shengyu Zhang. The authors claim "We propose to train VAE with a new reconstruction loss, the log hyperbolic cosine (log-cosh) loss, which can significantly improve the performance of VAE and its variants in output quality, measured by sharpness and FID score."
