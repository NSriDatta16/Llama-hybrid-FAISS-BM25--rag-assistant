What's the best way to have data available when a user is logged in?

In my application I have the requirement to store, for the period the user stay logged in, some variables that's used to provide a customized experienced on how the user views it's data (pre-defined filters, language, etc.). My needed data is not more than 1Kb. I have read many blog posts that definitely encourage to not store this data in the Session object. In many of these blog posts the authors suggests to use TempData instead. As I understand TempData is a good choice for short-lived temporary data and not suitable for caching data during all the period the user stay logged. Does am I wrong? What is a good alternative suitable to my scenario? thanks for helping :)
