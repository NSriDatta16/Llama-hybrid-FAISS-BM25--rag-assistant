To resume I think your question is whether you can reject the null hypothesis that the B group has a significantly higher average game score than the control group A. For this you would have to first calculate a test statistic for your experiment, then test for significance. The test statistic can be defined as $$\frac{\hat{Y} - \bar{Y}}{SE}$$ where $\hat{Y}$ is the observed group B average score, $\bar{Y}$ is the group A expected average score and $SE$ is the standard error of the group B scores, or $\sqrt{N} * SD$. Now to test for significance when the number of observations is small we want to use the Student's curve , rather than the normal curve. It complicates the P-value calculation a bit, because you will have to choose the curve that match your group degrees of freedom (df = observations - 1), but each one of these specific curves give a better probability distribution for reduced sample sizes. This final number will give you the probability that we can't reject the null hypothesis. Standard practices are that if the p-value is
