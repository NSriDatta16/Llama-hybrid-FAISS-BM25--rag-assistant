Does Stationarity for Time Series extend to Independent Variables?

There have been many questions about the importance of stationarity and also its means of calculation here on CV, but one question that I have not seen an answer to is whether or not stationarity (in the context of a time series regression) is required for both the independent (X) variables, or is just required for the dependent (Y) variables. Many thanks for someone who can elucidate this question!
