Continuous variable significant in logistic regression, but not when categorized?

I've got a variable (age) that is continuous. It's significant for my binary outcome in a logistic regression. However, when I try to categorize the age variable for easier interpretation, by splitting it into 10 year intervals, the variable is no longer significant. Or that's to say the variable is significant but if I run it with an i. (in stata) in front, no group is significant by itself. I could achieve the same by simply dividing the variable age in 10 and then I would have the effect for every 10 years and this time around it would of course be significant as nothing had been fundamentally changed. How come my variable stops being significant when categorized?
