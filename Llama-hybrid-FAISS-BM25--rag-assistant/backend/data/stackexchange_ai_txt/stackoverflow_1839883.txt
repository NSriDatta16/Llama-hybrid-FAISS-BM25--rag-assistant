Supervised learning Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning problems. Unsupervised learning In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop, 2006)
