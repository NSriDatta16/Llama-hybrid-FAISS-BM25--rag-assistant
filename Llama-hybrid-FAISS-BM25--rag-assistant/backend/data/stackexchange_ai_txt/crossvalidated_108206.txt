Multi-class classification via all pairwise classifications with LDA

I have trained linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers for three classes of the IRIS data and struggling with how to make the classification. Here is the procedure: For the Iris data, I have 3 combinations i.e. (0,1), (0,2) and (1,2). So, I trained a simple binary LDA classifier for each combination, and ended up with three classifiers: Classifier(0,1) Classifier(0,2) Classifier(1,2) Now, say I need to classify an input, say k = [1.2, 2.3, 5.0]. What I am doing is passing this input through all the classifiers individually, which are giving me their respective scores, like: Classifier(0,1)[k] = {0: some score, 1: some score} Classifier(0,2)[k] = {0: some score, 2: some score} Classifier(1,2)[k] = {1: some score, 2: some score} In a simple binary case of two classes, what we are taught to do is to take the class with maximum score as the result. My question is, what to do in such a scenario, where I have three results from three different classifiers, and I want to classify the output. Please note that I am not using a multiclass LDA. I am just using a binary LDA for all the possible combinations, a technique which is stated here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis#Multiclass_LDA quoting the last paragraph of this section: " Another common method is pairwise classification, where a new classifier is created for each pair of classes (giving C(C âˆ’ 1)/2 classifiers in total), with the individual classifiers combined to produce a final classification. " Can somebody please enlighten me about what needs to be done in such a case for classification? Thank you.
