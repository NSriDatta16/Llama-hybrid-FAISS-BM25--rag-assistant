If you were ever, even in distant past, able to solve problems in this list , then you should attempt to study applied stats "properly". I'll give you a simple two step algorithm. First, get up to speed with probability theory. There are many great books. My favorite is the classic book by Feller. It's called "Introduction" but don't be fooled by the title, it's as deep as you wish to go, yet very well written and simple if you just want to skim the surface. The second step is statistics. Again, there's a ton of great books. I'll give you one that I used, a decent intro text by Gujarati "Basic Econometrics", Fourth Edition. Econometrics is statistics applied to economics. For a reference, a guy who everyone thinks said that data scientist is going to be a sexiest job in next 10 years is Hal Varian, a Berkeley economist. A lot of machine learning stuff is based on basic statistics, regressions etc. All that is covered in this book, and you don't need to read it all, it's written in a way that you can pick chapters in your own order. You'll be surprised to see how many gaps left open after Ng's class are filling out quickly while reading these texts. As a practitioner, you don't need too much theory after these two steps. You can keep learning ML techniques specifically reading the books in this field. It's important not to get too deep in the beginning into probability and stats. Get your code going for ML first, and fill in the gaps as you go.
