Given that you have a time series , with possible influences of trend and seasonality on sales, I recommend that you look for time series techniques that can handle causal effects such as advertising. This thread should be a good starting point, although your focus appears not to be forecasting. Try something like this: > library(forecast) > model This will build an ARIMAX model for sales, with advertising as an external variable. You can then do summary(model) to see, e.g., parameter estimates. > summary(model) Series: data_ts[, "Sales"] ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] Coefficients: data_ts[, "Advertising"] 1.6445 s.e. 0.6574 sigma^2 estimated as 575.3: log likelihood=-51 AIC=106 AICc=106.57 BIC=108.35 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE Training set -2.821585 13.84857 9.039446 -40.91741 64.68516 0.5506261 ACF1 Training set 0.003027406 We see that ARIMAX believes that each unit of advertising increases sales by 1.64. You can plot: plot(data_ts[,"Sales"]) lines(data_ts[,"Advertising"],col="red") If you have future values data_ts_ad_future for your advertising, you can forecast and plot point forecasts and prediction intervals: set.seed(1) data_ts_ad_future
