CSS for hover that includes all child elements

I have a draggable div element with a hover style. This works fine, but the div contains some form elements (label, input). The problem is that when the mouse is over these child elements the hover is disabled. Name .app_setting:hover { cursor:move; } Any ideas how to get the hover to apply also to the child elements?
