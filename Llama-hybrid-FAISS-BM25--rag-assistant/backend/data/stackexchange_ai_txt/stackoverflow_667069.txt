Since you've stated that it is working in your development environment and not in your live, you might want to check Apache's AddDefaultCharset and set this to UTF-8, if it's not already. I tend to make sure the following steps are checked PHP Header is sent in UTF-8 Meta tag is set to UTF-8 (Content-Type) Storage is set to UTF-8 Server output is set to UTF-8 That seems to work for me. Hope this helps.
