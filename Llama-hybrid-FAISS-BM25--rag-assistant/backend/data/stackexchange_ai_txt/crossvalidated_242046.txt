A Dirichlet distribution is a vector-valued continuous distribution whose components are in (0,1) and which sum to 1. Consider a situation where $X_1\sim\text{Beta}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ and $X_2=1-X_1$. Then $\mathbf{X}=(X_1,X_2)^\prime$ is the simplest case of a Dirichlet distribution, but more typically $\mathbf X$ will be of dimension $3$ or more. It generalizes the Beta distribution (which is commonly used to model continuous proportions) to the situation where some whole is made up of multiple proportions of interest (e.g. the proportions of the various components in some mixture, such as the proportions of different soil types in a region, or the proportion of various ingredients in some mixture (such as a shampoo, say), or the proportions of a document on each of several topics. That is, it is a common choice for compositional data . This distribution has the density $f(\mathbf{x};\,\mathbf{\alpha})=\frac{x_1^{\alpha_1-1}\,x_2^{\alpha_2-1}\,...\,x_k^{\alpha_k-1}}{\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{\alpha)}}\,,\: 0 0$ where $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{\alpha})=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_1)\Gamma(\alpha_2)...\Gamma(\alpha_k)}{\Gamma(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+...+\alpha_k)}$ Another common use for the Dirichlet is as a prior distribution on the multinomial in Bayesian statistics.
