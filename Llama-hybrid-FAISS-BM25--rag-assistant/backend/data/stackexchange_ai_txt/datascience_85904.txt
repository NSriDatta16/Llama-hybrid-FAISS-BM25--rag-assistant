How to score the health of a company?

i'm currently doing dual apprenticeships. My main mission is to represent the health of a company based on accounting records for multiple companies over multiple years. The part of an accounting record i'm interested in is simply the date and the amount spend or receive. We're in a context of time series . The objective is to build scores, each one representing a part of the company. I have a few indicators for each one of this company's part. I didn't find any scientific articles about it, so i proposed an algorithm to do so. Here is it : For each indicator Build the mean for this indicator for each company Use a regressive model to get the trend Compute the difference to this trend (the objective is to increase the amount of data) Make a forecast Build the mean for this forecast Use a regressive model on this forecast to build the trend Compute the difference to this trend for each company Based on this difference, build the score I know this is not perfect, but after a lot of thinking, that's what i ended up with. For the forecast part, i'm planning to use an LSTM . I would like to hear your thought about my algorithm , even if you think it is completely crap. My objective is to improve my skills and to build the best system i can. I'm still a bit lost : should i try to transform the problem and go for more classical, like a simple classifier, or should i do that just for the last part ? Well, i don't know. Thank you. EDIT As Julio made me realize, i forgot to mention one important thing. In France, each one of the record has an identifier, which represent what type of of income/outcome it is. For example : each accounting record with the id 40 are accounting charges . In this example i showed you a simple 2 digits identifier, but it can go up to 8.
