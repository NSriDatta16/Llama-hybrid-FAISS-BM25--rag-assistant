One option is to use variable clustering to establish groups of variables from which you can select a representative. This is a sort of compromise version of PCA: you get oblique components that are still somewhat correlated (but only weakly), and retain the original variables so that your model is interpretable. In my experience there are usually good reasons based on domain knowledge to select a particular variable from those groups. You mention sklearn in your question so I guess you’re using Python, but I don’t know what software libraries are available in Python for this. In R there’s Hmisc::varclus() .
