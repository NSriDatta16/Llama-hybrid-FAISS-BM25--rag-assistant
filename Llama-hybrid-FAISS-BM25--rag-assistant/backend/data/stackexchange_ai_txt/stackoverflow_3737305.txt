I had the same problem, especially on mobile development projects. I created a library that eliminates the need for callbacks: http://code.google.com/p/proto-q/ This made my code easier to troubleshoot, maintain, and enhance. I added support for AJAX, web workers, script injection, and the storage APIs. I hope it helps.
