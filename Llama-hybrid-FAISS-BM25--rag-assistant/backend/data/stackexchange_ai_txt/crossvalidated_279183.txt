Generating the ROC curve for ensemble Classifier

I have 3 classifier models namely Logistic Regression, Linear-SVM, Decision Trees as an ensemble technique. I am using majority voting as the classifier combination method for prediction. But when I try to calculate area under ROC curve in R, the function roc needs response and predicted probabilities(score). The predicted class labels can be calculated by majority voting technique but how to calculate the score and thus calculate area under roc curve and generate roc curve?
