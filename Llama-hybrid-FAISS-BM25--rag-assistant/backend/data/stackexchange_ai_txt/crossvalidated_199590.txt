What does it mean to have a small p value and an OR=1?

As the questions says, in a logistic regression I have small p value for a variable indicating statistical significance (p = 0.001), however the odds ratio at a 95% confidence interval is 0.999 (both upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval are also 0.999). How to interpret that? I can reject my null hypothesis, but the variable has the same effect on both classes? How can I have a small p value if that is the case? Here is some sample output: OR 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 1.4315133 0.9037277 2.2814700 variable 1 0.9999999 0.9999998 0.9999999 variable 2 1.3925532 1.2386589 1.5640352 Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.128767 variable 1 0.00108 ** variable 2 0.00000002594048139 *** It is unclear to me how to interpret the results for variable 1.
