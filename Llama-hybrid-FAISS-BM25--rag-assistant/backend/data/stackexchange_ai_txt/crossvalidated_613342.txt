It does not make a lot of sense because if we have enough trees what is described won't happen. The way to ensure this is to monitor how the overall random forest (RF) performance changes as more trees are added (see the CV.SE thread on: Do we have to tune the number of trees in a random forest? for an in-depth discussion on that, Sycorax's answer is gold). Notice that RFs primarily reduce variance, not bias, ie. any single base learner is "as biased as" the overall ensemble, just the ensemble's prediction is more stable via bagging .
