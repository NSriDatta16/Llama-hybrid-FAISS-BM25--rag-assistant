I was able to find some great video courses free from Stanford on iTunesU Programming Methodology (CS106A) Programming Abstractions (CS106B) Programming Paradigms (CS107) Machine Learning (CS229) Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA Each one of these courses has around 20 or so lectures so it's a investment to watch them all but well worth it.
