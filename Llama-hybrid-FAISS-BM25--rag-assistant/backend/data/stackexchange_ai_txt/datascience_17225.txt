What is search engine life cycle from information retrieval perspective

I am already aware of usage of information retrieval for search engine. But still trying to understand what can be possible life-cycle phases for a search engine. I mean for a search engine is it only about build a search engine, deploy and occasional maintenance? I assume so. Perhaps at best augment it with some deep learning or NLP algorithm. Is my assumption accurate or there can be more to it for the search engine life cycle, purely from information retrieval perspective?
