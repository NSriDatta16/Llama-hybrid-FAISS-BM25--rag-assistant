No enclosing instance of the type is accessible in scope

I have this code: Thread thread = new Thread(null, vieworders, "MagentoBackground"); thread.start(); m_progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(SoftwarePassionView.this, "Please wait...", "Retrieving data...", true); This gives the following compilation error: No enclosing Instance of the type SoftwarePassionView is accessible in scope How is this caused and how can I solve it?
