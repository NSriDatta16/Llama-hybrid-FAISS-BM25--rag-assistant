I've done this a fair few times and the solutions out there really depend on the environment (enterprise / mission critical or development). The BEST way would be the Oracle AS/400 Gateway . Here are some important links in that area: Allow AS/400 apps to access oracle with the Oracle Access Manager: Installation Guide for the AS/400 Oracle Access Manager Allow your Oracle apps to access AS/400 tables and be queried using Oracle: Oracle Transparent Gateway for DB/2 ^^^Those products are fairly expensive but super powerful.^^^ Alternately, here are some more academic approaches to the situation: Here's a technical comparison of the two technologies... It's a little propagandaish*. Technical comparisons of Oracle and DB/2 Here's a document written from the opposite point of view - Someone moving from Oracle to DB2. I still find it's useful information: Leverage your Oracle 10g skills to learn DB2... And another IBM link that has some really great information all around: IBM Developer Network Search Results Hope this helps! *Yes, I know propagandaish is not a real word.
