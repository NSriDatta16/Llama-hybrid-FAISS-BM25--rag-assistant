How to efficiently manage a statistical analysis project?

We often hear of project management and design patterns in computer science, but less frequently in statistical analysis. However, it seems that a decisive step toward designing an effective and durable statistical project is to keep things organized. I often advocate the use of R and a consistent organization of files in separate folders (raw data file, transformed data file, R scripts, figures, notes, etc.). The main reason for this approach is that it may be easier to run your analysis later (when you forgot how you happened to produce a given plot, for instance). What are the best practices for statistical project management , or the recommendations you would like to give from your own experience? Of course, this applies to any statistical software. ( one answer per post, please )
