I'd like to suggest you solution for each case separately. * The user did not have JVM installed or possibly the correct version Typically user starts web start application by clicking link to JNLP file in browser. Try to check that java plugin is installed. You can do it using java script. This way you will avoid user that does not have java plugin to start application. I know that it is not ideal solution: - probably plugin is not installed but desktop java can run. this is "false negative" - user may run application first time successfully but then uninstall the JVM and try to run application again. * The application failed to load due to a web-server/deployment issue. (For example not all .jars required by the application were deployed to the web server. * The application had a connection issue with the database or a bug that caused it to not write to the database. All other issues could be solved using some kind of loader. run application using bat file/shell script that tests that java is here before running the application itself. I know that web start runs application itself but you can create special icon on desktop that runs your application via the script. wrap you "big" application(s) using lightweight loader that checks validity of classpath and (probably) DB connectivity and then runs the application. The loader can send failure notifications to user and to administrator some crazy solution. Let's back to the script. The script may notify the server side that the application is going to start. Server starts timer task that checks in DB the application status. If application has not connected to server the server may notify user by sending message using "net send" (if user is on windows) or mail if user is on other platform.
