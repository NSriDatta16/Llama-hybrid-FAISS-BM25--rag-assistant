Yes, there are several books. Here is my list: Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach by Burnham and Anderson Springer 1998. Model Selection by Linhart and Zucchini Wiley 1986. Regression and Time Series Model Selection , McQuarrie an Tsai World Scientific 1998. Model Selection , Institute of Mathematical Statistics collection of papers edited by P. Lahiri Vol 38 in their Lecture Notes-Monograph Series. Lacey Gunter and I wrote a monograph on it for Springer that will appear later this year in their new SpringerBrief series. Our book briefly summarizes the material in the aforementioned books but mainly covers the new qualitative interaction approach to variable selection that I describe in a question I posted here yesterday.
