How to decorrelate one variable from another

the issue that (I think) I have is that I have 2 variables A and B that have some correlation. I want to use A for an analysis but ideally I would have a variable that is not correlated with B. I know that I can use PCA two get two uncorrelated variables. However each of these two is very likely to have some correlation to the original B. How to Ingo about creating a variable X from A and B that is uncorrelated from B. To avoid the X-Y problem I will provide some further information. I want to do a fit/measurement using A (multivariate classifier) but in bin of B. But with A and B having a correlation this can bias my measurement.
