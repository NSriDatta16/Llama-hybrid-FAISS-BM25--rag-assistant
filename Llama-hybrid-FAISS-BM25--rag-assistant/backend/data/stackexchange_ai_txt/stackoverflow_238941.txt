Which is the best way to handle long write() arguments?

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for the responses. I didn't realize document.write() was deprecated. Add a another notch to the learning column. I'll be taking the advice posted here, but leave the original question so that the answers given make sense in context of the original question. I'm in the process of coding some rather long write() arguments and am trying to decide which of the following examples would be the best to follow, considering syntax, readability and performance. Should I a. Keep them all on one line: var someVariable = "( Link )"; document.write(" Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are very long words. " + someVariable + " Dociousaliexpisticfragilicalirepus is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious spelled backwards. " + someVariable); b. Break them up by adding line breaks for somewhat improved readability: var someVariable = "( Link )"; document.write(" Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are very long words. " + someVariable + " Dociousaliexpisticfragilicalirepus is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious spelled backwards. " + someVariable); c. Break them up by using multiple variables: var someVariable = "( Link )"; var partOne = " Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are very long words. "; var partTwo = " Dociousaliexpisticfragilicalirepus is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious spelled backwards. "; document.write(partOne + someVariable + partTwo + someVariable); Thanks in advance.
