You can't do much about the touch area. It's all based on how much finger area is picked up by the display. You can calculate size of touch area (warning: undocumented api) but intercepting touch events and calling a method to correct for fat finger syndrome seems a bit over-the-top. Basic process is: You touch screen Change of capacitance is measured in a unique, individualized portion of the screen and sent to hardware/software to interpret (just as an aside, Apple's patent states as many as 15 touches can be tracked at once.. 10 fingers, two palms, and 3 others in case you ever make an iPhone "Twister" game) Software interprets gradients in capacitance on screen and identifies touch boundaries Software calculates centroid of touch based on the average capacitance magnitude for each pixel or point in the region Software sends coordinates of touch boundary locations into application Your app interprets as a touch event, it gets sent along the responder chain, and (hopefully) the user see's the touch on the screen
