You don't need to bootstrap. Assuming iid, suppose the probability of occurrence in a given year is equal to $p$ . If the start year is 1960, the probability of the first year being 1997 is $\left ( 1-p \right )^{37}\times p$ . That is the probability of it not occurring in 1960 x ... x the probability of it not occurring in 1996 x the probability of it occurring in 1997. Look into the geometric distribution. It seems that once it occurs, it's more likely to occur again; but if you think you can assume iid until the event happens, this method is optimal. If you have multiple datasets, you can estimate $p$ by the average 1/(average time until first occurrence).
