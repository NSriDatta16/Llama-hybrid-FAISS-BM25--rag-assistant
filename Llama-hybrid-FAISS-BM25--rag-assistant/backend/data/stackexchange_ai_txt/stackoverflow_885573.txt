I know Maven is already mentioned, but I think that even more important than using Maven is to publish artifacts to Maven repositories, so that projects that do use Maven can use them. Your project page can then provide direct links to a repo as well so it server as storage space for downloadables as well. Also: in similar vein, making jars OSGi bundles -- which just means adding a few Manifest entries, nothing very complicated -- is another good thing. Both of these help others to more easily add dependencies to your package (if applicable) and can help adoption. Some more things to consider: Sensible version number scheme (major version bump for incompatible changes; minor version for additions with backwards compatibility; or something like that) Keeping good release notes Use a bug-tracking system, if you can use one easily (Codehaus, dev.java.net, SourceForce etc all offer this) Simple project Wiki for documentation Mailing lists for discussion
