What are posterior predictive checks and what makes them useful?

I understand what the posterior predictive distribution is, and I have been reading about posterior predictive checks , although it isn't clear to me what it does yet. What exactly is the posterior predictive check? Why do some authors say that running posterior predictive checks is "using the data twice" and should not be abused ? (or even that it is not Bayesian)? (e.g. see this or this ) What is this check exactly useful for? Can it really be used for model selection? (e.g. does it factor in both, fitness and model complexity?)
