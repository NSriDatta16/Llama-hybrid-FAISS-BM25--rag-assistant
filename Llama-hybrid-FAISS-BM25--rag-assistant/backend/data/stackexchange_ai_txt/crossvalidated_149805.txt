Lag length selection for a VAR model

The model I am working on has 4 time series (X, X1, X2, X3). Lag lengths are 5, 1, 4 and 6, respectively. X1, X2 and X3 are stationary at level and X is stationary at second difference. I am applying VAR at level data to find the relationship between them. I have to choose appropriate lag length and I don't know what the lag length should be. Should it be the maximum of the four time series' lags? Or is there any other method?
