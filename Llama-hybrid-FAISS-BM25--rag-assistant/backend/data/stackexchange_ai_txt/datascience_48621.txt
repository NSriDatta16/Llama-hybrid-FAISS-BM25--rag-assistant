Column With Many Missing Values (36%)

Hello this is my first machine learning project, I got a dataset with 18.000 rows and I have a column with 4244 values missing. I don't know why the values are missing since when it's appropriate there's a 0 value in it. The dtype of the column is int64 I consider this column usable and would like to implement it to the model. Could you please help me with how to deal with this problem, or lead my to a resource to teach me how to deal with this ?
