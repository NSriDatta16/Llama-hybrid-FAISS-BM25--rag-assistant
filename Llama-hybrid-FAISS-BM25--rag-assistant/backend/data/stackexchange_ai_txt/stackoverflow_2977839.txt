If MSIE gives you a 408, and Firefox does nothing, it may very well the execution time is terribly long, and MSIE just gives up whole FF is still waiting (untill you kill it, or Apache or PHP times out). AFAIK, Apache, PHP & user-agent all have their timeout settings. I wouldn't advice cracking those up as high as they might go, I'd say that if you run into a timeout on a webrequest, you should try very hard to optimise the work done (probably in the DB), and if it still takes to long, your other option is storing 'request', let a seperate job on the server (possibly cronjob) pick up those requests and generate the reports, store them, and inform the user (mail/text/messenger) their report is ready for download. If there's another problem then a timeout, you apache error log of php error log (you do log errors I hope?) should tell you more.
