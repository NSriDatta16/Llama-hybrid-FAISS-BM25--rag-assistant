In your first example, you can't authenticate with only a username, so the session can't be started. I can't tell why your privatekey example isn't working without some more information. Is it possible that its the incorrect key for that server? SSH on the command line may be trying multiple keys, or getting it from an agent. Anyway, it easier to start off with the SSHClient class. It will wrap up all the authentication, and host verification pieces in one package. It also has an open_sftp() convenience method to return an SFTPClient instance.
