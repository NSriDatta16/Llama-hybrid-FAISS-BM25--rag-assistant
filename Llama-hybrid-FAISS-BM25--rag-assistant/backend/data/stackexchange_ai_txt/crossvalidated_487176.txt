Proving that a function is not a kernel function

The function is defined as $k(x,x')=||x||$ Norm in Hilbert Spaces can be defined as $||x||= \sqrt{x^Tx} $ . I am not sure about the feature map of this function that how will it be and I am positive that it does not exist. Moreover, kernel function depends both on $x$ and $x'$ but how should we formally prove that condition?
