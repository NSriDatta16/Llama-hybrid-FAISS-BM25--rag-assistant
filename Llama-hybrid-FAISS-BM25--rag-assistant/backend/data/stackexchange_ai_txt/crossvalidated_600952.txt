How to interpret the Scatter Plot result from PCA?

I have a project in school about clustering analysis. I have applied standardization and principal component analysis (PCA) to my dataset (I used K-means), which is about heart disease patients. I also have 3 clusters since it has a high silhouette score based on the Hyper-Tuning Method. A scatter plot has been provided below, but I am unsure how to interpret it. The PCA identified two principal components (PCs) in my data: PC1: age 0.319710 cp 0.307450 thalach 0.446012 exang 0.373741 oldpeak 0.439388 slope 0.422569 PC2: age 0.385531 sex 0.391836 trestbps 0.455142 chol 0.452708 Here is the scatter plot: Definition of each variable: age - Age of patient sex - Gender of patient cp - chest pain type trestbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) chol - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved exang - Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope - The slope of the peak exercise ST segment Here is my link for the google collab: K-Means-PCA-Standardization-ClusterAnalysis I would like help understanding the scatter plot and interpreting the results of the PCA.
