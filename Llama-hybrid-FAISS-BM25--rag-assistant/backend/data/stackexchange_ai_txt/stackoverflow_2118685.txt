How do you handle SSL in development?

I have an application that uses HTTPS for some of its routes in conjunction with the ssl_requirement plugin. It's deployed and is working fine in production. The question is how best to handle this in development, because at the moment I'm simply hacking my routes.rb to remove the :requirements key and obviously that's not very convenient or elegant: map.resource :session, :controller => 'session', :only => [:new, :create, :destroy], :requirements => { :protocol => 'https' } Ideally I'd like to be able to run the secure parts of my application in development on Mongrel without any changes. How can I achieve this? I'm using Mac OS X.
