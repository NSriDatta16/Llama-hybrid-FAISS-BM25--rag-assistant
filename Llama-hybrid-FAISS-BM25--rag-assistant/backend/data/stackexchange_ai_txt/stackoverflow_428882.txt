I'm a J2ME application developer and i totally agree your post. The costs for signing a MIDlet are simply unaffordable for open source initiatives and unless your're developing simple games, you'll soon or later end up in using restricted APIs to access sockets or Location API just to name two of them. This is very frustrating and if you consider that the permission policies are not always threated the same on various devices, the thing get worst: on some mobile phone you can tell the OS to trust the entyre MIDlet and never bother you at all, other continue to ask you permission every time you call for a restricted method. It's tragic! I rellay appreciate your proposal and i think it would be a great achievement for JavaME developers.
