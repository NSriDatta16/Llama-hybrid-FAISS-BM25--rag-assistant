My question is this: since chance performance is 50% in a 2AFC trial, is it still reasonable to use the standard logistic link function? yes. Think of it this way: suppose you fit a logistic regression where your $y$ variable takes value 1 if subject i has flue, 0 otherwise. So long as neither $y_i=1$ nor $y_i=0$ are rare events, then flue incidence (i.e. $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$) is not relevant, it will be absorbed by the intercept of your model. but in practice participants in a 2AFC should be correct 50% of the time due to chance if this statement is true and all your exogenous variables have been de-meaned, then, you can expect your estimated constant to be $logit^{-1}(0.5)\approx0.05$ Best,
