Phonegap offline storage

I'm working on a phonegap iPhone app which downloads content from the network in the form of HTML docs with text, images, and embeded HTML5 videos. I want to download these documents as they're available and store them locally, for further reading in offline mode. I've searched a bit and found that the optimal place to store this kind of data would be in the app's Documents folder. However, I don't really know how to access it with the Phonegap API. I know how to create an XHTML file from js, but how do I read/write files from/to my own app's Documents folder?
