Regression with features that are not very correlated with the dependent variable

I am trying to use regression techniques and neural networks to predict the values of a continuous dependent variable(y) based on a set of features (X1,X2,... XN), where N is the total number of distinct features. I plotted the correlation coefficients between each one of these variables and found that the correlation between y and any other feature is very low (highest is around 0.14). So my question is, is there even a hope to train a machine learning technique with these features, since the correlations are very small? Are there ways to transform these features, so that they will correlate more with y?
