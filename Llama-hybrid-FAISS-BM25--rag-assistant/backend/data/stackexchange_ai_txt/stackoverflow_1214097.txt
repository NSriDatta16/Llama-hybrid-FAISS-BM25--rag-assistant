As other have noted, PyMe is the canonical solution for this, since it's based on GpgME, which is part of the GnuPG ecosystem. For Windows, I strongly recommend to use Gpg4win as the GnuPG distribution, for two reasons: It's based on GnuPG 2, which, among other things, includes gpg2.exe , which can (finally, I might add :) start gpg-agent.exe on-demand (gpg v1.x can't). And secondly, it's the only official Windows build by the GnuPG developers. E.g. it's entirely cross-compiled from Linux to Windows, so not a iota of non-free software was used in preparing it (quite important for a security suite :).
