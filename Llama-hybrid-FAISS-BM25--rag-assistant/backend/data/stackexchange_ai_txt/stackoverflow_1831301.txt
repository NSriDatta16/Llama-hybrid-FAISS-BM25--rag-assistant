Finding Perimeter and area of a Rectangle object? (C#)

I know that the formula for finding the area of a rectangle is just length * width, and the peremiter formula is 2(length) + 2(width). My question is, whats the most efficient way to find the area and perimeter of a rectangle object made up of other objects? My Code Snippet: class Rectangle { public Line left { get; set; } public Line top { get; set; } public Line right { get; set; } public Line bottom { get; set; } public Rectangle() : this(new Line(new Point(), new Point())) { } public Rectangle(Line diaganol) { Point beginningDiagonalPoint = diaganol.startPoint; Point endingDiagonalPoint = diaganol.endPoint; int begXC = beginningDiagonalPoint.xCoord; int begYC = beginningDiagonalPoint.yCoord; int endXC = endingDiagonalPoint.xCoord; int endYC = endingDiagonalPoint.yCoord; Point rightSideEnd = new Point(endXC, begYC); Point leftSideEnd = new Point(begXC, endYC); right = new Line(endingDiagonalPoint, rightSideEnd); left = new Line(beginningDiagonalPoint, leftSideEnd); top = new Line(leftSideEnd, endingDiagonalPoint); bottom = new Line(rightSideEnd, beginningDiagonalPoint); } } I want to write two methods, one to calculate the area, and one to caclulate the perimeter, how should I approach this with objects? I know I could take the xfinal coord - xinitial coord for width, and yfinal - yinitial for the length, but is there another and/or better way of doing this with objects? Thanks!
