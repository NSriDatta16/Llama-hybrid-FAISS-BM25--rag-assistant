Conditional exchangeability when conditioning on continuous variable

Conditional exchangeability is often introduced in a simple setting with a binary outcome, binary treatment, and binary confounding variable. In this setting, exchangeability holds within strata of the binary confounding variable. But what if the confounding variable is continuous? I have not yet seen a detailed explanation of this scenario. Suppose the outcome is death, $Y \in (0,1)$ , treatment is medication, $D \in (0,1)$ , and the confounding variable is severity of disease, $X \in (0,1)$ . Exchangeability holds iff those who took the drug are exchangeable with those who did not take the drug, i.e., the potential outcomes must be jointly independent of the treatment status, $(Y^1,Y^0) \perp D$ Because we have confounding, $X$ , exchangeability holds within strata of severity of disease. Thus, we have conditional exchangeability, $(Y^1,Y^0) \perp D|X$ where $(Y^1,Y^0) \perp D$ holds within $X=0$ and $X=1$ . How would this presentation be extended when the confounding variable is continuous? Say blood pressure, $B$ , $(Y^1,Y^0) \perp D|B$ I believe this is when stratification breaks down and regression is more appropriate (Morgan & Winship, 2015), but it would be nice to have a simple explanation that extends the presentation above.
