Sounds like you have an List of AccountInfo . Are you able to use LINQ? To get the average, you can do this with LINQ: double avg = accounts.Select(x=>x.Balance).Average(); To search for a given acct, you can do something like this: var foundAcct = accounts.SingleOrDefault(x=>x.Number==someSearchNum); For this to work(and create methods for these 2 actions), you'd need to move the List accounts out of the Main and be declared in the class. With LINQ, you'll required .NET 3.5 or greater.
