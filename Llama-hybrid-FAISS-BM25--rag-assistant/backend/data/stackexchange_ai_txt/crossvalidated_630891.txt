Packages that offer optimisation algorithms with checkpointing capabilities, allowing for stopping and restarting, include caret , mlr , and h2o . Specifically: caret has trainControl methods for saving models at intervals. h2o is an R interface for the H2O scalable machine learning platform that has grid search and model saving options that can be stopped and resumed. mlr is a machine learning package that offers benchmarking with resumption points. These 3 packages all support Genetic Algorithm, as far as I know. Each package has its own techniques for preserving the optimisation state, which can be restored in case of a disruption. In order to manage the restart manually, you would need to configure your optimisation process to save the state on a regular basis and load it as necessary.
