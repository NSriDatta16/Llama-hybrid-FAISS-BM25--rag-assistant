Turns out, the issue was due to compiling for 64-bit. After switching to 32-bit, everything began to work as advertised. Not much of a solution I guess, but there you have it. To clarify, I mean changing the XCode Build Setting ARCHS to "32-bit Intel" as opposed to the default "Standard 32/64-bit Intel".
