I had a similar issue with reporting services reports. I ended using a freeware app named Agent Ransack . I'm sure that there are lots of tools that do the same thing, but this is what I use. I just point it to a folder and put the table name I'm looking for in the "containing text field". I pull of my source from TFS into my VS projects folder and it doesn't take this app long to search all sub directories and it always seems to find what I need. It's not integrated into VS, but it may be worth a shot if no one provides a better solution.
