A decision tree is a partitioning of the problem domain in subsets, by means of conditions. It is usually implemented as cascaded if-then-elses. You can see it as a term that describes a complex decision logic. Decision trees are neither more efficient nor more "supportive" of machine learning than logical tests. They are logical tests. Also keep in mind that any algorithm is nothing more than a combination of arithmetic computations and tests, i.e. a (usually huge) decision tree. For completeness, let us mention that in some contexts, such as machine learning, complex decision trees are built automatically, by algorithms. But this doesn't change their nature.
