How to enforce specific date format in T-SQL?

I have a table that contains records, with a DATETIME column. I am writing a stored proc that will take a startTime and endTime and return all records between these two times. I want to force users to provide the time in a specific format ('YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.nnn'). The reason being I don't my table contains a lot of records, and I don't want to limit the data retrieval to two points in time during the same day only (so they must provide times to a seconds granularity at least). Is there anyway to enforce this? Thanks.
