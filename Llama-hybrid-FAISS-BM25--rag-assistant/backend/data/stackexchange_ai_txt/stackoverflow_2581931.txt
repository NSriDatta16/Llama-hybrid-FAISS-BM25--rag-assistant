Is there a Delphi dropdown notification component?

You know how in Firefox, if something happens that requires your attention but isn't immediately urgent enough to require a modal dialog, it will drop down a little strip at the top of the tab with a question on it? I'd like to be able to put functionality like that in a Delphi app, but I don't know if there's a component for that. Does anyone know of one?
