Animation in OpenGL

I would like to ask to you to share some ideas about how do you implement an animation support in your OpenGL application. For example, if we would like in case of the some event fired from the user input, animate a Ball particle on the screen, how do we need organize our code? : Set Animation property like a member of Ball particle object ? (That contains a set of matricies to apply to the owner model, delay of between them, is playback animation or not and so on..) Need to have some central repository that contains a relation between a Ball particle and applied animation to it (I, honestly, would prefer this one). ? Somethihg else ...? And after what about a rendering ? How to do it fluid and fast ? (I know this is very context sensitive, but just to give an idea..)
