Very good practice is to use GeoHash concept (http://geohash.org/) or GeoModel http://code.google.com/p/geomodel/ (better for BigTable like databases). Those are efficient ways of geospatial searches. I encourage you to read some of those at links I have provided, but in few words: GeoHash translates lon and lat to unique hash string, than you can query database through those hashes. If points are closer to each other similar prefix will bi longer GeoModel is similar to GegoHash with that difference that hashed are squares with set accuracy. If square is smaller the hash is longer. Hope I have helped you. But decision, which you will pick, is yours :). Lukasz
