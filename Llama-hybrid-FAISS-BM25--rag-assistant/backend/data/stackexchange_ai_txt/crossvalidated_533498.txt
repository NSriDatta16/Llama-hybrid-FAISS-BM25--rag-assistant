Using the binomial distribution for your likelihood function is the obvious answer. The most popular way of doing that is logistic regression, which assumes $Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \pi_i)$ and uses a logit-link function to lin any predictors you use in your model to the probability $\pi_i$ via $\log \pi_i - \log(1-\pi_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_{i1} + \ldots$ . I.e. this looks a lot like a linear regression, but instead of modelling the proportion directly, you are modeling the logit of the probability. Additionally, instead of normally distributed error terms, the randomness is accounted for via the binomial distribution. Most statistical software directly allows you to specify that your data is y out of n . For example in R , you can use glm( cbind(y, n-y) ~ x1 + x2, data = myexample, family = "binomial") to fit such a model (the notation with cbind(y, n-y) let's you specify the number of successes and failures associated with a record).
