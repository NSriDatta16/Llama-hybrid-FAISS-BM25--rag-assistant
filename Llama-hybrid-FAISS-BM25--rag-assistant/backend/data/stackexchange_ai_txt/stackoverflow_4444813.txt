Strongly typed access to Amazon S3 using C#

I'm currently migrating a Windows Azure application to Amazon AWS. In Windows Azure we used Lokad.Clout to get strongly typed access to Azure Blob Storage. For instance like this: foreach(var name in storage.List(CustomerBlobName.Prefix(country)) { var customer = storage.GetBlob(name); // strong type, no cast! // do something with 'customer', snipped } For more detailed examples see their wiki . In the AWS SDK for .NET you don't get strongly typed access. For instance in order to achive the above you have to execute ListBojects and then parse the key of every object in order to find the each individual property of the key (we often use keys consisting of several properties). Is there any S3-equivalent to Lokad.Cloud for Azure? UPDATE: Due to the size of the objects we cannot use SimpleDB (with Simple Savant).
