answering my own question in case there is someone else on the planet who made the same mistake i did: in a core data app, with a property 'notes', as in Entity.notes, if you set notes as binary type, and then use IB binding on an NSTextView for AttributedString binding, (do not use the Values binding), and use the built-in NSTransformer: NSKeyedUnarchiveFromData, the check boxes on the Inspector for Smart Links et al, work to setup the automatic link detection. you may do that programmatically as well. i had my notes property as 'string', and also was binding to 'value'. double d'oh.....
