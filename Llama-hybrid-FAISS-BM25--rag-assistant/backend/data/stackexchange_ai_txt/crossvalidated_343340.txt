A set of different quality metrics for neural network classifiers have been developed and published in 1994 [1]. The reference is given below. Besides the usual correctness/accuracy measures, and their class-conditional similar metrics - specific failure metrics have were developed. The bias and dispersion measures for the whole classifier, and for each of the classes are presented. For an application see ' bias- and dispersion-metrics illustrated '. Using the failure metrics, it can be see whether some classes are more likely to be misclassified as specific classes, than a other (wrong) classes. [1] M. Egmont-Petersen, J.L. Talmon, J. Brender, P. NcNair. "On the quality of neural net classifiers," Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Vol. 6, No. 5, pp. 359-381, 1994.
