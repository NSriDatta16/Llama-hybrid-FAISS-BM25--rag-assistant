You SHOULD be running at least weekly a maintenance plan to defragment indexes and update statistics, which would make his argument completely moot. Then you have the overhead of creating new indexes, probably during the middle of the work day. Assuming any kind of load at all and a decently sized table that will impact your performance far more than some index fragmentation ever will. Very bad idea.
