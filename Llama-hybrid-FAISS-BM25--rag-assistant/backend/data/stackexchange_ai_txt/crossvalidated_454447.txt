When is a data set a time series?

Time is a concept from the real world. In mathematics and statistics, however, we operate on numbers. When does a number, as a mathematical abstraction, correspond to " time "? Any data set which includes a numerical variable can be sorted by that variable. The variable can be even labeled as $t$ , but this alone shouldn't make the set a time series. Is being a time series: a property of the data set by itself; or our assumption, based on our domain knowledge, about the process that generated the data; or a label by which we justify the choice of tools for analyzing the data; or something else (what?); or a combination of the above? To make it more clear what my confusion is about, below are some examples, along with my guess whether it is a time series or not: Brownian motion: Position of a particle at time $t$ depends, in part, on its position at $t-1$ . Time series. Moon brightness : The brightness at time $t$ depends on the Moon's relative position to the Sun and the Earth. This position is a function of time, but time is not causal to the brightness. Not a time series. Epidemic: The number of infected persons at time $t$ depends, in part, on the number of infected persons at time $t-1$ , because the already infected spread the infection further. Time series. Road accident deaths over years: The number of deaths depends on car safety (seat belts, airbags, etc.), road quality, policing, etc. These have changed over time, but neither time nor past numbers are the cause for the current numbers. Not a time series. So, if my guesses above are right, it looks as if " time-seriesness " were a question of causality. If past realization(s) of a random variable, $x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ...$ have a causal effect on its future values, it's a time series. If there is a confounder to the past and future values, it's not a time series. In general, however, we don't know about causality and confounders in advance (and, often, not even after concluding the statistical analysis). Hence, we cannot know whether we should treat a data set as time series or not. Or, do we consider data to be time-series already if time can be used as a proxy for the unknown confounder(s)? (In that case, all of my four examples above would be time series). Or. am I on a completely wrong path?
