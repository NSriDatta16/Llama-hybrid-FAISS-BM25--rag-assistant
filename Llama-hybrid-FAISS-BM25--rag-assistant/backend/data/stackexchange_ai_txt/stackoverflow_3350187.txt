WPF C#: Rearrange items in listbox via drag and drop

I am trying to figure out how to move the items in a pre-populated listbox up and down via mouse drags. I have looked at the Control.DoDragDrop method from microsoft's api, but I still can't get it to do anything. I would appreciate any help since I am new to the visual studios environment.
