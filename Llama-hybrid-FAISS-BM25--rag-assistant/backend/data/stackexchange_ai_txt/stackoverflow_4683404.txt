Updating Datatable to EXISTING global database connection

I am using Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express. I have a WPF-based project. I have a successful connection to a database in Database Explorer, and a working existing Data Source in Data Sources. I created a datatable from the datasource using this code: Dim roster_table As New DataTable("AGENT_ROSTER") I can manipulate this datatable just fine, but I cannot figure out how to save its data to my database (agentroster.sdf) since the connection is on a global level, and isn't declared in this particular window. How do I update this database from the datatable on this window? By the way, I tried creating a connection on this window's code, using the exact same connection string as the successful globally-connected database, yet it said that it couldn't connect.
