The way I solved my problem is by using Fiddler as a proxy and defining a custom reply to the server that whenever the PathAndQuery property contains the site address, replace the 'false' to '1'. Not the most elegant solution but fits my problem. I learned the most from these 2 pages: FiddlerScript CookBook A site which teaches on the specific customRules.js file and the field i needed to edit Thanks for the help, Oz.
