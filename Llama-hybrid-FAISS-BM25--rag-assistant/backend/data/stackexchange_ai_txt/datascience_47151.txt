Find closest numbers approximately

I have a table like this; all columns are numeric: TableTest Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 5 6 7 8 12 6 5 6 2 3.5 6 1 And I want to find the closest row with these values: 4, 5.75, 7.2, 6. A human can find it (row 1 is answer), but how can I write a query for a computer to find it? I'm using SQL Server but I think it's relevant to machine learning.
