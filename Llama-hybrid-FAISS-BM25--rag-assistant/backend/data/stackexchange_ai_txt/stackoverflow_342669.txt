There are several commercial and free action script obfuscators, a google search turns up several. I can't vouch for any particular one, but I'm sure that they can all still be reverse-engineered to some extent. IMO, if the obfuscator makes your code unreadable by renaming the variables, functions and classes to meaningless/random characters, that is often is a whole heck of a lot of discouragement who wants to read your code or piece together anything more than a trivial program.
