There is something even more common than what you have suggested. using swap. Basically you do something like this: T().swap(*this); since many standard containers (all of the STL containers?) have a constant time swap method, this is a nice and simple way to clear a container and make sure it's storage is released. Similarly, it is a good way to "shrink to fit" a container as well, but using the copy constructor instead of the default constructor.
