Honestly, I think this is going to be a case of trial and error (in other words Research and Development). Some things to try: According to The Mac Address Specification , the first 3 bytes are organization specific (The OUI). I would suspect that if your phones are from the same manufacturer, that section should be similar (if not identical). Something to look at anyway. You figure out a network test to see if it's a phone. So, first you get the IP address of the device. Then open a port and try to send an equivalent of a protocol specific ping (in HTTP, it would be a HEAD request to port 80), but on a protocol specific to the phones. All you're looking for is a proper response format (and connection). Good luck, and have fun. Projects like these are the best ones in my opinion since they are a challenge and get you thinking and discovering...
