It really depends on the type of project. Some people like MVC because of the SEO benefit from clean urls and allowing users to intelligently "hack" urls by making intelligent url guesses. MVC comes with an expense that you'll lose web controls and so no ASP.NET AJAX and no drag-and-drop grid from your UI library. Just to generalize, a publicly available website might be a better candidate for MVC because of its SEO benefit whereas an internal or business app might be better off having the time used to develop other areas. Then again, if all you want is clean URLs, you can implement the same thing without MVC by means of URL rewriting, http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/02/26/tip-trick-url-rewriting-with-asp-net.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972974.aspx So as far as 'disadvantage' in using MVC, it might be more of a personal one in that, Do you want to undergo the learning curve in doing MVC? Do you rely on controls? Can you code the same thing through good ol' fashioned HTML, CSS? Might you be 'wasting time' in doing MVC when a better part of your project would benefit from the coding time? If all you're looking at is SEO, is URL rewriting a better approach for your needs? I'd say the disadvantages are really relative to the developer and project.
