There are two big pieces that you're talking about here: parsing XML, and persistence with Core Data. (1) I have had some success using this wrapper around NSXMLParser to read XML files. I've heard of but have not used more recent libraries, but this may provide a starting point for you. The linked article is quite thorough about usage. (2) The first thing you will want to do with Core Data is create a new data model. From there, you can create an model class (with @dynamic properties) to easily interact with your database through Core Data (using things like NSManagedObjectContext and its ilk). You can get a gentle introduction here , or jump in a little further along here . Implementing Core Data is non-trivial, especially for newer developers. I'd encourage you to seek out tutorials on particular topics as they arise.
