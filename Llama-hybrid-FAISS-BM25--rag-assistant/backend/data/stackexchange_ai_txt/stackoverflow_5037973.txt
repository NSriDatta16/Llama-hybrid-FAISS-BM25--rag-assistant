How to move a team from waterfall development model to scrum model ? Strategizing Phase: Well, the first step off course is the thought for change. Then comes the buy-in from the Management, and the Product Development Teams. Release Planning and Virtual Product Discovery: Ideally, you would start by identifying all stakeholders and identifying all the requirements by using the Agile Release planning method - which is a really lean way of doing Release Planning. You would identify virtual products at this stage if not already identified. Team Forming and Infrastructure: Next step would be forming cross functional teams based on what virtual products need to be built. This step can be tough. It may require RE-organization. Cross functional teams mean there will be no requirements gathering team, or software development team, or QA team. You would have to pull a experienced lot of people from each department to form a cross functional team. A Scrum Master and a Product for each team will have to be appointed. Basic infrastructure will need to be established for the cross functional teams to operate smoothly, without interruption. Start Sprinting With Team(s): Start following the Scrum/Agile principles and have them Sprint. Capture various artifacts and use them to inspect and adapt. WALAH you are Agile! What all are the steps that one need to follow to achieve a smooth transition. What would be the acceptance curve and will it be successful altogether? Steps are mentioned above in order. Acceptance curve varies based on how well you execute the steps I mentioned above. Lastly Yes, off course it will be successful. 100% guaranteed successful. Kidding, I wish I could guarantee that, but I can't. :) What I suggest is this - When you read my statement "Yes, off course it will be successful", the hope you might have got, just hold on to that hope and take that first step!
