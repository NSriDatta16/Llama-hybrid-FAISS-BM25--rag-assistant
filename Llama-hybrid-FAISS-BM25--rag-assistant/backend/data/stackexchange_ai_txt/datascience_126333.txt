Best certifications to transition to data science

I hope this hasn't been asked yet but here it goes anyway I am an experimental particle physicist who is considering transitioning to data science this year or the next. My skills are probably not what many employers are looking for and I would like to spend 2024 getting a few certifications to add to my CV/Linkedin profile etc. I am a postdoc and have been working on data analysis for around ten years. As most particle physicists I started with C++ and then transitioned to Python. Currently I am familiar with statistics and math in general too and libraries like: Matplotlib Pandas Numpy scipy ROOT (yes, no one cares about this one ) I am looking for certifications in coursera and other Google certifications, but I feel like I already know a lot of what they are going to teach me and I would not like to spend money and time re-learning what I know. By now I can write clean, maintainable code and do it reasonably fast. I am also familiar with: Linux Git Bash Latex And I have used Boosted decision trees and neural networks to do classification of data, (signal vs background). In the long term I am looking for a job that will pay above 100K, given that I am getting close to 40 and I would like to buy a house, get married and retire at some point. I would be glad if you could provide me some feedback on this, specially in the courses that you believe would match my long term goals. Thanks.
