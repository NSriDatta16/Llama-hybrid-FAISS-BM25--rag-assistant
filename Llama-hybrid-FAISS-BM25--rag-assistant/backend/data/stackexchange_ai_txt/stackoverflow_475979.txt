It is impossible to give a meaningful answer to this question. The ratios will not be even roughly the same from project to project. For some projects the visual design barely matters (as long as it more or less works) but the database is critical and complex. For others, it's all about providing a smooth user experience with lots of AJAX goodies and other eye candy, but the underlying data is trivially simple to organise and store. It sounds like you're thinking mainly of one-man projects, but for larger teams the size and setup of the team also matters, as well as your development process.
