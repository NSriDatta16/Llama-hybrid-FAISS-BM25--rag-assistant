Android Tablet - 3.0 Icon set/Guidelines

The latest version of Android is 3.0 Honeycomb. Before this version, we are providing 3 resolutions images for the application,i.e. hdpi, mdpi and ldpi. But, what are the icon resolutions for the 3.0 Honeycomb? or the same icon resolutions works with Honeycomb version as well. (Because tablet are of large screen i.e. Extra high density (320), xhdpi) I have already gone through SDK: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html , http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html , but failed to find solutions.
