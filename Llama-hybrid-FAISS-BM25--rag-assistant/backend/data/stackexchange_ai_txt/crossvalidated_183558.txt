Finding causality and cross correlation of multiple variables in time series

I'm new to time series. I have 24 variables in a monthly measured time series from 2009 to 2015. The time series measures how much production data that is registered in a ERP system and are intercorrelated some more than others. It has a nice upwards trend for almost all variables. Being internal company data the variables are measured in a "closed environment" and I know that variables outside the environment has no importance. Is there a way without using tedious cross correlation for each case to determine the causality and cross correlation for all? I thought of factor analysis but is this possible/reasonable for this time series data? Essentially I want to get a overview of the relationships with R and make a "basic" easy to use simulation tool in excel.
