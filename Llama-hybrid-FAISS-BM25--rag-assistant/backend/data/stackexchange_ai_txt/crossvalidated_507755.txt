You can have a look at this paper: CorrGAN: Sampling Realistic Financial Correlation Matrices Using Generative Adversarial Networks The idea is to use a Generative Adversarial Network to learn the empirical structure in your matrices. Then, one is able to sample from this empirical distribution of correlation matrices. For example, output of the model trained on financial correlation matrices (correlations between S&P 500 stocks returns): You can find an example how to use such model here, on this Google Colab .
