Eclipse has a built in Web Service explorer that may be enough for your needs. Open the JavaEE Perspective Click "Run", then "Launch the Web Services Explorer" Click the WSDL Page icon in the top right corner Click "WSDL Main" and enter your WSDL URL. This will allow you to use a UI to enter in your parameter values but also switch back to the raw request and response xml if necessary.
