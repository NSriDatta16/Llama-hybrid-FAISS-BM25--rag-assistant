SHOUTcast doesn't support SSL. The service on port 8000 is an unencrypted server for HTTP and ICY (the rather pointless SHOUTcast native streaming protocol, which is almost but not quite HTTP). The ssl_error_rx_record_too_long error is characteristic of trying to access a non-HTTPS service as HTTPS. You should be able to connect to 8000 with your web browser and get the DNAS status page. If, on the other hand, you connect to that port with a media player, it'll return the direct MP3 stream. (Unfortunately, in an incredibly boneheaded piece of design, the way SHOUTcast decides which to respond with is by sniffing your User-Agent header for something beginning with Mozilla , so if you're using an alternative browser or blocking your UA you'll not be able to get the status, and if the stream's down you might just get nothing.) To listen to a SHOUTcast server through SSL you would need to set up a proxy on another port that forwarded HTTPS requests to local HTTP requests; it'd also have to be a streaming-capable proxy, and you might need some hacks to stop ICY breaking it. Probably easier, you could set up an SSH forwarded port from your client to the server. That would also be the only way to allow the DJ to connect to SHOUTcast with encryption, since the DJ protocol isn't HTTP compatible at all. Obviously SSH tunnels are no good for random public listeners though. You could also try Icecast, an alternative to SHOUTcast that I believe has some SSL support (and also uses plain HTTP streaming instead of ICY).
