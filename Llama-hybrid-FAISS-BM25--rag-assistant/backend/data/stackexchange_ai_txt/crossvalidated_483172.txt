Holding other predictors constant via simulation in R

Imagine predicting salary of some professors from their years of experience ( time ) controlling for/holding constant their number of publications ( pubs ). Question: Is the following regarding the meaning of holding constant their number of pubs correct, and demonstrable via simulation in R ? Imagine we had countless professors, then take a sample of them with the exact same number of pubs (e.g., $1$ ). Fit a regression model with only time as predictor, get the regression coef of time . Take another sample with pubs of $2$ , Fit the regression model again, get the regression coef of time . Keep changing pubs to $3, 4,â€¦$ and each time get the regression coef of time . At the end, average of our regression coefs of time will be a partial regression coefficient that has controlled for the pubs of professors while predicting salary from time . p.s. Is controlling for a predictor similar to integrating it out ?
