You can get a list of timezones from the system and compare it to the city name: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397781.aspx Which is fragile. Alternatively there are a few web services out there you can use, passing it long/lat and it gives you timezone, but that means you're tethered to the third part web service.
