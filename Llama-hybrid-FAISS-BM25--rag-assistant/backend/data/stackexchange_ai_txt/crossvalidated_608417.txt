I'm sure you got your answer by now from somewhere else. That said, QE is the test for residual heterogeneity while Qm is the omnibus test for moderators in your model. You do have to realise that the a mixed model is just a random model with moderators. In your first question I will think the heterogeneity left is that due to variance. If the p-value of Qm is significant then it means the moderator you included explains a great propotion of the heterogeneity and that the differeces in mean ratios are likely not due to chance. I'm not sure about your last question but read this http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/0044-3409.215.2.104 by Prof Wolfgang Viechtbauer himself.
