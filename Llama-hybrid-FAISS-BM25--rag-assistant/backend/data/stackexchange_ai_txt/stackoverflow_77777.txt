I wouldn't use XML for storing RSS items. A feed reader makes constant updates as it receives data. With XML, you need to load the data from file first, parse it, then store it for easy search/retrieval/update. Sounds like a database... Also, what happens if your application crashes? if you use XML, what state is the data in the XML file versus the data in memory. At least with SQLite you get atomicity, so you are assured that your application will start with the same state as when the last database write was made.
