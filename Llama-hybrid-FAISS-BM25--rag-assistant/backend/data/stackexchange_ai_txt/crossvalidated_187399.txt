The frequency parameter of the time series ts() object the number of observations per season, as mentioned on this article - robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods . As my time series is composed by daily observations and because I have weekly seasonality, the frequency parameter must be set to 7 . That means, data tends to "repeat itself" every week.
