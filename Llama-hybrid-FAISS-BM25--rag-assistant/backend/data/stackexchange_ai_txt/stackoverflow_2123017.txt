How can I use jQuery to make a validation icon appear somewhats slowly, fading in

Here's what I have so far but thing aren't really working. (I dragged the jQuery.js file from the Solution Explorer to the area of my html. $(document).ready(function() { //fade in the context of whatever is inside the div tag. $('#name').fadeIn("slow"); }); Note that this form doesn't actually do anything except illustrate the Required Field Validator. Enter Your Name: ' runat="server" /> Hint: Try submitting it before you enter something. When validating the icon just pops up. No fade in or anything. Also, I know my current solution is hacky, so I'd really like someone to tell me what I should do instead of a creating a DIV tag just for the purpose of one animation.
