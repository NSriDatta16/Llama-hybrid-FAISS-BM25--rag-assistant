I personally am a big fan of a guy called Bertrand Meyer who wrote this book called Object Oriented Software Contruction and created a language called Eiffel which endoreses Design By Contract or Contract based programming. Code Contract is a kind of agreement between 2 software entities that may or may not interact. More or less like interfaces but more precise. I am not sure if everyone should or would be excited about this. Your assumption is somewhat correct. You might want to see this series of videos link
