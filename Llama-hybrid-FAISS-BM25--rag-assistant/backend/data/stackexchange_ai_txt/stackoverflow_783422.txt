Integration test framework?

I am looking for a test framework to cover our black box integration tests. We need something that is scriptable by non developers (aka not C# unit test type stuff). The initial scenarios I have in mind are: Restore known DB Run sql agent job (ETL) Execute validation sql scripts against output DB and Run msi install Check existance of Folders/Files/RegKeys/Services/etc run msi uninstall So far I have not found anything that seems fitting. Mostly UI testing (Project White/etc) which we will be using but does not cover these cases. Or unit test framework based integration testing which we are not ready to push our QA team towards just yet. I'm currently experimenting on rolling our own internal tool for this part of testing if I can't find anything else.
