There are a number of reporting solutions, such as Business Objects or Oracle Discoverer, which enable end-users to drag-and-drop fields, filtering conditions etc. as required from a pre-designed view of the data. These work best with data schemas that have been designed for reporting purposes (such as star schemas), as it sounds as though yours have. I would be wary of trying to use such tools to report from normalised, operational schemas.
