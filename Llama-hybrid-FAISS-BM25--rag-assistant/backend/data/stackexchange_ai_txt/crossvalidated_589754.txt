variance of the sprt stopping time

Is it possible to reduce the variance of the average stopping time of a fixed boundary SPRT by allowing variable boundaries as the test progresses at the price of increasing the average stopping time? If yes, is there a specific distribution for which the boundary sequence is known to have the smallest variance?
