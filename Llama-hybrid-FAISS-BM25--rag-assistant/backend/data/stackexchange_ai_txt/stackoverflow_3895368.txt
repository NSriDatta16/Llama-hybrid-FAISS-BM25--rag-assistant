This is sort of a complicated question. First of all, I disparage you for using a global variable, especially a DB resource. I'm also unclear as to why you need to echo the styles directly in this way. Now to help you: The only way to really solve this that I can see is if you have all of the styles stored somewhere, such as a DB, a config file, or any such thing per style. You must know the styles beforehand because you are hard coding them here. So just cycle through and if the ID of your slider matches its style, print the style. If you stored all of the styles in a big array in another php file hashed with the ID of the slider, this would be simple.
