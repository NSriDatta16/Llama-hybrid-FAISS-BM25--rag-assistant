I see. Thanks for clarifying. I think you should considered or do you know about multiple imputation? It's a technique that you may want to consider here that allows you to "fill in" the missing values in your dataset with statistically reasonable guesses. Most statistical software packages have routines that will perform the imputation for you. Once you've imputed your data, you can then run your analyses on the multiple datasets that are created by the routine and then your results are averaged over the imputed data -- again the software does all that. What software are you using? One thing to be aware of is that it's generally not a good idea to impute your data when you have larger proportions of missing data. What percentage of each of your variables is missing? Is there a way also to investigate or follow-up with your sites to determine the actual missing values?
