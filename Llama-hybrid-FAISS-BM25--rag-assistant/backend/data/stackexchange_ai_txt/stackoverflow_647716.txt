If you are getting compiler errors then your UserAgentLib.h probably didn't get included. You can test it with: !exists( UserAgentLib.h ) { error( "No UserAgentLib.h file found" ) } You put the above in one of the .pro file and not the constructor.See this . If the library didn't get linked (which is after your application has compiled well) -- then you need to tinker with your LIBS += ... line, though which appears fine on first glance.
