How do researchers actually code novel architectures and layers?

Disclaimer: I am almost a complete novice when it comes to tensorflow, keras, coding in general, and neural networks/data science. While reading papers on novel architectures for neural nets, I see diagrams and such describing their ideas, and then they present their results, with no code shown. While learning to apply neural nets, I just load in the data, build a model by stacking layers like LSTM, Dense, etc, and training it. In other words I can't see how to do anything that isn't straight out of the box. What tools, libraries, etc, do researchers use to implement these architectures when the layers aren't as simple as model.add(Dense(1)) For example, how might we implement the SeqMO algorithm described in this paper? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05357.pdf
