It's probably much faster to do it Patrick Robertson's way. You can also do it with the group option: Testitem.find(:all, :group => "sortkey") using the :select option will put the DISTICT sortkey into the SQL query, while using :group adds GROUP BY sortkey . I don't know which one is faster. You could also do it by just returning the strings of sortkey as well: Testitem.find(:all).map(&:sortkey).uniq This is probably slower because it will retrieve all the items and do the filtering on the Ruby side instead of the SQL side.
