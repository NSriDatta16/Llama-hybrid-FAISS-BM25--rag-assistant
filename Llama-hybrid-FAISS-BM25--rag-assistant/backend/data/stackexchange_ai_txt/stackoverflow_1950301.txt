You don't want to search the file, so do what you can to avoid it. We don't know much about your problem, but here are some tricks I've used in previous problems, all of which try to do work ahead of time: Break up the file into a database. That could be SQLite, even. Pre-index the file based on the data that you want to search. Cache the results from previous searches. Run common searches ahead of time, automatically. All of these trade storage space to for speed. Some some these I would set up as overnight jobs so they were ready for people when they came into work. You mention that you have structured data, but don't say any more. Is each line a complete record? How often does this file change?
