Neural network & Bayesian in this machine learning algorithm

I am new to machine learning etc and found this comprehensive algorithm: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/ . However, I am not able to make out any reference to neural networks here. Also are Bayesian methods for machine learning limited to "Naive Bayes" which is included in this graph or is it that some of the other techniques can also be done by Bayesian methods. Sincere apologies if this is a completely wrong question.
