How to determine if a dichotomous variable is randomly distributed or is predicted by other instances

I have a product with a measurement of X features. Each feature can either be a PASS or a FAIL. Which statistical test can I use to tell if the failures are randomly distributed across all features? Example: You have a sample of 684 cars with 4 tires each. Each car can have either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 flat tires. Are the flats randomly distributed across all tires, or does the presence of one flat predict the presence of another? Sample dataset: Num of flats / QTY observed 0 flats / 645 1 flat / 27 2 flats / 4 3 flats / 7 4 flats / 1 My best guess is to estimate the "expected values" using a normal distribution based on the average and standard deviation of the original dataset. However, I can't run a successful chi-square with an expected value of zero, and I don't know if it's at all appropriate to estimate a normal distribution based on the original dataset. My calculated "expected values' are: 645, 58, 0, 0, 0
