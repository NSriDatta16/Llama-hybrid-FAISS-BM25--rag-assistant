You can scale your time series if you want to, fit a model, forecast, and scale back. The back-transformation is trivial, since it simply inverts an affine linear transformation. However, most standard time series forecasting algorithms don't require scaling. Most likely, forecasts on unscaled observations and forecasts after scaling-forecasting-backscaling will be identical. Try it both ways and compare!
