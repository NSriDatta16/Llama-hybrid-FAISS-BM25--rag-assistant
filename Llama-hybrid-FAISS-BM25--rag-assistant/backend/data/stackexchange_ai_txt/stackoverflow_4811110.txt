This is sort of how "Digest" authentication works for HTTP. If you are interested in learning, read more about the Digest Authentication method. Digest authentication does prevent a man-in-the-middle from learning the users password. But, it is vulnerable to attacks where the sniffer can alter traffic too. An active attacker can let the user provide the credential, but modify the body of the request as they like. Also, as you describe things, the server stores the user's password. This is bad. Password based authentication should only store something derived irreversibly from the password. I recommend that you use SSL and learn how to hash passwords for server-side storage.
