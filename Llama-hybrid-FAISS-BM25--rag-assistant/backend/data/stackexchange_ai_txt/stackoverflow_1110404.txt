Remove Elements from a HashSet while Iterating

So, if I try to remove elements from a Java HashSet while iterating, I get a ConcurrentModificationException . What is the best way to remove a subset of the elements from a HashSet as in the following example? Set set = new HashSet (); for(int i = 0; i Here is a solution, but I don't think it's very elegant: Set set = new HashSet (); Collection removeCandidates = new LinkedList (); for(int i = 0; i Thanks!
