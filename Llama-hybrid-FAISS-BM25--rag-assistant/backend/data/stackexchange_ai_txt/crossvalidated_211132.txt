Diagnostics for generalized additive model vs linear model

I am doing an analysis in R and I have the model: lm(birthrate~education+employment+lo(latitude, longitude),data=data2). It seems to be a generalized additive model, can I still use the usual diagnostic plots (the four default ones are residuals-vs-fitted, normal-QQ, scale-location, residuals-vs-leverage with Cook's-distance contours marked on) to assess the model's validity?
