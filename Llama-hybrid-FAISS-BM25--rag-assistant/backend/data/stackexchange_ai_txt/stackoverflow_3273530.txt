How to draw shapes on top of Silverlight multiscaleimage?

There is a multiscale image with deepzoom image as a source. Now I need to allow users to draw poligons and lines on top of the multiscalimage in such a way that the shapes will follow drag and zoom to scale accordingly. I tried to add a canvas in addition to the multiscaleimage but can't figure out how to make them stick to each other on zoom or drags. If you have done any user shape drawing on top of deepzoom image, please share your methods. Thanks, Val
