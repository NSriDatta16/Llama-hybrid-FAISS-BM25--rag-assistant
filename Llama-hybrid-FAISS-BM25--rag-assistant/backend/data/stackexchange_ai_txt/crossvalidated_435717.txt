To construct a feature space, do I have to involve all the features?

In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. The vector space associated with these vectors is often called the feature space. Consider the titanic dataset , Pclass can take on {1, 2, 3}, sex can take on {'male','female'} ... is it reasonable to say the feature space of Pclass is the set {1, 2, 3}? or I have to involve all the features in the dataset, such as Pclass, set, Name, ...
