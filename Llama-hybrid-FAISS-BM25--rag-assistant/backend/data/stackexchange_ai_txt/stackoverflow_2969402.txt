As Simon pointed out, the CSS @font-face declaration can be used to implement traditionally non-web-safe fonts on your site. If you want to try it yourself, definitely check out Paul Irish's now famous bulletproof font face implementation , which links to FontSquirrel's font file generator . It's now supported cross-browser with the right implementation, although with most fonts you'll have to deal with licensing, and consistent rendering is still an issue. The site you asked about though uses Typekit , one of several new services that will host and serve font files for you (for a fee), and offers you an easy implementation that masks the complications of @font-face. Google's Font API is similar, although it's free and only hosts/serves a small selection of free fonts. Also, non-native alternative techniques for embedding fonts have been around for a while (although they wouldn't be indicated in the CSS), see cufon and sIFR .
