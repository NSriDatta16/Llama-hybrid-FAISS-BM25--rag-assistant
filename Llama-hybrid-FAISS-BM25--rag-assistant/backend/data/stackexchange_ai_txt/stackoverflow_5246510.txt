In C++ (14882:2003), this is split between two paragraphs: 9.5[class.union]/1 Each data member is allocated as if it were the sole member of a struct. 9.2[class.mem]/17 A pointer to a POD-struct object, suitably converted using a reinterpret_cast, points to its initial member (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides) and vice versa. I haven't heard of a cross-reference between C and C++ like that, it may be non-trivial, as this example shows.
