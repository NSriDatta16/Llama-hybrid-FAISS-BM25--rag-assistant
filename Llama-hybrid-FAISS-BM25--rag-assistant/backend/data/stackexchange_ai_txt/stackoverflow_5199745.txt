RESTful services are supposed to be stateless, so yes a client does need to provide authentication credentials every time it calls a RESTful service. There is no real benefit to replacing username/password with some kind of hash or token or session ID. All are just different forms of authentication that must be validated against some bit of data in persistent storage. The drawback of sessions and tokens is that they violate the statelessness requirement. If database performance is an issue then use memcached or some other high-performance data cache. You'll probably find that ALL of your database access benefits from this, not just retrieving auth credentials. Finally, there's no problem with sending username/password every time as long as you're doing it over HTTPS. Never, ever send important auth credentials over plain text HTTP.
