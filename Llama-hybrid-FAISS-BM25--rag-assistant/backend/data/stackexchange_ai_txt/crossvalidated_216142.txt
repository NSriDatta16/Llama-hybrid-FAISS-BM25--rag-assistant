Neural Network for Forecasting Time series

I have a dataset of monthly sales for the past 6 years. Significant attributes in the data set are: Region, Nameplate, Segment MonthofSale and TotalSales. I want to experiment with using neural networks for forecasting sales in R for the next 3 months. Using the Last 2 years as Validation data and the previous 4 years as Training. If I were to do that, do I consider Region, Nameplate, Segment and MonthofSale as Inputs? And do a 4 -3-1 network? Or did I get the whole concepts of inputs wrong? Any pointers on this will greatly be appreciated. Thanks & Regards, B
