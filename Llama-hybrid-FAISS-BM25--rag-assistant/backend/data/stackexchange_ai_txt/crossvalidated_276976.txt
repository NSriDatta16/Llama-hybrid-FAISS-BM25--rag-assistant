Meant this as a comment, but it grew quite long. Yeah, it's not all lost. You didn't really detail the problem and the data available to you, but I'll try to give an informed opinion here. Actually, the low correlations themselves do not mean anything. You have to keep in mind correlation is a measure of linear association, so you get low values for strongly non-linear association which can be captured by learning algorithms. Besides that, you are probably using all independent variables at once in your model, so you can expect to have a better performance than using any of them separately. You didn't test the predictive power of interactions as well. And also keep in mind non-linear algorithms may find some underlying organization that's not obvious looking at the variables. Above everything else, you can't really know beforehand how your model will operate, you have to test it , so good luck!
