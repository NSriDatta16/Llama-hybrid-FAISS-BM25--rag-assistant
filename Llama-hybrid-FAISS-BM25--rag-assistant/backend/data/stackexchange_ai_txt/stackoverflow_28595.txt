Folders in StarTeam can be renamed to match the filesystem moves by right clicking the folder and going to Properties. If you created new nesting levels, you will have to create those folders normally. If you moved files between existing folders, you can move those in StarTeam by dragging them from the file window on the right to the new folder on the left. Files can be renamed to match a new name in StarTeam the same way folders are, right click the file and select Properties. As a fellow StarTeam user, my condolences go out to you.
