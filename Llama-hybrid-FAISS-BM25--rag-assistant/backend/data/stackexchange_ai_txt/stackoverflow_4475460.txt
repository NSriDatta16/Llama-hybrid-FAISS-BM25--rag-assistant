jQuery Change All HTML IF that HTML = Something

So essentially I have a ton of paragraph tags that contain non-breaking spaces. While I know, removing them and correcting the issue is the real concern - I'm working on a bandaid fix to auto-remove them after the page loads via jQuery. Essentially I have: &nbsp; Several hundred times in a page. I want to remove them all via jQuery but of course not remove all the other paragraphs on the page which don't solely contain non-breaking spaces. This should be fairly simple but for some reason I'm not getting it; something like: if($.trim($('p').html()) == '&nbsp;'){ $(this).remove(); } That is only hitting the first paragraph on the page, I need to hit all of them.
