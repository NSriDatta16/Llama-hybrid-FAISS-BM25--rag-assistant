Calculating patient-years from average follow-up

I need to estimate patient-years for some studies, in which this data is not reported. However, I do have total population and mean follow-up. Would it be suitable to estimate the number of patient-years by multiplying the total number of patients for the average follow-up time? For example: 100 patients, with a mean follow-up of 2.2 years = 220 patient-years. Thank you in advance.
