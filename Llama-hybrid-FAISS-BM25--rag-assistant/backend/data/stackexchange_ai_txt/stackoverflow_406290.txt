If you can touch the system's proxy configuration (which is used by many applications) or, if the app doesn't heed that setting, touch the application's configuration to use a proxy of your choice, you can create a HTTP proxy that would do the job for you. If you just want to profile, there is a ready made tool that behaves like this and is very nice, Fiddler . Else you'd have to go deeper into the network stack and implement something like a sniffer/firewall, for instance using WinPcap . That's a lot harder to do.
