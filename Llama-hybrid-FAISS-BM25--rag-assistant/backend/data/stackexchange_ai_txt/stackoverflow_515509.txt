MVC Namespace organisation

Hoping the SO community can help to resolve a debate in the office. At the moment our conclusion is 'it depends' ! In MVC, how do you organise your namespaces? Option A Do you go down the MS ASP.NET MVC route of having a Models, Controllers and Views namespace? Option B Or do you separate each MVC triad into it's logical 'function', for example: Feature A FeatureAModel FeatureAController Types IFeatureAView (interface - so that controller DOESN'T ref a concrete View) View FeatureAView (concrete) We can see the point of both. I like Option B as it structures my projects in studio better - at a glance I can see where everything is as it's grouped by Feature. But Option A gives us an easier scaling option if we want to move all our Models out into a service layer in the future, for example. All thoughts welcome!
