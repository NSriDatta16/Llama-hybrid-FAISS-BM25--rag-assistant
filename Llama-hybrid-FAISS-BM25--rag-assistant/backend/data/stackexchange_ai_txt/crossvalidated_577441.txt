How to parametrize a beta prior for a sequential Bayesian analysis of a proportion?

I'm developing a decision rule for a study using an interim analysis with a Bayesian characterization of the event probability. At a certain point, we will perform a planned stop, and only proceed with the study if it meets certain benchmarks. I'm interested in ensuring that the probability that the posterior exceeds a threshold is $\beta = 0.8$ or higher. This is implemented in the R package ph2bayes , but the citations and literature don't get into the nitty gritty of using an informative prior. Suppose at my planned interim, I have 0 events out of 5 observations, and I will enroll 20 if I meet the "go" criterion, and I would like the posterior probability of the proportion being 30% or higher to be 80%. How can I use 0 and 5 to define the shape and scale parameters of a beta distribution to describe binomial likelihood of the proportion as a prior?
