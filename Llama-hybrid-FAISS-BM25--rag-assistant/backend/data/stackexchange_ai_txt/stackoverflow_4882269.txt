Angles Integers that overflow are elegant tools for measuring angles. You have 0 == 0 degrees, 0xFFFFFFFF == 359.999.... degrees. Its very convenient, because as 32 bit integers you can add/subtract angles (350 degrees plus 20 degrees ends up overflowing wrapping back around to 10 degrees). Also you can decide to treat the 32 bit integer as signed (-180 to 180 degrees) and unsigned (0 to 360). 0xFFFFFFF equates to -179.999..., which equates to 359.999..., which is equivelent. Very elegent.
