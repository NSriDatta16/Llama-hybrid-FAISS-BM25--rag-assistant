You have to use ".html()": var contents = $('#frag').html(); Personally I think that's silly, and that ".text()" should work, but I logged a bug on the issue and the jQuery people declined to fix it. Also, the value of the "type" attribute is in fact not a big deal, but you definitely need to set it to something , and not (of course) the actual JavaScript type.
