Difference between marginal and conditional treatment effect? Relating to regression vs. propensity score methods

Peter Austin has a nice introduction to propensity score methods (citation below), and he states that one of the differences between PS methods and plain regression is that PS methods give you a marginal treatment effect, while regression gives you a conditional treatment effect. He defines conditional and marginal treatment effects as thus: "A conditional treatment effect is the average effect of treatment on the individual. A marginal treatment effect is the average effect of treatment on the population." OK, I understand his definition, but why does regression give you the treatment effect on the individual, and what are the practical implications of that when a clinician is interpreting one study that estimated treatment effect with regression vs. another study that estimated treatment effect with PS methods?
