If results reported by SPSS are on the scale of the linear predictor, then when you exponentiate the Mean values provided you would get expected values of your count outcome variable. For example, if your count outcome variable Y is number of headaches in the past month and your only predictor variable is Gender (with levels Male and Female, say), your SPSS output should provide enough information for you to retrieve the expected number of headaches in the past month for males and the expected number of headaches in the past month for females. If the model were to include Age (in years) in addition to Gender, then your SPSS output should provide enough information for you to retrieve the expected number of headaches in the past month for males with a "typical" age and the expected number of headaches in the past month for females for females with a "typical" age, where the "typical" age could be the average age of the subjects in your study (regardless of their gender). I don't know what SPSS considers to be "typical" for this type of calculations. Someone who knows SPSS can provide further help, but you need to specify in your question further details about your Poisson regression model, including 1. what predictors it includes and how they are coded and 2. what outcome variable it includes.
