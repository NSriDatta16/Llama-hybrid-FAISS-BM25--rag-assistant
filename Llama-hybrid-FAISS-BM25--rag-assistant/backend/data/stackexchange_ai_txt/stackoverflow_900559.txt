Recommended Resources for Data Compression Research

I'm looking for recommended resources on data compression; any studies on techniques, data structure and/or algorithms; any useful resources related to research, any books, organizations or any other information would be helpful. I know it's kind of a general query, but just interested in expanding my knowledge on the subject matter.
