Another Eclipse/Android/version control system question

I saw the question in this post and I have a similar but perhaps more detailed question. I have just installed SVN and Subversive and I added an existing project to a repository. Then I checked out the project and opened it. Unfortunately, in Eclipse, the Subversive layout has taken over the Android layout in the Project Explorer view and I'm not too happy about that. In other words, the Android layout organizes the project under src, gen, assests, res, and other nodes, whereas the Subversive layout organizes the project strictly by the folder structure under the repository. Is there any way to use a source control plug-in AND keep the Android layout? If not, I may just resort to removing the Eclipse version control plug-in and manually use TortoiseSVN.
