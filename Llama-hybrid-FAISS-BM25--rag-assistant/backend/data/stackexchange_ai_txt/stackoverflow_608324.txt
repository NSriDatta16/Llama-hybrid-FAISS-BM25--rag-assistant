One way would be to create a TStringList, and have each item's object point to another TList (or TStringList) which would contain all of your values. If the topmost string list is sorted, then retrieval is just a binary search away. To add items to your topmost list, use something like the following (SList = TStringList): Id := SList.AddObject( Key1, tStringList.Create ); InnerList := tStringList(SList.Objects[id]); // for each child in list InnerList.add( value ); When its time to dispose the list, make sure you free each of the inner lists also. for i := 0 to SList.count-1 do begin if Assigned(SList.Objects[i]) then SList.Objects[i].free; SList.Objects[i] := nil; end; FreeAndNil(SList);
