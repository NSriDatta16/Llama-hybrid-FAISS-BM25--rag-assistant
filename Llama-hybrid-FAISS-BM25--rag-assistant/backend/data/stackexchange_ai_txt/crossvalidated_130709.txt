In the $2\times 2$ case the distributional assumption is given by two independent binomial random variables $X_1 \sim Bin(n_1, \theta_1)$ and $X_2 \sim Bin(n_2, \theta_2)$. The null hypothesis is the equality $\theta_1=\theta_2$. But Fisher's exact test is a conditional test: it relies on the conditional distribution of $X_1$ given $X_1+X_2$. This distribution is a hypergeometric distribution with one unknown parameter: the odds ratio $\psi=\frac{\frac{\theta_1}{1-\theta_1}}{\frac{\theta_2}{1-\theta_2}}$, and then the null hypothesis is $\psi=1$. This distribution has its Wikipedia page . To evaluate it with R, you can simply use the formula defining the conditional probability: p1 Or use the dnoncenhypergeom function of the MCMCpack package: psi
