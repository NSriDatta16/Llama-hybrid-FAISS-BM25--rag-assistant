The other answers are good, but to give a concrete example: suppose you want to know the average height of mayors of London. So far there have only been 3 mayors of London, so you take the mean of their heights and find it is 173cm. This is exactly the mean height of all the mayors of London so far . But there will be more mayors of London in future, and they will shift the mean to different values, so it isn't really useful to claim that the population mean is certainly exactly 173cm.
