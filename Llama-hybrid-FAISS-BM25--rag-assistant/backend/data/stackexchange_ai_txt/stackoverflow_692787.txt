I agree with Tom Hawtin's first paragraph … AtomicInteger[] will require an object per element. AtomicIntegerArray just requires the AtomicIntegerArray object and an array object. So use the latter if possible. …but it should also be noted that AtomicInteger[] is not thread safe. Specifically, the array's references to the individual AtomicInteger objects may or may not be correct if accessed from multiple threads. Synchronizing access on the array object itself will eliminate this issue, though.
