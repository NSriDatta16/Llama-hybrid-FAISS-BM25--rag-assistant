Question about the output results of Scikit-learn's adjusted rand index

There is a problem that the calculation of ARI using the Adjusted_rand_score function in Scikit-learn does not match the results of the ARI calculation based on the paper proposed by Hubert et al 1 . Please point out any errors in the calculation method or Scikit-learn's handling. The following clustering example will be used in the calculations. ClusterX : 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ClusterY : 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 First, calculate the ARI using the proposed paper by Hubert et al 1 . Table Notation for Comparing Two Partitions Y0 Y1 Sums X0 2 0 2 X1 1 2 3 Sums 3 2 The formula for calculating ARI is shown below. Next, the ARI is calculated using Scikit-learn[2]. The input for ARI in scikit-learn needs the correct label to use as a reference (Ground truth class label?) and the label of the cluster. Thus, for the above clustering, if we put the clustering labels as X = 3, Y = 4 labels_true = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1] labels_pred = [3,3,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4] The result is Using this data to calculate ARI, we obtain from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_rand_score adjusted_rand_score([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1],[3,3,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4]) output â†’ -0.08 The result does not match. My English is poor because I am not a native English speaker, but please answer me. ================================================= 1 L. Hubert, P. Arabie. Comparing Partitions.
