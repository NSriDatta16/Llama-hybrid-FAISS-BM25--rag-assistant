This is not about how to test, but rather how you identify your visitors. Instead of using IP-lookup to determine their geographical location, you should instead grab the information about the locale they use from the useragent string. F.instance, I'm a norwegian, and when I go to useragent.org I see that my browser sends "nb-NO" as the language my machine uses. You can easily use that to customize currency, dates etc on your site.
