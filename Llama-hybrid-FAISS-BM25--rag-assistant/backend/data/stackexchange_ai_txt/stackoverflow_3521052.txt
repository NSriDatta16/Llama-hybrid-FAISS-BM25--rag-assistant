Well one way (not so elegant) is to create another enum in the assembly that can be shared. You need to create some build action to clone the generated enum from data assembly to new sharable enum. If generated enum is in a separate file then simple file copy (with change in namespace) as post-build event to DAL project or Pre-Build event in shared assembly project would do the trick. If the generated file contains some other stuff then you need to do some text processing in your favorite language (powershell, c#) to extract enumeration definition.
