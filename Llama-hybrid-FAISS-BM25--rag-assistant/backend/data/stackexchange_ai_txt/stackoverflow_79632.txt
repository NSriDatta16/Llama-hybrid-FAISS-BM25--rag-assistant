I have a two tables joined with a join table - this is just pseudo code: Library Book LibraryBooks What I need to do is if i have the id of a library, i want to get all the libraries that all the books that this library has are in. So if i have Library 1, and Library 1 has books A and B in them, and books A and B are in Libraries 1, 2, and 3, is there an elegant (one line) way todo this in rails? I was thinking: l = Library.find(1) allLibraries = l.books.libraries But that doesn't seem to work. Suggestions?
