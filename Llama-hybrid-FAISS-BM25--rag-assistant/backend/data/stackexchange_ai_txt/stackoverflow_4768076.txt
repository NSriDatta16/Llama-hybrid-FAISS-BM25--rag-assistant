The size of string is limited by the amount of memory available on the server. Whether that string can be successfully stored in a session would depend on the session storage mechanism in use. If you're using the out-of-the-box file based session storage, then the it's likely you can write a file which is larger than the amount of available memory. If however you were using, say, memcache, then you might be more limited. However, practically speaking, if you're storing so much in a session you have ask this question, you're probably abusing sessions! Sessions should contain only that which you really want to have readily available for virtually every PHP request your application handles - typical examples would be a user name, user id or privilege level. When your app needs something bigger occasionally, it can go and grab it from another storage system.
