In this situation you are largely limited to fragment caching. For a plugin you will probably have to have a look at the source in order to make a call about how caching can be handled. If the plugin generates the nav as some content that you push into a template, you can cache this fragment. Depending on your audience, you might be able to push the non-cached elements to JS. You can cache the entire page and then use JS to flip the login/logout links. Really hardly worth the effort. As with any performance optimisation,. Have you measured the performance of your system and collected metrics?
