How to dynamically switch between comparing Less Than, Greater Than, or Equal To?

Basically I am giving the user an option to filter a set of files based on thier size. The user picks a comparison type (Greater Than, Less Than, Equal To) from a drop down list, and then enters a size, in bytes, to compare to. This is what I have so far: switch (cmboCompareType.SelectedText) { case "Greater Than": fileOK = fi[i].Length > int.Parse(txtByteValue.Text); break; case "Less Than": fileOK = fi[i].Length Is there a more elegant way to do this sort of comparison without repeating so much code in C#?
