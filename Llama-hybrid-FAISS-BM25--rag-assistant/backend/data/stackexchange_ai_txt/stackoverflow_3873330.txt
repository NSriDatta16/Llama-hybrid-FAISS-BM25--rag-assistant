It is really that costly. It requires a read-modify-write for each pixel. the modify operation is of the form fragment * alpha + previous * (1 - alpha) Count the number of pixels you do that on, and you'll soon realize you do a lot of math (and require more memory bandwidth). It all depends on how big your sprites are, but it is not surprising to slow down heavily when you have a lot of overdraw.
