You should only dynamically allocate variables if you need them on the heap . A common misconception (or habit) from people who program in other languages, such as java, is to use the new operator to create every variable. This is not necessary and may cause fragmentation in your code. In C++, for small variables, just declare them: int i; instead of: int * i = new int; By not declaring them using the new operator, you are allowing the compiler to automatically dispose of them when necessary (a.k.a. when leaving scope). This saves the burden of allocation and deallocation from the programmer.
