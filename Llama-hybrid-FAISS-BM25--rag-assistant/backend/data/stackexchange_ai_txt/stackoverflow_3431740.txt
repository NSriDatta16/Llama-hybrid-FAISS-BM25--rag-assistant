Your memcpy() returns a pointer to char . In the line std::cout you dereference the pointer (you use operator*) so effectively you send one char (the one the return value points to) to the stream. There is a bug in your code. strlen returns number of characters in the literal "georgia", but wihtout the terminating null character. You should increase n by one, to allocate appropriate storage for dest and to copy also the terminating null character.
