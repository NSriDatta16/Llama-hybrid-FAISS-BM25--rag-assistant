WM6.5 embedded Internet Explorer finder scrolling

I'm writing a .NET 3.5 application targetted for Windows Mobile 6.5. My application uses an embedded IE control to display content. The IE application allows the user to finger scroll around the webpage (i.e. touch the screen and drag instead of using the scrollbar). My IE control has a scrollbar and when I emulate the gesture, I highlight text instead of scrolling. Is there a way to add finger gesture support to an embedded IE control? Thanks, Aaron
