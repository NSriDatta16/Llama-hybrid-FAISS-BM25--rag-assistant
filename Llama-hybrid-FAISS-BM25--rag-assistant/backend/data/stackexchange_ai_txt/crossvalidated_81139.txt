Graph 2.14(a) shows a plane made by three vertices on each axis. The distance of a vertex from the origin is $\theta_i$, corresponding to one of the $k=3$ classes. The region enclosed by the pink plane and the planes of the axes is probability of (vector) $\theta$. Now suppose that you tilt that plane so that you have a pyramid with the pink plane, the face nearest to the reader, placed flat on the page. Then suppress the third dimension "popping out" of the page, and instead color the triangle so that the higher density region, with a longer distance from the base to a surface, is more red. That's what graphs 2.14(b) and 2.14(c) show. The more the red is concentrated near a vertex, the more probable the class associated with that vertex. Likewise, if the red region is not very near to any vertex, it is not especially likely that an event has higher probability of membership in any of the classes. This pyramid, though, only makes sense as a single realization of the Dirichlet distribution. Drawing again from the same distribution might yield a different pyramid with different lengths $\theta$ to each of the vertices. The key difference between (a) and (b)/(c) is that (a) graphically displays the probability of one draw of vector $\theta$. Graphs (b) and (c) show the probability density for values $\theta$ in the $k=3$ simplex, that is, they're attempting to present the probability density function for all values $\theta$ in the support. One way to think about (b) and (c) is as a point having additional red color according to the average height between the flat pink plane and the surface of the pyramid, averaged over many draws of $\theta\sim\text{Dir}(\alpha)$.
