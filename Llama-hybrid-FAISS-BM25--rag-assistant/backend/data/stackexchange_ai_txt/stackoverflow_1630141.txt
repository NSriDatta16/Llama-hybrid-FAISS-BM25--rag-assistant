JavaScript - Prototype

I am trying to get a better working knowledge of JavaScript. So, I have bought the book, "JavaScript the good parts" by Douglas Crockford. I am having difficulty grasping the Prototype at the moment. Everything below seems to work in my browser until I hit //PROTOTYPE Example. Can someone have a look at it to see why I cant get any output from it. (My page returns blank unless I comment all of the prototype code out) Thank you for any assistance. Barry var stooge = { "first-name": "Jerome", "last-name": "Howard", "nickname": "J", "profession" : 'Actor' }; // below is augmenting var st = stooge; st.nickname = "curly"; // st.nickname and nick are the same because both are ref's to the same object var nick = st.nickname; document.writeln(stooge['first-name']); //expect Jerome -- this is "suffix" retrieval document.writeln(st.nickname); //expect "curly" -- this is "notation" retrieval document.writeln(nick); //expect "curly" document.writeln(stooge.profession); //PROTOTYPE EXAMPLE; if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') { object.create = function(o) { var F = function () {}; F.prototype = o; return new F(); }; var another_stooge = Object.create(stooge); another_stooge['first-name'] = 'Barry'; document.writeln(another_stooge['first-name']); // the below should be inherited from the prototype therefore "Actor" document.writeln(another_stooge.profession);
