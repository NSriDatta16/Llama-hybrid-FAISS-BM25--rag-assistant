What makes you confident in your results? The appropriate method to evaluate whether you have modeled a real signal or noise is completely dependent on the question you are asking and the modeling approach you've used to address it. Many very thick books have been written on this topic, often constraining their attention to one problem domain and/or type of model. The complexities associated with model evaluation are a big component of why data scientists generally have graduate degrees. Which brings us to the second part of your question: At what point do you think you can present your work to tech illiterate superiors? Your tech illiterate superiors don't have that graduate degree that would inform them how to evaluate your analysis. They're trusting you to present honest and accurate results. It is extremely easy to mislead people who aren't stats-fluent into believing whatever narrative you want to present. It's your responsibility to make sure your results are air tight, or at least in synch with your client's risk tolerance. Your results are ready to be shared when you are satisfied that you are interpreting them correctly, and you have a plan for how to communicate them plainly. at the end of the day what makes you go "I did the right thing for my company/project, and this should work" I have built a model that accomplishes my goal. I am satisfied that my modeling approach is sound and repeatable. If I'm working on a prediction task, I also want to be sure that my model generalizes well to out-of-sample data. I have evaluated the projected impact of utilizing my model and am reasonably confident that the benefits of applying it justify the time and effort I am putting in building it. I have a clear path forward to implementation. I have a technical plan for making my results actionable, and know whose support I need to make it happen. I am confident that I can communicate my results in a way that will convince non-technical stakeholders that my results are real and assuage their concerns.
