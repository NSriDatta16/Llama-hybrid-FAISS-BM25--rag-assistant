I see, probably, my question was a bit confusing. What I was asking is: What's the reason for this syntax with the brackets and the colons? Why didn't Microsoft define it the way it is in C# - everything seperated by dots? The question came up when I saw the following line (I actually wanted to put attention on): $doc = new-object -typename "System.Xml.XmlDocument" Obviously, sometimes the brackets/colon syntax is not needed, so why is it even existing?
