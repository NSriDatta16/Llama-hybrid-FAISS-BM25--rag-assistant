Split the resources into different DLLs or choose some container to store the files (for example some embedded database like SQL Lite, Eldos SoLFS storage, AidAim Single File System storage, or your own implementation) that can be attached at the end of the executable if possible (since you used Delphi 2009 you can do that with Post-Build commands). If you choose the second way your program will use less memory since the resource section will be smaller, also depending the implementation you can also protect the images with encryption or even compress them. Only minus is that you will have to create custom loading procedures to load the png data into your objects (not too hard).
