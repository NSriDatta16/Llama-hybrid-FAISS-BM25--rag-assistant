Linear regression model with (categorical) predictor variables

I used LM model with (categorical) predictor variables on my data in r like this (I have count variable as dependent/target variable): # Fit linear model to total viewing: fit If I understood correctly in r the first category is always the reference one so has by definition a coefficient of 0. So by looking at the model result, is 68.3 minutes (intercept) average time viewing of Panelist0 + sex1 + internet1 + education1 and by taking into account the term Panelist1 the 68.4 + 17.6 is avg time viewing of Panelist1 + sex1 + internet1 + education1 is that correct interpretation?
