Average precision when not all the relevant documents are found

I can't find on the Internet a proper source that explains this. I have built a search engine that for a particular query retrieves 5 relevant document out of the 10 relevant documents. When I calculate the average precision, I sum the Precision@k, where k is relevant. At this stage, should I divide by 10 or by 5?
