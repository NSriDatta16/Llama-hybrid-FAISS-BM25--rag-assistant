There may be no paper dealing with PCs in vector fitting over ordination. However, there is abundant literature about using PCs to replace a high number of correlated observed variables with a couple of surrogate variables. Opinions diverge, but I think the dominant modern view is: don't do this! Naturally, there are many ways of implementing this, and some ways have a better justification, but just plugging in PCs from exploratory analysis is something I wouldn't do. Ask yourself these simple questions: How do I interpret those fitted factors? Can I do it? Can I explain to myself (as a starter) what they mean? However, it should not be difficult to find someone who disagrees with this message. A side note: Ordination plots should always have equal aspect ratio. In your plot one unit of axis is more than two times longer on dimension 2 than on dimension 1. This is particularly important in NMDS where all you try to find is the configuration, or distances among points, and these are distorted if you stretch dim 2. If you use ggplot2 you should add + coord_fixed(ratio=1) in your plotting string (and in vegan plot this is taken care automatically).
