Finding Correlations in Categorical Survey Results using the Chi Squared Test in R

I recently conducted a survey for Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters to better learn how DMs prepare and run their games. I have all of the counts per answer graphed out using ggplot2 which is all well and good but I want to dig deeper into the data with R and am looking for some help with identifying correlations between questions. I don't have a background in statistics but I've read up on chi squared tests and attempted to conduct them in R but with little success. I've also been interested in displaying correlations between questions using the corrplot library but all of the examples seem to focus on a single set of variables and their relationship to each other. I don't know how that works when you have multiple questions with multiple categorical answers. I was hoping you folks might walk me through how I can better analyze the results of this survey and find correlations between the data. Here is a copy of the current survey data in csv. http://s3.amazonaws.com/slyflourish_content/dm_survey_clean.csv Here's the first five rows in CSV: Timestamp,Frequency of Games,Length of Games,Primary Locations,Campaign Worlds,Adventures,Preferred Combat Type,Preparation Time,Campaign and Worldbuilding,Story and Adventures,Combat Encounters,NPC Development,Exploration and Roleplay,Treasure and Magic Items,Prop and Handouts 2016/10/28 6:40:17 PM AST,Monthly,About six hours,Home,Personal setting,No answer,5' gridded combat,About four hours,About 30 minutes,More than two hours,About 30 minutes,About 30 minutes,About 15 minutes,None,About 15 minutes 2016/10/28 6:43:20 PM AST,Weekly,About six hours,Home,Personal setting,No answer,Abstract maps,About an hour,About 15 minutes,About 15 minutes,About 30 minutes,About 15 minutes,About 15 minutes,None,About 30 minutes 2016/10/28 6:47:04 PM AST,Less than monthly,About four hours,Home,Forgotten Realms,No answer,Abstract maps,About three hours,About 30 minutes,About 30 minutes,About an hour,About 15 minutes,About 15 minutes,About 30 minutes,About an hour 2016/10/28 6:47:38 PM AST,Monthly,About four hours,Home,Forgotten Realms,No answer,Theater of the Mind,More than four hours,None,About an hour,About an hour,About 30 minutes,About an hour,About 30 minutes,About 30 minutes 2016/10/28 6:53:59 PM AST,Weekly,About four hours,Roll20,Personal setting,No answer,Abstract maps,About three hours,More than two hours,About an hour,About 30 minutes,About an hour,About an hour,About 5 minutes,About 30 minutes In attemting to perform a chi squared test, I wrote the following code: library(corrplot) d Here are some specific questions: How do I perform a chi squared test on these results that are meaningful? Right now I don't trust the results I'm getting. How can I display an interesting correlation plot using corrplot on these data?
