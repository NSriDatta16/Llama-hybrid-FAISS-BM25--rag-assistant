If you are using the 2010 ReportViewer control then it appears HTML4.0 it has been removed from this version (It did work fine in the 2008 version) if you are executing in local mode. See http://www.gotreportviewer.com/ Question: What are the limitations of ReportViewer control? A: Unlike the Report Server the ReportViewer control does not connect to databases or execute queries. Also, in local mode the only export formats available are Excel, Word and PDF . (In remote mode all formats supported by the Report Server are available.) The ReportViewer control cannot be extended by adding custom renderers or custom report items. Besides additional export formats, the Report Server offers better scalability, central storage, management and access control of reports, caching, subscriptions, etc.
