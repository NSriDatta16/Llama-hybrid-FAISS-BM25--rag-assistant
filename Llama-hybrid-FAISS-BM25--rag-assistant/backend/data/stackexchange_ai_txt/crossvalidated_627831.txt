How to interpret glmer in repeated measures experiments?

My current design is that for each subject, there are two conditions. For each condition, there are 60 trials with some slight randomization. We measure the subject response (which also binomial) for each trial. Ultimately we want to test the behavioral difference between these two manipulated conditions. Currently, I am using: glmer(response ~ condition + (1|ID), data = df, family = "binomial") I want to see if different conditions can signifcanly influence the behaviors. I did not got significant p-value with linear regression (which took average score for each subject in each condition). But the p-value is significant if I include every single trial in this model. I am wondering how to explain this. Does this action of utilizing all single trials add the possibility of false positive?
