Your problem description is not clear or at least, I'm not sure if I understand clearly. With that disclaimer, I suggest you look into two classes of predictive models: Decision tree and Random forest: A quick search on decision tree and random forests will suggest you can you discover "rules" that tell you what will happen if this variable has value v1 and that variable has value v2, etc.. Second possibility is that your series looks like a time series problem. Don't get confused by word "time". If it's just a series of numbers/categories, it can potentially be a time series problem. Ex: temperature, share price variation, even language (sequence of words). You can use regular time series models like Arima or you can use deep learning models like RNN, LSTM - RNNs etc. You may want to learn more about basic concepts of machine learning including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification, regression, time series models etc. Just one word: you may have to suitably prepare your data for any type models to work better. All the best.
