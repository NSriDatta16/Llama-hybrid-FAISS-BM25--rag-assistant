A naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions. Bayes' theorem was named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702–61), who studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution. After Bayes' death, his friend Richard Price edited and presented this work in 1763, as An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances. So it is safe to say that Bayes classifiers have been around since the 2nd half of the 18th century. Especially as Stephen Stigler suggested (in 1983, Stephen M. Stigler, "Who Discovered Bayes' Theorem?" The American Statistician 37(4):290–296) that Bayes' theorem was discovered by Nicholas Saunderson some time before Bayes. On the other hand Edwards (1986) disputed that interpretation (in 1986, A. W. F. Edwards, "Is the Reference in Hartley (1749) to Bayesian Inference?", The American Statistician 40(2):109–110). Which takes us back to the safe assumption of "2nd half of the 18th century" again, as a naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem... which makes it "naive" is that it comes with strong (naive) independence assumptions. But practically, it's the same theorem.
