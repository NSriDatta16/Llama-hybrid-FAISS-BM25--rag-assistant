Frank Dernoncourt has a better general purpose answer, but I think it's worth mentioning that when people use the broad term "Deep Learning" they're often implying the use of recent techniques, like convolution, that you wouldn't find in older/traditional (fully-connected) neural networks. For image recognition problems, convolution can enable deeper neural networks because convoluted neurons/filters reduce the risk of overfitting somewhat by sharing weights.
