I really wouldn't have a 30,000 element drop-down. The GUI is supposed to make it easier on the user rather than harder. If you have no other way to categorise the data other than alphabetically, you're not restricted to using a two-stage approach with just the first character. Make it reliant on the first two characters. This would give you at most 676 (assuming alphas only) in the first drop-down and (on average) 44 in the second. We've actually taken two approaches to this problem. BIRT (which we use) allows for cascading parameters which can easily run that second-level query whenever you change the first drop-down box. However, some of our customers care absolutely zero for nice GUI stuff (other than the output of nice 9-point Verdana and beautiful charts to placate management, of course). They prefer a free-form text entry field where they can just type in "SYS_PAX_%" to change their queries. Of course, these are the customers that know exactly what data is in their database and use values which lend themselves to categorisation with SQL LIKE clauses. Others prefer the ability to search.
