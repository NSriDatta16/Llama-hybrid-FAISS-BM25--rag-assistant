Is there a type of report or cross-tab that would display this data elegantly?

I have data in this form, Article ID Company A Company B Company C 1 Featured Mentioned -- 2 Mentioned Featured Mentioned 3 Mentioned -- -- 4 Featured Mentioned Mentioned 5 Mentioned Mentioned Featured I’d like to show, for example, how many times Company B was mentioned in an article where Company A was featured. I can write a manual query to answer that, however, I thought perhaps there’s a more elegant way to show in a grid the counts of all combinations. Someone could then see how many times Company C was mentioned in an article where Company A or B was featured, and vice versa. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this? I’m just not feeling creative today and all I can think of is the lame, brute-force, manual method ;)
