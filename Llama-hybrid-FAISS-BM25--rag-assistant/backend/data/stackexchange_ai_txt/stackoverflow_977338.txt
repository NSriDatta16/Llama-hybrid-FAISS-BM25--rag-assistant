From your code, it looks like you are accessing the objectArray property of self . Do you have that defined in your .h file? @interface DragController : UIViewController { NSArray* objectArray; } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray* objectArray; If the @property is not present, then your class does not respond to [self objectArray] . You only need the property if you need other objects to access it. If you just want to access the instance variable, you can simply use objectArray by itself, so replace [[self objectArray] indexOfObject... with simply [objectArray indexOfObject... and the warning should go away. If objectArray really is a method, it should look like this in your .h file, after the { instance variables } section: -(NSArray*)objectArray; And in the .m file: -(NSArray*)objectArray { // return the array here }
