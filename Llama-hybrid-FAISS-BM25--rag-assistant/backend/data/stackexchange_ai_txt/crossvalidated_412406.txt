Consider the denoising autoencoder. The input features to a neural network are contaminated by a small amount of noise, sent through one or more intermediate layers, and then through a final layer of the same size as the input layer. This network is optimized to reconstruct the original data which can be seen as a form of regularization. The resulting network weights (minus the final layer) are frozen and transferred to a supervised learning task (perhaps added to another neural network). It has been found that the features constructed by this process are quite valuable. This applies to regression or classification.
