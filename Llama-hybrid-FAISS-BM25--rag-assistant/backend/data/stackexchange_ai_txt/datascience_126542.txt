Choosing a cluster validation measure for graph clustering algorithm

I am currently solving a clustering problem. Objects to be clustered are represented as sparse vectors in R^N, N=10. The number of objects is about 1kk. To cluster, I build a graph keeping the largest similiarities between objects and use modularity-based Louvain method. The problem is, I do not understand how to validate the resulting clusters. I need an internal validation metric which will be computable (O(N^2) is not feasible) and suitable for arbitrary cluster shapes (I have a prior knowledge that clusters are not spherical by all means, though I don't know their count). The question is: how do I choose a validation metric for my case? Ideally, it is graph-based (though I cannot find such a metric), allows for random cluster shape and computationally as simple as possible. What I tried: Silhouette score. Not feasible due to computation issues. Calinskiâ€“Harabasz index. Not feasible, because it features cluster centroids, implying that resulting clusters are supposed to be spherical. What I didn't try and also don't want to try Dunn Index. Not feasible, because it features cluster centroids, implying that resulting clusters are supposed to be spherical. Also I have doubts regarding computational complexity. Density based cluster validation as in https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~zimek/publications/SDM2014/DBCV.pdfarticle . Not feasible, because the computation is at least O(N^2), probably even more complex. Modularity, it obviously doesn't make sense since we are optimising it. Dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering. Thanks in advance.
