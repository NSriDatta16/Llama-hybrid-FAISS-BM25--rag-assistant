Best Practices for controlling access to form fields

I have a classic 3-tier ASP.Net 3.5 web application with forms that display business objects and allow them to be edited. Controls on the form correspond to a property of the underlying business object. The user will have read/write, readonly, or no access to the various controls depending on his/her role. Very conventional stuff. My question is: what is the object-oriented best practice for coding this? Is there anything more elegant than wrapping each control in a test for the user's role and setting its Visible and Enabled properties? Thanks
