The algorithm that you describe is treating $D$ like a variable in the problem, but using a method other than Bayesian inference to deal with $D$. A Bayesian solution requires handling $D$ in a Bayesian manner, i.e. giving it a prior and integrating it out to get the marginal for $p_i$. For example, you could use a Dirichlet process as the prior for $D$ and do inference for $p_i$ via Gibbs sampling.
