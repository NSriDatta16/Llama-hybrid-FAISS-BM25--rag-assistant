load jQuery-Templates from external file?

I just started using jQuery's template engine. Which looks quite nice so far. Yet i wonder if it's possible to load templates from an external file somehow. Imagine having loads of templates. This would mess up the html-code and is also not cacheable and has to be downloaded on every request. I was hoping there is a way to define them all in an external file and then load them and store the compiled templates into localStorage. Does anyone have an idea how to load them from an external file?
