Per a previous answer here this is actually discouraged by the Android UI guidelines: An App shortcut has such text below it, and it may change in future Android releases or in custom skins such as HTC Sense or MOTOblur. A widget should be a wholly contained graphical element without a text label below it. You need to find a way to make graphics / text in your widget which are self identifying to the user.
