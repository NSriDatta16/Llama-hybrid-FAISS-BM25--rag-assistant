Toolbar buttons can not be dragged. Currently this feature is disabled in Qooxdoo. Instead You can use Menu Button. I know this is not proper way and not Elegant but at-least you can have the functionality you want. And Sorry for the second Question about List of Drag-ables, There is no such list available yet
