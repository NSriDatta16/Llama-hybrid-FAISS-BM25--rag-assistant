MVVM Light and SL3 Commanding

I am familar with MVVM. Actually been doing most of my learning in SL4. However, with a recent need, I have to use SL3. I am attempting to use MVVM Light v3 with SL3 and utilize commanding. The problem is that in SL3 there is no Command attribute for buttons. I managed to find an old article ( http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2009/09/26/using-relaycommands-in-silverlight-and-wpf.aspx ), but I am having trouble figuring out the ButtonBaseExtensions.Command. It appears it is no longer available in GalaSoft.MvvmLight even though the namespace GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Command is. So the question is how can I use MVVM Light v3 with SL3 and leverage commanding? Do I use MVVM Light v2? Can v2 and v3 coexist on the same machine?
