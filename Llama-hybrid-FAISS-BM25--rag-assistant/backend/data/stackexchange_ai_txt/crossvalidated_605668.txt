PCA - Feature Scaling

I have been reading that the features should be standardized before performing PCA but I couldn't relate to my understanding of the same. PCA try to project the dataset in the direction of maximum variance and the whole idea of PCA is the dimensionality reduction. So, If I achieve the maximum variance in less components, then that is preferred over achieving in more components, right? In other words, I am getting the cumulative explained variance ratio of ~99% in 2 components when using non standardized data whereas the standardized data takes ~10 components to achieve the same variance. So, why standardizing is preferred prior to performing PCA? Other that dimensionality reduction, if the intention is to prepare the dataset for an input for a regression model, it it better to have more features explaining the variance? PCA - Non Standardized data(2 components) PCA - Standardized data(10 components) I would appreciate it if you could correct my understanding. Thanks in advance.
