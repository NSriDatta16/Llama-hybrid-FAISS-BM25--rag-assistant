In a couple of words, you can use a variety of properties for identification of the object in QTP, and you can use Regular Expressions to add even more flexibility. For example, in your case, possible ways to address web browser would be the following. 1) Addressing first browser window (first opened) and any page Set objBrowser = Browser("creationtime:=0") Set objPage = objBrowser.Page("title:=.*") 2) If you assume that you always work with Google page. Set objBrowser = Browser("title:=.*Google.*") Set objGooglePage = objBrowser.Page("title:=.*Google.*") 3) Addressing page with particular search results sSearchWord = "blabol" boolRC = Browser("title:=" & sSearchWord & " - Google Search.*").Page("title:=" & sSearchWord & " - Google Search.*") Thank you, Albert Gareev http://automation-beyond.com/
