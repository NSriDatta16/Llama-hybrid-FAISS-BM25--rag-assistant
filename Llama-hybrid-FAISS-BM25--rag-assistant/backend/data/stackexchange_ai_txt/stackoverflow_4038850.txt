This is not naive, this is the proper way of an ER model. Separating entities with relations, the classic design pattern. Worry not about query/join overhead, RDBMSs are optimized for this and can fly through those join queries. You can also make the relation table have (part_id,machine_id) as a compound primary key. Better yet, create them as indexed organized tables and avoid any (negligible) overhead of the table data.
