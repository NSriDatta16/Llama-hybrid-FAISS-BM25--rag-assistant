Is it legitimate to compare the accuracy between SVM models?

I wish to investigate whether variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ provide any additional explanatory power to variable y, above and beyond some control $X$. I prefer using the support vector machine (SVM) method as (I) $y$ is a binary variable, (II) I want to control for non monotonic effects of $x1$ and $x_2$ on $y$, and (III) I want to make no distributional assumptions (since a logit model would impose more restrictions). I'm using a non linear SVM with the RBF kernel. Essentially, I'm wondering if it's legit to compare the accuracy of training and test data between an SVM that uses $X$ as input variables on y and another SVM that uses $X$, $x_1$, $x_2$ as input variables on $y$. Are the accuracy scores directly comparable?
