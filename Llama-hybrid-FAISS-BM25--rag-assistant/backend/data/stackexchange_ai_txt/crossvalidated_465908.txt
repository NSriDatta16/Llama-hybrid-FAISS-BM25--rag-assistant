Suppose you have $n = 20$ observations for the maximum temperature on a particular day of the year during a period when you believe the mean of such temperatures was stable at $\mu.$ Perhaps the sample mean and SD for the twenty-year period are $\bar X = 35, S = 10.$ Then a 95% CI for the true population $\mu$ is $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n},$ where $t^*$ cuts probability $0.025$ from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $\nu = n-1 = 19$ degrees of freedom. Specifically, for the data above a 95% CI for $\mu$ is $35 \pm 2.09(10/\sqrt{20}),$ which is $35 \pm 6.619$ of $(28.381, 41.619).$ [Computations in R.] q = qt(.975, 19); q [1] 2.093024 me = q*10/sqrt(10); me [1] 6.618723 pm = c(-1,1); 35 + pm*me [1] 28.38128 41.61872 Now you have a new high temperature 45 for that day this year. Compared with the historical distribution, estimated to be $\mathsf{Norm}(35,10),$ this new temperature would be at about the 84th percentile. That's certainly higher than 'average', but not really very exceptional. pnorm(45, 35, 10) [1] 0.8413447 It would not be fair to compare the new one-time high temperature 45 with the CI $(28.381, 41.619)$ for the historical $\mu.$ (Your new temperature of 45 is an observation, not a parameter.) However, based on the 20 years of data, we can get a prediction interval for an additional observation. It is of the form $\bar X \pm 2.09S\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{20}},$ which is $34 \pm 21.45$ or $(13.55, 56.45).$ So the new high temperature is within the interval of values for an additional observation from the historical distribution. [If you get a year with a high temperature of 60 for that day, then you have an unusual observation according to the 95% prediction interval.] ME.pred = q*10*sqrt(1+1/20); ME.pred [1] 21.44711 35 + pm*ME.pred [1] 13.55289 56.44711 However, if you get five years of temperatures for that day that average well above $35,$ you could do a Welch 2-sample t test to compare the 20-year historical data with the new data, to see if the new mean is significantly higher than the historical one.
