If it doesn't have much data you may have a problem. If your data on bullying consists of a yes/no variable (bullied vs. not) for each child, then @JimBoy is right and you should use logistic regression. If you haven't studied that yet, then you should either do so or look for a different problem. Linear regression (which is what people usually mean when they just say "regression") is for dependent variables that are continuous - that is, they can take on any value. If you tell us what data the example you are using does supply, we may be able to give a more comprehensive answer
