AS3 Zooming center of a dragable container with in a Mask

HI, I have container movieclip and one mask layer with the height and width of the current screen. The continer is always bigger than the mask clip. so i need to zoom the container at the center of the mask clip. something link in MicroSoft XL zoom controller at the bottom right . Does any once have the equation or any other demo links? Thanks in advance!!! EDIT 1 private function slider (event:Event) { //event.target.value = 0 to 1 // possible values are 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9, 1 // mcMask.x = mcMask.x = 0; // mcMask.width = stage.StageWidth, mcMask.height = stage.StageHeight // mcContainer.x and mcContainer.y may vary .. its greater than the mcMask clip. // So its need to be drag on the mask clip. I have placed a lots of images in the container something like map. // If the slider changes the values then the map(mcContainer) need to zoom to scale came from 'event.target.value'. // i want to zoom the mcContainer inside the mask, not the mouse cliked point, I want the current center // posistion of the container with resepect to the mask clip. mcContainer.scaleX = mcContainer.scaleY = (event.target.value); mcContainer.x = (mcMask.width - mcContainer.width)/2; mcContainer.y = (mcMask.height - mcContainer.height)/2; // I tried this but if i drag this mcContainer to the left or right it should not locate the center point. } any hope??? :( EDIT 2 The Source Code: http://www.4shared.com/file/08X5mG99/AS3_Zooming.html
