As previously mentioned, Amazon S3 is definitely an option, but it may be cheaper in the long run to own the hardware you are backing up to. For example: Buy a basic server and and eSATA RAID5 setup with 2-3 times the capacity you currently need, then install it at a co-location center. Preferably one with high, but cheap, bandwidth. This way the server and storage is off-site, but after the initial cost of the hardware, you are only paying for bandwidth. Granted, the downside to this is that, unlike something like S3, if the hardware goes down you have to go fix it yourself, or pay the CoLo people to. But this may be a tradeoff you are willing to make. Also, with this solution, you are still going to need a beefy upload pipe to handle the traffic... so there's always the "sneakernet" solution.
