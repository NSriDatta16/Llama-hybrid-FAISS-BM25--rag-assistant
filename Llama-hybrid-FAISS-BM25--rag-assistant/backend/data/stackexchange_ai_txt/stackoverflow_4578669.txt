Three simple rules. Okay, five: Most important thing, if you want to consider your password storage being safe: allow strong passwords only e.g. at least 8 chars with some different case letters and numbers and even punctuation marks Allow users to use strong passwords only. Make a routine to check length and character range and refuse weak passwords. Even get yourself John the ripper database and check against it. Torture users wickedly, beat them up, until they choose good long and random enough passwords. Passwords! Not salt, of which everyone is delighted to talk for hours, but password itself should be random enough! Salt your passwords and store that salt along with user info. you can use user email and username as a perfect salt, no need to invent something extraordinary random. Certain algorithm is not that important, you can use MD5 as well. In real world there are very few people who would bother themselves with cracking user database of your famous Fishing And Grocery Fans Society site forums.
