I would suggest you to pay attention on another software—Helicon Ape http://www.helicontech.com/ape It’s free for 3 web-sites and includes compression/caching solutions which work smoothly. Just in one string of configuration you will get gzip and cache enabled: SetEnvIfNoCase mime text/.* gzip=9 cache-enable=mem The rule above tells Ape to compress text/* mime-types with the highest level as well as cache them in memory. Just give it a try.
