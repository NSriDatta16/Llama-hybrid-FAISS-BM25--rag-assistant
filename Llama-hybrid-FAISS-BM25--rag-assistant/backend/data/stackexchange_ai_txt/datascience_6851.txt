What's an efficient way to compare and group millions of store names?

I'm a total amateur as far as data science goes, and I'm trying to figure out a way to do some string comparison on a large dataset. I've a Google BigQuery table storing merchant transactions, but the store names are all over the board. For example, there can be 'Wal-Mart Super Center' and 'Wal-Mart SC #1234', or 'McDonalds F2222' and 'McDonalds #321'. What I need to do is group ALL 'Wal-mart' and 'McDonalds' and whatever else. My first approach was doing a recursive reg-ex check, but that took forever and eventually timed-out. What's the best approach for doing that with a table of 20 million+ rows? I'm open to trying out any technology that would fit this job.
