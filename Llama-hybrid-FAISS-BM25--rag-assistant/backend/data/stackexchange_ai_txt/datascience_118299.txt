There are research lines that study neural network "lifelong learning" or "continual learning", which precisely involves incremental learning from new information. However, they are not often used in practice. A usual technique is to evaluate how much the new data deviates from the old data (i.e. concept drift) and only retrain if they differ too much. This maintains the model current while saving retrainings.
