maven 3 + pmd fails when code has annotations and generics

When I run mvn pmd:pmd I get an warning / error from PMD saying that the code cannot use generics, annotations or Enums with java 1.4 or 1.5. This is supposed to be a error when the targetJdk property is not set (which I did set). Here is an example of the error I get [WARNING] Error while parsing /Users/augusto/Downloads/PMD-Clover2-Cobertura-Maven2-Test/PMDTest/src/main/java/org/xh/studies/quality/App.java: Can't use generics unless running in JDK 1.5 mode! and here's a snippet of the pom I'm using (there's a link to the whole app below) org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin 2.3.2 1.6 1.6 org.apache.maven.plugins maven-pmd-plugin 2.5 1.6 I'm using Maven 3.0.2 on mac, with the latest java patch 1.6.0_24.
