So the 0.016 that you are seeing is the average of quotation while err is just the SSE. I'm old school and don't know how to exactly show this using the new partykit package (maybe @Achim could illustrate), but I can show you how this done using the older party package. So let's create some reproducible example library(partykit) airq 6.9 # | | | [5] Temp 77: 31.143 (n = 21, err = 4620.6) # | [7] Temp > 82 # | | [8] Wind 10.3: 48.714 (n = 7, err = 1183.4) # # Number of inner nodes: 4 # Number of terminal nodes: 5 Now let's dtach the partykit package and fit the same tree using party and calculate the same values detach("package:partykit", unload=TRUE) library(party) airct I think it is easy to see from the output which is which What the code above does is basically extract the information of Ozone information out of the fitted tree per each inner node and calculate the relevant statistics As per the P-value s, this seems like some type of printing bug, here's an example how you can calculate the P-value s in the inner nodes terNodes As a side note, if quotation is a dummy variable, you should probably fit a classification tree (i.e. convert it to a factor) rather a regression tree like you are doing
