I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for but if i need some simple flat file storage in C# i usually just use linq2csv . its fast, efficient and type safe, with the added benefit that you can just edit the files in excel (or whatever) which makes it easy. Though its obviously not suited for hierarchical or highly relational data, but it is very easy for simple tabular data and much more compact than XML. It provides very easy Write and read methods which would make it easy to sync changes to filesystem.
