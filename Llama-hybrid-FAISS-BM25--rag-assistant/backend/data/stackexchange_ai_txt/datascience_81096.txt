This sounds like a normal supervised classification task. Have you tried other standard methods like Support Vector Machines, RandomForests, Gradient Boosting, kNN, Neural Networks etc. as well or is there a particular reason why you only tried clustering methods. Clustering methods like kmeans or spectral clustering are usually used in an unsupervised setting where class memberships are not available. Often they make certain assumptions about the data which might be violated, e.g. kmeans assumes spherical clusters, which is clearly not the case for your data.
