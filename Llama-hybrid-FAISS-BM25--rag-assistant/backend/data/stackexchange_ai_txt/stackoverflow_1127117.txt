YUI Uploader in jQuery Draggable

I have a YUI-Uploader lying in some Element, which is a jQueryUI-Draggable. After clicking the Uploader-Button which opens the File-Select-Dialog, the Draggable got a MouseDown-Event => is sticky at my mouse. How can I prevent the YUI-Upload-Button from bubbling the MouseDown-Event? In Webkit the Upload-Button (which is a transparent Flash-Object) seems to not even recognize the MouseDown-Event. How can I make sure its always the first to get the Event? some z-index-magic or so?
