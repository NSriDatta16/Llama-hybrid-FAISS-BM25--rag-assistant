Javascript Calendar with Drag select for multiple days

Anyone know of a Javascript Calendar that supports drag selection for multiple days? Need to be able to do it over months as well, not just restricted to one month. Thanks a lot in advance, the ones here are no good for my problem: http://www.javascript-examples.com/javascript-calendars/
