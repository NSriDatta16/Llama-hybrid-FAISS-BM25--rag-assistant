Sampling Twice and Posteriors

I have a random variable with some unknown distribution with support over $[0, 1]$. Every turn, I sample a $p_t$ from this distribution. However, I am unable to observe $p_t$ directly. Instead I observe the results of $n_t$ independent Bernoulli variables with parameter $p_t$ and see that $h_t$ (out of $n_t$) of them are $1$. I am not able to control $n_t$ but I am able to know what it is. What would be my posterior distribution for $p$ after $T$ turns? I'm just learning about Bayesian statistics, so any help/resources would be helpful.
