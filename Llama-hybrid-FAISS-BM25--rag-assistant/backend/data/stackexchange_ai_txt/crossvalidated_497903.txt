How to reverse log difference?

I am currently doing log differences to a dataset and I want to revert back to the actual values. I'm trying to understand why at the end we need to multiply by the original value (and why we do not add)? The columns in blue demonstrate how I am finding the log difference, and the columns in orange show how I revert back to the original time series. See attached picture. Any explanations would be appreciated, Cheers.
