How would i encode certain $_GET params?

Im currently using base64_encode for some $_GET params that i don't want regular user to mess with. I was wondering that base64 is not looking too strong or is it ? I also don't want to make some sort of mega encoding it's not so much of important information, but i would not like that user with average knowledge would mess with params in get. Should i keep using base64 ? Currently it produces MQ== if value is 1 so it's quite easy to take it out from URL and decode and then insert your own.
