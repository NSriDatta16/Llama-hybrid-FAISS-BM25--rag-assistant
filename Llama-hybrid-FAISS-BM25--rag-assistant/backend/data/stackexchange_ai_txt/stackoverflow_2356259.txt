Instead of using \parbox , you can use the minipage environment: \begin{minipage}[t]{\textwidth} % ... \end{minipage} % If you want to explicitly define the height: \begin{minipage}[t][\columnheight]{\textwidth} % ... \end{minipage} The minipage environment has the same options as the \parbox command: \begin{minipage}[pos][height][inner-pos]{width} % ... text ... \end{minipage} where pos is one of c , t , or b (for center, top, and bottom, respectively); height is the desired height of the box, inner-pos is one of c , t , b , or s (for center, top, bottom, and stretch, respectively); and width is the desired width of the box. If you choose s for the inner-pos value, the text be stretched to fill the vertical space in the box (extra space will be added between paragraphs). If you choose not to specify inner-pos , it will be set to the same as pos . I haven't tested this with your code, but it should work. (I've used it when defining new environments before.)
