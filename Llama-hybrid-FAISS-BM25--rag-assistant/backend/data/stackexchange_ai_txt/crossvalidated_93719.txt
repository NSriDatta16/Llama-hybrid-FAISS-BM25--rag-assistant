Can Inferential Statistics be carried out in a Retrospective Case Study?

Just wanted to check with regard to a retrospective case study, if various data is collected for a set of patients on different variables can this be interpreted with inferential stats tests? Even if no power calculation could be made to determine the required sample size before the study began i.e. just the patients that were available with a certain pathology were used? Many thanks for any thoughts.
