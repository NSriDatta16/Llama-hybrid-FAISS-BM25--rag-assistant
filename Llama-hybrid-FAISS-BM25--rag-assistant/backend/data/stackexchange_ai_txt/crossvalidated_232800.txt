Bayesian parameter estimate when you have multivariate errors

I have $N$ measurements, $(x_i, \, y_i, \, z_i)$, each comes with standard errors, $(\sigma_{x_i}, \sigma_{y_i}, \sigma_{z_i})$. For context, these are three different astronomical measurements taken at the same point in the sky, for $N$ different points in the sky. The model for these measurements is: $$ z(x,y) = \alpha\,x + \beta\,y $$ I want to do parameter estimation for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, but instead of just the best fit parameters, I want the probability density function. Now, using Bayes' Theorem: $$ P(\alpha,\beta \ | \ \left\{x_i,\,y_i,\,z_i\right\}_{i=0}^N,\,I) = \frac{P(\left\{x_i,\,y_i,\,z_i\right\}_{i=0}^N \ | \ \alpha,\,\beta,\,I) \,P(\alpha,\,\beta \ | \ I)}{P(\left\{x_i,\,y_i,\,z_i\right\}_{i=0}^N \ | \ I)}$$ where $I$ contains other information such as prior knowledge of the errors. I don't quite seem to know how to compute $P(\left\{x_i,\,y_i,\,z_i\right\}_{i=0}^N \ | \ \alpha,\,\beta,\,I)$ when there are errors for all the variables. If I only had the errors for $z_i$, then I have, $$ \begin{aligned} P(\left\{z_i\right\}_{i=0}^N \ | \ \alpha,\,\beta,\,I) &= \prod_{i=1}^{N} P(z_i\ | \ \alpha, \, \beta, \, I) \\ &= \prod_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_{z_i}^2}} \exp{\left( - \frac{(z_i - z(x_i, y_i))^2}{2 \sigma_{z_i}^2} \right)} \right] \end{aligned} $$ But this is really easy for one-dimensional errors because the independent variables correspond between data and model. How do I do this while incorporating the three-dimensional errors (where even the independent variables have errors)?
