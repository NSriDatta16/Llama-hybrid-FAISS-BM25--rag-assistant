Let $X,Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_{1000} \in \{0,1\}$ denote the true color, and the responses, respectively. "Blue" is coded as a $1$, and vice versa. Assume that $p(x)$ is Bernoulli with parameter $p_x$. Assume that each $Y_i|X=1$ is Bernoull with parameter $p_1$, and assume $Y_i|X=0$ is Bernoulli with parameter $p_0$. Also, pick a prior for the parameters $\theta = (p_x,p_0,p_1)$. You're looking for $p(\theta,x|y_{1:1000}) \propto p(\theta)p(x|\theta)\prod_{i=1}^{1000}p(y_i|x)$. Formulating it like this highlights the fact that (at least if you're a Bayesian) you need to choose priors for these three parameters. The Bayesian viewpoint is nice because you could take advantage of what you know about how often cars are blue, and what you know about peoples' tendencies to agree with reality. Also you can generalize this model. For example what if the car changes colors, or if you're looking at a sequence of cars (then you have a sequence $\{x_i\}$), or if people are equipped differently to evaluate car colors ($\{y_i|x\}$ are not identically distributed), or if people are basing their decisions on what other people are saying, etc.
