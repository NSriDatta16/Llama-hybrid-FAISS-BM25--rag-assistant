Using previous data in Bayesian change point detection

I'm interested in the detection of a single change point. I have phase I data, $X_{-n},\ldots, X_{-1}$ , and I when subsequent observation arrive I want to find if their distribution has changed (either in mean or variance). There is a plethora of methods, some summarized here: An evaluation of change point detection algorithms . In which it seems the method suggested by Adams and MacKay Bayesian Online Chane Point Detection seems favorable. This leads me to two questions: How to incorporate the data from phase I into the Bayesian method. I tried letting the algorithm run on $X_{-n},\ldots, X_{i}$ , but it sometimes detect change in the phase I data. The second option I tried is to update the posterior according to the phase I data, but then it never detects any change later. Is there a non-parametric change-point detection method (detecting change in distribution, not necessarily in mean and variance)? Preferable if it is available in python.
