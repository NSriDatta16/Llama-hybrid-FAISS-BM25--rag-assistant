Prz. In general an ARIMA model is an optimization of the number of previous periods to use in the weighting scheme AND the values of the coefficients . You are assuming 3 periods and the coefficients are equal. Care must be taken to identify level shifts , seasonal pulses, pulses and Local time trends while ensuring that the parameters (coefficients) haven't changed over tome and that the error variance is homogeneous. For more on ARIMA modelling and Intervention Detection please see work by Tsay http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf and perhaps some of my previous posts here at SE https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3382/irishstat?tab=activity . Hope this helps. If you wish to post an example time series, I will try and give you some pointers on this data.
