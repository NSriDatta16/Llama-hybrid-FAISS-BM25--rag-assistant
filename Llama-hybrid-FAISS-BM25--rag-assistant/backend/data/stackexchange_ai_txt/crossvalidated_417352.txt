Conditional distribution of a function of a random vector given conditional distribution of random vector

Let $\mathbf{X}=(X_1,...,X_n)^T$ be a multivariate normal distribution. Now we have $\mathbf{Y}=(Y_1,...,Y_n)^T$ defined by $Y_i = e^{X_i}$ . Let $\mathbf{Y^1}, \mathbf{Y^2}$ be partitions of $\mathbf{Y}$ . I am interested in finding an expression for the conditional distribution of $\mathbf{Y}$ : $$f_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y^2|y^1}) = \frac{{f_\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y^2,y^1})}{f_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y^1})}.$$ I was able to derive the following relation between the joint distributions of $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ : $$ f_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y}) = \frac{f_{\mathbf{X}}(ln\mathbf{y})}{y_1y_2...y_n}. $$ I am looking for some simple expression for the mean, variance, and distributions of the random variables in the partition $\mathbf{y^2}$ given knowledge of the random variables in partition $\mathbf{y^1}$ . The conditional distribution expression is straight forward and elegant for the multivariate normal case but I am having a tough time trying to derive an expression for this random vector. Any help would be really appreciated.
