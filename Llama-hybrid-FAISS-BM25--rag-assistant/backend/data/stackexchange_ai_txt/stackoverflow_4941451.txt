Using jQuery themes (CSS) within jsFiddle

Has anyone tried using any of the jQuery themes in jsFiddle? I'm interested in using the Accordion widget with a theme but having trouble implementing it in jsFiddle. The trouble is, I believe the themes require image files to populate some of its effects, and my suspicion is that jsFiddle has some sort of issue with that. I even resorted to uploading the custom css and js files from the jquery download, along with all the images, onto my personal home server and adding them as managed resources. I'm getting the functionality, but not the desired imagery. Here's my current fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mendahu/CmX4k/ To see what it should be like, checked jQuery's "Humanity" theme on the UI site. The managed resources are found here: https://robins.homeserver.com/home/jquerycourse/ (also the images subdirectory). As far as I can tell, the directory structure is the same (ie. the CSS document refers to all images as "images/whatever.png"), and I organized it as such on my server. Any ideas?
