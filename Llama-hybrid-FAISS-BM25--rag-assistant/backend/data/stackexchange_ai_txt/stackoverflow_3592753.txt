C++ Specify Headers Include Directory in Code

Is there a way to specify include directories in the code, perhaps via a #pragma? I have my project setup as "src/" and "include/" folders. I am trying to compile in Visual Studio 2010, but I don't want to set it up in the project settings. Is there another way to allow it to compile instead of having to specify the include as #include ../include/ss.h
