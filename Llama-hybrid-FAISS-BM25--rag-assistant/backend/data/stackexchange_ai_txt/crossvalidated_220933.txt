Logistic regression - correcting for differing quality of observations

I'm stuck with the following problem. I want to run a predictive logistic regression. My dependent variable is binary (0,1). My predictor is a continuous variable. However, the quality of observations of the predictor variable is variable. Think of this as the predictor variable being measured with different instruments that produce more or less reliable observations of X in subsets of my overall sample. In other words: my Xs are random variables, for which the mean and stdev can be estimated though. I suppose that if I don't account for the varying quality of my observations, my regression will produce biased and unefficient results. How should I correct for the differing degree of uncertainty in my Xs? My intuition says I would have to standardize/studentize the Xs first and putting the standardized scores into the regression in order to eliminate the varying portion of the standard deviation of X. But I'm not sure if this the correct approach?
