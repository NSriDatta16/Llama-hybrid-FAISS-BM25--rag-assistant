how to create an xml using objective-C with respect to data storage?

I want to save user generated data in an XML file in the iphone. While we have NSXMLParser to parse through any xml from a url, do we have any method to create a xml file which can be stored in the app documents directory, so that i can use the parser to read the file and then display the contents back in the app. Or using Core Data is the last resort?
