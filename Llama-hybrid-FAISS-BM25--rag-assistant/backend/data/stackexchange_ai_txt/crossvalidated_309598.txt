How to quantify the reliablility of an estimate

Lets say I inspect two workers. Worker A works one hour and produces 2 goods. Worker B works 100 hours and produces 180 goods. So, on average, worker A produces 2 goods per hour and worker B 1.8 goods per hour. However, due to the small amount of working hours of worker A, the estimated high productivity could be by chance whereas the estimate of the productivity of worker B is much more reliable. How can I deal with the difference in reliablility of the estimates? Is it possible to quantify the reliablility?
