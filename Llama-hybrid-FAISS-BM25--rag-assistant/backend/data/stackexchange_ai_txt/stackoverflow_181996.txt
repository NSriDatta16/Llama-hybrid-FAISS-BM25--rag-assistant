Folders! Nice and simple. I have found these to be invaluable over the years to help organise a separate emails on a customer or project basis. Even when there's multiple parties involved i only have to look in 2 folders at most to find what i'm after. Edit: Similar to what tloach said, i use the inbox essentailly as a todo list of things i still need to look at.
