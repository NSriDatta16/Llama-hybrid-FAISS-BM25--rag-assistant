Perhaps you can use union? #pragma pack(0) union { char array[15000]; struct { char sram[10000]; char bram[5000]; } map; } combination; They are physically contiguous. If you access 'array' then it will go into either bram or sram based on the offset You need the pragma to tell the compiler to NOT align struct members on word boundaries. This prevents a number of bytes of space between the two parts of the map structure.
