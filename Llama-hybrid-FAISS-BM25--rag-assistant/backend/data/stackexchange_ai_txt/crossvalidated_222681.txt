How to group/cluster similar words

Let say I have a list of words, such as: apple apale aaple apples oranges ornnges orange orage melons meeons meeon melon melan I want to group them based on similarity (or maybe I should say cluster them). Obviously, from above list, there are three groups: apple, orange, melon. Do you have any idea on how to achieve this (in machine learning or statistical sense)? Thank in advance.
