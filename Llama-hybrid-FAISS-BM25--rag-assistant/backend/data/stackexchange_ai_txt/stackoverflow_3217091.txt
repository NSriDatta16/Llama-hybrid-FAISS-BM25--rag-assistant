Asp.NET Login Control: Dealing with brackets in passwords

I'm using the standard asp:Login control, and we have a user who recently changed her password to include an angular bracket. When she tries to login, she gets an error message, and I get the standard 'dangerous request' exception. I know I can set ValidateRequest="false" on the page to negate this, but I was hoping someone knew of a better way. Thanks! Solution We made her change her password to remove the bracket. Pragmatic wins out again. Thanks for the replies.
