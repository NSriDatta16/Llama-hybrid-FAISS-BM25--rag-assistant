JSON is best for consumption of data in web applications from webservices for its size and ease of use, especially due to the built-in support in JavaScript . Imagine the computation overhead for parsing an xml fragment compared to the instant lookup in JSON. A very good example is JSON-P. You can get back data from a webservice wrapped in a callback function call, like my_callback({"color": "blue", "shape":"square"}); inside a dynamically generated tag so the data can be directly consumed in the function my_callback() . There is no way to get even close to this convenience using XML. XML would be the format of choice for large documents, where you have a framework of rendering pages of data in multiple formats using XSLT. XML can also be used with application configuration files for readability among many other uses.
