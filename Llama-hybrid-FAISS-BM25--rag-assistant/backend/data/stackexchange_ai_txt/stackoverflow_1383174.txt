Source file organisation

I am having a bit of trouble organising my source files. I have my own small, but growing collection of code that I would like to use in various projects. The file and folder layout is something like this: library\sub1\source.h library\sub1\source.cpp library\sub2\source.h library\sub2\source.cpp One of my problems is that I want to include this code, as needed, in my other projects. To date I have used absolute paths to point to the libary code, but there must be a better way. Futhermore, I need to add every library file I use to a project's files Visual Studio in order for it to compile correctly. So my question in short is how do I fix this? What is the proper/best way to handle the above situation.
