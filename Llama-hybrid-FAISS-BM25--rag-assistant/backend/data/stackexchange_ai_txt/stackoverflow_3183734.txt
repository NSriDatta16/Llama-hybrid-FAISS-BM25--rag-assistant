You need to put the declaration of B before A . The compiler doesn't know about this: B::frndA() . A forward declaration is not enough information to infer what members the type has. I would recommend to put your class A declaration in a file A.h and it's definition inside a file A.cpp . Likewise the same for the type B inside of B.h and B.cpp At the top of each header file put #pragma once (or if you prefer include guards). Then inside your B.h you can simply include A.h .
