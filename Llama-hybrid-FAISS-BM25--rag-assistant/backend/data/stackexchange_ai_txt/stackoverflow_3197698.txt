Obtain data from dynamically incremented IDs in JQuery

I have a quick question about JQuery. I have dynamically generated paragraphs with id's that are incremented. I would like to take information from that page and bring it to my main page. Unfortunately I am unable to read the dynamically generated paragraph IDs to get the values. I am trying this: var Name = ((data).find("#Name" + id).text()); The ASP.NET code goes like this: Dim intI As Integer = 0 For Each Item As cItem in alProducts1 Dim pName As New System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlGenericControl("p") pName.id = "Name" & intI.toString() pName.InnerText = Item.Name controls.Add(pName) intI += 1 Next Those name values are the values I want...Name1, name2, name3 and I want to get them individually to put in their own textbox... I'm taking the values from the ASP.NET webpage and putting them into an AJAX page.
