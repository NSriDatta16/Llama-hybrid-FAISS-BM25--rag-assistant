Styling WPF controls inline with Infragistics themes

we are using Infragistics WPF controls (e.g. xamDataGrid, xamDockManager etc), and we will be using the Infragistics Office 2007 Blue theme which these controls support. We also want to style the rest of the application (i.e. standard WPF controls) using the same Office 2007 Blue style. What's the best approach? Are there Office 2007 themes/skins that we can download or purchase? Can we use anything from the Infragistics download?
