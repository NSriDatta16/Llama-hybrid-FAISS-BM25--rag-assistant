Why is browser sniffing not a recommended practice?

You hear it all over the place: using javascript to sniff the user agent string to detect browser versions is a Very Bad Thing. The latest version of jQuery has now deprecated its $.browser object in place of $.support . But what should I do if there's a bug or problem which is only affecting IE and not the other browsers, and I'm not sure why? In my case, some jQuery code makes a tooltip appear and disappear with an animation on mouseover and mouseout. In Internet Explorer, it looks awful, and jittery, with the tooltip div changing to a really large size before hiding, and if you run your mouse over a heap of items with the tip it really kills the browser. I have no idea what particular feature IE doesn't "support" that I should be testing against, so it's much easier to just sniff for IE and use a different method. What could/should I do instead?
