Optimum web folder structure for ~250,000 images

I will have around 200,000 images as part of my website. Each image will be stored 3 times: full size, thumbnail, larger thumbnail. Full size images are around 50Kb to 500Kb. Normal tech: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP on a VPS. What is the optimum way to store these for fast retrieval and display via a browser?? Should I store everything in a single folder? Should I store the full size images in 1 folder, the thumbails in another etc? Should I store the images in folders of 1000, and keep an index to which folder the image is in? Thanks for any advice. Albert.
