Generally speaking, if you're not in the linear case you need the support vectors. Your only other alternative would be to have some other way of approximating the resulting function - you may be able to reduce storage requirements somewhat over storing the support vectors themselves, for example by "sparsifying" the result (see for example this paper for one approach).
