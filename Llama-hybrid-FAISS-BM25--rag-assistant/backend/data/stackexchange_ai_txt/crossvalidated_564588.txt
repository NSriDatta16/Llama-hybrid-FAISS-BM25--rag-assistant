How is my data stationary?

I did a quick Dickey-Fuller test, to test whether my time series is stationary, and the result gives a P value of 9.6*10^-15, or in other words stationary. How is this possible, my data clearly doesn't seem sttionary. The mean seems to be constant(to an extent), no seasonality issue but it's the variance?
