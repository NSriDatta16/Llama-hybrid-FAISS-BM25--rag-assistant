If vertShaderPathname is empty, that means the vertex shader source couldn't be found. In this case, make sure there the shader exists in your project, and is bundled as a resource. To do this in xcode, go to the tree on the left, navigate to "Targets->(projname)->Copy Bundle Resources" and make sure you have a "Shader.vsh". If it appears in "Compile Sources" instead, then you need to drag it into "Copy Bundle Resources"
