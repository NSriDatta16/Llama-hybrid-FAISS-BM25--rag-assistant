It is not possible (look here for the reason - 2nd paragraph about requirements) Your custom class must not be a nested class. Nested classes and the "dot" in their general CLR usage syntax interfere with other WPF and/or XAML features such as attached properties. You can of course work around that - but that limits you to setting the valueconverter in the code-behind (which is yucky :-)) I'm curious, though, why would you not want other classes to use it?
