Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting and visualization library for the Python programming language and its NumPy numerical mathematics extension. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like tkinter , wxPython , Qt , or GTK , Jupyter and IPython notebooks. There is also a procedural "pyplot" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL ), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB . Matplotlib can output PNG , PDF , PS , EPS , TIFF , JPEG , PGF , and SVG files, or plot in windows using a variety of toolkits (including plot animation ).
