If you are using blocks that inherit Mage_Core_Block_Template (i.e. that use a template to display) you can assign data using the assign() method, once the blocks have been instanciated by loadLayout() $this->loadLayout(array('default', 'myModule_default')); $this->getLayout()->getBlock('your.block.name.in.the.layout')->assign('data', $data); Then, in the .phtml template, you can simply use This is not used very often in magento, but since it's implemented as public methods and thus declared stable, I believe it's fine do so. Thats also the reason for the convention to start variables declared in a template with an underscore (e.g. $_product = $this->getProduct() ), so they can be distinguished from assigned variables.
