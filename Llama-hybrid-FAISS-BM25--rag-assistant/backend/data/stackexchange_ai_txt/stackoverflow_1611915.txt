iPhone: Accessing view objects from a ViewController in Code

Let's say I have a ViewController that needs access to a view. In the class file of the ViewController I am doing IBOutlet ViewA *someview; And in Interface Builder, I drag and drop a UIView in my document and set the class to ViewA . I am missing how "stuff" is instantiated when you connect through IB. Is ViewA automatically allocated when the .xib files are unarchived? What if I don't want to use IB?
