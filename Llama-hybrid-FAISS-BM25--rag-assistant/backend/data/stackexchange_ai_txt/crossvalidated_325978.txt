Classification of 20 million records to 200 categories

I have a data set of 20 million records, which I need to assign to 200 categories. (Business language - based on the text description, I need to assign it to one of the 200 departments). Suppose I have to use (multinomial) logistic regression, how can I handle such huge number of target categories? To generalise, for any ML classification algorithm, what should be the approach to handle such target variables with a large number of options. Note : I am using Python + NLP (with an option for deep learning)
