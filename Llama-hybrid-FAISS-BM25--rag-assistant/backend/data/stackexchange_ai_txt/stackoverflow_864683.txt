Using a smalldatetime or int for storing a month in database

I'm currently developing a monthly checklist system for our organization. A user may login, select a month, then submit a list of yes/no questions relevant to that month for our organization's purposes. Some of the questions are used in more than 1 month's checklist, so I'm creating an intersection table to facilitate this one-to-many relationship. The fields are ChecklistMonth and ChecklistQuestionID. I'm unsure of how to store the ChecklistMonth field, however. If I use a smalldatetime, it seems a bit overkill, as I am only interested in the month. It will also look a bit dated in future years. On the other hand, it seems a bit wasteful to create a table with the fields MonthID and Month in order to identify only the month. What is everyone's opinion on this? Thanks in advance.
