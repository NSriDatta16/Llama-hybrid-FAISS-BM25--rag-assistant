Trying to reolve touch to location always returns zero (0) as x location

While writing the touchesBegan handler for my view I ran into this interesting error. Code: ... UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:self]; ... The problem is point.x is always zero, no matter where I "touch" and y is a huge number that flunctuates somewhere between 1070000000 and 1090000000. The handles is in a view class and it works the same is I pass nil instead of self to locationInView. I also tried looping over all of the touches, and there is only that one with x as zero always. So what am I doing wrong here?
