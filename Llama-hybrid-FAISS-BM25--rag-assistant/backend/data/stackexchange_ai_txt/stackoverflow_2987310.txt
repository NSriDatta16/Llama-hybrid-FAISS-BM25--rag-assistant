Deliberately adding bugs to assess QA processes

How do you know that as many bugs as possiblle have been discovered and solved in a program? Couple of years ago I have read a document about debugging (I think it was some sort of HOWTO). Among other things, that document described a technique in which the programming team deliberately adds bugs into the code and passes it to the QA team. The QA process is considered completed when all the deliberately known bugs have been discovered. Unfortunately, I cannot find this document, or any similar one with description of this trick. Can someone please point me to such a document? EDIT To make Evgeny happy, let me paraphrase the last sentence of the first paragraph: "The QA process isn't complete before all the deliberate bugs are found"
