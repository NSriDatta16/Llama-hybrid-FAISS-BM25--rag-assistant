Hudson will not start on Windows 7? JNLP slave agent listener started on TCP port

I'd like to setup Hudson to work with Ant. I am using it for the first time, and when I try: java -jar hudson.war it starts doing something, but stops on the line: INFO: JNLP slave agent listener started on TCP port 59204 I am running Windows 7, also the Java Web Start for hudson does not start.
