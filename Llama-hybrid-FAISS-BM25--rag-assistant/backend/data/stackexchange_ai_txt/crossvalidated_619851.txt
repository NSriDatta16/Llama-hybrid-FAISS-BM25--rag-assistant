If some online tutorial disagrees with the official documentation of the software, almost always you should trust the documentation. What the documentation says is: Description princomp performs a principal components analysis on the given numeric data matrix and returns the results as an object of class princomp . Usage princomp(x, ...) ## S3 method for class 'formula' princomp(formula, data = NULL, subset, na.action, ...) ## Default S3 method: princomp(x, cor = FALSE, scores = TRUE, covmat = NULL, subset = rep_len(TRUE, nrow(as.matrix(x))), fix_sign = TRUE, ...) ## S3 method for class 'princomp' predict(object, newdata, ...) Arguments formula a formula with no response variable, referring only to numeric variables. data an optional data frame (or similar: see model.frame ) containing the variables in the formula formula. By default the variables are taken from environment(formula) . [...] x a numeric matrix or data frame which provides the data for the principal components analysis. cor a logical value indicating whether the calculation should use the correlation matrix or the covariance matrix. (The correlation matrix can only be used if there are no constant variables.) [...] covmat a covariance matrix, or a covariance list as returned by cov.wt (and cov.mve or cov.mcd from package MASS). If supplied, this is used rather than the covariance matrix of x. [...] So it can be called either with raw data or the given covariance or correlation matrix (with cor=TRUE ). The tutorial calculates the principal components analysis of the correlation matrix . Sure, you can do this, but in most cases, you would be interested in doing PCA of the raw data, rather than the correlation matrix. The tutorial uses the correlation matrix without the argument cor=TRUE . This makes sense if the author wants a PCA of the correlation matrix used as data, but is incorrect if they mean providing the correlation matrix (the covmat argument). The tutorial incorrectly suggests that you should scale the data before calculating the correlations. This is not needed , as correlation already is a normalized covariance. So the moral is that you should not trust everything you read on the internet.
