For spectral clustering,

My professor is teaching us spectral clustering but unfortunately he gave a hand-wavy introduction and left most of the details out, so I'm trying to fill them in on my own. He stated, suppose we have a graph $G=(V,E,W)$ where $W$ is the weight matrix and there are $n$ vertices. The degree matrix $D$ is defined as a diagonal matrix with entries $d_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij}$ . Then the Laplacian matrix is defined as $L=D-W$ . He said define $$\tilde{W} = D^{-1/2} W D^{-1/2}$$ Then the symmetric normalized Laplacian is defined as $$\tilde{L}=D^{1/2}(I-\tilde{W})D^{1/2}$$ He said, let $\lambda_1 be the largest eigenvalues of $\tilde{W}$ . Let $v_1,...,v_R$ be the corresponding eigenvectors. He said then $$\tilde{W}v_k = \lambda_k v_k$$ and the "embedding" of a point $x_i$ in the new space is $$e(x_i)=\lbrace v_{ki}\rbrace_{k=1}^{R}$$ I learned from this famous paper more of the details: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/SM-ncut.pdf In particular, they show that separating points into two clusters $A$ and $B$ can be set up as $$\underset{y}{\text{argmin}} \frac{y^TLy}{y^TDy}$$ subject to $y^TD1 = 0$ . I understand that the eigensystem $$(D-W)y=\lambda Dy$$ solves this problem and, setting $z= D^{-1/2}y$ , we get $$D^{-1/2} L D^{-1/2} z = \lambda z$$ which is equivalent to $$\tilde{L}z=\lambda z$$ I don't understand how to get from here to $$\tilde{W}v_k = \lambda_k v_k$$ I tried doing $$\begin{align*} \tilde{L}z&=\lambda z\\ (I-\tilde{W}) z&=\lambda z\\ z - \tilde{W}z &= \lambda z\\ \tilde{W}z &= (\lambda + 1)z\\ \end{align*} $$ But I'm really unclear if this is sensible. Is this correct? If so, why are the eigenvalues of $\tilde{W}$ simply the eigenvalues of $\tilde{L}$ plus 1?
