Definition of $X_t$ in the context of Stochastic process and Time Series

In the book An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling , Stochastic process is defined as : A stochastic process is a family of random variable(s) , $X_t$ , where $t$ is a parameter running over a suitable index set, T. If $T$ is not a random variable rather an index set , how can be $t$ a parameter ? Isn't time series a stochastic process ? But there we say $t$ is an index and $X_t$ is an outcome at time point $t$ . Then why should we telling $t$ a parameter in the definition of stochastic process ?
