Anomaly detection in Multivariate timeseries

I am working on an algorithm which will detect the anomalies in multivariate timeseries. Suppose there is a time series My algorithm will compute two equations: lower_equation_y and upper_equation_y . lower_equation_y = slope1 x X1 + slope2 x X2 + slope3 x X3 + lower_bound_intercept upper_equation_y = slope1 x X1 + slope2 x X2 + slope3 x X3 + upper_bound_intercept The future datapoints of Y which will not be in the range of lower and upper equation will be marked as anomaly. I'm only interested in finding anomalies in Y at a time. STEPS I followed : Compute multiple regression equation taking y as target and all x's as independent. Compute lower bound and upper bound intercept and prepare the equation Then mark anomaly based on the equations Problem with above approach : It is not capturing the relationships between the x's, because regression don't capture the relationships between independent. Updated Approach I thought to use VAR instead of regression, it will capture the dependencies among the x's. The problem with VAR is I have to give stationary independent variables to the model My questions There is trend component in my independent variables, if I make it stationary it will affect the values of slope, will that affect my anomaly calculation? Because to prepare an equation I need the trend part as well. I stuck at this problem, can someone please help me with my approach any new idea or improvement in the existing for computing anomalies will be appreciated.
