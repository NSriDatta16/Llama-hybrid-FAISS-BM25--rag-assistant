I find it useful to have three JS files in each dynamically generated page. The general functions that are re-used everywhere, the project specific functions that are used all over the project and the page specific js file. This way you have a handle on what is "reusable" and what isn't. This also encourages you to "promote" your code. As you "promote" it, you will find yourself separating it more and more into UI or Behavior. As more stuff gets separated you may find yourself including 6 files or just breaking each file up with a package structure as you suggested earlier UIFunctions().doStuff()... However if you have to prefix your stuff with PageName you haven't promoted your code and maybe it is time you do so :-) That is just how I have been doing it.
