You could use the reg:logistic objective function. https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html#learning-task-parameters Edit: You need to use either the internal API for this, or use the sklearn API's XGBRegressor with objective='reg:logistic' (or binary:logistic ). Do not use XGBClassifier , as it will label-encode the target!
