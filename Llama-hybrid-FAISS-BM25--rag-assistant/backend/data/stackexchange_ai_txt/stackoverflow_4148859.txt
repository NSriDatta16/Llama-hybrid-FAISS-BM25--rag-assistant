mysql multiple tables vs 1 table

Im making a simple score keeping system and each user can have stats for many different games But i don't know if each user should have his own score table or have one big table containing all the scores with a user_id column Multiple Tables: table name: [user id]_score game_id | high_score | last_score | average_score Single Table: user_id | game_id | high_score | last_score | average_score
