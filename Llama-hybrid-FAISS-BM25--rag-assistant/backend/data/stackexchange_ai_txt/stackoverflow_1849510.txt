In many cases you are probably missing the point of the exercise if you think this is important. There's a world of a difference between a homework exercise and real world programs. The purpose of such exercises is seldom, if ever, to teach user interface design; the technique you describe is generally just a simple way to obtain test input for the real exercise, and is also probably encouraged by tutors who, pressed for time require submitted code to adhere to some 'course-style' to make marking easier. 'Course-style' is seldom the same thing as 'good-practice' or 'practical style', but that is not to say that it does not serve some purpose, or even that that purpose is beneficial to the students education. Unfortunately novices often get hung up on this stuff when it is generally irrelevant to the actual purpose of the exercise. The problem is that user input using standard library primitives is not as foolproof and some tutors seem to think.
