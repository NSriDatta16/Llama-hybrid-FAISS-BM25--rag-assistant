This is a very simple concept called sessions. When you visit facebook, it reads unique information sent to it via the connection such as IP address, browser, and some other minor information, when this information is combined it creates a unique identifier. this unique identifier is then stored in a file like so: d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c.session So when you login with your credentials there application add's information into this file such as last activity etc. When you go away and come back, facebook will then read the information that's sent with every requests, it then add's it all together and creates a unique hash, if this hash exists within it's storage system it will open it up and read the contents, and know exactly who you are. all this is combined with cookies, the unique hash is sent back to the browser and stored in your cookies folder, this cookie file is sent back to facebook with every request. PHP Handles this for you internally so it's pretty basic to get it up and running: http://php.net/manual/en/features.sessions.php Here's an example that may help you understand the concept a little more. ' . $_SESSION['hits'] . ' times.'; ?> if you load this page and then hit F5, the session value get's incremented every request so you should see something like: You have vistited this site 1 times. You have vistited this site 2 times. You have vistited this site 3 times. You have vistited this site 4 times. ... The session file is unique to each person visiting, thus meaning that when using the session variable in PHP it would be to that user only, so everyone get's there own individual session. as your researching it's goods to search StackOverflow for certain tags, such as PHP and sessions. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php+session Here's a good question in regards to cookies and sessions advantages etc. Purpose Of PHP Sessions and Cookies and Their Differences
