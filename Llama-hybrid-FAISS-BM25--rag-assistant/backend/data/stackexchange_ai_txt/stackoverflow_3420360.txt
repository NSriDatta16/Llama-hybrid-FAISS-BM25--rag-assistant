Amazon SimpleDB Query to Find "Post By Friends"

I have been developing an iPhone app which queries a server that relays data I store in Amazon SimpleDB. I have a database table of "Submissions" by various users. I am interfacing with Facebook to retrieve Facebook Friends and wish to make a query to "Submissions" to find posts by friends - like: SELECT * FROM submissions WHERE userID = '00123' OR userID = '00124' OR .... (through complete list of friends) I think this will run into an Amazon query limit with this kind of select statement - [Maximum number of comparisons per Select expression: 20] Can you think of a way to elegantly pull this off with SimpleDB? I'd rather not have to do a bunch of 20 person queries. Or, do I need to move to a different database package and then do cross-table queries? Thanks!
