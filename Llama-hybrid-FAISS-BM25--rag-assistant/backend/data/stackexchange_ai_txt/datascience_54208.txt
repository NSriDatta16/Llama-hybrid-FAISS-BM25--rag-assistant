Keras model giving error when fields of unseen test data and train data are not same

I have created a simple Keras deep learning model in python. Total no of variables in training are 195 while in unseen test data are 181.All input fields are categorical(converted by one hot encoding). Since unseen test data has some different categories thats why after one hot encoding fields are not matching with train. So during predict step on unseen test data, model gives the following error. Is there any way out? ValueError: Error when checking input: expected dense_30_input to have shape (195,) but got array with shape (181,)
