fseek ($fp, -n, SEEK_END);, but you must open the file as 'r+' and not 'a'. It's not generally a good idea to be processing XML like this; relying on exact byte positions is very fragile. Better would be to open the file in an XML parser, add the elements you want, serialise it to a new file and swap them over (so that nothing reads the XML in the middle of you writing it). On a database-backed site, you could also consider generating your sitemap XML dynamically using PHP itself.
