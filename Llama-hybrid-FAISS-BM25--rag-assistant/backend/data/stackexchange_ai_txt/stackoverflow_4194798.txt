I think you have your answer here. I just wanted to add a couple of suggestions based on my abundant experience with this problem. If you add logging to the catch block, you can ascertain how often the web service call fails, and how many attempts were made in all. (Maybe put a toggle in web.config to turn this logging off once the issue subsides.) That information may prove useful in discussions with system administrators if, for example, the web service provider is within your organization, such as on an intranet. In addition, if you find that the calls are still failing too often, you could introduce a delay in the catch , so that the retry is not immediate. You might only want to do that on the final attempt. Sometimes it is worth the wait for the user, who doesn't want to lose all the data they have just entered. And finally, depending on the situation, you could add a Retry button to the UI, so that the user could keep trying. The user could choose to wait five minutes for the network problem to clear itself up, and click Retry.
