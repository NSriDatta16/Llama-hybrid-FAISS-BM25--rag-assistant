Why is SVM better for bioinformatics analysis?

I have used five different algorithms: bagging, boosting, C4.5, random forests and SVM, for binary classification of biological data relating to peptide sequence. The dataset comprised of approximately 1000 sample (evenly distributed in two groups, negative and positive) and 126 attributes. The performance of each classifier was assessed in terms of ACC, SEN, SPC and MCC and SVM surpassed in all performance values. Bagging had the second best performance. I want to know what makes SVM more appropriate for binary classification especially when dealing with biological data?
