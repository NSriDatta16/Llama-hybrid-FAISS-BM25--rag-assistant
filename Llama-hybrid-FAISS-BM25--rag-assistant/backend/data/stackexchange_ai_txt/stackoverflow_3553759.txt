The behaviour of compilers in locating header files is implementation defined for both the <> and "" variants. However, based on this page for VC2010, it appears the quoted form searches a superset of the angle bracket form so I'm not sure that's the problem. I suppose it would be a silly question to ask if the following file actually existed? f:\boost_1_44_0\boost\type_traits\transform_traits.hpp So, a couple of investigative jobs: Make sure that f:\boost_1_44_0\boost\type_traits\transform_traits.hpp exists. Try changing your top-level include to use quotes. Try changing the include in f:\boost_1_44_0\boost\lambda\core.hpp to use angle brackets. Make sure you try all four possibilities for those last two. Is f: a network-mounted drive? What happens if you put it all on c: ? That last one is just in case Windows is doing some shenanigans under the covers :-)
