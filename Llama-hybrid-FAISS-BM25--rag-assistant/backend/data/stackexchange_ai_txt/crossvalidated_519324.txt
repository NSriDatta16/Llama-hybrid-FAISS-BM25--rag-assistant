Tree models' measures of feature importance have been called into question in general . But also, xgboost 's python implementation get_score defaults to "weight" , which measures the number of splits a feature makes. This obviously hurts small-cardinality features like sex (which should be highly predictive in titanic ): it can only be used to split once per tree; even if it is used for the first split of every tree, if your trees are deep enough its weight-importance will be low.
