Yes, you can, with a product called "Hydra" from RemObjects: http://www.remobjects.com/hydra.aspx They have a demo showing embedding a WPF graph in a Win32 application. As Ken White notes, you can develop all your .Net stuff in Delphi Prism. It can then be leveraged in Win32 using Hydra if you like.
