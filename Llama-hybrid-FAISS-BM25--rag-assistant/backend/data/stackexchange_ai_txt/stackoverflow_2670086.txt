Simplest answer I can think of: OLEDB source from Database A Select a.name, a.address, a.status, a.myuser from a.dbo.people lookup from Database B Select b.userid,b.username from b.dbo.user on the columns tab in the lookup drag a line between username and myuser and click the checkbox next to userid. In the bottom part of that tab alias the userid column as createdBy in the column under the heading Output Alias OLEDB Destination to Database B select the People table to output to and map the columns from your dataflow to the outputs.
