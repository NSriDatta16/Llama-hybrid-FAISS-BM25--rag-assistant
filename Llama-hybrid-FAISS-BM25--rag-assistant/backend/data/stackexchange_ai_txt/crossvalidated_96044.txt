rigorous proof of a statement in Elements of Statistical Learning

In Section 2.4 of the book ESL by Hastie etc., it was said that $\hat{f}(x)=\text{Ave}(y_i\mid x_i\in N_k(x))\rightarrow E(Y\mid X=x)$ when $N, k\rightarrow \infty$ and $k/N\rightarrow 0$. Here $N_k(x)$ is the neighborhood containing the $k$ points and "Ave" denotes average. Is there a rigorous proof of this statement?
