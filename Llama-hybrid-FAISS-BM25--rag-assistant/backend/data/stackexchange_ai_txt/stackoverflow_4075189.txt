Agent/MailboxProcessor in C# using new async/await

This question combines two topics I don't fully understand Reading through a paper about async in F#, I came across the topic of Agents/MailboxProcessors, which can be used to implement reactive state machines. Could the new async/await functionality in C#5 be used to implement something similar in C#, or is there already something analogue that would be better suited?
