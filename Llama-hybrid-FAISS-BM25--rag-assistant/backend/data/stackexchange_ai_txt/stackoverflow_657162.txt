Who gets the call at 3am when the software isn't working or a system died? If it's the dev team then by all means expect to own the deployment (since you own production). Best practice for organizations that can support is to provide the Operations group with deployment instructions and good wishes. Bottles of scotch help too. If your production controls are lax, than tighten them up. A book like "Visible Ops" is a great guide to getting things under appropriate levels of control in the appropriate hands.
