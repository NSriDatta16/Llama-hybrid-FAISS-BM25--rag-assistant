Yes , XSS allows hackers to control the content on your site and normally takes a single function call to fix. It takes less effort to fix this issue, than for you to post this question to SO about it. Lets say you are Fox News, someone could use XSS to fabricate the news. Further more it could be used to deliver a drive by download attack to your users. In your case someone could create a fake brochure with outrageous claims.
