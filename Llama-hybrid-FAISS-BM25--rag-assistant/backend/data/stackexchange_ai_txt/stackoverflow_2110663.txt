I think this is more of a social problem than a programming problem. Any sort of programatic solution to natural language processing like this is going to be buggy and error prone. It's very hard to distinguish things that are close, but legitimately different from the sort of undesired duplicates that you're talking about. As Dominic mentioned, Stack Overflow's tagging system is a pretty good model for this. It provides cues to the user that encourage them to use existing tags if appropriate (drop down lists as the user types), it allows trusted users to retag individual questions, and it allows moderators to do mass retags. This is really a process that has to have a person directly involved.
