Are you running the script locally via file: ? If so, Firefox doesn't appear to allow localStorage entries to live beyond unload when file: access is used. For more info, you may want to look at the question: Is “localStorage” in Firefox only working when the page is online? It's a little dated, but still seems to be applicable.
