How to visualize the comparison of 3 different types of distances among objects

I need to calculate the difference between six time series in three ways: Time Series are: Kamel, Dumper, Graben, Traktor, Generator Methods are: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and maximum distance For example, I show the differences between these time series for Euclidean distance in a table like this: (I have two more such tables.) Now I want to visualize these tables in one diagram, with a different color for each method. What data visualization method should I use?
