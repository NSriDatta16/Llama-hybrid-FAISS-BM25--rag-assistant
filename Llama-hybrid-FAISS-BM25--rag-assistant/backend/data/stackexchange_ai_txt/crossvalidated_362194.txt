Data - how 'smart' are models / is my dummy redundant?

I am currently practicing my data-analysis skills by doing the Titanic competition from kaggle . Its a rather grim exercise where you have a list of passengers and have to predict whether they survived the disaster. I am planning on using Logistic Regression and am in the process of transforming the data, but I had the following question: One of the variables (integer) is parch which is described as the # of parents / children aboard the Titanic I wanted to test the hypothesis that a 'parent' would have lower survival chance, as self preservation was not necessarily their number 1 priority (again, its a grim exercise). One way I could do this is by adding a parent dummy where ( age > 18+ parch > 0) But this would not be new information, as the value of this dummy is based on features/data that already exist in the row. My question is as follows: Is adding this dummy required? Assuming my hypothesis is true, wouldn't the model infer learn the difference between children and parents itself based on the age variable? passenger_id | age | parch | parent 1 5 2 0 2 3 2 0 3 40 2 1 4 43 2 1 For example, the dataset above would describe 1 family of 4, would the parent dummy be redundant as the regression already gets both the parch and age variables? How 'capable' are the models in inferring these connections from the data?
