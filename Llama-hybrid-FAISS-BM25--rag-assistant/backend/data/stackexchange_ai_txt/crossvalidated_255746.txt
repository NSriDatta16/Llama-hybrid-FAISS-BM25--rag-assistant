One argument against it is if one of your models is much closer to properly identifying the time series patterns than the rest in the ensemble. Had you used that model versus the combination, it would likely have performed better. Other problems: knowing which models to include, what ensemble size and how to combine is vague. While there is evidence that the basic average works well for time series combinations, it's still not settled (my opinion). I've seen median (or trimmed-means) and linear combinations work quite well in practice.
