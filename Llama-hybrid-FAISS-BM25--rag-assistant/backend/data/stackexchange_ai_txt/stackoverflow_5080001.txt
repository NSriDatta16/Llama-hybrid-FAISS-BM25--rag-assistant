Updating a TextView with a SeekBar's value (ultra-slow)

Now look at that! I am having trouble with one of the simplest goals: updating a plain TextView with the value of a SeekBar. This is my approach: @Override public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress, boolean fromUser) { if (fromUser) { mInfoText.setText(mFunction.getUserFriendlyString(progress)); } } It basically works, but it kind of blocks the whole UI when I'm dragging. (Note: I tried both View.post() and Activity.runOnUiThread()). Am I overlooking something?
