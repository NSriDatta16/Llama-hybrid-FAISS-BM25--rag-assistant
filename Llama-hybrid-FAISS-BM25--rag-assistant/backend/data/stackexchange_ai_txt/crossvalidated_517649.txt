Is Inverse Variance Weighting biased if my samples come from correlated data?

I have a brief question about whether or not inverse-variance weighting is a biased or unbiased estimator when the samples themselves are means of correlated data themselves. To elaborate on this, let's say I have 10 "measurements" which have a mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2_i$ each. The sample values are independent to one another but their mean and variance come from correlated samples themselves. Where $\mu_i$ is the mean of subsamples of a given measurement, $i$ , and $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of those subsamples for a given measurement $i$ (this variance includes the statistical autocorrelation between the subsamples which emerge from markov-chain monte carlo). I compute the total mean and total variance by using the weights as, $w_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}$ , and taking the weighted mean $\mu_{ave}$ = $\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \mu_i$ / $\sum_{i=1} w_i$ and the variance as $\sigma^2_{ave}$ = $\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i^2 \sigma^2_i$ / $\left( \sum_{i=1}^{10} w^2_i \right)^2$ The Wikipedia article does mention that the individual measurements have to independent of each other but also unbias which I'm pretty sure values are. However, I'm not 100% sure about the variance as the wiki does state " if the measurements are performed under identical scenarios" and because my subsamples are correlated I'd assume this would invalidate this weighted-average. I'm not 100% sure about this statement so I was wondering if someone else with more experience might be able to clarify some points for me! Any help is appreciated! Thank you!
