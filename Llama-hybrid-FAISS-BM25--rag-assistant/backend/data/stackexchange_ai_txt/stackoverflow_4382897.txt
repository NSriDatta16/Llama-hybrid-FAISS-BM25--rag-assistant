ASP.NET Chart Rendering issue in Firefox

I am working with an ASP.NET Chart control in an AJAX UpdatePanel that is being updated about 4 times a second with a new point added to it each time it is updated. This causes the chart to render 4 different images each second. I have been testing this functionality in a few browsers and have tried to tweak the chart settings to render the images as fast and smooth as possible, however it seems that Firefox is unable to load the chart this fast. Right now I have this working well in IE, decent in Chrome, and not so well in Firefox. IE updates the chart and renders a new image up to 4 times a second flawlessly. In Chrome the image of the chart is rendered but is kind of flashy. When tested in Firefox a blank Image is shown where the chart should be and is not actually loaded until AFTER the AJAX UpdatePanel STOPS updating. Is there a way to optimize the ASP.NET Chart control for Firefox? I have tried tweaking the AntiAliasing, ImageStorageMode, and ImageType properties with no visible improvement. Any help is appreciated, Thanks. EDIT: Here is my update panel with the chart in it.
