[Guidance Needed]Research in data science

IMAGINE You're a research intern and you're an undergraduate student. Have some experience in data science and now new to research. Your task is to conduct research on vision transformers . Oh and by the way, you're new to transformers concepts. You first learn transformers and make your fundamentals strong. You implemented and checked vision transformers original code. All fine! You even checked and ran current SOTA papers in vision transformers. Now you have gained enough knowledge to conduct your own research. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT UNTIL..... ISSUE I am unable to develop good ideas in my mind and obviously unable to implement by myself . I tried and tried and tried, which only leads to big bad errors. I thought maybe I understand other author's codes and practice their implementation to get hang of it. Understanding the code itself takes DAYYSSS(sometimes weeks). I seriously don't understand if there's any right way to do this. Sometimes I wish I had proper guidance to conduct research. I did come up with various strategies, but nothing works. It's been almost 2 months and I feel depressed. Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.! About my Advisor/mentor My mentor who is a university professor assigned me this task is only concerned about my progress and doesn't help me to actually get things done. And in my last meeting with him clearly tells that he's not at all interested in the above things I mentioned
