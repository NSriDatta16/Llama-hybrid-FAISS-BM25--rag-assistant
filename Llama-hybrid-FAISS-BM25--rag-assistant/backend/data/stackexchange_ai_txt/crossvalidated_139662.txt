Testing the statistical significance of regression coefficients in a logistic regression

Are only the p-values relevant when testing the regression coefficients of a logistic regression? Does the z-value of a coefficient give any further information about the significance of the coefficient? I know how the z-values are to be estimated, but I have some difficulties with interpreting it for each coefficient, so I am not sure if it gives any information about its significance.
