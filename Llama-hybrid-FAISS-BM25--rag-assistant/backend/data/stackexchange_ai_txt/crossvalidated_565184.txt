Interpreting Treatment Effects from R Logistic Regression

This is probably a simple(ish) question but I would appreciate any help/pointers. I have the following logistic regression model: mod Where the outcome variable is binary (0 for not accepted, 1 for accepted). The model produces the following results (via summary(mod)) Call: glm(formula = accepted ~ has_degree + is_resident + age, family=binomial) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.11364 -0.07556 0.24139 0.59416 1.87022 Coefficients: Estimate Std.Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -228.9320 81.6951 -2.802 0.00507 ** has_degree -1.1979 0.5766 -2.078 0.03774 * is_resident -1.0126 1.1522 -0.879 0.37946 age 2.3549 0.8388 2.807 0.00499 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 112.467 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 75.987 on 96 degrees of freedom AIC: 83.987 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6 How can I determine the treatment effects explained by the model? If I take the sum all e^predictor variable estimates will this provide the treatment (ratio from 0 to 1) explained by the model?
