Contact header in 4xx responses?

The Statement in RFC 3261 about presence of Contact Header in 4xx responses are contradictory. Does anyone have any explanation for the same? As per RFC 3261 - 13.2.2.3 - A single non- 2xx final response may be received for the INVITE . 4xx , 5xx and 6xx responses may contain a Contact header field value indicating the location where additional information about the error can be found. Subsequent final responses (which would only arrive under error conditions) MUST be ignored. However, in RFC 3261 Section 20.1 Contact R o - - m o o Contact 1xx - - - o - - Contact 2xx - - - m o o Contact 3xx d - o - o o o Contact 485 - o - o o o Also the Book "SIP: understanding the Session Initiation Protocol" By Alan B. Johnston Page 77 says that A user agent sending a REGISTER request may receive a 3xx redirection or 4xx failure response containing a Contact header of the location to which registrations should be sent.
