You could encrypt the password + a salt with a public key. For logins just check if the stored value equals the value calculated from the user input + salt. If there comes a time, when the password needs to be restored in plaintext, you can decrypt manually or semi-automatically with the private key. The private key may be stored elsewhere and may additionally be encrypted symmetrically (which will need a human interaction to decrypt the password then). I think this is actually kind of similar to the way the Windows Recovery Agent works. Passwords are stored encrypted People can login without decrypting to plaintext Passwords can be recovered to plaintext, but only with a private key, that can be stored outside the system (in a bank safe, if you want to).
