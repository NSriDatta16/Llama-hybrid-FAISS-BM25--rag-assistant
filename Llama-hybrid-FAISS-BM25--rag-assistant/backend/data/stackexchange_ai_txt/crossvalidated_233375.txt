Are "kernel methods" and "reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces" related?

Are "kernel methods" and "reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces" related? Specifically, is the "kernel" used in the term "kernel methods" the same (type of) "kernel" as that used in the term "reproducing kernel Hilbert space"? Note that I already checked the Wikipedia pages for the two topics, and there was no mention of "kernel method" on the page for "reproducing kernel Hilbert space" nor vice versa. I want to find a textbook about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ( see here ), and this would be a lot easier if the two concepts were essentially the same, since "kernel methods" seems to be a topic which is covered frequently in machine learning textbooks. On the other hand, if they are different, then I will have to expend some effort in making sure that I understand the difference between the two in order to avoid getting confused.
