In the documentation for the mediate function you can read this: the "proportions mediated", or the size of the average causal mediation effects relative to the total effect. So, a proportion mediated that is greater than 1 would indicate that the size of the mediation effect is larger than the total. This could happen if the directions of the main and mediated effect were opposite. This is equivalent to suppression in ordinary regression. If the direct effect is very small, then the proportion mediated could be far greater than 1. Then the question of whether there is mediation at all becomes kind of philosophical. If there is no effect, is there anything to mediate?
