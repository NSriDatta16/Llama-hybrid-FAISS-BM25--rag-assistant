I asked myself this question also a lot of times. Still haven't figured out an ultimate solution to the problem. Iterating through parents and parents is definately a way but has to be taken with caution, cause relations might change in your application during runtime. I wrote a simple method a few days ago that lets you iterate through all parents of a given object. Definitely not an elegant solution but it works so far. the SWIZ framework also offers good methods to facilitate the communication between objects via code injection and Event mediation. Maybe worth a look...
