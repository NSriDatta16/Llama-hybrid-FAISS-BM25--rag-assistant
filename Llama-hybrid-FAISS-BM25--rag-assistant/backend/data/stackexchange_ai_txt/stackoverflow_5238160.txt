Boost python linking

I'm adding boost.python for my Game. I write wrappers for my classes to use them in scripts. The problem is linking that library to my app. I'm using cmake build system. Now I have a simple app with 1 file and makefile for it: PYTHON = /usr/include/python2.7 BOOST_INC = /usr/include BOOST_LIB = /usr/lib TARGET = main $(TARGET).so: $(TARGET).o g++ -shared -Wl,--export-dynamic \ $(TARGET).o -L$(BOOST_LIB) -lboost_python \ -L/usr/lib/python2.7/config -lpython2.7 \ -o $(TARGET).so $(TARGET).o: $(TARGET).cpp g++ -I$(PYTHON) -I$(BOOST_INC) -c -fPIC $(TARGET).cpp And this works. It builds a 'so' file for me which I can import from python. Now the question: how to get this for cmake? I wrote in main CMakeList.txt : ... find_package(Boost COMPONENTS filesystem system date_time python REQUIRED) message("Include dirs of boost: " ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} ) message("Libs of boost: " ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ) include_directories( ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} ... ) target_link_libraries(Themisto ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ... ) ... message calls show: Include dirs of boost: /usr/include Libs of boost: /usr/lib/libboost_filesystem-mt.a/usr/lib/libboost_system-mt.a/usr/lib/libboost_date_time-mt.a/usr/lib/libboost_python-mt.a Ok, so I've added simple .cpp-file for my project with include of . I get an error at compiling: /usr/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory So it doesn't take all need include directories. And second question: How to organize 2-step building of script-cpp files? In makefile I showed there are TARGET.o and TARGET.so , how to process that 2 commands in cmake? As I understand, the best way is to create subproject and do something there. Thanks.
