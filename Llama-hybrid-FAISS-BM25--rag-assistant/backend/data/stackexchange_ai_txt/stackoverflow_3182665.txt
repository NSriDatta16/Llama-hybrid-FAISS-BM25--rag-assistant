The performance difference will depend on several factors. You may need to be concerned about latency between the UI and the server side. If this is substantial, then more than a few round-trips will start to make your UI look sluggish. In addition, repeatedly connecting to the UI will force authentication checks, and may also increase the load on your DB for both ASP.NET state if you're using a DB for that and for the retrieval of individual resources unless you're caching the results somewhere. Caching just to support a chatty interface will increase the memory load on your servers, and could result in thrashing during periods of high load. Not only that, you may be paying for extra bandwidth that is not relevant to the request itself (i.e. TCP/IP packet headers) that will increase in proportion to how chatty your system is.
