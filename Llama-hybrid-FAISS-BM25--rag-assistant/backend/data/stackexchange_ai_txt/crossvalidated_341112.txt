Easy. Imagine that the number of times you cough in a minute when having cold is from Poisson distribution, where $\lambda$ is the intensity. Now imagine that the intensity depends the number of days you were sick $d_t$ and the number of antibiotic pill you took $m_t$: $\lambda_t=\lambda(d_t,m_t)$ The number of time you coughed at time $t$ is a random variable: $$x_t\sim Poisson(\lambda_t)$$ The distribution parameter depends on some variables, but the actual realization is random. You'll see that the average times you cough changes with time, maybe increases in first couple of days, then decreases: $$E[x_t]=\lambda(d_t,m_t)$$
