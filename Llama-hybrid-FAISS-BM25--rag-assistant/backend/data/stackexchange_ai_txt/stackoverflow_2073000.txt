2 questions: 1) long 2 wide data in R, 2) followup re: rattle

1) long to wide question: I have a dataset with 3 columns: person, event, frequency. If the frequency is zero, the row is not in the table. Is there a simple way using basic R functions or libraries to convert this table to wide format, with one row per person and one column per event with the frequency as the value in table. 2) rattle question: On a related note, is this even necessary for Rattle to understand as an input? I am trying to import some data into R to explore some of Rattle's machine learning algorithms. Thanks! Patrick McCann
