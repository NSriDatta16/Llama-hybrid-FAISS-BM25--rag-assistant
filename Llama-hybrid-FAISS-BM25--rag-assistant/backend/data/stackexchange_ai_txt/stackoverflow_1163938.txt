check "IF" condition inside FOR loop (batch/cmd)

The code I need to implement in a Windows batch file is like this (it is currently in Perl): while( ) { if($_ =~ m/xxxx/) { print OUT "xxxx is found"; } elsif($_ =~ m/yyyy/) { next; } else { ($a,$b) = split(/:/,$_); $array1[$count] = $a; $array2[$count] = $b; $count++; } } My questions are: Is this level of complexity possible in Windows batch files? If so, how can I put an If condition inside a for loop to read a text file? Thanks for your attention. If you know the answers, or have any ideas/clues on how to reach the answer, please share them. EDIT: I am working in Windows. I can use only whatever is provided with Windows by default and that means I cant use Unix utilities.
