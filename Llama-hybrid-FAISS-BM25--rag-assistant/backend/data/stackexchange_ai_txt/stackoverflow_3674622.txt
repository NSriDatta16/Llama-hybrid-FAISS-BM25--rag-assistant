In almost all cases I can think of, you can use nested decode s instead of case . Instead of select case when a=1 then 'foo' when b>2 then 'bar' else 'foobar' end from xyz; you can write select decode(a,1, 'foo', decode(sign(b-2),1,'bar', 'foobar')) from xyz; The other, probably more elegant possibility, is to create a database view and use it in forms, so forms 6i never sees the case .
