notifying the user about successful update in codeigniter

i'm using these two lines to update my table using codeigninter active records $this->db->where('reference_number', $reference); $this->db->update('patient', $data); what i want to de is to check weather it successfully updates the table and according to that i want to give a notification to the user, how can i check the successful update is happened with this lines? there is a no clue in the user guide telling that by putting the line if($this->db->update('patient', $data)); will give us a true or false value, can we do like that? or is there any other solution to this problem? regards, Rangana
