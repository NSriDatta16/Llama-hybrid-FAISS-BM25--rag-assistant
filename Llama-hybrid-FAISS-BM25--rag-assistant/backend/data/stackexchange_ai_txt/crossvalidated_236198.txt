Now I could do just that and than point to the estimated model which produced the highest accuracy as the "best". Is this approach valid however? You cannot use the test set to choose your model. You could select the model which produced the highest accuracy on the validation set. How do you go about in making neural networks "more stable"? If you don't trust much your validation set to reflect the test set, you could train several neural networks and combine their outputs using some ensemble methods.
