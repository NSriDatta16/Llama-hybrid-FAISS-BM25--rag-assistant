On your Wordpress setup, take a look at wp-admin/export.php lines 28-48 (on a 3.0 setup). This is the code that generates the XML file downloadable in the admin. You could maybe use that in your own code (unfortunately, it's not organized into a function, so you'll have to do some copy-paste-ing). Also, you could automate the downloading of http://yourblog/wp-admin/export.php?download , as this URI would always redirect to a fresh XML export. You'll have to deal with inputting your credentials for that, though.
