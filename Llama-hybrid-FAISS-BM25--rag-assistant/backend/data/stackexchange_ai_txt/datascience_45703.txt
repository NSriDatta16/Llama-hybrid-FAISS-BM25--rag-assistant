Is a "curve" considered "linear"?

In linear regression, we are fitting a polynomial to a set of data points. In Bishop's book of Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning, there are a few examples where the fit is a curve or a straight line. I am a bit confused if a curve is linear or not. The term linear means that the fit should be a linear function or a polynomial of degree 1 i.e., a straight line. But in many resources, examples are shown where the fit can be a polynomial of degree 3,9 etc. So, are these higher order polynomials linear?
