Is classification using linear regression called logistic regression or linear disriminant analysis?

I have heard people describe logistic regression as linear regression except as it is deployed for classification. But I have heard the exact same comment about LDA (linear discriminant analysis). Out of logistic regression and LDA, which is closer to what happens in linear regression?
