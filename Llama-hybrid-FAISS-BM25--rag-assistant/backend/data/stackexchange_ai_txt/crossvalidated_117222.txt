How do I define the number of parameters needed to specify this Bayesian network?

If it is known that Bayesian network has one root node, one node with a single parent, two nodes with two parents and the remaining nodes with 3 parents, indicate how many parameters would be required to define this Bayesian network? Do this for the following combination of number of variables (n) and their values (m): a) n = 20 and m = 2; b) n = 20 and m = 5; c) n = 500 and m = 10; I'm not sure how to answer this question. I know that there's a formula which states that the number of parameters equals to m^n - 1, where n is a number of variables and m is the number of values per variable. Could someone please help me understand this question better? Thanks!
