force serialization of static fields

I need to persist several classes with A LOT of static fields (which are arrays filled & modified during the runtime). It would take a lot of effort to convert from static fields to instance vars, so I'd rather go for a quick solution, if any. So far the path of least resistance is to cook my own writeObject() for each class. Alternatively, i dont need Serialization as such - any mechanism to store/load an object from persistent storage will do. E.g. XMLDecoder to decompose the bean objects, etc.
