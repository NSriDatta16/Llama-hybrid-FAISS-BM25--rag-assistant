PHP considers null is equal to zero

In PHP, ($myvariable==0) When $myvariable is zero, the value of the expression is true; when $myvariable is null, the value of this expression is also true. How can I exclude the second case? I mean I want the expression to be true only when $myvariable is zero. Of course I can write ($myvariable != null && $myvariable == 0) But is there other elegant way to do this?
