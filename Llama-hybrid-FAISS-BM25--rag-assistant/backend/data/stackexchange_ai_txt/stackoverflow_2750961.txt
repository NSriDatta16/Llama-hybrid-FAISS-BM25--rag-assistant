Binding WPF ComboBox in XAML - Why is it Empty?

I am trying to learn how to bind my simple database (.sdf) to a combobox. I created a dataset with my tables in it. I then dragged a table from the DataSource onto my control. There are no build warnings/errors, and when it runs, the ComboBox is empty. The paths that is shows are correct, the selectedPath is "ID" and the displaypath is "Name". If I do this in Linq to Sql, the combo box does populate: this.accountComboBox.ItemsSource = from o in db.Account select new { o.ID, o.Name }; But I would like to learn how to do this in XAML. I have dragged datagrids from the DataSource as well, but they are not populated either. Any idea?
