Does PHP Have an Equivalent of Java's RequestDispatcher.forward?

In Java I can write a really basic JSP index.jsp like so: The effect of this is that a user requesting index.jsp (or just the containing directory assuming index.jsp is a default document for the directory) will see home.action without a browser redirect, i.e. the [forward]( http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html#forward(javax.servlet.ServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.ServletResponse)) happens on the server side. Can I do something similar with PHP? I suspect it's possible to configure Apache to handle this case, but since I might not have access to the relevant Apache configuration I'd be interested in a solution that relies on PHP alone.
