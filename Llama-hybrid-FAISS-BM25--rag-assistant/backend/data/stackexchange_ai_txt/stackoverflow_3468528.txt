No, Magento is not built to allow different vendors to have access only to their information. I believe that Enterprise tries to add some of this functionality, but do not rely on the system keeping everything separate. Notably, even if the products can be hacked, there is no such system of permissions for attributes, or attribute sets. If one owner deletes an attribute set, the store for the other owner will be affected. Similarly, the category manager has the same issue. Order management in the backend is in the same place. Maybe not the answer you wanted, but hopefully that helps. Thanks, Joe
