Should I apply PCA on my entire dataset or just the data converted from nominal?

I have a data-set with a decent number of attributes, half of them nominal. I used a binary vectorizer to convert the nominal attributes to numerical, but now there are far too many of them. I'm not sure how to use PCA on the data-set for the best results. Here are the three approaches I thought of: Load the data, remove the target variable, then run PCA on the entire data-set. The problem is my data here is non-standardized because some of it is income, some of it is age etc. It's also not scaled. I could scale it to go from 0-1 but some of the values have extremely high ranges, from 0 to 99999. Load the data, remove the target variable, then run PCA only on the values that i converted from being Nominal. Re-add these PCA-generated columns to the original numeric data. Load the data, remove the target variable, then run PCA separately for each attribute that used to be nominal, so for example run it for education-College , education-High School , generate n number of principal components, re-add to the original columns and then run it again for another ex-nominal variable, keep repeating until done. The second approach seems the most sensible to me, but I'm not too sure. If it helps I am using Python/Pandas/Scikit-Learn for all of this.
