Safety stock calculations using Intermittent Bootstrap

Together with fellow students, I’m working on an assignment to calculate safety stock levels in case of intermittent demand. We’re already able to simulate the demand like in the paper of Willemain, Smart, Schwarz (2004), but are now in question what is the best manner to approach the finalizing calculations of the safety stock per simulation. Currently we’re using a basic formula based on the maximum and average demand of every simulation but we’re wandering if this is a correct way. Do you have tips/suggestions on how to proceed? Many thanks!
