You should encourage people about things that you want them to do. You should "feed the animal". Look at stackoverflow; what do you think about badges? Why do you think this wonderful things exist? Thanks to ego , there is nothing you can't get it done. Give them badges, real badges, wearable badges. They will wear with happiness, they will do with happiness. Btw, yes, I am a boss :)
