FMS server technology: 10 connections vs. $4.5K

I came across this comparison chart that suggests that FMS costs about 4.5 grands (compared to $995 for wowza and free for Red5). Since I'm at the stage of choosing/learning the technology, I'd rather take free Red5, but Red5 looks like a poorly-organized, poorly-documented, and poorly-featured project compared to FMS or wowza, so I'm going for FMS for now. The big problem with FMS for me is the cost. I'm probably missing something big here. Is FMS only for companies with deep pockets? I see in the comparison chart that they give you 10 connections are free, but since I'm very new to the technology I can't tell what 10 connections is good for. Can someone please clarify with some simple example what type of application could be sustained with 10 connections and when 10 connections would not be sufficient?
