Understanding The Vertical and Horizontal stack in conditional gated Pixelcnn paper

I found some confusion understanding the importance of vertical and horizontal stacks as a solution to the blind spot problem presented in the original pixel cnn architecture discussed in this paper . The vertical and horizontal stacks ideas were presented in the this paper . Therefore, after browsing, I found this link to explain the concept. In the vertical stack section of the web page, I still find that pixel f, still cannot see pixels c, d and e. Any help is much appreciated!!
