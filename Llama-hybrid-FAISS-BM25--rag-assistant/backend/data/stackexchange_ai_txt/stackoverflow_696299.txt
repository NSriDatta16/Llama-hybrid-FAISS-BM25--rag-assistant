Embedding Silverlight app in an Eclipse RCP

Does anyone has a good resource on embedding a Silverlight application in an Eclipse RCP application? Scenario is as follows: We have a third party application that we want to integrate into an already developed Eclipse RCP Application, and we don't want to redo anything. Also, I can't just start this as a second app but must be embedded within the application that we already have. I know it is possible to embed using OLE objects, would this be the way to go?
