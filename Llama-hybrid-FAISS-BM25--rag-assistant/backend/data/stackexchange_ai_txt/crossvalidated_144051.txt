If you have multiple potentially correlated variables for both 'Organizational justice' and 'turnover intention' you might want to use Principle Component Analysis or a factor analysis-based method to reduce the dimensionality of your data. By using PCA, you'll be able to summarise many correlated variables into one variable that explains the largest proportion of the variance for your data (PC1). Therefore, if a large proportion of the variance is accounted for (>80%) in PC1 for organizational justice, and the same when you perform PCA for 'turnover intention' you'll have two principle component variables that represent both. You could then correlate those two separate PCs to see how organisational justice and turnover relate to each other.
