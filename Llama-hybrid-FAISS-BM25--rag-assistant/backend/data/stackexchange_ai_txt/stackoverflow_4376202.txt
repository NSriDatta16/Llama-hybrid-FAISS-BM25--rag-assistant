I don't remember much about "old" lighting features in OpenGL, but I believe that your problem is having an invalid value in gl_LightSource[0].position . How do you specify the light position ( glLightParameterfv(GL_LIGHT_POSITION, ...); )? Most importantly, what's the state of the model-view matrix when you specify them? If the model-view matrix is identity, you specify the light positions in eye space , which gives you the impression that they move with the camera (well, remember that the camera is at (0,0,0) always and it's the world which moves). For a correct result, I believe you should specify the lights in world space , i.e. after performing camera transformations on the model-view matrix, but before doing any other operations on it. The light position is multiplied by the model-view matrix at the moment of specification, so your shader will always get the value in eye space , which is useful - you don't need to modify it any more since lighting calculations are done in eye space. This also implies that eyePos should be just (0,0,0) in your calculations, which makes v equal to just normalize(-p) . Also, for best results make those calculations in fragment shader, not vertex shader. :) Hope that helps.
