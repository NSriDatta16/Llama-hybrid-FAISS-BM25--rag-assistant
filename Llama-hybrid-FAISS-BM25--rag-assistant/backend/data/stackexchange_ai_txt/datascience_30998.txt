High Correlation between inputs of neural network

I am building a neural network to predict if a video is pornographic or not by analysing the bytes of upload and download at every 0.1 seconds for a total of 25.6 seconds. So, I have 512 input variables, 256 of download and 256 of upload and I realised that for the same second, the upload and download variables are highly correlated. Does this mean that I am just adding complexity by distinguishing between upload and download variables?
