The expected accuracy of the model should increase when all 5 inputs are available Not necessarily true, NNs do the learning, and may decide that the most import features are A,C,D, and the others only contribute a small amount, while I'm not saying they aren't important, it isn't necessary that missing B and/or E even alters the output. With option 2, you've already addressed a major problem with that approach. I work with many networks that have input dimensions >1000, so this clearly cannot scale well. Don't think I need to add much more you've solved that already. For option 1, that is a rather intuitive idea, why not just teach the network what is missing by showing it a 0? Well the problem there is that 0 is a meaningful value, and is significantly different from a missing value. So the network would still be learning a great deal from that input, which sometimes is good, but if it is also possible for say Feature B to be 0, then that is overlapping the value with a biased (not chosen by random) replacement for it. One of the fantastic things about Neural Networks is their ability to learn from data, and this includes when data is missing from the input. Now, it is important to recognise that in training you should be remaining as balanced as you can, if Feature B only exists in say 5% of the training data, is it worth including in the feature space of the model if it can't add too much information? There are techniques to balance this data appropriately, and there are a lot of methods to impute, replace, or predict missing values. A fairly significant amount of ML techniques can handle missing values, so often you won't have to worry about them. For example, a RandomForest Classifier will be able to ignore/handle missing values, while still learning effectively. When it comes down to it, you should pick a feature space that is reasonably stable, if only 5% of all training data contains all 5 inputs, then 5 features isn't likeley to be the best choice, find a happy medium where you do have a significant number of features present in all training data.
