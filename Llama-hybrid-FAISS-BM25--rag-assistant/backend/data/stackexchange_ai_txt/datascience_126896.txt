This means that each of the above mentioned series will at some point reach a number of 0 remaining customers. After how many months does this happen on average? From this and the structure of your overall question, I get the impression that you would like to perform survival analysis to determine the point when existing customers churn. To accomplish this in Python, you could use the pysurvival library. This works by building a survival model that predicts the probability of an event happening at a particular time - in this case, that 100% of customers who sign up in a particular month churn. The model would allow for comparison of predicted churn to actual churn to determine prediction accuracy. I am not sure if you are simply working with churn data itself or if you have other features that can be incorporated into the model, but it is worth noting that pysurvival has the ability to incorporate extraneous features into the model as well.
