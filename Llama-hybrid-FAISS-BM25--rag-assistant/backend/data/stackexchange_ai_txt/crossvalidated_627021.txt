PF is an optimization technique, think things like gradient descent, where RNN is the model the optimization technique is applied to. TLDR: PF is a technique for optimizing a set of parameters using bayes theorem. RNN is a level of abstraction to NN (allowing cyclical connections). These cyclical connections make it difficult to train properly using gradient decent with back propagation. This has led to alternative RNN structures such as lstm or alternative optimization such as backpropagation through time. PF-RNN are just the optimization schema of a PF applied to an RNN.
