If you registered the UDID of a device in the provisioning portal and selected it when you created the mobileprovision, then you should be able to install that provision on the device using Xcode's Organizer. If it doesn't let you, go back to the portal and check the UDIDs you used. If you can install the profile on your iPhone 4, but the app won't run, check which profile you used for the exact current type of Build of the current Target which you are trying to run (as every Build can use a different profile. And Target settings over-ride Project settings).
