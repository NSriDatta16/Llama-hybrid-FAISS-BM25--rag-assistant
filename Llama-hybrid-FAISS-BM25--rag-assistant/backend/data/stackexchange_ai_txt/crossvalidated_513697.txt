How to use causal inference to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different groups?

I'm experienced in data science but new to causal methods. I'm trying to figure out how to frame a question I want to investigate in a causal way. I'm interested in seeing if COVID-19 has impacted two similar groups (one with a certain attribute and the other without) differently by comparing them 'before' and 'after' the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. A few things I'm struggling to make sense of: What is the 'treatment'/'intervention'? Both groups are subject to the COVID-19 epidemic. I think that the treatment must be the presence/absence of the attribute that distinguishes the groups? But the attribute is consistent for each group across both the before and after time periods. The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic was gradual rather than a sudden event, and hard to precisely define. The causal methods I've seen, such as regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences and synthetic controls, seem to assume the an event comes into affect immediately. Can these methods be used for this problem? Are there alternatives? I'm a bit lost, so any thoughts would be appreciated!
