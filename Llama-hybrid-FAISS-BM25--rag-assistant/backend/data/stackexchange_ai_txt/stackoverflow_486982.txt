As jdangel points out the www is good practice in some cookie situations but I believe there is another reason to use www. Isn't it our responsibility to care for and protect our users. As most people expect www, you will give them a less than perfect experience by not programming for it. To me it seems a little arrogant, to not set up a DNS entry just because in theory it's not required. There is no overhead in carrying the DNS entry and through redirects etc they can be redirected to a non www dns address. Seriously don't loose valuable traffic by leaving your potential visitor with an unnecessary "site not found" error. Additionally in a windows only network you might be able to set up a windows DNS server to avoid the following problem, but I don't think you can in a mixed environment of mac and windows. If a mac does a DNS query against a windows DNS mydomain.com will return all the available name servers not the webserver. So if in your browser you type mydomain.com you will have your browser query a name server not a webserver, in this case you need a subdomain (eg www.mydomain.com ) to point to the specific webserver.
