Check encrypted file for empty content

I'm using gpg to decrypt files sent to me by a vendor. Everything works fine accept for when the content of the encrypted file is empty (the vendor has told me that there is no content in the files in question). If I try and decrypt one of these files I get: gpg: can't handle this ambiguous signature data Is there any way to check that the file has no content accept for the header, so that I can set it up to fail more elegantly?
