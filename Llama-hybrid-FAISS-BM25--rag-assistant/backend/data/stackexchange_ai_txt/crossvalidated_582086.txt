It is the identity operator , $IX_t=X_t$ , and is typically used in ARIMA type formulas where you also have the backshift operator $B$ (sometimes people use $\nabla$ for the backshift), or polynomials in $B$ . Essentially, it's a way to make notation more compact. For instance, if you have a time series $(X_t)$ , then $$(I-B)X_t = IX_t-BX_t = X_t-X_{t-1},$$ and $$(I-B^2)X_t = IX_t-B(BX_t) = X_t-X_{t-2}.$$
