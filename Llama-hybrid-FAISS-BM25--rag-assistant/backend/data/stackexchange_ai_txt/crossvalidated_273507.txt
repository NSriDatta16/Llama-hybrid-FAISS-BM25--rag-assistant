HMM: Why are observations conditional on the latent state and not vice versa?

The model of a HMM consists of a latent Markov chain with state $X$ and transition probabilities $P(X^t \mid X^{t-1})$ , and observation variables $Y$ that depend on the current latent state via $P(Y^t \mid X^t)$ . This results in the following causal graphical model: Question What are reasons for why the arrows go from the latent state to the observed variable, and not the other way round? I'm looking both for technical and philosophical reasons. An example of a technical reason could be: This way, the model has fewer parameters. Philosophical reasons could be based on the relationship between the causal structure of the model and the causal structure of reality. Shall the latent variable cause the observation, or shall they influence the latent state? I'd also be very glad about pointers to literature that discusses this issue.
