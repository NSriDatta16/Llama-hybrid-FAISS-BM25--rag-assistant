We define the null hypothesis with equality because we need some null value to compute the test statistic and p-value. Consider the steps in computing the test statistic in a $t$ -test. $$ t = \dfrac{\bar x - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} $$ In order to calculate this, we need some $\mu_0$ that we define in the null hypothesis, $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ . If we define the null hypothesis as $H_0: \mu\ne\mu_0$ , we cannot calculate the test statistic. As you have noticed, this may be of dubious utility, and alternatives have been proposed that range from confidence intervals to equivalence testing (such as TOST) to Bayesian methods.
