what's with a "embedded webserver in a web application" in Python?

CherryPy claims: Your CherryPy powered web applications are in fact stand-alone Python applications embedding their own multi-threaded web server. You can deploy them anywhere you can run Python applications. Apache is not required, but it's possible to run a CherryPy application behind it (or lighttpd, or IIS). CherryPy applications run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and any other platform supporting Python. Having come from PHP and wanting to learn Python, I came upon a thread here in SO while looking for a webserver I can setup to start Python web development. However, after almost googling myself to death, I can't still find one. I came across entries like "Django has its own lightweight webserver" and the aforementioned Cherrypy. What I am confused about is this :I was used to using XAMPP, where I have a web server, a database server and my application and I can't visualize the idea of a "web server inside the application itself". How do I connect to my database server then? How do I configure stuff like custom urls and directory protection (much like what I do in Apache)? Thanks in advance guys!
