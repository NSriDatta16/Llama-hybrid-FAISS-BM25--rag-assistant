Basically this can't be done directly because the multiply imputed fit is different from a single fit as presented in a normal Cox model. When multiple imputation is performed, several possible datasets are generated and the model fitting process combines those fits into a single point estimate. If you wish to obtain survival curves from the survival outcomes and possible stratifying variables used to estimate the Cox model, you will have to estimate the survival curve for each of the Cox models and combine them in some "sane" way. This is methodologically unclear. You could consider a point-wise average, a maximum, or reconstruct the risk sets to directly pool the survival outcomes. There is no clear answer here, but each approach is defensible yet imperfect.
