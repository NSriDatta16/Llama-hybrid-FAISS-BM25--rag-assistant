Odds Ratio, More Likely vs. As Likely, do I need to subtract 1?

When reporting odds ratios from a logistic regression, I've seen the words "as likely" and "more likely." If the odds ratio is say 3.5, I know that I can say females are 3.5 times as likely as males to graduate high school, however, this "as likely" doesn't make much sense to the general public. Can I simply say females are 3.5 times "more likely" to graduate males, or do I need to subtract 1 from the 3.5, and say female students are 2.5 times more likely to graduate than males?
