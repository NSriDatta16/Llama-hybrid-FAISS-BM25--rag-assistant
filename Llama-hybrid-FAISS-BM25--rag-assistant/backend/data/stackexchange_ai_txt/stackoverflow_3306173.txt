Handling touches on Iphone

Im having a little problem on handling touches in my apps. I set my touchesBegan like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *currentTouch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; touchPoint = [currentTouch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(image1.frame, touchPoint)) { image1IsTouched = YES; } } Then i set my touch move like this: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *currentTouch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; currentPoint = [currentTouch locationInView:currentTouch.view]; if(image1IsTouched == YES) { image1.center = CGPointMake(currentPoint.x,currentPoint.y); ..... } } Now i tried my app on actual unit and thats where i notice my problem. While im touching the image1 with 1 finger the app is doing ok and its checking for collision everytime i drag my finger. The problem occurs when i touch the screen with another finger while touching/dragging the image. The image im currently touching will jump to the other finger. I've tried [myView setMultipleTouchEnable:NO]; & using NSArray on touches and comparing the [touches count] with the touch but its not working. Can someone show me how to set a uiimageview to act on single touch only. Thanks.
