Getting the number of active employees per month

In large companies with thousands of employees, how to get the number of employees per month? everyday there could be new employees, resigned or terminated employees, etc. If I want to get the number of the employees in a given month it will be confusing since the number of employees differs from one day to another in the same month. Do I just calculate the average number (total employee in all days/total days) or can I get the highest and lowest and divide by two? which is better or is there a better and more accurate way?
