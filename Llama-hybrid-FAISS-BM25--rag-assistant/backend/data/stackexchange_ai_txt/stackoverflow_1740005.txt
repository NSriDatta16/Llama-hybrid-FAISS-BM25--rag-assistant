You can also use a regular expression to achieve the same effect, without all the string manipulation you are doing right now. This would be the most elegant solution: $string = "this is *noun but it is *name"; // Lets set up an empty array $tokens = array(); preg_match_all('/\*\w+/m', $string, $tokens); $tokens = $tokens[0]; // Only one sub-pattern, dropping unnecessary dimension. var_dump($tokens); Regular expressions exists to do mainly exactly the kind of task you are trying to achieve now. They are usually faster than doing string manipulations manually (Regular Expression engine in PHP is compiled code). To explain my regex: / : start boundary \* : an asterisk ( * ) \w : any alpha-numeric character or underscore + : previous marker, 1 or more times. (match \w one or more times) / : end boundary m : multiline modifier
