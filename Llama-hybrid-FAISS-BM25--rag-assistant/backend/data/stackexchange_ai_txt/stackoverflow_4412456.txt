After getting Agent running again (server reboot), I tried manually deleting the change_tables record and CT table, but when I tried to enable the table, there were a series of errors relating to CDC metadata. However, I was able to disable CDC for the entire database successfully, and then re-enable it. This of course dropped any and all resources related to the CDC feature. I'm chalking up the weird behavior to the all of the rapid DDL I was running for testing. As this was a test environment, I had options that wouldn't be available in a production environment, at least without backing up the captured data. I'm concluding that yes, you really shouldn't manually mess with any of the CDC resources.
