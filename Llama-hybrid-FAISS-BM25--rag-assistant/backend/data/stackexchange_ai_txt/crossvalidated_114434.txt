What is meant by effective parameters in machine learning

My question might be a bit ambiguous, but I started to wonder what does the "effective parameters" mean in machine learning? I have heard few professors of machine learning in my university talk about effective parameters (the context was about k-nearest neighbors or Gaussian mixture models etc.). Any clarification on what this might mean? Thank you for any help! P.S. I have also seen this term in the book: The Elements of Statistical Learning 2nd edition, Trevor Hastie, page 15.
