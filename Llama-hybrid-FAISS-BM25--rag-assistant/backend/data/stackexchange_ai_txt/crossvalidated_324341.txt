A good resource will be the classical textbook on reinforcement learning Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction , mostly the part about dynamic programming. Another good resource will be Berkeley's opencourse on Artificial Intelligence on EdX. The difference in their name (Bellman operator vs Bellman update operator) does not matter here. You will see other names like Bellman backup operator. They are all the same thing. Basically it refers to the operation of updating the value of state $s$ from the value of other states that could be potentially reached from state $s$. The definition of Bellman operator requires also a policy $\pi(x)$ indicating the probability of possible actions to take at state $s$. The second definition of Bellman operator in your example means updating the value of state $s$ by taking actions with probability from any predefined policy $\pi$. On the other hand, the first definition of Bellman operator is only specific to one policy , which is to take action on state $s$ that gives the highest value of state $s$ with 100% probability. Therefore, the first definition can be regarded as a specific example of the second definition: the second definition works for any policy, while the first definition only works for the optimal policy that gives the highest value.
