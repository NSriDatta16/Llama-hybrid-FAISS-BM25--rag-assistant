In practice many different users from the public internet often use the same IP address via NAT or other IP sharing. DHCP is much more common than it was in days of yore, which means these IP addresses will be released and re-issued daily or at some other frequency. Mobile devices will change IP addresses frequently. So the stability and validity of an IP address varies by networking technology (cellular, cable, DSL, dial-up, etc). This may be fine, based on your security policies. You should also look at nonces, forced logins, and other security mechanisms based on what your trying to accomplish. You may want to change the session id every N requests or hash the User Agent string with the IP address.
