Common parameters for conditional likelihood

I am trying to understand the concept of conditional likelihood in the context of logistic regression. One paper I am reading defines $L(\theta; y|x) = f(y|x; \theta)$, then goes on to point out that there may be different distributions $f(y|x; \theta)$ for every different $x$, and also that these different distributions share the same parameters $\theta$. The first part of this makes sense that there may be different distributions for each $x$, however, I am failing to understand why $\theta$ must be the same for each of these distributions. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?
