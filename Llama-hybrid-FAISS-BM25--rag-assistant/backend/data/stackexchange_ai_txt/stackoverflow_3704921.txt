There's no reason. The primary key should be NVARCHAR(256), as is hard for me to believe that the UserId will always be exactly 256 chars. Right now this schema is potentially wasting (a lot of) space on disk. Note that with SQL Server 2008 row-compression storage the fixed length column would be stored as a variable length one on disk anyway (trailing spaces are removed), but only if row-compression is enabled.
