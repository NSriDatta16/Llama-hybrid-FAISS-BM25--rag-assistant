Most efficient way to retrieve the source of a website through PHP? (GET Request)

I know that file_get_contents can be used to retrieve the source of a webpage, but I want to know the most efficient way. I have an old class I made a long time ago that uses something like this: $this->socket = fsockopen($this->host, 80); fputs($this->socket, 'GET ' . $this->target . ' HTTP/1.0' . "\n"); fputs($this->socket, 'Host: ' . $this->host . "\n"); fputs($this->socket, 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008050509 Firefox/3.0b5' . "\n"); fputs($this->socket, 'Connection: close' . "\n\n"); $this->source = ''; while(!feof($this->socket)) { $this->source .= fgets($this->socket, 128); } fclose($this->socket); Is this the best way? By most efficient I mean returns the fastest results.
