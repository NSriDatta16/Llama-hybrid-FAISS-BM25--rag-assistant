Your current mixed model wing_tot ~ year + (1 | species) includes a random intercept for species. This means that you are modelling the average wing size of each species as being drawn from a Gaussian distribution. According to your model fit the estimated mean of this distribution is 1.380e+02 and the variance is 366.4. To know whether this assumption is justified you have to consider how many different species you collected data from (enough to estimate a Gaussian distribution from?), and whether a Gaussian distribution is indeed how wing size is distributed (I don't know much about birds but perhaps the wing size is not symmetrically distributed around some mean as there is a lower limit how small the wings can be but no upper limit?). However, even if both of these conditions do not hold it is probably still better to include the random intercept rather than leaving it out. Another potential issue is that your model currently is assuming that wing size does not change differently for each species by year. Perhaps this is something you also want to control for in your model? If you do then you can include a random slope of year by writing wing_tot ~ year + (1 + year | species) . Would you analize the output value in "year" (-3.209e-02) as that the mean size of the wings are significantly decreasing of 3.209e-02cm on the whole period? yes, that's what the output suggests. However, in order to determine whether this is significant you might want to also fit a model without the fixed effect of year, i.e. wing_tot ~ 1 + (1 | species) , and then do a model comparison between your fit and that fit, i.e. anova(fit1,fit2) . I think your final analysis where you are testing each year separately is not particularly useful for answering your question of interest. (There also seems to be a bug somewhere in your code as year2000 is included twice). However, it can be used to answer a related question. Perhaps you're interested in whether the effect of year on wing size is linear (which you are currently testing) or changes in some other non-linear way. One way of testing this is to include other terms in your model, such as the log of year or the square of year, and testing whether they are significant. However, rather than including arbitrary terms it might be better to develop a visual intuition first. One way of doing this is to plot the average wing size for each year, which is essentially what your regression is computing. As you can see from the plot there seems to be some structure in your data: the points up until ~2006 appear to have a higher variance than points from ~2007-2017. 2018 appears to be an outlier. Perhaps it's worth thinking about whether there is anything different about how this data was collected? Another issue could be whether there is data for every species for each year or do you only have data for some species for some years? It might also be worth making similar plots to the one I made for each of your species.
