The simple answer is that there is no support for PCM playback from Silverlight in version 2. So unless you want to write a fully managed PCM to MP3 converter you are stuck. Even then I'm not sure you could get the MediaElement to play from isolated storage. Is there any chance you could use a web service to perform the conversion? See also this question: Where's the sound API in Silverlight? Or, how do I write a music app to run in the browser? Update: Silverlight 3 supports your custom audio sources. However, it won't let you intercept samples to perform effects on WMA or MP3, presumably for DRM reasons, so you would still potentially need to write your own decoder.
