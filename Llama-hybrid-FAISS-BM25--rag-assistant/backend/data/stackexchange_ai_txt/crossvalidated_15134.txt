In my mind, Bayes vs frequentist is about formal inference, and exploratory data analysis is neither. Certainly, when it comes to model assessment/goodness-of-fit and sensitivity analysis, in which I'd classify your points (1), (3), and (4), there will be differences in how one would proceed, but that's because the nature of the differences between the analysis and computational methods rather than about philosophy. Regarding your (2), I don't generally see the results of the EDA as pointing you towards the Bayesian or frquentist approach, but rather I'd think it was the goal of the study that mattered most. For me personally, the EDA (plus deep introspection) would point me towards a model, and if I could find a natural frequentist approach that answered the scientific question reasonably well, I'd go with that, but if by the nature of the situation, no frequentist method would work well, and if there were a reasonable prior, I'd use Bayes.
