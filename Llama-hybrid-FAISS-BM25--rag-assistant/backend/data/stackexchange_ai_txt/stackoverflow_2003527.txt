Why are django projects python packages?

Why aren't they simply directories? Any good advice says to keep as much as possible in the apps and not to couple them to the project. The very ability to import an app as project.application discourages this. Why does django-admin.py create the __init__.py at all? The project is perfectly useful without it. What is the justification?
