Autocorrelation versus ordinary correlation for Gini coefficents and discussion topics?

I have a data structure like this: countryA: 2004, 2007, 2010,... countryB: 1999, 2005, .... I would like to compute the correlation between the increasing of the Gini coefficient and the percentage a certain topic is discussed in the public. I do not think that my data is balanced. I know that most of the time people use time series cross-sectional models to compute a correlation between a Gini coefficient and a discussion topic. Yet, I have read some articles that make an appealing case for using multilevel regression models in such cases. I am applying in Stata the following command: xtmixed topicA gini || country: Here are my questions: How should I check whether my data is autocorrelated and is there a way to account for autocorrelation in those multi level models? Does it make sense to check for autocorrelation when I have very few cases (total over all countries 126 and within countries between 3 and 10) when the time distance between the data points is kind of random?
