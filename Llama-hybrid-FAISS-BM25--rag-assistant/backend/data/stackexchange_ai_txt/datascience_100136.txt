Currently you're using using a pre-trained NER model to tag a single sentence. The pre-trained model is not especially trained for phone numbers, it performs general NER. This is why it will also tag persons/organization names, places, dates, etc. You could train a custom NER model but you need a large amount of data with phone numbers annotated. A single sentence is useful to debug but you must have at least a medium-size sample of data with phone numbers annotated in order to evaluate your method. A single sentence is not enough because it's normal for the system to make some errors, the point is to minimize the amount of errors on a representative sample. Finally it's important to consider alternatives to NER: phone numbers follow a quite specific format, it's probably more efficient to use some simple pattern-matching in this case.
