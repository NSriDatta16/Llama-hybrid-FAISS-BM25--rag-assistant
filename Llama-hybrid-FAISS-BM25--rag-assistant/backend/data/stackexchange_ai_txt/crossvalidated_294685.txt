We can indeed make assumptions about the response variable. Indeed, when you apply a regular linear regression model, by definition you are assuming a normal distribution of the response variable. When you want to use GLM to make predictions, your model inevitably will assign some noise to your predicted values. The assumption over the response variable will help your model to distribute that random noise more accurately. In addition, since GLM go beyond the traditional linear regression models, you are able to evaluate further models as for example logistic regression. If you change the assumed normal distribution in the response for a binomial distribution you will be actually using a logistic regression model (take a look at the very first example from the MATLAB's help page from your link!). For a detailed explanation, take a look at this helpful lesson: https://web.archive.org/web/20170710062505/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/216 Hope this helps and good luck!
