Sorry, a question, not an answer: What are the server differences between IIS6 and II7 that matter to your code? For ASP.NET development, the web server itself is somewhat ASP.NET neutral. It forwards the request to the .NET framework, so THAT's the part that matters. More info here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/58wxa9w5.aspx Adding Morgan Cheng's comment into the answer: There is some difference between IIS6 and IIS7 on how to explain web.config. For example, to customize UrlRouteHandler, according to MSDN. IIS6 and IIS7 are different. Details in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.routing.urlroutinghandler.aspx
