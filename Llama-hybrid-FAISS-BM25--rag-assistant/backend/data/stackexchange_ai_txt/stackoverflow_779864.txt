Having worked a modeler and texture artist for over 3 years, I have tried the majority of modeling tools and keep coming back to Nevercenter's Silo . It's the most elegant, well designed sub-d polygonal modeling application I have ever had the pleasure of using. Once you've used Silo, you'll wonder why anyone uses anything else.
