One obvious solution is to save a list of children IDs in the collection's database row, e.g 1111,1112,1113,1114,1115 . It's quick, easy, and guarantees uniqueness, but I imagine it would be unnecessarily CPU-heavy to compare lists like this, especially if they get long, not to mention that it's a fair amount of duplication when it comes to storage space.
