Use scikit-learn package. In your case you need find sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression and User guide It's clear enough for understanding. You needn't special actions to win collinearity. But instead of linear method you can use non parametric algorithm like random forest sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier . Ð¡ompare the results of the logistic regression & random forest on the test data
