Using PHP in a frame on a ColdFusion page

My organization uses ColdFusion pages for most everything. The administration decides the standard layout, look, and feel of every page so things look uniform across all of the organizations pages, but each department can modify certain "components" of their pages. Each of the "components" that can be modified exist as a .cfm file, so any changes I make must be made in those .cfm files. I want to include a PHP script I made in on one of my departments pages, but obviously I cannot use two server-side scripts on the same file at the same time. My idea is to make a frame in the .cfm file where the source is my PHP script like this: When I do this I can view my page's source code in FireFox, click on the http://myorgainzation/test.php link, and view what my PHP script generates. The problem is that the information generated by the PHP script isn't showing up in the frame like I expected it to. In fact there is nothing there at all. I have not used frames very often, is it possible to do what I want?
