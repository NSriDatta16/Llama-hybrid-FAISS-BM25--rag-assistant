You got it right that you can't simply regress one on another because it'll probably lead to spurious correlation . That's why in time series analysis the non-stationary series are often transformed to stationary series. An example is so called Box-Jenkins approach , where you difference the non-stationary. Differencing is one of the de-trending methods. There are others. Once you difference your series, they become stationary so you run the regressions on them. This is a fairly standard approach. I'd suggest you also pay attention to possible cointegration which tends to complicate the analysis, but has to be taken care of it is present. The idea of a cointegration is very simple as shown here on example of a drunkard and his dog
