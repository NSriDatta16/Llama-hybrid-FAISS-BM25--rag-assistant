Had been looking for this myself, but using the example above gave me from year 0001 dates. Here's my alternative, incorporated with smorgan's more elegant mod suggestion though beware I haven't leak tested this yet: NSDate *myDate = [NSDate date]; // Get the nearest 5 minute block NSDateComponents *time = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components:NSHourCalendarUnit | NSMinuteCalendarUnit fromDate:myDate]; NSInteger minutes = [time minute]; int remain = minutes % 5; // Add the remainder of time to the date to round it up evenly myDate = [myDate addTimeInterval:60*(5-remain)];
