Dataset target values selection

Let's say I want to train a neural network to predict whether some state is 'good' or 'bad'. We can think of it as a value function for a board game. So a natural choice would be to place one neuron in an output layer with hyperbolic tangent function activation. Then I need to construct a dataset where for each 'good' position the target value equals 1 and -1 otherwise and train with mean squared error loss function. So I chose target values in dataset that match my activation function's image. From what I've read this is a common approach. But what if I assign some states greater or lower values than 1 and -1 respectively? Does it make any sense? If so, can we say anything theoretically how such change would affect training?
