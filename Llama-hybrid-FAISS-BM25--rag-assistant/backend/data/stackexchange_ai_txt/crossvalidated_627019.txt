Complex Relationships: When you suspect that the relationship between variables is complex and not just linear or monotonic, MI can provide a more comprehensive measure of dependency. Mixed Data Types: If you're dealing with a mix of continuous, ordinal, and nominal variables, MI can offer a consistent measure across variable types. No Assumptions: If you want a measure that doesn't make underlying assumptions about data distributions, MI can be more suitable. Feature Selection: In machine learning, MI is often used for feature selection since it can identify any statistical dependency between features and targets.
