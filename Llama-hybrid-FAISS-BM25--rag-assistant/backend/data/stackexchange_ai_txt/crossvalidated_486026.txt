Model1 is a GAM (or a penalized GLM with smooth terms). Model2 and Model3 are equivalent mathematically, and practically equivalent up to implementational differences. (there's also the issue that gamm() defaults to fitting using maximum likihood, not REML, which you used in the gam() fit.) The Bayesian view of smoothing, which you are using with gam() and method = 'REML' provides an equivalency between smooths and random effects; technically these are all just Gaussian random fields. So just as you can consider a model with smooth terms as a GLMM (a mixed effects model), you can view a GLMM as a GAM where the random effects are represented by identity matrices as the penalty matrices of "smooths". It's better not to think about these models as unique types or species of model but as different facets of the same thing; otherwise you get twisted in all sorts of knots considering whether Model2 is a GAM or a GAMM! If you used a more general model fitting system like TMB or Stan (say via brms ), all this distinctions disappear as you're just estimating a set of parameters by evaluating a likelihood (plus doing some MCMC in the case of Stan). As to which model flavour or facet to use, if you have clustering at the subject level then Model2 or Model3 is the way to go as you should account for that clustering and Model1 doesn't. Then which of those you use will depend on how much data you have and how many subjects you have; gam() is not as efficient at fitting random effects as nlme is and once you get over say 50-100 levels of the subject factor nlme and hence gamm() will be much more efficient. The downside is that gamm() is much harder to make work in complex model settings and is more likely to fail with warnings, convergence issues, etc than gam() . Also consider gamm4::gamm4() which fits the models in a similar way to gamm() but which uses lme4 and hence is much better for non-Gaussian models. (Which you might consider here as the response Stress sounds like something that can only take positive values...)
