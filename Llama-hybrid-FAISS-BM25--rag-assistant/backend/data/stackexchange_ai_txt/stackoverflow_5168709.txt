When does one use Web Parts vs. Full blown ASP.NET application in SharePoint?

I'm still struggling with this question as I'm trying to get up to speed with SharePoint, coming from ASP.NET Web Forms. We're looking to use SharePoint exclusively for several reasons; one of the main selling points is to consolidate our development efforts. So for example, today we have several one-off websites with anywhere from 1-5 pages (smallish) on several servers, IIS installs, etc. and seem to be a bit fragmented. Let's say I have a requirement for a smallish site (1-5) pages. What is the SharePoint way to handle this situation? Do I create several Web Parts, then create the pages in SharePoint and plug them in or do I simply create an ASP.NET Web Forms application and provide a link within SharePoint to it? Thanks! Update I'm going with neither. Based on feedback and additional research it seems that Application pages are what I'm looking for. Here's a good article: http://grounding.co.za/blogs/brett/archive/2008/07/13/sharepoint-the-role-of-a-web-part-vs-using-application-pages.aspx
