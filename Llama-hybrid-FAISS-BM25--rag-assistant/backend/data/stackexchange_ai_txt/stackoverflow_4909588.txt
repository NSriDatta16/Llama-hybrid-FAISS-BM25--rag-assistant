Is ApplicationData safe place to store data during onPause?

In my application I'm storing all data in ApplicationData so that it can be easily shared between activities. My understanding is that this data should persist for the full life cycle of the application from the initial onCreate to the final onDestroy. That being the case, is there any need for me to store data in persistent storage during the onPause of all but the top activity?
