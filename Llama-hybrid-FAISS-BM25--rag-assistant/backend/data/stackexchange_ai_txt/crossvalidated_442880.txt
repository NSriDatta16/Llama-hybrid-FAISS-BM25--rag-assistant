Is it ok to refer to frequentist statistics as traditional or classical statistics?

I don't know of any statisticians or work in the data science industry so I'm not really in the know about all the lingo. I am trying to explain stats to others and was wondering if I could use the term "classical" or "traditional" instead of "frequentist", mainly because I do not like the word frequentist. I am hoping to use the word classical or traditional whenever I want to contrast frequentist stats with Bayesian stats. Thanks
