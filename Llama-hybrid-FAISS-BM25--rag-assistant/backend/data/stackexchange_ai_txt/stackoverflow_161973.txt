Sometimes you have to decide whether it is more space or more speed that you are after, which will lead to almost opposite optimizations. For example, to get the most out of you space, you pack structures e.g. #pragma pack(1) and use bit fields in structures. For more speed you pack to align with the processors preference and avoid bitfields. Another trick is picking the right re-sizing algorithms for growing arrays via realloc, or better still writing your own heap manager based on your particular application. Don't assume the one that comes with the compiler is the best possible solution for every application.
