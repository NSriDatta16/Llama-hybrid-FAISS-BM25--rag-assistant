The February 2009 issue of SQL Server Magazine has an excellent article for using arrays (More Options for Handling Arrays as Inputs). The article describes using a CLR split UDF. This works with SQL 2005 since it has CLR integration. Its too much code for me to post here and explain, but if you have access to the magazine's website I recommend downloading their function for doing this. Its fast and elegant.
