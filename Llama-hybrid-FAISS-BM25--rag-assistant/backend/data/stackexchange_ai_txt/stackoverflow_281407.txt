I recommend making the Game Score be the lower end of a 95% confidence interval. In the limit as you play a lot of games your Game Score approaches your average score though is always strictly less. It's like using average score but being appropriately skeptical of people who only played a few games and may have just been lucky. Said another way, it's a pessimistic estimate of what the true average will be after enough games are played. How to compute the 95% confidence interval without storing the entire list of scores: Computing a mean confidence interval without storing all the data points Alternatively, if you keep track of the number of games played, the sum of the person's scores, and the sum of the squares of their scores, you can compute the standard error as follows: SE = sqrt((ss - s^2/n) / (n-1) / n) Instead of bothering with the 95% CI, you could just let the Game Score be: s/n - SE Note that the above is negative infinity when only one game has been played. That implies you'd give someone who's played only one game the lowest possible score as their Game Score. Another idea is to explicitly show the confidence interval when ranking people (sorted by the low end). Then people would be playing more to both shrink their CI as well as to increase their average. Finally, it might make sense to weight more recent games more so that an isolated bad game decays in significance more quickly. The way to do that would be to pick a discount factor d greater than 1 and give the i th game a weight of d^(i-1) . (Although then I'm no longer sure how to apply the confidence interval idea.) PS: I expanded on this idea here: How to calculate mean based on number of votes/scores/samples/etc?
