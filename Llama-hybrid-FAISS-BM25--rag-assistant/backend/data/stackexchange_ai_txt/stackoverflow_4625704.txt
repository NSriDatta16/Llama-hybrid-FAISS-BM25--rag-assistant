I did the same thing for an application. (but I used PHP, anyway it doesn't matter for what you need) I used jQuery + jQuery UI drag & drop / resize I used AJAX with 4 parameters (x,y, z-index and id of the element) for drag & drop on drag stop I used XML as a database for this, but any database (or any persistance way) will do the trick. As @Thibault Witzig said, take the most pertinent for your project.
