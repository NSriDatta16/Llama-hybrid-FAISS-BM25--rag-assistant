Bootstrapping an ordinal logistic regression using R

As one of my IV does not meet the assumptions of a ordinal logistic regression model (the fit of the model itself is pretty good though R^2 = .52), I wanted to use bootstrapping in order to "secure" my findings. However, no matter what I do, there are errors... My AV is a ordinal variable with three levels. I tried different versions of the function. This is the one which seems right "the most". Maybe somebody can help?!? # Anzahl der gew√ºnschten Boot Samples B Fehler in optim(s0, fmin, gmin, method = "BFGS", ...) : Anfangswert in 'vmmin' ist nicht endlich That is German and means the starting value is not finite. How can I help R to find the correct starting value?!
