For serious reporting, usually you create data warehouse (Which is typically at least somewhat denormalized and certain types of calculations are done when the data is refreshed to save from averaging the values of 1.3 million records when you run the report. This is for the kind of reporting reporting that includes a lot of aggregate data. If your reporting needs are not that great a replicated database might work. It may also depend on how up-to-date you need the data to be as data warehouses are typically updated once or twice a day so the reporting data is often one day behind, OK for monthly and quarterly reports not so good to see how many widgits have been ordered so far today. The determinate of whether you need a data warehouse tends to be how long it would take to runthe reports they need. This is why datawarehouse pre-aggregate data on loading it. IF your reoports are running fine and you just want to get the worokload away from the input workload a replicated adatabase should do the trick. If you are trying to do math on all the records for the last ten years, you need a data warehouse. You could do this in steps too. Do the replication now, to get reporting away from data input. That should be an immediate improvement (even if not as much as you want), then design and implement the datawarehouse (which can be a fairly long and involved project and which will take some time to get right).
