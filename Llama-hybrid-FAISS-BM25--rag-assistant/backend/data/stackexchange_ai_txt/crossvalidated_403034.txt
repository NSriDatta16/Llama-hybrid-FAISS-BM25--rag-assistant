Is detrending equivalent to differencing?

Given a non-stationary time series, there are many statistical tests (e.g. ADF, KPSS, etc.) to test whether the series has unit root or not. Equivalently, they test whether a trending time series has a deterministic trend (trend stationary) or stochastic trend (difference stationary). However, I am confused as in the book 'Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R' by Jonathan D. Cryer and Kung-Sik Chan, page 90, they mention: Several somewhat different sets of assumptions can lead to models whose first difference is a stationary process. Suppose $$Y_t = M_t + X_t $$ where $M_t$ is a series that is changing only slowly over time. Here $M_t$ could be either deterministic or stochastic. If we assume that $M_t$ is approximately constant over every two consecutive time points, we might estimate (predict) $M_t$ at $t$ by choosing $\beta_0$ so that $$\sum_{j=0}^{1} (Y_{t-j}-\beta_{0,t})^2$$ is minimized. This clearly leads to $$\hat{M_t}=\frac{1}{2}(Y_t+Y_{t-1})$$ and the “detrended” series at time $t$ is then $$Y_t-\hat{M_t}=Y_t-\frac{1}{2}(Y_t+Y_{t-1})=\frac{1}{2}(Y_t-Y_{t-1})=\frac{1}{2}\nabla Y_t$$ This is a constant multiple of the first difference, $\nabla Y_t$ . Thus the author proves that whether you de-trend or take the first difference, the result is the same (up to a constant). Why, then, do we need to use unit root tests if both trend stationary and difference stationery are equivalent?
