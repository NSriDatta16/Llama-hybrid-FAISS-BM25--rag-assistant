Embedding compressed files into a c++ program

I want to create a cross-platform installer, in c++. It can be any compression type, eg zip or gzip, embedded inside the program itself like an average installer. I don't want to create many changes on different platforms, linux and windows. How do I embed and extract files to a c++ program, cross-platform?
