What are different storages available/used to/by a program during execution time?

Typically when you run any program, during execution time what are different storages available to it and what are they used for? I understand stack and heap. Also, I know that value types go in stack whereas ref types go in heap. But, I have also come across terms like program counter, instruction pointer. What do they mean? BOUNTY: There are some really good answers below. I am looking for something more detailed. Something, which will not compel me to read a few chapters from a COA book. Specific blogs/videos/explanation appreaciated.
