MapQuest API: Any reason to use it over Google Maps?

So I've been looking into the different mapping API's out there, and I've narrowed it down to Google Maps API and MapQuest's API. I'm leaning towards the MapQuest API for: Unlimited queries Support for draggable routes. Google's API allows multiple way points, which is not the same thing. The draggable routes is a pretty important feature for what I'm working on, but am I missing any big reasons to avoid MapQuest's API? Some caveat in the EULA perhaps? The draggable route support sucks in practice?
