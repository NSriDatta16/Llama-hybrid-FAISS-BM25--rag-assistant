I'm note sure I follow the R-code as I have only used R once or twice, but it looks to me as if you are comparing the marginal likelihood of a model with only an intercept and no slope (hadcru.mcmc.zero) and the marginal likelihood of a model with a slope and an intercept (hadcru.mcmc). However, while hadcru.mcmc.zero seems to be the correct model for H0, hadcru.mcmc does not seem to me to correctly represent H1 as there is nothing as far as I can see that constrains the slope to be positive. Is the something in the prior for the slope that makes it strictly positive (I don't know enough about MCMC in R to know)? If not, that may be where your problem lies as the marginal likelihood would then have a component representing the likelihood of the data for all of then egative values of the slop permitted under the prior (and 0) as well as the positive. It is debatable whether the H0 for this question should be that the slope is exactly zero, nobody would believe that to be plausible a-priori. Perhaps a test using the Bayes factor for a model where the slope is strictly positive (H1) against a model where it is zero or negative (H0). HTH (and I am not just confusing things)
