Question of understanding regarding Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process and acquisition function

I'm trying to understand Bayesian optimization and I struggle a lot with all the involved methods. Hence, I have some short questions: We start with a a-prior function, which is a gaussian process. A gaussian process is something like a normal distribution but with functions, instead of with variables. A gaussian process is mainly described by the expectation function $ m(x) $ together with a covariance function $ k(x, x') $ . The gaussian process is used to optimize an acquisition function. The maximum of the acquisition function determines where to check the next sample. We use the next sample together with the a-priori/gaussian process (which both together form the so-called a-posterior function) to get a "new" a-priori function. Is this correct? Did I miss something? Here is just a random plot so it's easier to respond and/or to grasp answers adequately: Image1: Image2:
