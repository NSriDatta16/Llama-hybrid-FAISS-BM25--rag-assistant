It is possible that memory becomes fragmented. That means that your program can fail to allocate 1KB, even though 17 GB of memory is free, when those 17GB is fragmented into 34 million free chunks of 512 bytes each. There's of course the possibility that your program miscalculates a memory allocation. A common bug is trying to allocate -1 bytes of memory. As memory sizes are always positive, that's interpreted as size_t(-1) , much more than 32 GB. But there's really no fact which points in that direction. To solve this problem, you will need someone who does speak C++. If it's indeed memory fragmentation, a good C++ programmer can tailor the memory allocation strategy to match your specific needs. Some strategies include keeping same-sized objects together, and replacing string by shims.
