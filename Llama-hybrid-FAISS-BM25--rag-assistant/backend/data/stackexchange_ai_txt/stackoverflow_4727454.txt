WordPress Anonymous Postings?

My client wants to create a form on his new WP site that when filled out and submitted will be submitted to his admin post queue to approve and if he approves gets posted on his site in the "blog" (which is actually a bunch of guitar like tabs). The form would be custom and have custom fields. Below is the form, but in the old design before I did a refresh on it. So, how hard would this be? He does not want it in the WP admin panel which i began to do, but outside in a page like /contribute
