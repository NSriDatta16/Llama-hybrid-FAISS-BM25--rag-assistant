I just ran into this problem as well, and even didn't work. This was particularly a problem because, for better or for worse, I'm using hidden inputs as counters (to keep track of a dynamic number of file upload fields, for example). These obviously need to be reset on reload to keep non-applicable warning messages from appearing. I "fixed" it for my in-house purposes by abandoning the reset button in favor of a link. Instead of I'm using Reset (the filename is index.php). Far from elegant, but it works for my purposes.
