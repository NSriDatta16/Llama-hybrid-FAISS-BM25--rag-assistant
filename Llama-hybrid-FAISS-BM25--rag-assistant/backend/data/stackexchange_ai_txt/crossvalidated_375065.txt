There are levels of intuition. For those familiar with matrix notation instatistics the intuition is to think of it as a square of the random variable: $x\to E[x^2]$ vs $A\to A^TA$ In matrix notation a sample of the random variable $x$ observations $x_i$ or a population are represented by a column vector: $$a=\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}$$ So, if you want to get a sample mean of the square of the variable $x$ , you simply get a dot product $$\bar{x^2}=\frac{a\cdot a} n$$ , which is the same in matrix notation as $A^TA$ . Notice, that if the sample mean of the variable is ZERO, then the variance is equal to the mean of the square: $\sigma^2=E[x^2]$ which is analogous to $A^TA$ . This is the reason why in PCA you need the zero mean, and why $A^TA$ shows up, after all PCA is to decompose the variance matrix of the data set.
