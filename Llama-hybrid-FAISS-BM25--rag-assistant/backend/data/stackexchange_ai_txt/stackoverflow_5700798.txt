Binding to the data is the best way. However if the data doesn't have the appropriate values then a converter needs to be employed (as in the examples). if you want something more elegant, I'd add a conversion within the data and bind to that property instead say like : public int RealProperty { .... } public SystemColors.AppWorkspaceColor Colour { return manglefromInt(RealProperty); }
