I'm not surprised your output didn't make much sense with the intercept included. By default, glm uses the alphabetically first category as the base case. In your case that is May, which has few counts and a correspondingly large standard error (see more about this below). That uncertainty will infect all of the contrast coefficients. Basically, for each month you are trying to compare its mean rate to the mean rate of May, which you don't know very well. If you wanted to use an intercept in your model, you should force the model to use the month with the largest count (October, it looks like) as the base case; then you will get reasonable coefficients. Without the intercept, your coefficients represent a fixed effect for each month. Basically, it is giving you an estimate of the mean rate for each month, transformed by the model's link function. You didn't specify a link function explicitly, so the model used the default, which for the quasipoisson family is log . So, the coefficients are the logs of the monthly mean rates. Another way to get the monthly counts is to use the model's predict method with type = 'response' , which will return the values directly. Finally, for your last question, the large negative coefficients for May and November indicate that the estimate of the mean rate for those months is much less than 1 (i.e., its log is much less than zero). I'm guessing you had no counts at all in those months, which also looks to be the case in your graph. When you try to compute an average rate without any counts, all the model can really say is that the rate must be tiny. Formally it gives you a number, but the number isn't very meaningful, which is what the large standard errors for those terms are telling you.
