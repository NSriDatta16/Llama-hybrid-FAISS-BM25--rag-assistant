A standard method is to begin by generating an autocorrelated Gaussian process $z_i$. (It doesn't have to be Gaussian, but such processes are easy to generate.) Take the logistic (inverse logit) of the values, producing a series of numbers $p_i = 1/\left(1 + \exp(-z_i)\right)$ in the interval $(0,1)$. Independently draw values from Bernoulli($p_i$) distributions to create a series of $0$ and $1$ values. Clustering will tend to occur with positive autocorrelation. As a bonus, this procedure allows you to perform two stages of simulation: you can fix the underlying realization of the Gaussian process and iterate the second stage of Bernoulli draws. Or you can generate a separate realization of the Gaussian process each time. There are probably R packages to do all this directly. The geoRGLM package performs this simulation in two dimensions (using a Matern autocorrelation function, which includes exponential and Gaussian autocorrelations as special cases); you could simulate along a straight line (or $1$ by $n$ grid) to obtain a time series.
