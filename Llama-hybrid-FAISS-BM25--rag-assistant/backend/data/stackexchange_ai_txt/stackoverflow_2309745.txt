How important is it to digitally sign our executables?

We produce a content management system. It's a database-based system, used only by businesses and organizations, and never downloadable from the Internet. That is, it's not the kind of software someone might stumble upon and wonder what it is and whether it's safe to run. Over the 20+ years our system is being sold, its executables have never been digitally signed. Is it time for us to start signing them? For starters, I can think of a few pros and cons: Pro: If using Verisign certificates, Windows Error Reporting can be used Pro: When Windows Vista and Windows 7 show one of those annoying UAC messages, signed applications are presented a bit more nicely Con: Certificates cost money. Not a lot, but if they're useless it's too much Con: Signing has some maintenance overhead, how much I don't know.
