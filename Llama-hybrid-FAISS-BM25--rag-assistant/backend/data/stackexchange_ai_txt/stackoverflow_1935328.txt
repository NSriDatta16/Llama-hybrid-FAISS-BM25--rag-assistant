Project organizing in Visual Studio

I'm going to cut my project into few parts in one solution. The main part will be console-window and another one should be static-lib. The problem is linking dependencies into static-lib projects. For example, I have a scheme below: Project lib 1 -> TinyXml / Main project \ Project lib 2 -> Another lib As you can see, my first lib should use TinyXml. Before this I linked tinyxml-lib and included a few .h files. But in lib-project I can't link another lib. So, what should I do? Or I just can link all dependencies into main project?
