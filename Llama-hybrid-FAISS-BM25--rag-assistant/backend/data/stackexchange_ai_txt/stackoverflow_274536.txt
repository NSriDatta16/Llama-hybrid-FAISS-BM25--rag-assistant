ASP.NET MVC - Script Combine

The ASP.NET team released the script combining feature in 3.5 SP1 as detailed here http://www.asp.net/Learn/3.5-SP1/video-296.aspx . Is there a similar feature already for the MVC framework? If not, is this in scope or is it possible to somehow leverage the webforms capability in MVC? I see this site uses a custom jquery.package.master which, I assume, they have rolled themselves (maybe into the build cycle, however it is not all minified therefore I think they have manually appended the scripts together rather than some automated minify & combine task). Would be interested in any ideas how to accomplish this in MVC but I dont want to begin rolling any of my own functionality in case I will be duplicating work in progress.
