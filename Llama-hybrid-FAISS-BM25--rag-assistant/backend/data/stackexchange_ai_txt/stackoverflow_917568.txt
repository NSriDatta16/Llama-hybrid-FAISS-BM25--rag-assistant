If you are embedding a flash flv video then yes, it could slow the page load down. This is because the page will need to load the flash plugin in order to get the content size, etc and render the initial frame etc. Doesn't mean it's a bad thing though. It won't be an extreme slowdown (flash is pretty highly optimised nowadays), so instead evaluate on how it looks rather than performance unless you are trying to eke out every dreg of performance on your page load :)
