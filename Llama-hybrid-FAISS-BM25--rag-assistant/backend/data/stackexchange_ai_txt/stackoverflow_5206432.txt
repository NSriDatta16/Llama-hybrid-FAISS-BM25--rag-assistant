I tend to always error on the side of organization so I would seperate each situation out with their own folder and just structure it like so... application | |... | |_views | |_user | |_header.php | |_footer.php | |_blocked | |_header.php | |_footer.php | |_error | |_header.php | |_footer.php | |_public |_header.php |_footer.php This way you can specify in the view load which header you want via the path $this->load->view('user/header'); and it is very obvious to anyone looking at this out of context to tell what you are doing compared to $this->load->view('error/header'); And for the logic of knowing which one to load, all of that needs to be determined in the controller. You should not be making those decisions in your view.
