Don't keep a file as a blob in your db... instead, keep the file outside of your web directory, then have a php file that checks access, and serves the file to people if they have correct access. $file = 'file_path'; header("Content-Type: image/jpeg"); header("Content-Length: " . filesize($file)); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"filename.jpg\""); header('Cache-Control: private'); header('Pragma: private'); $fp = fopen($file,"rb"); fpassthru($fp); fclose($fp); exit();
