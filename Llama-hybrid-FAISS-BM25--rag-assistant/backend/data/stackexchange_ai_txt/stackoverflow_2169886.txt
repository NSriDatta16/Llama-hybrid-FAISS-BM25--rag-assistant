I'm actually relatively new to SharePoint and I was very astounded initially that one had to create individual controls manually, without a GUI interface like any normal ASP.NET web development involves. However, I had a very very good tip that allowed me to still use a GUI interface, and use it to create webparts for Sharepoint. It involves wrapping WebUserControls in webparts. The link I used is here: http://www.a2zdotnet.com/View.aspx?id=95 You basically create WebUserControls (.ascx file) in a website, and so you can just add your controls like any normal .aspx page. You can also have a normal code-behind file (.ascx.cs). You then drag the .ascx file onto an .aspx file, so that it will then use your WebUserControl. When your .ascx files are ready and built, you copy them to the Layouts directory in the 12-Hive of your SharePoint Server. Best to create a sub-directory in there, to avoid clashing with other files in there already. You then need to create a separate class Library project, that will have your WebPart code on. You then tell your WebPart to use your .ascx files in the layouts directory. Something like this: protected override void CreateChildControls() { base.CreateChildControls(); try { this.Controls.Clear(); _myControl = this.Page.LoadControl("\\_layouts\\MyFolder\\WebUserControl.ascx"); this.Controls.Add(_myControl); } catch (Exception e) { err = e.Message; } The link I provided above provides more information, but basically you compile the webpart project and then add the DLL to the BIN directory of your sharepoint server (c:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\ etc). You don't have to compile it to the GAC , by the way. Then you add a entry to the web.config of your sharepoint server: If you didn't compile the DLL to the GAC, but the BIN instead, you just need: Again, the link I posted above has it written in the code, a reference to the GUID, which is only needed if you placed the DLL in the GAC. You don't need the GUID part of the code if you only placed in the BIN directory. Hope that helps. Ash
