"Dynamic factor analysis" might be your answer and is certainly worth reading up on. It aims to identify a small number of underlying (unobserved) factors behind the co-movement of a large number of observed time series. To implement as part of a broader modelling exercise you will probably be looking at R, Matlab, Stata or a specialist time series package like RATS. There are lots of potential pitfalls, however, including the possibility that in reducing the explanatory variables in your data to the underlying common "structure", you may be throwing away precisely that part of it which is related to your response variable of interest. However, the technique seems widely used, particularly in areas like econometrics that can try to combine it with a theoretical sense of what the structure underneath all those time series may be.
