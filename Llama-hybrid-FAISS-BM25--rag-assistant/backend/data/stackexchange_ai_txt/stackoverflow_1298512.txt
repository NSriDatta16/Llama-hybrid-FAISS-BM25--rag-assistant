TreeSet fragments memory and has additional memory overheads. You can look at the sources and calculate amount of additional memory and amount of additional objects it creates. Of course it depends on the nature of stored objects and you also can suspect me to be paranoiac about memory :) but it's better to not spend it here and there - you have GC, you have cache misses and all of these things are slooow. Often you can use PriorityQueue instead of TreeSet. And in your typical use case it's better just to sort the array of strings.
