How to predict non negative values of a target in xgboost?

I am using xgboost (in R) to predict a continuous non-negative target variable using standard root mean squared error as an evaluation metric (and loss function). However, as pointed out in this post , it is possible that a non-negative target sometimes receives negative predictions. Since I have many training values in the target that are close to zero, there are a few observations that have received a prediction below zero. So, is there any way to train my xgboost model so that predictions are >= 0? Maybe through different loss functions?
