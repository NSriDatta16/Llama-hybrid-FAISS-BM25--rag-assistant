Easy book to understanding basic concepts

I have a medium-strong background on programming and logic, however I'm trying to start using R, and other tools to make machine learning based studies of some problems. I did take probability and statistics at university, but it was a very poor taught one and never realized until now. I found two books on Amazon I liked: Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data The Complete Idiot's Guide to Statistics Both seem like good starting points, at least to quickly understand key concepts and then use different automatic tool techniques for my purposes, but has anyone read those? Which one is better? P.S. I would like to learn: distributions (normal, poisson, etc), descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis, $R^2$, probability, Bayes, Markov chains, and all related concepts.
