Number of Hidden Layers and what they can achieve: 0 - Only capable of representing linear separable functions or decisions. 1 - Can approximate any function that contains a continuous mapping from one finite space to another. 2 - Can represent an arbitrary decision boundary to arbitrary accuracy with rational activation functions and can approximate any smooth mapping to any accuracy. More than 2 - Additional layers can learn complex representations (sort of automatic feature engineering) for layer layers.
