It is particularly important for performance to not use select * when you have a join becaseu by definition at least two fields contain the same data. You do not want to waste network resources sending data you don't need fromthe database server to the application or web server. It may seem easier to use select * but it is a bad practice. Since it is easy to drag the column names into the query, just do that instead. Another issue that occurs when using select * is that there are idiots who choose to add new fields in the middle fo the table (always a bad practice), if you use select * as the basis for an insert then suddenly your column order may be wrong and you may try to insert the social security number into the honorarium (the amoutn of money a speaker may get paid to pick a non-random example) which could be a very bad thing for data integrity. Even if the select isn't an insert, it looks bad to the customer when the data is suddenly in the worng order on the report or web page. I think think of no circumstance when using select * is preferable to using a column list. You might think it is easier to maintain, but in truth it is not and will result in your application getting slower for no reason when fields you don't need are added to the tables. You will also have to face the problem of fixing things that would not have broken if you had used a column list, so the time you save not adding a column is used up doing this.
