Choosing kernel size of cnn for time series data with multiple seasonalities

I try to solve a standard time series forecasting problem using convolutional neural networks. The data has multiple seasonalities and so I wonder if a kernel size should reflect this fact e.g. for a 7-day seasonality one could use kernel size 7 in the first convolutional layer and so on but then what happens if there is both 7-day and 365-day seasonality? Questions: Is my intuition correct? Maybe it doesn't really matter and I should just optimize kernel size using standard hyperparameter optimization techniques. Is it better to just remove seasonalities using other techniques and only then apply CNN? If my intuition is correct I suppose you could model these situation by concatenating outputs from multiple CNNs - one with kernel size 7 and another one with kernel size 365. Has such architecture been tried? Does it work? Answers backed by papers are especially appreciated.
