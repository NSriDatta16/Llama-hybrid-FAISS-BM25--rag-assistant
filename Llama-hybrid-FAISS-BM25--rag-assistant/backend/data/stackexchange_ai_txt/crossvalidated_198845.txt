In this case the amount of neurons should be 5*5*3 . I found it especially useful for convolutional layers. Often a uniform distribution over the interval $[-c/(in+out), c/(in+out)]$ works as well. It is implemented as an option in almost all neural network libraries. Here you can find the source code of Keras's implementation of Xavier Glorot's initialization.
