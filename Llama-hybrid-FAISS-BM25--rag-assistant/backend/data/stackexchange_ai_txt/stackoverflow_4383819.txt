The EDMX files are made up of several parts, the CSDL portion describes the conceptual model (classes, properties, function imports etc). The SSDL portion describes the storage model (tables/views, columns, procedures, etc). The MSL portion describes the mapping between the CSDL and SSDL objects. There are also one optional section in the EDMX that describes the designer's diagram layout and that contain other settings related to the designer. The specification for the CSDL, SSDL, and MSL is available on MSDN at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399604.aspx Alternatively, I have a wrapper library that adds an object model around the EDMX that makes it easier to create, read, and update EDMX files: http://huagati.blogspot.com/2010/12/creating-or-modifying-entity-framework.html
