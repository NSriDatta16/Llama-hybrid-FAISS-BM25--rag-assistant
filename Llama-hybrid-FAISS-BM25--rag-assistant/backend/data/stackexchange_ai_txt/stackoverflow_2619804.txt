Flash: prevent the user from draging one thumb of a HSlider

I'm using Flash HSlider component. I used a slider with several thumbs. I'd like to prevent the user from draging just the middle thumb, but can drag other thumbs. I don't know how to do it. Could any one can give me some tips? Thanks. Yuan
