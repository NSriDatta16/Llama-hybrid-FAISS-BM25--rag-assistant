Smart approach to CSS3

do You have any elegant approach to benefit from CSS3 features, like border radius or gradients? I am looking for a solution that would avoid browser-specific CSS properties and browser-specific stylesheet files. I find them both hard to maintain and too verbose. It could be a Javascript library that would take care of cross-browser compatibilit. Thus, I could use only W3C CSS3 properties support (not browser-specific) and get rid of the library when browsers will start tu support CSS3 well. So far, I have found these resources that seem to fulfill at least some of my expectations: eCSStender - JS that is told to imitate the CSS3 features on different browsers (even IE6), I haven't tested yet, however ( read about eCSStender ) Mordernizr - JS that detects which CSS3 properties the browser supports ... I'll fiil it with your answers Or maybe you have other approach that lets You take advantage of CSS3 without very verbose code?
