Plotting Vector Embeddings

I am currently working on a project that requires some form of data on the paper. Even though I was able to get some coding done and communicate results, I need some graphs. What I want to do is graph the embeddings that Facenet outputs. But how can I do this? The embedding is just a 128 x 1 vector. I can find the L2 distance of two embeddings from each other but I want to plot the data. There isn't any X or Y coordinate that tells me where to put the "points" I was also thinking of using this thing called PCA but I don't know the theories behind that (yet)
