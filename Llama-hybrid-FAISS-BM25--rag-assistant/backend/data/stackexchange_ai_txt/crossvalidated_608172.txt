The definition of the hypoexponential distribution (HD) requires that: $$f(x)=\sum_i^d \left(\prod_{j=1,i\neq j}^{d}\frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_j-\lambda_i}\right)\lambda_i e^{(-\lambda_ix)},\quad x>0 $$ that expression is only a special case when $\lambda_i \neq \lambda_j$ . It is not a requirement for the hypoexponential distribution in general. The more general hypo-exponential distribution can be expressed as a phase-type distribution $$f(x) = -\boldsymbol{\alpha}e^{x \boldsymbol{\Theta}} \boldsymbol{\Theta} \mathbf{1} $$ With $$\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (1,0,0,\dots,0,0)$$ and $$\boldsymbol{\Theta} = \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda_1 & \lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -\lambda_2 & \lambda_2 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\ 0 & 0 & \ddots & -\lambda_{d-2} & \lambda_{d-2} & 0\\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -\lambda_{d-1} & \lambda_{d-1}\\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & -\lambda_{d}\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ That involves the exponentiation of a matrix . And that can be approximated with a sum using a Taylor series. You can see the matrix as modelling a sort of Markov chain process with non-discrete time steps. A sum of exponential distributed variables is like waiting for several consecutive transitions whose waiting time is each exponential distributed. Those transitions relate to the Markov chain. Not only when $\lambda_i \neq \lambda_j$ but also when $\lambda_i = \lambda_j$ then the formula can give problems as demonstrated in this question: Why my cdf of the convolution of n exponential distribution is not in the range(0,1)?
