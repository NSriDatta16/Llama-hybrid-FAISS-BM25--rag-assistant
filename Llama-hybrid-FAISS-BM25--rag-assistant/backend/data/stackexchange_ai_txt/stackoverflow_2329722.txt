nm: "U" The symbol is undefined

When I nm on one of my libs: nm libmylib.so I get a line like this U _ZNSs4_Rep20_S_empty_rep_storageE@@GLIBCXX_3.4 I checked the man page for nm and I got "U" The symbol is undefined. What does an undefined symbol really mean? If it is really undefined, then why does nm report it at all?
