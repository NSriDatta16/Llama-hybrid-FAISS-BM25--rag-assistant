First, you probably don't have to do so much forking and house keeping yourself: http://linux.die.net/man/3/daemon Next, remember that your daemon's interface to the world is probably through some sort of shell script that you also write located in /etc/init.d or whatever other distro-defined place. So for the above answer, your shell script would send those signals to the pid of the process. There probably is a better way though. Signaling like above is a one way process, your controlling script has to jump through race-condition-prone and fragile hoops in order to confirm if the daemon successfully stopped or restarted. I would look for precedence and examples in /etc/init.d.
