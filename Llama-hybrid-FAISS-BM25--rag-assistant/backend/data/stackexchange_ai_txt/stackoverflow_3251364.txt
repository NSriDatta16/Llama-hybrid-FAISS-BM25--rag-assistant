You can grow a cell array which is much cheaper than an array then use cell2mat to convert to array (requires having twice the memory but if you have it can be the easiest way). If you know the number of pixels you can preallocate a cell array of the right size, fill each cell with the array of actual values (up to 640 but usually 2-5) then use cell2mat to get convert it to a contigous array. If you are worried about fragmentation you can do pack after loading the cell which should defragment your memory (rights everything to disk and loads it again contiguously) before you do the cell2mat conversion.
