Paperclip - undefined method 'icon_file_name'

I've just installed the Paperclip and trying to attach an icon to my model. has_attached_file :icon, :styles => { :normal => "100x100>", :format => 'png' }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :url => "/icon/:slug.:extension" :path => "icon/:slug.:extension" s3.yml contains my bucket name and two keys. slug interpolation is defined in the config/initializers/paperclip.rb as Paperclip.interpolates('slug') do |attachment, style| attachment.instance.cached_slug end When I call game.icon.url, I get this error: undefined method `icon_file_name' for # What am I doing wrong? I'm running rails 3.0.4 and ruby 1.9.2 on Windows 7 x64, if it makes any difference.
