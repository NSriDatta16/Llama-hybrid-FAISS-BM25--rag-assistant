Alter Type: add attribute if it doesn't already exist

Is there a way to alter an object type to add an attribute only if it doesn't already exist? I am writing a script that will be run on multiple databases. I'm trying to avoid unnecessary PLS-00410 errors (duplicate fields in RECORD,TABLE or argument list are not permitted). Something like the following: ALTER TYPE employee ADD ATTRIBUTE --IF NOT EXISTS (address2 VARCHAR2(30)) CASCADE; If there is no elegant inline solution like the above, is there a system table I can look at? ALL_TYPES only lists the number of attributes per type, not the specific attributes.
