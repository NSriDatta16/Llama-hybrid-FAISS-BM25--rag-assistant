The css2 spec has some information about how a user agent “should” compute width, but reality is not the spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins . I definitely recommend going with a strict DOCTYPE instead of a transitional one, http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html#DTD . Without specifying a margin for your .outer div, the user agent will determine the width using width: auto , which looks like it varies depending on the user agent. Why do you not want to specify a width for the parent div? If you can, specify a width for the parent div, even if it's width: 100% . You may want to also place * { margin: 0; padding: 0; } in the stylesheet to avoid user agent differences in those attributes, especially if you specify width as 100% for .outer. This may be trivial, but you should be able to shorten the statement .outer .floater to just .floater. If you need the “shrink-to-fit” effect around the inner floater and need to maintain float-right, then add direction: rtl; to the .floater class; otherwise you should be able to use float-left;
