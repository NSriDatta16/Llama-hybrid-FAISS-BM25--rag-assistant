You should look at the lower plot in the left column, titled Plot of residuals vs. fitted values . Does it show some tendency for the residuals do be more spread out with increasing fitted values? I do not think so, so no indication of non-constant variance. The qq-plot is close to linear, except the steep gradient at the lower left (corresponding to a hump in the corresponding histogram.) That indicates some lower bound on the residuals, which is maybe natural, since there is a lower bound (zero) on the observations, distances. The leverages seems close to constant, which is good. So nothing in particular to worry about.
