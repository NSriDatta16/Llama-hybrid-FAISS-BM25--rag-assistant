Please explain how google analytics would interpret IP addresses for a internal IP address range

A: represents my companies network IP address range (10.90.10.0-255) INTERNAL IP addresses B: represents the larger organization that provides our network services (Not our ISP however) C: Represents our website that has google analytics installed. When I access the site will google analytics record the 10.90... IP address? Or will it only know of the external IP address that B pipes all traffic out thru? 234.255.255.000? I really may not understand some basic concepts, but according to google this is possible. https://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55481&hl=en_US&utm_id=ad But I agree with this forum. If it is not routable google will never know about it. http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Analytics/thread?tid=79087fbe4c6ade7b&hl=en
