Is there a test/technique/method for comparing principal components decompositions between samples?

Is there any methodical way to compare the directions, magnitudes, etc of PCA results for different samples drawn from the same population? I'm leaving the nature of the test deliberately vague because I'd like to hear all the various possibilities... e.g. there might be (and I'm speculating here) a test comparing the sizes of the first principal components, or a test comparing the directions of the principal components, or there's some kind of distance measure between PCA outcomes and a test statistic for their equality. As far as a use case goes, I don't have on in mind. Just out of curiosity, maybe as an exploratory technique.
