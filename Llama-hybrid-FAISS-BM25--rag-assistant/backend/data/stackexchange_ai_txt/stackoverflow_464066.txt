If you're certain that you will never have another client application, you may get away with treating the database as a simple storage. However, if you'll ever have more than one client application obviously you will have to replicate constraints in all client applications, which is a bad idea. Remember that other clients include developer tools. Also, by using the database as a "dumb repository", you will most likely end up with a less efficient application. The database can do a lot of stuff much more efficiently than your application can. Why not take advantage of that?
