When should I use machine learning? Machine learning should only be used if there is no reasonable other way: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) : We can't manually design how we recognize language by rules. It is too complex, often fuzzy and a lot depends on context. The same is true for various Computer Vision (CV) tasks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Let it be automatic summarization, translation or sentiment analysis. Additionally to the problems in ASR and CV it has a lot of special cases. While we might be able to recognize those if phrased correctly, it is in many cases absolutely hopeless to write them all down and keep them up to date. What is the perceptron good for? It's good for learning how multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) work. I'm not sure if there is any real use case where you would want to apply a perceptron. Decision stumps (if-statements) are extremely simple, just like perceptrons. If such a simple model is enough, you could probably also just set it by hand. (Please let me know in the comments if you know an example where a single perceptron / decision stump with the associated learning method provides value compared to an ad-hoc decision method)
