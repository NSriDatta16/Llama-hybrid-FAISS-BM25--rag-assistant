I am unfamiliar with any definition of the MAPE that includes the degrees of freedom (which would be hard, since the MAPE is often used to assess time series model forecasts, where the notion of "degree of freedom" is not entirely clear). Are you asking about in-sample or out-of sample accuracy, both for mse and mape ? High-degree polynomials are almost certain to overfit, yielding spuriously good in-sample fitting accuracy but catastrophic out-of-sample accuracy. Here are a few examples with toy data and zero-th to third degree polynomials - I shudder to think of what an eighth degree polynomial would do here: If you truly want to model nonlinearities, consider splines. Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies has a very helpful overview.
