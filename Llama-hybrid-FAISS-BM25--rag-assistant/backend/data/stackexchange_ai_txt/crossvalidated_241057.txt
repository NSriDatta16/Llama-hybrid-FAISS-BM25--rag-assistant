Despite your question asking for a single measure that summarizes agreement across all variables, I would recommend against this. You should use a generalized measure of agreement that accommodates multiple categories and different weights (in case your categories are ordered) and apply this to each variable separately. I would recommend the generalized kappa, pi, or S coefficients ( link to more information ). You could then average these scores across all variables to get a single number, but isn't it more useful to know how well the raters did for each variable? Suppose your raters had high agreement for one variable and low agreement for another. It would then appear that they did moderately on average. But this isn't exactly right. The data for one variable will be very reliable while the data for the other will be less so. This is important information.
