PHP - Show results, conditional based on link

Looking for some help with the code below. I think there may be an issue with the way I've organized the php call and function calls. I'm a beginner and am trying to allow users to display results from different tables, depending on what link they click. I get this error: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '{' in /home/content/c/e/l/celebrything/html/wp-content/themes/celebrything/sidebar.php on line 16 Any help in correcting the issue here would be amazing. Here's the code: Most Popular Celebrities in last 24 hours Today Week Month get_results('SELECT name, count FROM wp_celebcount_' . $table); foreach($result as $row) { echo ' name) . '&search=Search">' . $row->name . ' - ' . $row->count . ' Posts '; } } ?> showTable($_GET['table']); UPDATED CODE ---------------- Most Popular Celebrities in last 24 hours Today Week Month get_results('SELECT name, count FROM wp_celebcount_' . $table); foreach($result as $row) { echo ' name) .
