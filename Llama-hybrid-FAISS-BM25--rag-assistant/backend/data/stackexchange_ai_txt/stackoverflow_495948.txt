I keep everything in one file and only provide different files for alternative styles (e.g. for printing). Within that file I keep the overall layout (columns, headeer & footer) seperate from the actual contents (paragraphs, headings, lists...) I am used to thinking object oriented, so I group the styles for different objects (menus, blog posts) together. From that perspective, colour and position both belong to the same object and therefore are kept together. I am wishing for the ability to define colours once in a style sheet, assign them a declarative name (e.g. 'HeadingColour') and then use the name when assigning the colour to a selector...
