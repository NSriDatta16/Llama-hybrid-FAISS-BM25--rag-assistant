Random forest classifier is predicting only one class even when the dataset is not imbalanced

This is a binary classification task, I have 15K 1's and 11K 0's (target) I have tried the following: X = feature_cols y = department_wise[['Threshold']] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2, random_state=1) model = RandomForestClassifier() model.fit(X, y) predicted_labels = model.predict(X_test) X_test predicts only 0 and the accuracy comes around 88%. I don't understand why since my data set is not even imbalanced. Whatever other classifier I am trying, it shows the same result with high accuracy. Please let me know where I am going wrong.
