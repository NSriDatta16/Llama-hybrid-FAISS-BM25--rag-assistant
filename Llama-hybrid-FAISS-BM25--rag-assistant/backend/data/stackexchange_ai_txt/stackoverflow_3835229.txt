Use :hide to get rid of all windows unless you really need them open. I'm not sure why tags are creating a new window for you, CTRL+] should re-use the current window. nnoremap + 4 + and nnoremap - 4 - make it much easier to resize windows, along with the standard _ and | . Get a 22" monitor (minimum) and use :vsplit to show files side by side. I find this is even more important than having two smaller monitors. Use L , H etc to move windows around. Don't forget :tab sp to open the current file (or a new one) in a new tab. :map h and :map l , etc make it much easier to move between windows. :map :tabprev and :map :tabnext make it much easier to move between tabs. And finally, if you need to have 20 files open regularly, this could be a sign that your code is poorly organized. If possible, features should be contained within a single file, then you just need to focus work on one feature at a time.
