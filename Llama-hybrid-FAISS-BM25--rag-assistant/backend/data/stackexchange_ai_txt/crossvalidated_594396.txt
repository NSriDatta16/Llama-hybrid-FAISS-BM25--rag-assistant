Build a logistic regression model based on the result from another model

I have a logistic regression model A. I want to build a new model, B, that is based on model A, but with one or more new features. This features are of a diffrent kind and needs to be trained on a dataset with another time horizon, monthly instead of annual. In order to do this, is it posible to use the probabilities that model A has returned as input features in model B? Does that make sense? Hope the question is clear enough. This idea is a bit confusing to me.
