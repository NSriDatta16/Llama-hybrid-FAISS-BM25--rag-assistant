If the month-to-month variation is known not to be significant then, for each salesman, compute the average monthly sales and let that be the record for the salesman. If there is some kind of seasonal effect this would not be a good approach as you would really prefer to have January's average sales February's etc. In fact, you can look for seasonality by computing for each month the average across salespersons.
