Looking through some old notes on structural breaks, I have these two cites: Enders, "Applied Econometric Time Series", 2nd edition, ch. 5. Enders discusses interventions, pulse functions, gradual change functions, transfer functions, etc. This article may also be helpful: Box, G.E.P. and G. C. Tiao. 1975. “Intervention Analysis with Applications to Economic and Environmental Problems.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 70: 70-79.
