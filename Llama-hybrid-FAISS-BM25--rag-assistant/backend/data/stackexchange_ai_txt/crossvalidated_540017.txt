IMO you can find equally hard-to-answer philosophical questions like this about the foundations of any branch of maths, not just Bayesian statistics: what does it really mean, deep down, to say that 1+1=2? Not sure I could answer that satisfactorily, but I still confidently use arithmetic. But my interpretation is: we don't need to think of $\theta$ as a long-run probability. It's the number with the property that if my utility function is linear, then I should be indifferent to the opportunity to pay $\theta$ for a contract which pays out $1$ if the next flip of the coin is heads and 0 if it is tails.
