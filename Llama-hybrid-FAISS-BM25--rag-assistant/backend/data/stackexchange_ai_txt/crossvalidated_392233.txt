The problem you are referring to can be seen as a particular case of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). An excellent review of the topic can be found in [1]. Here is a quote concerning your problem : « Sparse functional data arise in longitudinal studies where subjects are measured at different time points... » This suggest that you may find some answers by looking for Sparse Functional Data in the litterature. Using RNNs is a natural choice for time series analysis. The LSTMs may offer better performance compared to other RNNs when dealing with anytime events as it seeks to maintain an hidden state, which will also help coping with sparsity of the events. LSTMs also have the advantage that you can directly use the data without any aggregation. Temporal Convolution Networks are a good alternative if you are willing to accept a certain degree of aggregation. [1] Wang, J. L., Chiou, J. M., & Müller, H. G. (2016). Functional data analysis. Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 3, 257-295.
