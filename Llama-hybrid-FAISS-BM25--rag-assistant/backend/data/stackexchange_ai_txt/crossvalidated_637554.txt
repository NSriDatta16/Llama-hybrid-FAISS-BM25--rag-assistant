Dependent variables are count variable with an upper bound

I need to test some hypotheses for a social sciences dissertation. In my description below, I refer to the independent as the Xs and the dependent variables as the Ys. I am expecting a straight linear relationship between the Xs and Ys, like Y = mX + C. The Xs are a "continuous" variable that will be the average of four questions from a 5-point Likert scale. The Ys are both Count variables that can take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I am assuming that as that as that as my Ys are count variables, I will need to use something like a Poisson model or a Zero-Inflated Poisson model. However, as my the Ys have an upper bound, would that complicate matters?
