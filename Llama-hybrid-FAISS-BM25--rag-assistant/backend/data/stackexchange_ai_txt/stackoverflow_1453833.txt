How to run ShellExecute on shell object clsid?

Shell explorer on Windows define global objects such as ::{2559a1f4-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0 which is a link to the user "internet browser". I got these value from a shortcut that is drag&dropped over my application, but I can't find how to use it to open it... I'd like to get information about what this object is too. Does someone know how to ask Windows about what this object is ? Does someone know how to open it ? I have found that these objects can be found by reading from the registry at : initString = HLCR\CLSID\\{CLSID\}\PersistentBag\InitString openCommand = HKLM\Software\Clients\{initString}\shell\open\command Usually its not a good idea to read directly from the registry. I'd be please to have a cleaner way to read these values. Thanks.
