Your data set is similar to the thousands of hourly series that we have seen. Hourly predictions can often rely on previous hourly values (your ARIMA) but also on day-of-the-week effects , month(week)-of-the-year effects , holiday effects (both on and before/after the event) , Fridays before a holiday , Mondays after a holiday, specific days of the month , level shifts, local time trends , changes in parameters/error variance over time. All of this has to be done in a robust manner where unusual observations are identified and their effect nullified. I suggest that you address your problem with adequate methodology and useful software AND perhaps the advice of a trained time series statistician. Pursue robust Transfer Function identification also known as Dynamic Regression.
