Silverlight in Safari and Firefox by default?

I'm curious, how does Microsoft plan to embed Silverlight into Safari and Firefox. Because if it doesn't come shipped with Safari and Firefox by default, why should anyone use it? They are counting on that the average user is installing it when he/she sees: "Silverlight need to be installed"? Maybe they won't install and just leave the page. Isn't that bad for business that chooses Silverlight?
