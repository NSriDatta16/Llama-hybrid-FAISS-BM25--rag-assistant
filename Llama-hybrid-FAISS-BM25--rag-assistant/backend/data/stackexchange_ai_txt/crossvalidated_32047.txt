In my experience, the mean of rating-scale data is often the most closely correlated with the level of real-world metrics we try to associate with the rating scale. We have found a lot of linear relationships, and the average is therefore one of the better ways to summarize the data. That being said, as Jeromy pointed out, most ways of analyzing the central tendency of a rating scale will give similar results (rank orders, etc) most of the time. Also, I suspect Amazon is probably not all that concerned with the scientific validity one way or the other. Amazon's goal, in the end, is to get people to shop more on Amazon.com, and the way reviews help achieve that will probably not vary with whatever one-number summary is used. Good products will be rewarded, really bad products punished, and nervous purchasers will have a chance to review pros and cons in more detail.
