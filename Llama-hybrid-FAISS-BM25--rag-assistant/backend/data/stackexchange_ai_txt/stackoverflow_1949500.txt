Is it possible to automate Siebel testing behind the GUI?

My test team currently uses QTP to test through the GUI, but like any automated test suite that relies on the interface, it is more fragile than automating tests that directly interact with the code. I am attempting to learn more about Siebel and Siebel Tools to better understand how we might be able to test below the GUI, but would like to hear from someone with more expertise to find out if this is feasible.
