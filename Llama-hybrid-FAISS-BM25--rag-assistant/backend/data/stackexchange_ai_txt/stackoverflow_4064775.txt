Need a resource for pairing cities to coordinates

I have a list of cities (and some other locations) around the world, formatted like this: America/Antigua America/Anguilla Europe/Tirane Asia/Yerevan America/Curacao Africa/Luanda Antarctica/McMurdo And I need to get their corresponding coordinates formatted like this: Europe/Stockholm 59.21N 18.04W Since I have a rather large list (around 1k posts) I would like to be able to automate the retrieval of these coordinates. Does there exist a free resource (preferably downloadable, not search-only) from which it's easy to extract this data? The alternatives I can think of at the moment are google maps (which would require an api key, if I understand it correctly), or Wikipedia (which doesn't have that data easily available, and is not optimized for that kind of searches). And both of these are online-only, which is sub-optimal for me.
