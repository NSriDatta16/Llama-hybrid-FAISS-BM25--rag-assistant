char keyValue[strlen(key)]; is wrong since you use strcpy, you have to account for the nul terminator. make it char keyValue[strlen(key) + 1]; . This is likely what's causing your issue in the last printf. *(storageUnit->buckets) = &data; might be wrong too. data and keyValue are both allocated on the stack. When your Function returns, these objects are no longer valid, so storing that pointer in storageUnit->buckets[0] is useless. You should probably allocate the element and the key dynamically with e.g. malloc().
