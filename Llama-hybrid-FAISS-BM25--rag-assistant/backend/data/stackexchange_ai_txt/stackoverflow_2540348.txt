hundreds of databases sql server log shipping

SQL Server 2005 Standard 64x, with 300+ tiny databases currently (5MB each), user base adds databases as needed. Want to implement log shipping for warm standby, but not via the wizard, since that looks like it adds 3 jobs (1 on primary, 2 on secondary) for each log-shipped database. Do I try to write my own or use something like Quest's LiteSpeed? Or am I being too squeamish about having hundreds of SQL Server Agent jobs and all of them firing off (or worse, would I have to try to time them)? All advice welcome.
