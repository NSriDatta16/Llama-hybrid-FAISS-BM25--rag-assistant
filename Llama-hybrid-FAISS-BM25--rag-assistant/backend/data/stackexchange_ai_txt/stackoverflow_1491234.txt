How can I stop inline C# from adding a space to a element on a View in MVC ASP.Net

I have a code chunck below that is being output with a space in the element when it's formated as shown and the condition is false. If I put it on one line it generates the required output. What I'm after is a more elegant solution. Any ideas? Code Formated: Output: Required Output: or Thanks, Denis
