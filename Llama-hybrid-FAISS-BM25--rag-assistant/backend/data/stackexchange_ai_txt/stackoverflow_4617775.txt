How do I access SourceGear Web services using SOAP::Lite?

For some reason SourceGear provide an undocumented Web service on their installations. They actually ask developers to use the API instead because the Web service is kinda messy, but this is a problem in my case because I cannot use this API on a Perl environment, so their solution for my specific case is to use the Web service. This shouldn't be a problem. Using SOAP::Lite I have connected to several Web services in the past in the same way. But the lack of documentation is a major chaos if you don't know where the SOAP calls can be made. I only have an XML to decipher where to and how to make these calls. It would be great if a real SOAP genius could help me out in this. This is an example of the login call and the expected response: Request POST /fortress/dragnetwebservice.asmx HTTP/1.1 Host: velecloudserver Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: length SOAPAction: "http://www.sourcegear.com/schemas/dragnet/LoginPlainText" string string Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: length int string I'm looking for a way to be able to assemble this somehow. This is my Perl example: my $soap = SOAP::Lite -> uri ('http://velecloudserver/fortress/dragnetwebservice.asmx') -> proxy('http://velecloudserver/fortress/dragnetwebservice.asmx/LoginPlainText'); my $som = $soap->call('LoginPlainText', SOAP::Data->name('LoginPlainText')->value( \SOAP::Data->value([ SOAP::Data->name('strLogin')->value( 'admin' ), SOAP::Data->name('strPassword')->value('Adm1234'), ])) ); Any tip would be appreciated.
