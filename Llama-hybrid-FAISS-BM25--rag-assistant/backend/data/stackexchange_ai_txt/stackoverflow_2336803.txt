Deleting rows from a table cause index fragmentation?

I removed some rows from a very large table. Then I ran a query that usually runs within a few seconds and found it to be running very slowly after deleting the rows. I re-built my index and ran my query and found it to be fast again. Could deleting those rows caused the index to be fragmented?
