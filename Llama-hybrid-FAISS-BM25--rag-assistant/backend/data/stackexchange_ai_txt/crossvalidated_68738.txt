How to forecast time series from clusters?

I have a set of 1200 time series for which I need to build a forecasting model. Since it is too time consuming to build a model for each series, I separated the series into clusters and what I want to do now is to build a forecasting model for each cluster (using time series techniques). However, I don't know which is the best way to build that model for each cluster. Should I extract a series prototype and build the model on it? How do I do this? In a paper by E. Maharaj (1999) (Forecasting Time Series From Clusters) the author forecasts time series from clusters by "pooling" the series together, but I can't understand how this pooling is done.
