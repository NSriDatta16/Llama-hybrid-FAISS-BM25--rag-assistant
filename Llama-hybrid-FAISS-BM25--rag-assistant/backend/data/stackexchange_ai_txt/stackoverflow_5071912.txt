Deallocation while key value observers still registered (reverse geocoder)

When my view goes away I get the following message: An instance 0x1c11e0 of class MKAnnotationView was deallocated while key value observers were still registered with it. Observation info was leaked, and may even become mistakenly attached to some other object. Set a breakpoint on NSKVODeallocateBreak to stop here in the debugger. Here's the current observation info: ( Context: 0x0, Property: 0x1e98d0> ) The code that defines and starts the reverse geocoding is: geo=[[MKReverseGeocoder alloc] initWithCoordinate:droppedAt]; geo.delegate=self; [geo start]; I have tried setting geo.delegate to nil right before the I dismiss the view. That would be too easy. I have also tried: for (id annotation in mvMap.annotations) { [[mvMap viewForAnnotation:annotation] removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"selected"]; } Which throws an error that says: * Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: 'Cannot remove an observer for the key path "selected" from because it is not registered as an observer. My view for annotation code is: -(MKAnnotationView *) mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id )annotation { MKAnnotationView *aView; aView=(MKAnnotationView *) [mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:annotation.title]; if (aView==nil) aView=[[[MKAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:annotation.title] autorelease]; else aView.annotation=annotation; [aView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:selIcon]]; aView.canShowCallout=TRUE; aView.draggable=YES; return aView; } I'm sort of pushing buttons and flipping switches here while spinning in. Any idea of what I can do here?
