It's because you're doing multiclass classification, and xgboost does that by building parallel models for each class. So the total number of trees is actually $512\cdot (\text{# classes})$ . I don't know what order those trees come in. plot_tree calls to_graphviz which calls (after maybe model.get_booster ) model.get_dump , which calls some c-level stuff I won't try to track down.
