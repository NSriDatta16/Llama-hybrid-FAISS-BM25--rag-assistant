Can you use linear regression to predict individual player performance from team performance?

Imagine you have performance scores for each player on a soccer team using some sort of ranking system. You then group these player scores into the teams they play for, then average the player scores to calculate a "team performance" score (assuming here that better players mean a better team). If you plot the individual performance on one axis and team performance on the other axis, a linear relationship is observed, and the data passes other assumptions of linear regression. Is linear regression an appropriate modelling approach to use here, to predict individual performance from team performance? I saw this approach in a paper (page 7) and was interested in this seemingly "circular" connection of the variables, how the dependent variable is so directly linked to the the independent variable. Is there a name for this type of approach?
