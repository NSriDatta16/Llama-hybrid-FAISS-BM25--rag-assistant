It's not clear what question(s) you hope to answer with additional analyses.. The omnibus chi-square (with all the rows and columns in one table) will tell you if the proportions of lesions you observe are unrelated (or related) to decade category. You could use logistic regression to predict the presence/absence of lesion as an outcome with the decade variable as a predictor. It answers a slightly different question: 'what are the log odds of being in the lesion group for each additional decade.' Which question are you asking?
