Can ordinal, ranked variables be used for PCA?

I have a data set of some 40+ individuals and 10 variables. Each individual is asked to rank these 10 variables from least preferred (1) to most preferred (10). Is it sensible to apply principle component analysis on this type of data? I know it is applicable when it would have been on something like a Likert scale, but here every individual / row / tuple would exactly contain every 1-10 value once.
