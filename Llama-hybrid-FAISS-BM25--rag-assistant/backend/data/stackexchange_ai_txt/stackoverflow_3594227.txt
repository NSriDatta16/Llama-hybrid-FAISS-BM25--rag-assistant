In Android 2.2 and previous, there is only one "external storage" ( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() ). The definition of where this points is up to the device manufacturer. The Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) merely mandates that it be at least 2GB, IIRC. It is not even required for "external storage" to be removable. At this time, there are no standard APIs to get to other partitions or cards. A device manufacturer might document how to access these -- you would have to see if they have anything on their respective developer sites. Bear in mind that on some of these devices, other partitions or cards may not be readable or writable from regular SDK applications.
