I have no solution to your problem, but you might find one on the jpcap discussion board on Google Groups. Scanning through the messages (keywords "jvm crash") I noted one saying that the problem turned out to be calling a method with the wrong parameters. So you might try double-checking that your code is using the API correctly. I would not report this to Sun / Oracle. The evidence in the crash dump points to an error in the way that something is using JNI.
