Joel, would it not be possible to leverage the element of the configuration file of your applications? AFAIK, it handles UNC shares, and if you're already putting new assembly versions in named folders, it seems like the appropriate config files could be updated with a new element when a new version is rolled out, maybe through the use of a subversion hook script. One hitch would be if you made an update without changing the version number, since the machines would have already downloaded a copy and would likely be unaware of the change.
