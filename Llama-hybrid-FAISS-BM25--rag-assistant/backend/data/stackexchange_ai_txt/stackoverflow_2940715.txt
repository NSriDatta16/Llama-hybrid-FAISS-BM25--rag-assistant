If the sensor data in each individual node is generally sufficient to make a reasonable decision, they could just communicate the result and take a majority vote. If majority vote is not appropriate, you could train an additional classifier that uses the outputs of the nodes as its feature vector. Since you want to have on-line supervised learning with feedback, you could use a neural network with backpropagation or an incremental support vector machine that adds the errors to the training set. Look into classifier biasing to deal with false-positive/false-negative trade-off.
