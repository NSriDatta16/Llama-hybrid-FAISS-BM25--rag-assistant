Specifying a multilevel model in MCMCglmm (R), that is heteroskedastic at level one

I am considering MCMCglmm as an alternative to MLwiN. The former package works perfectly fine, but I cannot figure out how to model heteroskedasticity at level one. For instance, if I have the following model, individuals within countries Fixed: y = 1 + x1 + x2 Random Level 2: 1 + x1 (country level) Random Level 1: 1 + x1 (individual level) For level 2 I can specify the option random=~country+x1 , how do I specify the level one portion? My guess would be that this has something to do with the rcov option, but specifying the formula as rcov=~indiv.id+x1 doesn't work. Or am I entirely wrong and these type of models are just not fitted in MCMCglmm? Thanks for any tips. EDIT: to provide a clearer idea of what the model is, here is how the model looks in MLwiN . At the top there are fixed effects, at the bottom you have two variance matrices: Ou is variance on the country level, and Oe is variance on the individual level. Ou is easily modeled in MCMCglmm, using the random option. I cannot get MCMCglmm to estimate the Oe.
