I interpret the probability that the question does not refer to the very first days after the observations started, but rather to the "long run". Use a Markov chain model $\newcommand{\bpi}{\boldsymbol\pi}$ Since we assume that the weather of today does not depend on yesterday, and even morning and evening are independent, you can model the number of umbrellas at home (or at work) by a Markov chain . Let $X_t$ be the number of umbrellas at home on the morning of day $t$ . It is a random variable that only can take values $0,1,\dots,n$ . As for all Markov chains, the joint distribution of $(X_1,X_2,\dots)$ is specified by the transition probabilities , $$ p_{ij} = P(X_{t+1}=j\mid X_t = i),\quad i, j \in\{0,\dots,n\}. $$ These transition probabilities do not depend on the current time $t$ . However, distribution of $X_t$ will depend on the start value $x_1$ , the initial number of umbrellas at home, through all the intermediate steps: $$ \begin{aligned} P(X_t=k) &= \sum_{j=0}^{n} p_{jk}P(X_{t-1}=j) \\&=\sum_{j=0}^{n} p_{jk}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n} p_{ij}P(X_{t-2}=i)\right) \\&=\dots \end{aligned} $$ On the long run, the Markov chain approaches a stationary distribution When days go by, with increasing $t$ , the distribution of the $X_t$ becomes less and less dependent on $x_1$ , and converges to the distribution of a random variable $X$ , $X_t \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{\text{D}} X$ . We denote by $\bpi_k$ the probability that on the long run, there are $k$ umbrellas at home in the morning, $\bpi_k=P(X=k)$ . The distribution $\bpi$ is called stationary distribution of the chain. When the Markov chain has (approximately) reached equilibrium, we can assume that $P(X_{t+1}=k) = P(X_{t}=k) = \bpi_k$ . Then $$ \begin{equation} \bpi_k = P(X_{t+1}=k) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} p_{jk}\bpi_j,\quad k=0,\dots, n. \end{equation} $$ For the umbrellas, the most of the elements in the sum vanish, because the number of umbrellas at home can only change by $\pm 1$ during one day. Note that not all Markov chains automatically have a stationary distribution. Some condtions have to be fulfilled, but we are on the safe side with the umbrella chain. How can we use all this to find the probability to get wet? The only quantity we need to find is the probability to have to leave the home without an umbrella, that is, there is no umbrella in the house. This is the same idea as you suggested in your question. On the long run, the probability of having no umbrella in the morning of an average day is $$ P(X = 0) = \pi_0. $$ To find this probability, we need to solve the system of equations given by (1). But before we can solve it, we have to specify the transition probabilities $p_{jk}$ . Transition probabilities for the umbrellas, and stationary distribution We have only three possible transitions, depending on the weather at day $n$ : a) no change, $X_t=k \to X_{t+1}=k$ . For $0 , this is possible on days where there either is no rain, or when it rains both in the morning and in the evening. The probability for this change is $$p_{kk} = (1-p)^2 + p^2 = 1 - 2p(1-p).$$ For $k=0$ , this is possible when it does not rain in the evening, thus $$p_{00} = (1-p).$$ For $k=n$ , all umbrellas are at home. There will be no change in umbrella number unless it rains in the morning, but not in the evening: $$p_{n\,n} = 1-p(1-p).$$ b) increase by 1, $X_t=k \to X_{t+1}=k+1$ . This requires to leave the home without umbrella, and to return with one that had been at the office because of evening rain. It is not possible when already all umbrellas are at home. if $k = 0$ , it only needs to rain in the evening: $$ p_{0\,1} = p.$$ for $0 , $$p_{k\, k+1}=(1-p)\cdot p.$$ c) decrease by 1, $X_t=k \to X_{t+1}=k-1$ . This occurs when it rains in the morning, but not in the evening, and requires at least one umbrella at home. Thus, for $k>0$ , $$p_{k\, k-1}=p\cdot(1-p).$$ All other transitions never occur, and from (1), we have $$ \bpi_k = p_{k-1\,k} \bpi_{k-1} + p_{k\,k} \bpi_{k} + p_{k-1\,k} \bpi_{k+1} $$ (as far as the individual transition probabilities are defined for $k$ ) More precisely, with the abbreviation $a=p(1-p)$ , the stationary distribution of the chain fulfils $$ \begin{align} (2)&&\bpi_{0} &= (1-p)\bpi_{0} + a\bpi_{1},\\ (3)&&\bpi_{1} &= p\bpi_{0} + (1-2a)\bpi_{1}+ a\bpi_{2}, \\&&&\vdots\notag\\ (4)&&\bpi_{k} &= a\bpi_{k-1} + (1-2a)\bpi_{k}+ a\bpi_{k+1}, \qquad k=2,3,..,n-1 \\&&&\vdots\notag\\ (5)&&\bpi_{n} &= a\bpi_{n-1} + (1-a)\bpi_{n}, \end{align} $$ Now we have $n+1$ equations that can be solved for $\bpi_0,\dots\bpi_{n}$ . From equation (2) we find $\bpi_0 = (1-p)\bpi_1$ . Plugging this in to (3), we get $\bpi_1=\bpi_2$ . Then from (4), with $k=2$ , we get $\bpi_3=\bpi_2$ . Now we have $\bpi_1=\bpi_2=\bpi_3$ , which in (3) recursively gives $\bpi_1=\dots=\bpi_{n-1}$ . Finally, (5) gives us $\bpi_{n}=\bpi_{n-1}$ . Taking into account that the probabilities $\bpi_0\dots\bpi_{n}$ have to sum to 1, w find $$ \bpi_0=\frac{1-p}{n+1-p},\quad\bpi_k =\frac{1}{n+1-p}=\frac{1}{1-p}\bpi_0, \ \ k>0. $$ This is an (imho) quite counterintuitive result - I would have expected that all possible numbers of umbrellas are equally likely, or perhaps, that numbers around $n$ are more likely than having no umbrellas at either home or office. The event that the individual gets wet in the morning has thus probability $p\bpi_0$ . By symmetry, the same probability applies for getting wet in the evening. The overall result is $$ P(\text{wet}) = \frac{2 p(1-p)}{n + 1 - p}. $$ As one would hope, this probability decreases with $n$ . Checking by simulation The following R code simulates the chain and estimate the fraction of wet trips: simwet
