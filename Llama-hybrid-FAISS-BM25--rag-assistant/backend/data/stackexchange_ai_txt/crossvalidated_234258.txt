Quantile regression would be one, robust approach. There are any number of transformations that would make your dependent variable and the associated residuals more tractable. These include Lambert's W, the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation and the Box-Cox. The problems with all of these transformations, when applied to the DV, is, 1) challenges with transforming the values of any predictions back into the original metric (if that's needed) and, 2) even if you can get the predictions back into some semblance of the original metric, there is still likely to be substantial retransformation bias.
