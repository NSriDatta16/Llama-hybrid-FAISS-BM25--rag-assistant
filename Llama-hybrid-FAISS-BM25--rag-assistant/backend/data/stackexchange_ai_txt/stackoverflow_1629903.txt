In terms of capabilities the two are more or less identical - there are some differences but those are not too significant in the general case. In terms of deploying apps to users they're the same - the capabilities are in the framework not the languages. Consequently there are two ways to look at this: 1) use C# because the syntax is familiar and you won't tie yourself in knots trying to forget to add a ; at the end of a statement or 2) Use VB.NET because its different so you'll struggle less to work out which environment you're working. Pragmatically I'd go with C# - there are probably more samples out there in C# than in VB.NET and if you can already cope with swapping between C++ and Java then adding a 3rd similar language probably isn't going to be too stressful.
