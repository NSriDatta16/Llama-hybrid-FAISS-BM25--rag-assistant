Clustering time series based on correlation

I want to cluster a set of time series regarding their pairwise correlation. If I normalize the series by subtracting their average value and then scaling to a standard deviation of one, the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r value) between original series is the same as the dot product of the normalized counterparts. Which clustering algorithms would be apropriate in this situation ?
