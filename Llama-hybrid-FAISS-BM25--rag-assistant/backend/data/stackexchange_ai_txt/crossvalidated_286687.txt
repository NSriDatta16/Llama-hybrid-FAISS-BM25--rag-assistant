There has been interesting work on POS tagging by Google SyntaxNet : https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html You can check their paper here : Globally Normalized Transition-Based Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042 You can use it directly to train a POS tagger or to get the dependency tree if I remember correctly.
