Magento products not showing up consistently in frontend

I have Magento site running with 20000 plus products. Sometimes it does not show the products in the frontend. It says "There are no products matching the selection", but the products are still there in the backend site. I know I have to run re-indexing process, and whenever I complete the re-indexing process all products are there in the frontend. So now, my question is: Why this is happening again and again? This is now fourth time I faced this problem. I want to know the real causes of this issue. I am very afraid. Thanks
