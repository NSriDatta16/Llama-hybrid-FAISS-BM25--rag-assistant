The optimal tuning parameter ( $\texttt{spar}$ ) in R function $\texttt{smooth.spline()}$ is automatically determined by min GCV by default (with option $\texttt{cv=FALSE}$ ). The other option (by setting $\texttt{cv=TRUE}$ ) is the jackknife (i.e., leave-one-out) based PRESS. Recall that GCV is simplified from PRESS by merely replacing the diagonal elements $S_{ii}$ of the smoothing matrix, say, $\mathbf{S}$ with their average $\mbox{tr}(\mathbf{S})/n$ . Usually the best tuning parameter choice from PRESS is similar to that from GCV, though GCV is easier to compute.
