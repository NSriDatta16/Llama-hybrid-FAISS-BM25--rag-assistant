How to turn off xdebug in script?

Possible Duplicate: How to disable XDebug I have installed xdebug, but it is making my unit tests much slower. Is there a way to disable it via ini_set or other way. I tried xdebug_disable() , but no difference at all, unless I change php.ini file. My idea is to turn on xdebug only when code-coverage report is generated, I don't need it before that.
