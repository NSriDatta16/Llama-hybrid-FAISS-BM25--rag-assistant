Injecting ANYTHING using controller's construct is generally a BAD PRACTICE ! Problem lies in your design. What kind of object is OtherClass? Is it DB adapter? Is it ACL? Is it some helper class? If you need external class in your controller I suggest using action helpers. That's what they are created for ;) Or create an action helper that will fetch this OtherClass from somewhere when needed. You should NEVER use __construct() to do any of your dirty work. That's what init() is used for. But it has no params. And there is a reason for that - again - you should not inject dependencies like this ;) Update: Note your class uses discouraged PHP4 member variable definition syntax. Try replacing your var with protected .
