Cannot import edu.stanford.nlp - Stanford parser with jython problem

Can someone help me out with the stanford parser from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml ? I've only downloaded and unzipped the parser. I've also installed the jython fully but i cannot parse a sentence, it seems like i've installed some modules or something. http://wiki.python.org/jython/InstallationInstructions >>> import sys >>> sys.path.append('~/standford-parser-2010-11-30/stanford-parser-2011-11-30.jar') >>> from java.io import CharArrayReader >>> from edu.stanford.nlp import * Traceback (innermost last): File " ", line 1, in ? ImportError: no module named edu Is there more installation procedures other than unzipping it and importing it in jython?
