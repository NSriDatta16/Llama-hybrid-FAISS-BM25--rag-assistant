Your question is incorrectly phrased. The examples do not indicate misspelling but change in the form of writing a full name. And, would your search expect to match on words like son with reference to the example? would it expect to match bob when looking for a name called Robert ? Are you looking for things like this and this ? Ok, reading your comment suggests you do not want to venture into that.
