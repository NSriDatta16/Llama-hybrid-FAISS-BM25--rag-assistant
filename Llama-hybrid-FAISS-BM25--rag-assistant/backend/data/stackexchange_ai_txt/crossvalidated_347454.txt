You are referring to the prior class distribution of the categories in a collection. The prior distribution is implicitly given, by means of the training set provided to the neural network. The play-back option is called inverse mapping, en is computationally intractable for a regular feed-forward neural network. Instead, the convolutional deep-learning neural networks do learn prototypical patterns. I recommend you to train deep learning neural networks (LeCunn-style) and study their prototypical vectors, after successful learning has been achieved.
