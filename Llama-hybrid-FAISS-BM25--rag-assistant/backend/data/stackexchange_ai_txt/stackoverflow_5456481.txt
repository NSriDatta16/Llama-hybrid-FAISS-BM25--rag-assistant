the question doesn't really belong to OOP but to PHP behavior in general All PHP data is going nowhere as well as PHP script itself. PHP scripts execution is atomic. It's not like a desktop application constantly running in your browser, and not even a daemon with persistent connection to your desktop application. It's more like a command line utility - doing it's job and exits. That's why using external storage, like file or database is required. But of course you can save only strings there, not instances of variables or anything of the kind. Strings only.
