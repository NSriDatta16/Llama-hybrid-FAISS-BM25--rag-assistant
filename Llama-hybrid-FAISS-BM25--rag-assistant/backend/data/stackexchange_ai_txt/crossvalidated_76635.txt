Frequentist /Bayesian hybrid for model selection: make sense?

I was told that this hybrid is wrong and I should never use it for any serious writing: We estimated all of the ARMA models considered in this paper using the standard procedure of maximum likelihood. We based model selection on the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion, with the requirement that all parameters were significant (at the 5% level). True or False? Why?
