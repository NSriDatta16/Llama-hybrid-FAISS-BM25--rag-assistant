Graphical drag-n-drop designer library for C# applications?

I have an app that my users use to build objects. For example, they will create a "user" object and add properties (name, address, etc). I would like to use an environment like the one Visual Studio uses on its class designer or entity designer. Is there a library out there that will help me with this? Thanks for any suggestions.
