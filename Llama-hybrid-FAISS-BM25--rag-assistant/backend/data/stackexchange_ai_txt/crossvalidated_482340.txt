Does my validation curve indicate over fitting from train and test?

I carried out a grid search on my xgboost and varied the parameters below. I noticed in my grid search results that the train score is very high, e.g. 0.99999 and my test scores are more modest around 0.72. Since there is such a big difference between my train and test score does this indicate over fitting?
