Rejection ABC: Connection with Rejection Sampling?

I am trying to understand the link between (rejection) ABC and rejection sampling. For example, this paper states: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC, Sisson et al., 2018) is centered around the idea of Monte Carlo rejection sampling (Tavar√© et al., 1997; Pritchard et al., 1999). Parameters $\theta$ are sampled from a proposal distribution, simulation outcomes $x$ are compared with observed data $x_{o}$ , and are accepted or rejected depending on a (user-specified) distance function and rejection criterion. While rejection ABC (REJ-ABC) uses the prior as a proposal distribution, [...] Usually, the comparison of simulated data $x$ and observed data $x_{o}$ happens by choosing a threshold $\epsilon$ and a distance measure $\rho$ , and if $\rho(x, x_{o}) , then $\theta$ is accepted. Hence, I do not see any connection (need) for rejection sampling, as is stated in the quote. Can anybody please clarify?
