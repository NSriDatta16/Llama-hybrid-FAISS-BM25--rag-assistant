You can't know a prior how much data you need to achieve a specific accuracy. However, if you just want to know how much people have achieved on other datasets, you can check BERT's original paper : As you can see, there are some datasets of 3.5k and 2.5 examples. You should also know that comparing BERT and LSTMs is not a fair comparison, as with BERT you are doing transfer learning, so it would profit from the pre-trained data, not only from your training data.
