Based on your description, it doesn't seem like your dataset is a set of feature vectors; rather it's simply a description of the ratios appearing in the population describing the original dataset. Standard statistical learning methods aren't going to help because you're already dealing with statistic descriptors instead of raw data. Particularly, this dataset cannot describe the occurrence of covariance . I'd first seek to achieve some form of dimensionality reduction . Starting with only the ratios, this is going to be weak: features whose ratios are close to 1.0 or 0.0 clearly contain the most descriptor "information", and you could build a decision tree based upon that. A hand-built one should focus on the features with the strongest descriptors first, and weakest descriptors last.
