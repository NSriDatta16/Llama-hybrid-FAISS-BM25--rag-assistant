An easy way would be to use TF-IDF (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency). It can help you find how much terms stand out in a document (by comparing with your entire corpus) and use it to rank your entities. TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn Just note that the TfidfVectorizer is on a word level. So some processing will be needed if your entities can consist of more than one word. Alternatively you could use a model that allows you to produce a heatmap of the words. Then you can use that heatmap to look up your NEs in that heatmap. This paper, A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding , could give you some ideas.
