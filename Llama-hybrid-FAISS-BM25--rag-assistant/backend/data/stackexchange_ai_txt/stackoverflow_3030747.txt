It's called the ternary operator. It's similar to an if/else construct, but the difference is that an expression using the ternary operator yields a value. That is, you can't set a variable to the result of an if/else construct: // this doesn't work: $c = if ($r == 0) { rand(65, 90); } else { rand(97, 122); } You can read more about it here: http://php.net/ternary#language.operators.comparison.ternary The ternary operator is frequently misused. There's little benefit to using it in the example you showed. Some programmers love to use compact syntactic sugar even when it's not needed. Or even when it's more clear to write out the full if/else construct. The ternary operator can also obscure test coverage if you use a tool that measures lines of code covered by tests.
