Understanding notation in the paper "Sparse Sinkhorn Attention"

I'm reading the paper Sparse Sinkhorn Attention by Tay, Yi, et al. and am confused on some of the notation used in Section 3 . At the start of the section, the authors describe block-based attention and introduce a few variables: In our method, the input sequence $X$ of length $\ell$ is partitioned into $N_b$ blocks in which each block has a length of $b$ tokens. Later on, they define the block-wise pooling operation in Equation 2 as follows: If my understanding is correct, it seems they are now using $N_B$ instead of $N_b$ to indicate the number of blocks, and are using $\ell_{B}$ instead of $b$ to indicate the number of tokens in each block. Is this just an inconsistency in the notation, or am I overlooking something? Thanks in advance for any insights!
