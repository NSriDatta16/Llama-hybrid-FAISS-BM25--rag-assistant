Using a list of entities has few disadvantages: The list is closed The list is not context sensitive. You need context in order to differ between "a white house" and "the white house". List building require a lot of labor List might also contain errors. It does feel like cheating (or at list no NLP insights are used). You can cope with these disadvantages by going along the direction @emre suggested and use the list in order to learn a classifier. For example, you can use tokens near the entity and learn rule like that "I live at X" is an indicator of a place and "I talked with X" is an indicator of a person. You can play this game few rounds by increasing your list by the hits of the rules and use the new list to learn more rule. Please not that in this learning you will introduce noisy into the data so in most cases the learning should be so straight forward.
