This basically looks like a 2x2x2 table ([toxicity, non-toxicity] x [constraint, non-constraint] x [group A, group B]). This question is similar. I'm not super familiar with this area (will delete this answer if a better one supersedes it), but you can do: a chi-squared test with the expected values for the ([toxic, non-toxic] x [constraint, non-constraint]) combinations set equal to the average across groups a binomial regression with glm(cbind(toxic, non-toxic) ~ constraint*group, family = binomial) , testing the interaction for significance an appropriate version of the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test ? (Based on the Wikipedia page it looks like this doesn't quite do what you wants - it tests the overall [toxicity x constraint] interaction across groups rather than comparing the groups ...) If you feel like digging in there's probably something in Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis that covers this case ...
