There is no perfect flow... If you have an existing team, start from the present process. Keep it simple, be pragmatic, both with an existing team and a new team. We use "done" subcolumns in a couple of places with a common WIP limit for the working and the done subcolumns. This way we both enable pull behaviour and limit WIP for the whole step. A typical use of a queue is in front of a bottleneck, to optimize flow. Non-bottlenecks should use slack to learn and improve, but a bottleneck (if you can identify it) limits the performance of the whole team. Regarding the final "done" column I would be pragmatic regarding tickets. I would, however, be more specific on the board regarding column names. Does "closed" mean in production, or on your testserver? Just put that in the column name.
