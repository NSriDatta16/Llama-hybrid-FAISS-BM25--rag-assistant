jquery select both class and id dynamic

I need to make a web page which has a dynamic number of paragraphs, and a corresponding number of info paragraphs. I have put all the text in the "text" class, and all the info in the "info" class, each with an id increasing by 1 for each set. Example: "> "> I need to figure out how I in jQuery dynamically can get the id of that the user clicks on, and toggles the corresponding info paragraph. Something like this, but just dynamic: $(document).ready(function(){ $('p.text#text2').click(function () { $ ('p.info#info2').slideToggle(); }); }); Any help will be much appreciated. Regards Sofus.
