C# how can I select all the text in a textbox when I double click?

Using C# how can I select all the text in a textbox when I double click? My text contains spaces "This is a test", when I double click by default only one word is highlighted, how can I highlight all the text? What I am trying to achieve is a quick way for users to clear the texbox of text, the text exceeds the length of the box so you can't select the end and drag back to delete, you have to click and use the backspace and delete keys to clear the text. Thanks Alison
