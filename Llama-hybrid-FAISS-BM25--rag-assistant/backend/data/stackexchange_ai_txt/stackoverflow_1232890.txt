How about an extension method as a variation of Eric's suggestion: public static string ToQueryString(this Dictionary dict) { return '?' + string.Join("&", dict.Select(p => p.Key + '=' + p.Value).ToArray()); } eg: dctParameters.ToQueryString(); The performance cost of any of your implementations is really not worth losing sleep over considering that this kind of process is not likely to bog down a server. The issue is (as you say) better not faster and what you seem to be after is an elegant approach rather than the least CPU cycles.
