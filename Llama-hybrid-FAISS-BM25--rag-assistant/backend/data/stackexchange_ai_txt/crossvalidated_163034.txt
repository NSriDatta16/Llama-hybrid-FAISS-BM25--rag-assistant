Bayesian logit model - intuitive explanation?

I must confess that I previously haven't heard of that term in any of my classes, undergrad or grad. What does it mean for a logistic regression to be Bayesian? I'm looking for an explanation with a transition from regular logistic to Bayesian logistic similar to the following: This is the equation in the linear regression model: $E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n$. This is the equation in the logistic regression model: $\ln(\frac{E(y)}{1-E(y)}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n$. This is done when y is categorical. What we have done is change $E(y)$ to $\ln(\frac{E(y)}{1-E(y)})$. So what's done to the logistic regression model in Bayesian logistic regression? I'm guessing it's not something to do with the equation. This book preview seems to define, but I don't really understand. What is all this prior, likelihood stuff? What is $\alpha$? May someone please explain that part of the book or Bayesian logit model in another way? Note: This has been asked before but not answered very well I think.
