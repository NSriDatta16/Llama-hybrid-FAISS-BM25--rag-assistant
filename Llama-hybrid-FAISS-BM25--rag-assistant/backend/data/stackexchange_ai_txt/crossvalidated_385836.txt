You can have zero in your features, that's not a problem unless your ML algorithm is very very specific/custom, which is not in this case. Logistic regression multiples your sample's features with weights, i.e. $x_i$ 's with $w_i$ 's, and makes a decision based on the result; and if $x_i$ is $0$ for a sample, it's just $i$ -th branch is not activated in the neuron for that specific sample. Here, don't assume that $x_i=0$ means $i$ -th branch doesn't have a saying on the decision just because it is multiplied with $0$ . For the random forest, or decision trees to put it simply, having $0$ has absolutely no effect. You can add 1 to all your samples and obtain the same decision tree again since it just sorts the feature values and finds a threshold.
