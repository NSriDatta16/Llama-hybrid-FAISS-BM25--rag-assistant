Error with generating JasperPrint in the client side

I am using JNLP which fetches my jar files to client. When I run the application, I am getting the error: JasperPrint(NullPointerException) . I can figure out the cause partially. It is because JasperPrint instance cannot be stored on client side due to access permission. Is there a way to generate JasperPrint on the client side?
