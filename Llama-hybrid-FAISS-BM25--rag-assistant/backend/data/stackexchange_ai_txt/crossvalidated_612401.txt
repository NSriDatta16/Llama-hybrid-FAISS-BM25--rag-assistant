Best Way to do Hyperparam Search and Cross-Validation

I'm making experiments to evaluate language models to brazilian portuguese datasets. So, i've made so each dataset is divided in 10 parts, I want to use cross-validation to determine the model's performance. But the thing is, I also want to use Hyperparam Search to determine the best parameter for the model. I've red that you should do Hyperparam Search for each fold of the cross validation, and in other places, that you have to use a part of the dataset that will not be used in the cross validation. Can someone please give me a hand on this one? I would also appreciate if someone has some academical articles that describe the process please :)
