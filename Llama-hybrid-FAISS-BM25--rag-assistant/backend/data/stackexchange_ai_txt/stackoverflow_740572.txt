The question is a little fuzzy, but if you want to set the position of a CocosNode you do: [myNode setPosition:cpv(x,y)]; If you want the node to be offset from a touch location, you can do this by implementing ccTouchesBegan:withEvent -(BOOL)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; CGPoint convertedLocation = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate:location]; [myNode setPosition: cpv(convertedLocation.x - 100, convertedLocation.y - 100)]; return kEventHandled; } That will offset the CocosNode by -100,-100 to where the touch occurred. The ccTouchesBegan:withEvent: should be implemented in your Layer, and isTouchesEnabled should be set to YES to enable touches.
