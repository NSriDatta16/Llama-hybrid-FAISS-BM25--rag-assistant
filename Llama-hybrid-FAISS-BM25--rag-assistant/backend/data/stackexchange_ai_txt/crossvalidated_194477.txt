Here are a few points. Your ARIMA model is not "estimating a second time series", it is filtering it. The function accuracy gives you multiple measures of accuracy of the model fit: mean error ( ME ), root mean squared error ( RMSE ), mean absolute error ( MAE ), mean percentage error ( MPE ), mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ), mean absolute scaled error ( MASE ) and the first-order autocorrelation coefficient ( ACF1 ). It is up to you to decide, based on the accuracy measures, whether you consider this a good fit or not. For example, mean percentage error of nearly -70% does not look good to me in general, but that may depend on what your series are and how much predictability you may realistically expect. It is often a good idea to plot the original series and the fitted values, and also model residuals. You may occasionally learn more from the plot than from the few summarizing measures such as the ones given by the accuracy function.
