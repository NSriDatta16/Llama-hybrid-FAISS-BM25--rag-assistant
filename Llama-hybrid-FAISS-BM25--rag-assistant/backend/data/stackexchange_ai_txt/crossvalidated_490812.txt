About Multi-layer Perceptrons

I've always been a bit confused when it comes to Deep Learning terminology. Is the definition of the perceptron, whether single layer or multi layer, associated with a specific type of activation function? (aka Step function?) Or is it associated with any activation function that attempts to squash the output in between a range of values? (aka sigmoid, TanH..) The definition of a perceptron is still not very clear to me, despite all the sources i've read.
