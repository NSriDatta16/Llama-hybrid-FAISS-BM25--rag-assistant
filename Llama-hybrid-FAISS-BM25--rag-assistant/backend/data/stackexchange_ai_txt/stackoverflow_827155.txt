This is a hot research topic in Computational Linguistics. The shallow approach, using Bayesian Filtering, is not likely to yield perfect results - but you probably don't need perfect results anyway. In CL, the 80-20 rule quickly becomes the 95-5 rule, so if you are content with what you can achieve through shallow methods, skip this answer. If you want to see whether you can improve on your results, you could try to find some better resources. The task you're referring to is called 'text summarization' in the research community, and it has its own web page which is hopelessly outdated. Mani and Maybury (1999) is probably a good overview (I haven't read it myself,) but also quite antiquated. More recent is Martin Hassels dissertation on the topic, and also quite exhaustive, including language-independent (read: statistical, i.e. shallow) methods. As always, Google will be able to help you, too. Just search for text summarization .
