Good sophisticated linq to sql sample?

I am looking for a more sophisticated way of using Linq to SQL. I am leaning L2Q but I am only seeing simple examples of business objects and simple CRUD operations in them. Any sample application that includes these: 1- Business objects which get their data from more than 1 table and from many to many tables. 2- Keeping track of data changes and automatically be able to make changes to more than one table in a simple operation. An intelligent SubmitChanges? (don't know if this possible - right now I write my own stored procs to do all the work plus I am desiging my database in a way so my use of Linq to SQL is easier!) 3- Good use of relationships between tables. It should be more than just dragging tables into the designer. 4- Transactions 5- disconnected data. Use in ASP.NET. 6- N-Tier architecture 7- Basically, more sophisticated use of LINQ to SQL and learning good design patterns 8- Skip Linq to SQL and move to Linq to Entities? I feel I am not taking good advantage of Linq and it's just giving me nice intellisense and easier queries and I feel it has a lot more to offer but not sure what and how. I am looking for real life sophisticated samples which can be a good source for learning above from what books and tutorials provide. Anything on CodePlex? Google code... etc?
