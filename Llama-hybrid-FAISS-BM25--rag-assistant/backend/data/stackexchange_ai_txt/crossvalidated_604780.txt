The inverse gamma is a conjugate prior for $\sigma^2$ in typical Gaussian-data models. The underlying idea is to have a convenient proper-prior approximation to an improper $\sigma^{-2}$ prior, for a weakly informative/low information prior. In the limit as $\epsilon=\beta=\alpha$ goes to $0$ , the $\text{inverse gamma}(\epsilon, \epsilon)$ distribution goes to that improper prior. This occurs when $\beta$ is a scale parameter, not a rate parameter. This use goes back at least to about 1993 give or take, that was when I first encountered it - I believe in conversation - and indeed subsequently used it in an illustrative example. Gelman [1] credits Spiegelhalter et al (1994), so that's possibly its first appearance, though I would not be in the least surprised to discover it's a good deal older than that. A warning: according to Gelman ([1], again) the $\text{inverse gamma}(\epsilon, \epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon$ (where 0.01 or 0.001 are typical choices of small) distribution is not as weakly informative a prior as was hoped for; he says that the results depend on which $\epsilon$ is chosen.
