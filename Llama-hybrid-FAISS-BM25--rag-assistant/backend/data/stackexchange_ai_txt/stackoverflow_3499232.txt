Most elegant way to write a piece of code that handles ramping up and down?

I have the following code in my microcontroller project: if (newThrottle = newThrottle; set--) { // Perform actions to set the throttle } } else { for (int set = currentThrottle; set If it's not blatantly obvious, this code snippet is used to ramp the motor throttle up or down from its current value to a new value. Is there any more elegant way to write this?
