I'm not sure what you mean by "a forward in -each- of thoses methods". I'm not sure that nextResponder is the correct thing to forward them to either. The problem is that touches are supposed to be "owned" by a single view throughout their lifetime. I'm not sure how UIScrollView or gesture recognizers are implemented, but I'm pretty sure they do more than you're supposed to do on your own. I'd override questionnaireView's hitTest:withEvent: to return self . In your touchesBegan:withEvent:, call [super hitTest:[touch locationInView:self] withEvent:event] and store the subview that "owns" it. In touchesMoved:withEvent:, forward the touch to the relevant subview, but if you detect a gesture, "forget" the subview that owns the touch and instead call touchesCancelled:withEvent:. In touchesEnded/Cancelled:withEvent:, forward it to the subview and then forget the owning subview. It's icky, but it mostly works. Some things it gets wrong (from the perspective of subviews): -[UIEvent touchesForView:] will return the QuestionnaireView. UITouch.view will return the QuestionnaireView UITouch.phase might not be UITouchPhaseCancelled in touchesCancelled:withEvent: (if you detect the gesture and cancel the touch). *
