I'd use GoToState behaviors with DataTriggers in Silverlight. Pretty simple in Blend: Put all of your logic for what drives you to a different state in your view model. Expose the state as an enum. Open the States tab. Create a new state group (if you don't already have one). Create your states. From the Assets tab, select Behaviors. Drag the GoToState behavior from the Assets tab and drop it on your root visual element. In the Properties panel, click the "New" button next to the TriggerType and select DataTrigger. Remember that enum on your view model? Set the Trigger Binding to the state enum on the view model. Set the Trigger Value to the value of the enum. Set the StateName to the target state. Blend should now have generated all of the VSM XAML for you. Once you get the hang of things you'll see how in some scenarios you don't even need the enum on the view model -- you'll be able to drive the state entirely off of the view.
