Since you are using SAS, I thought I'd share this. I'm not sure what model you are using, but if you are using logistic regression this may be a useful resource. Sample 54866: Logistic model selection using area under curve (AUC) or R-square selection criteria Under "Details", it reads: In addition to the AIC and BIC criteria available in PROC HPLOGISTIC, the SELECT macro can also choose models using the area under the ROC curve (CHOOSE=AUC), the R-square statistic (CHOOSE=RSQUARE), or the max-rescaled R-square statistic (CHOOSE=RSQUARE_RESCALED). Under "Limitations", it reads The best subsets selection method (SELECTION=SCORE) available in PROC LOGISTIC is not available in the SELECT macro. The area under the ROC curve criterion (CHOOSE=AUC) is not available with nominal, multinomial (LINK=GLOGIT) models.
