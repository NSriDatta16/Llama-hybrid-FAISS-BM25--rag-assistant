Averaging over time If you have $m$ series with constant population means $-\infty *, you can define the population mean of all series as a vector of individual means $\mu:=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_m)'$ . Then the sample mean over time, $\bar x:=(\bar x_1,\dots,\bar x_m)'$ , where $\bar x_i=\frac{1}{T}(x_{i,1}+\dots+x_{i,T})$ is the sample mean of the $i$ th series, will be a consistent estimator of $\mu$ if the individual series are stationary. For example, conditional heteroskedasticity and/or autocorrelation of the individual series would not prevent consistency but would reduce efficiency of the estimator $\bar x$ . Averaging across series and over time In the setting above, you can define the population mean of the average (across "space") of all series as $\mu:=\frac{1}{m}(\mu_1+\dots+\mu_m)$ . (You could also extend this trivially to a weighted average.) Then the sample mean across series of the sample means over time, $\tilde x:=\frac{1}{m}(\bar x_1+\dots+\bar x_m)$ , will be a consistent estimator of $\mu$ under stationarity. Once again, conditional heteroskedasticity and/or autocorrelation of the individual series would not prevent consistency but would reduce efficiency of the estimator $\tilde x$ . Other points Am I correct to assume that each of these time series has to fulfill the conditions of having the same mean and being homoskedastic (i.e. stationarity)? If you are averaging over time, then you need the (unconditional) mean to be the same over time for each individual series. Without that the estimators would not have meaningful counterparts in population and thus would be estimating some weird objects that you might not be interested in. Homoskedasticity is not required for that, however, as it only affects efficiency but not consistency and not the "meaningfulness". Note also that conditional homoskedasticity is not required for stationarity. Is it also important to prewhiten the individual series (i.e. remove autocorrelation)? Not really, because autocorrelation does not prevent consistency; it only results in a loss of efficiency. I am not aware of a way around it as autocorrelation effectively means the sample contains less information about the population mean (which you are trying to estimate) than an i.i.d. sample would. A transformation that could help gain some efficiency would be to account for conditional heteroskedasticity, if any. Is there a canonical reference on this topic? Not that I am aware of. *This excludes the possibility that one or more of the time series are random walks, because random walks do not have population means. However, under cointegration you could still be fine if the simple unweighted average happens to be a cointegrating combination of the series.
