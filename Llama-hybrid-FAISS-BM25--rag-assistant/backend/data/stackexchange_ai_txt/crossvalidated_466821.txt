I know they test for different things, but ultimately tests if a time series is stationary or not. The mistake in your argument is that tests of autocorrelation assess stationarity. Actually, they assess presence of autocorrelation (unsurprisingly). Now, an autocorrelated time series can be stationary or nonstationary. (Note that a stationary time series can have zero or nonzero autocorrelation; nonzero autocorrelation by itself does not make a time series nonstationary.) Therefore, learning that a time series is autocorrelated does not indicate the time series is nonstationary. If you want to assess nonstationarity of the unit root kind (there are other kinds, too, e.g. nonstationarity due to a structural break or changing variance), you need a unit root test.
