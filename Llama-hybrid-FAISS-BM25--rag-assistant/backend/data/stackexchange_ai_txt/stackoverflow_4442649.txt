In the simplest terms numberOne being marked as public means that if you create an instance of your hithere class this member variable will be accessible. For example: hithere h = new hithere() h.numberOne = 42; numberTwo being private means that this is not accessible and can only be used within the hithere class. So taking the above example further: hithere h = new hithere() h.numberOne = 42; h.numberTwo = 84; The last line would cause a compiler error as you cannot access numberTwo as this is private. It is probably worth spending some time reading up on access modifiers, a quick google will find many examples, e.g: http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Techniques/Understanding-C-Class-and-Member-Modifiers/ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ba0a1yw2%28v=vs.80%29.aspx Additionally your hithere class does not have an access modifier defined therefore the compiler assumes this to be private. As such if you were to reference your library from another you would not be able to create instances of the hithere class.
