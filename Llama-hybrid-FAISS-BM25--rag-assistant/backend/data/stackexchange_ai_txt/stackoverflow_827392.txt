It definatley sounds like you need to run your tests with an interactive session as opposed to a service. Adding the "Allow Service to interact with desktop" might help, but this is not supported in Vista any more apparently. If you can run your builds interactivley as a command line, not a serivice that should work too. We used to run our UIAutomation tests using the visual studo 2008 load agent to distribute them, running as a command line tool on VM's with no problem. I also agree that you probably should't be running UI tests on a build server a part of your daily build.
