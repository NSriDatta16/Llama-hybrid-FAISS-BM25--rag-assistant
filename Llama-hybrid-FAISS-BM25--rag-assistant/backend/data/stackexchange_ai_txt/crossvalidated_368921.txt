HW and SARIMA require cycles of prespecified length. For instance, if you have monthly data, you would prespecify frequency=12 , and if you have daily data and suspect weekly seasonality, you would use frequency=7 . So what seasonality to allow the algorithm to use will depend on your time buckets - the algorithm itself should then sort out whether or not to use seasonality. You can use seasonal plots (see here and here ) to explore potential seasonality. You may also have multiple-seasonalities , which is a whole other cup of tea. Incidentally, I strongly recommend auto.arima and ets in the forecast package in R, rather than trying to detect seasonality "by hand", or always running a seasonal method like Holt-Winters. If you have cycles of varying, irregular or unknown length, then HW and ARIMA are not very good tools (except as simple benchmarks, which may be hard to beat). If you really want to forecast something like this, you will need to apply econometric tools - econometricians deal with such cycles in the business cycle. That said, your top time series looks a bit strange. Specifically, the flat lines do. Did you really measure exactly the same value at multiple time points in a row, or did you measure at irregularly spaced time points and then carry the last observation forward? If so, then ARIMA and smoothing are probably not appropriate.
