Should I scale targets when building regression model with multiple objects?

I'm using TensorFlow 2 to build a regression neural network with four numeric output objects. Each object has a distribution that is close to the normal distribution. The mean and variance of those distributions are different but close (For example, $Normal(0.2, 0.01)$ and $Normal(0.5, 0.04)$ ). I'm wondering should I scale the targets before training? Moreover, should I scale the targets if they have very different magnititudes?
