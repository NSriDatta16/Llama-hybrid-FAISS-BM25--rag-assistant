What you want is a program transformation system . This is a tool that parses your source file, and can apply transformations to modify it, an regenerates source code with the modifications. A source-to-source transformation system accepts rules of the form of: lhs -> rhs if cond where the lhs and rhs are souce patterns for valid fragments of the language and the cond checks that the rule is safe to apply. (Consider " ?x/?x -> 1 if ?x~=0"; you need the condition to verify that the division is valid). One such tool is our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit . DMS has full C, C++, C#, Java, COBOL, Python, PHP and ECMAScript front end parsers (as as many lesser known languages) and can apply such rules directly. DMS also provides symbol table construction and control and data flow analysis, as these are often useful in defining a cond for complex rules. If you want, you can also fall back to a "standard" procedural interface to visit tree nodes and modify ASTs.
