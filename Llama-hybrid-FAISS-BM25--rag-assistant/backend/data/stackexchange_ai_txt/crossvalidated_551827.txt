After asking so many questions I was interested in what a quick-and-dirty analysis of the data you provided would give. To start with a disclaimer: I am not familiar with metafor , nor do I know anything about meta-analyses in your area of work. With that out of the way, here's an initial analysis that may give you some food for thought. Plotting the data Let's start by inspecting the data in a similar way to what you have shown in the form of a histogram. But this time we show data as a stacked histogram noting the different study identification groups as given in column ID . Here I assume data are stored in a tab-separated file called "data.tsv" . library(tidyverse) data The histogram shows some evidence for group-specific mean yi values, the differences of which relative to a global mean we will now try to characterise in a varying/random intercept model. Fitting the model I am using the Bayesian/Stan-equivalent of lme4::*lmer , through the excellent rstanarm package (which allows you to use the usual R formula syntax). Specifically, we fit a simple varying/random intercept model with shrinkage towards a global mean, which will give a fixed effect global intercept and an ID-specific intercept difference (relative to the global intercept) as the random effect. This model corresponds to Model 1 from the rstanarm Tutorial . library(rstanarm) fit Model inspection Pending a thorough model validation step , we can now use the tidybayes package to extract posterior draws using tidybayes::spread_draws to calculate and plot ID-specific intercept point estimates (median and 95% quantile intervals). library(tidybayes) fit %>% spread_draws(`(Intercept)`, b[, group]) %>% mutate( ID = str_remove(group, "ID:"), a = `(Intercept)` + b) %>% group_by(ID) %>% median_qi(a) %>% ggplot(aes(y = ID, colour = ID)) + geom_point(aes(x = a), size = 2) + geom_linerange(aes(xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper), size = 1.2) + labs(x = "Intercept")
