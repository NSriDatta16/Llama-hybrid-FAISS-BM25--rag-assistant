See this paper . It will (likely) take more than one pass. The idea is that in each pass upper and lower bounds are computed such that the median lies between them. A fundamental result here is N = size of data, P = number of passes Theorem 2) A P -pass algorithm which selects the K th highest of N elements requires storage at most O(N ( 1 / P ) (log N) (2- 2 / P ) ) . Also, for very small amounts of storage S , i.e., for 2 2 ) , there is a class of selection algorithms which use at most O((log N) 3/S ) passes. Read the paper. I'm not really sure what the heap has to do with it
