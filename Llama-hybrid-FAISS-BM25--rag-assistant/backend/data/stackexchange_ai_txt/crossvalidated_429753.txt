Just to focus on the basics of visual data analysis, a time series plot looking at "level" variables is not the best way to study relationships between two variables. The more accurate way to look at this is use a scatter plot. The X-axis would be a First Difference change in CO2 concentration (the independent X variable), and the Y-axis would be a First Difference change in Temperature (the dependent Y variable). If you use Excel, implementing such a graph would allow you to fit various types of regression and polynomial to that scatter plot graph. From that framework you could very readily examine the strength of the relationship between the two variables. Don't be entirely surprised if when looking at it this way, the relationship between X and Y is a lot weaker than what your eye interprets it to be when looking at your time series with "level" variables. This visual framework is also important if you want to model or estimate Y using X. If you use "level" variables, your model may end up with a very high R Square (same as coefficient of determination). But, that is a classic "spurious regression" (look at the seminal paper on the subject by Clive Granger). You should instead first-difference all your variables (so they represent periodic change not levels); and, then you are in better shape to run your model. "Spurious" regressions very often have very high R Square (close to 1.). Very often this is a diagnosis that you have indeed a "spurious" regression.
