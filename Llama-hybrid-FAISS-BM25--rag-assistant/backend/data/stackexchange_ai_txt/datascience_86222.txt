Think of your model as a function that maps input features to the response variable. Random forest classifier/regressor is always a piece-wise constant function. Neural nets are continuous functions (they are the successive implementation of linear maps and continuous activation functions). They are always different, so your work is accurate here. For consistency issues, try setting up the seed as mentioned above. Also, try adding cross-validation to your model to avoid too good/too bad random choices.
