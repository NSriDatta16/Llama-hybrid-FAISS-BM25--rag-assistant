Get the most average position of X objects on a path with Y available positions

Its friday, and in local time the clock is 3.22pm, so my brain wont give me a solution, so i ask: Im trying to write a function/algorithm in Actionscript 3.0 that gives me the most average positions of x number of positions along a path of y number of available positions. Y is always larger than X of course. The background is, I got a map, with for example 50 possible placements of objects (along a path). But i only got 32 objects to place along this path, but i want their placements to be as average/even along that path as possible. So that it for example won't be a big gap at the end. My avaiable positions are at the moment stored in an array with point values. If you just do totalPos/wantedPos and floor it, it will be a "ugly" gap at the end, any ideas? EDIT: I wanted to add the function incase anyone else wants it: function place (x : uint, y : uint ) : Array { var a : Array = new Array(); var s : Number = y / x; var c : Number = 0; for (var i : Number = 0; i Assumes you have an array posArray with the possible positions already...
