disadvantages of svm

since I was reading about disadvantages of svm(support vector machine) Non-Probabilistic - Since the classifier works by placing objects above and below a classifying hyperplane, there is no direct probabilistic interpretation for group membership. However, one potential metric to determine "effectiveness" of the classification is how far from the decision boundary the new point is. it said that it has no direct probabilistic interpretation for the group why this is disadvantages of the svm? for my thought this will increase the speed since it does not have to deal with the probabilistic interpretation for the group member. but I might be wrong. 1. what is the actual meaning of 'no direct probabilistic interpretation?' 2. why this chracteristic is disadvantages of svm? 3. and what other method provide the 'probabilistic interpretation'?
