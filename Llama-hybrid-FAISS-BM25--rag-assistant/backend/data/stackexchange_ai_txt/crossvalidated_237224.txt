neural network - target data

For the simple AND learning with a perceptron, it is required to have two inputs x1 and x2 and one target data y. Most AND examples (such as in the book "Fundamentals of neural network-fausett") have this network topology in the figure above, that is 2 inputs(x1,x2) and 1 output(o). My question is, how do we give the network the target data (y) if there is only two inputs(x1,x2)??
