PyLab - changing text color and background fill color of text box

I'm using PyLab to make some graphs in Python. I want to make a text box that is colored magenta with black text, but cannot get the text to be black. text(x, y, 'Summary', backgroundcolor = 'm', color = 'k') This gives me a magenta background and then text that is almost just as pink. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Many thanks!
