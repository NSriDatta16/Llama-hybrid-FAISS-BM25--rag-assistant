The CLT has to do with type I assertion probability $\alpha$ being approximately correct (and even then the sample size must be huge for it to work if you have high asymmetry) but offers no protection against high $\beta$ (low power). The $t$ -test can be used any time you have confidence that its normality/equal variance assumptions are true, but you'll be getting a lot of the power from the assumptions when $n$ is small. A Bayesian $t$ -test recognizes uncertainty with regard to both normality and the variance ratio. More here . Or use a nonparametric method to test a more general hypothesis.
