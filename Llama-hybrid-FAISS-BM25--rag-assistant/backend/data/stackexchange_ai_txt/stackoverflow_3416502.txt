I'm not sure I completely understand your question. You don't need parameters unless you are calling stored procedures. If you are passing in a SQL query, then you can pass in arguments in a string.Format() perhaps. (the below example was adapted from MSDN ) string customerId = "NWIND" string companyName = "Northwind Traders"; OleDbConnection myConnection = new OleDbConnection(myConnectionString); string myInsertQuery = string.Format("INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CompanyName) Values('{0}', '{1}')", customerId, companyName); OleDbCommand myCommand = new OleDbCommand(myInsertQuery); myCommand.Connection = myConnection; myConnection.Open(); myCommand.ExecuteNonQuery(); myCommand.Connection.Close(); However, if you wish you call a stored procedure instead, this is how you would do it with OleDB: (below example was adapted from MSDN ) OleDbConnection myConnection = new OleDbConnection(myConnectionString); OleDbCommand salesCMD = new OleDbCommand("SalesByCategory", nwindConn); salesCMD.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; OleDbParameter myParm = salesCMD.Parameters.Add("@CategoryName", OleDbType.VarChar, 15); myParm.Value = "Beverages"; myConnection.Open(); OleDbDataReader myReader = salesCMD.ExecuteReader(); myConnection.Close();
