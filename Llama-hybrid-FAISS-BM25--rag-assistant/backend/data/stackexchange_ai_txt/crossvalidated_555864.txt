For purely descriptive purposes, is it okay to run correlations between two non stationary series?

I have been obsessed with trying to conduct an analysis in the “correct” way. I read that no time series analysis should be conducted on non stationary series. I found both my series have a unit root and therefore are non stationary, so I’ve been running analyses on the first differenced data. My final question here is the following: if I am purely interested in describing the past relationship, with no intent of predicting the future, is is “okay” if I run correlation analysis on two non stationary series to identify time lags? Or should I cross correlate the first differenced data and stop asking so many questions? I have zero interest in inferring a causal “relationship.” I only want to explain the co-movement. I’m interested to know the lag which maximizes the correlation between two interest rates. I.e. interest rate A changes now, that is correlated most with changes 2 months from now for interest rate B.
