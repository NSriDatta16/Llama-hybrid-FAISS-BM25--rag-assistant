The intuitive notion that you are trying to formalize is exactly what a proper Bayesian analysis will provide. To see this, consider for a example the following simple model, which has similar features to the case you are considering: $$ X \sim 0.9\mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2) + 0.1 \mathcal N(0,1)$$ here $X$ is assumed to be generated from a mixture of a normal distribution with unknown parameters $\mu,\sigma$ , and a small "contamination" having a known standard normal distribution. Given a set of observations $x_i$ , the likelihood is (up to irrelevant constants) : $$\log \mathcal L (\mu,\sigma) = \sum_i \log \left( 0.1e^{-\frac{1}{2}x_i^2} + \frac{0.9}{\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x_i-\mu)^2/\sigma^2} \right)$$ and it diverges to infinity at the points $(\mu=x_i,\sigma=0)$ . However, despite the fact the likelihood is not defined at those points, the posterior probability of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ $$ P(\mu,\theta | x ) \propto \mathcal L (\mu,\sigma)\pi(\mu,\theta) $$ with any proper prior $\pi(\mu,\theta)$ , is a perfectly valid probability distribution. For example, this is a plot of a slice of $\log \mathcal L (\mu,\sigma)$ along the line $\mu=x_1$ when the data is $x=[1.0309,0.4307,-0.7551,0.3038,0.4514]$ (generated with a "true" $\sigma=1$ ) With any prior that is more or less uniform in the range of the plot, the posterior expectation of $\theta$ would be around 1, since the divergent spike at $\sigma=0$ contains only a negligible fraction of the posterior probability. This corresponds to your intuition that "it is very unlikely that just by chance we had a model whose mean is equal to the target and whose Ïƒ is so close to zero". This is exactly the meaning of the infinity at $\sigma=0$ : if someone had a-priori a model that predicts exactly the value of $x_1$ we observed, namely if the prior distribution had a non-zero point mass at $(\mu=x_i,\sigma=0)$ , then the posterior would be a $\delta$ -function at this point: the probability of observing exactly this predicted value by chance is zero, so wo would have to conclude the this model is correct with absolute certainty. But if we consider a-priori all values of $\sigma$ and $\mu$ to be "equally" possible, then we are assigning zero prior probability to the exact point $\sigma=0$ .
