If the P isn't the first child, why would you want to apply rules as if it were? What exactly are you trying to accomplish? If you want to apply rules to only the first paragraph, you can do so with jQuery and the following code: $(".body_content p:first").addClass("blueStuff"); Which would add a class called 'blueStuff' to the first paragraph tag within .body_content.
