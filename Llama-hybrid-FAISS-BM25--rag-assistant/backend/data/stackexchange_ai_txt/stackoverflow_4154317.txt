JavaScript, Django, and Google App Engine - Replace Text

My goal is to associate a tooltip (containing a definition) to certain words on the client side using JS. The text is generated with Django/Python (from a GAE datastore). To accomplish this, I need to scan a block of text for multiple key words that require definitions and dynamically create a html 'title' for the tooltip. I have succesfully done this for one key word at a time, however, I seem to be unable to do a search for and replace multiple values within the same block of text (when I try to accomplish with a django forloop, the entire original string appears once for each replace command - see below). My code: var str=" Paragraph of text containing key words such as test1 and test2! "; {% for i in thing %} document.write(str.replace(/{{i.word}}/gi, " {{i.word}} ")); {% endfor %} This results in: "Paragraph of text containing key words such as keyword1 and keyword2! Paragraph of text containing key words such as keyword1 and keyword2 !" My desired output is: "Paragraph of text containing key words such as keyword1 and keyword2 !" Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, I have a very limited knowledge in JS.
