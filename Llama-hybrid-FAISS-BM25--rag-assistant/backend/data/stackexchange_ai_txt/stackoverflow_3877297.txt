How do i render html/css same in firefox and IE

i am making a menu for my school assignment and it needs to work in both IE and firefox. I am done the menu and it works perfectly in firefox, but i am having trouble getting it to display properly in IE A part can be found over here: http://tutudragon3.info/ie-trying.php When i click the home image in firefox, a dropdown sort of thing pops-up with 2 images with text "d" and "d". In firefox, there is no space between those dropdown images, but when i try it in IE, I see a small blank space between them. how could i fix this (delete that space) please. I tried many different things but it didn't work. Using IE8 by the way.
