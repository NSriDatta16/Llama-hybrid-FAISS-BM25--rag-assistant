Logistic regression looks like a good choice here. You don't need responses centered on 0.5. I'm not so sure about the weights. If you have a column of successes (say r) and a column of trials (total service points), you can do glm(cbind(r,n-r) ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, family=binomial(), data=tennisData) and the estimation takes care of things. If each player has several matches and each match has several service points, you might want to include a random effect for matches. A random effect for players is also possible, but you are probably doing better by including past player outcomes in the model. In other words, I doubt you would be able to estimate a player effect in a model that also contains the "average of previous matches" variable. If there is a match effect, it is important to include it so as obtain appropriate confidence intervals for your predictions.
