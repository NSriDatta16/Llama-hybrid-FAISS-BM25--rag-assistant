Resharper throws OutOfMemoryException on big solution

IDE Configuration: Visual Studio 2008 + Resharper 4.5.1 + Agent Smith 1.1.8 . There is no any sophisticated configuration for last to add-ins. Solution description: 33 class libraries + web site with 200+ pages. Symptoms: After an hour of work under tuned on Resharper the IDE starts to throw the OutOfMemoryExection exceptions. Normal work is impossible only reopen Visual Studio can help. Does anybody has such problem? Is it possible to configure Resharper to consume less memory? What Resharper feature does consume the most memory?
