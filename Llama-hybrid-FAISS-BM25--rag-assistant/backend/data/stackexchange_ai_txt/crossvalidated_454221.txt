After reading more around this topic I believe that the paper Understanding predictive information criteria for Bayesian models answers my original question best and gives great references to further reading. It also clarifies terminology and vocabulary and gives some concrete examples and comparisons. In the end, my conclusion is that my question was really around having a "measure of predictive accuracy" and comparing that to the "true data-generation processes" "measure of predictive accuracy". The paper shows what is possible and what is not.
