You need normal data to train on. If you have abnormal instances also, those should be excluded from the training set. Having access to labeled abnormal/normal data is very useful for the validation and testset. Anything that differs from the normal data (as learned by the autoencoder) is considered an anomaly. If you have a lot of labeled abnormal and normal data, then you can consider using binary classification instead.
