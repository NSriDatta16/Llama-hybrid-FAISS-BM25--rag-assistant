On the publishing side, you'd use the DB subscription storage option (found in the production profile) so that all publishing instances see the same list of subscribers. On the subscribing side, you'd use a distributor to distribute the load of events coming in so that each message is dispatch to only a single instance. Note that you'd use one distributor for each subscriber, so no real bottleneck, and the distributor doesn't do any actual work so it's not much of a concern.
