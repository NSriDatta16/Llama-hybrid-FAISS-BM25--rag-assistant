Is it needed to use a regularization if you only have dummy variables in machine learning ?

I have a problem in which I would like to predict the segments of a population (supervised learning) and I am planning on using the xgboost algorithm in R. My question is, is there any point in using also a regularization since all my explanatory variables are dummy variables ?
