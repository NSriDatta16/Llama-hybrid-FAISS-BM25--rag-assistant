Multi class log-loss is used in many data science competitions. Although not so easily interpretable as accuracy, it penalizes based on your confidence on your predictions. If the models you are using output probabilities, it may be a better way than accuracy to compare and select different models on your validation data, as it takes into account the probabilities and not only the amount of correct predictions.
