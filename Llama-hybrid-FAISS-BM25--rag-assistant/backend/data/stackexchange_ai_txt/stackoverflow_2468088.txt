"___ is largely an organizational issue caused by long hours, little down time, and continual peer, customer, and superior surveillance" No this is not the definition of scrum, it is the wikipedia excerpt on the definition of burnout. Dont do too many short 10 days sprints. You will burnout your team eventually. Use short sprints where you really need them, and don't do too many in a row. Think long-term. A distance runner always paces themselves for the full race and does sprints in short distances only where it matters. If you burnout your team you can toss out all them fancy scrum charts, they won't do a thing for your team's plummeting productivity.
