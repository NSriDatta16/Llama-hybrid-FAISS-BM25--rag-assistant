Confusion on the connection between causality and stationarity and possible implications

Let $(x_{t})_{t\in \mathbb Z}$ be a causal AR(p) process with operator $\phi$ such that $\phi(L)=\phi_{0}-\phi_{1}L-...-\phi_{p}L^{p}$ and $(\epsilon_{t})_{t \in \mathbb N_{0}}$ white noise sequence: By definition, there exists a sequence $(\psi_{t})_{t \in \mathbb N_{0}}$ such that $x_{t}=\psi(L)\epsilon_{t}$ where $\psi(L)=\psi_{0}+\psi_{1}L+\psi_{2}L^{2}+...$ with the Lag operator $L$ and $\sum\limits_{j\in \mathbb N_{0}}\lvert \psi_{j}\rvert . One equivalent property of causality is that all roots of $\phi$ lie outside the unit circle. Furthermore, introducing the notion of weak stationarity, meaning mean stationarity and covariance stationarity of the time series $x_{t}$ . We get that a AR(p) process $x_{t}$ is stationary, if the roots of $\phi$ lie outside of the unit circle. So by the above thoughts I have espoused, I may assume the following: causality $\implies$ stationarity with mean $0$ . This leads me to what I think may be a contradiction, because under the assumption that $x_{t}$ is stationary, we have $\mathbb E[x_{t}]=\frac{\phi_{0}}{1-\phi_{1}-...-\phi_{p}}$ So even if i did assume causality, this would have to mean that $0=\mathbb E[x_{t}]=\frac{\phi_{0}}{1-\phi_{1}-...-\phi_{p}}$ , which is certainly not true, and would only be true if I assume $\phi_{0}=0$ . What am I not understanding?
