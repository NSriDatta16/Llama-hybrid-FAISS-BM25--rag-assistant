NCover has held the code coverage niche for the .NET market for some time, probably since it first went commercial. I suspect the issue is that the old free version was compiled for .NET 2, and .NET 4 is sufficiently different the old NCover now won't work correctly. For what it's worth, NCover 3 seems the most viable option. Admittedly not free, but the cost isn't too bad for the Classic version. I've been trialling it recently, and it's worked fine against a .NET 4 application. And it's much cheaper than a higher-end version of Visual Studio.
