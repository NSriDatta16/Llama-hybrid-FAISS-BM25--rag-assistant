CMS Solutions Magento and Wordpress package all theme related files into their own seperate directories. These contain the serverside code, stylesheets, images and javaScript for the theme. The user in effect chooses a directory to use which affects how the page is layed out and styled. An easier approach A much easier way to get started would be to accept that the actual content, e.g. HTML of a page would stay the same, but let the user choose from various CSS style sheets. When choosing a style sheet the system could use JavaScript to load it in dynamically so that the user can preview the look they are choosing.
