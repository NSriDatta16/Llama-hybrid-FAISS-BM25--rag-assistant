PCA on log transformed data

I am about to conduct two Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on species abundance data and species composition data. I have about 12 different locations where abundance data for over 50 invertebrate species has been collected. The software I am using has an option to log transform and scale the data prior to analyses. My question is, without spending too much time examining the data, is it a fairly common approach to both log transform and standardize the data prior to PCA analyses? Or is it best to just leave the data alone and run the PCA?
