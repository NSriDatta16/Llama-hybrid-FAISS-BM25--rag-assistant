SVM - non separable case/soft margin, where are the support vectors

My Question is - in the inseparable case(where we add slack variables) $\begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} & \underset{w}{\text{minimize}} & & \ ||w||^2 + C \sum_{1}^{m} \epsilon_i\\ & \text{subject to} & & y^{(i)}(w^Tx^{(i)} +b) \geq 1 - \epsilon_i, \; i = 1, \ldots, m. & & \epsilon_i \geq 0, \; i = 1, \ldots, m. \end{aligned} \end{equation*}$ I selected 2 vectors in the image above, which one of them is misclassified and the other is in the wrong side of the margin. My question is, are they support vectors? Or the rule for support vectors is that they lie on the margin, ie $|wx-b|=1$?
