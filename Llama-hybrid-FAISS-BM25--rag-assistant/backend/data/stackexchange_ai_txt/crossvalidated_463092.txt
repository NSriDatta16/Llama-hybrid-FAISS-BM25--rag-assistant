The population described here represents a distribution, and the one you have as UK population is a sample from it, which is why the parameter changes while for the population it is fixed. In this sense, although you use the entire UK population to estimate the average age of living, it'll only represent an estimate of the true unseen population average age of living, which is the distribution that the current UK population is sampled from. But, I agree with the comments and other answer by @NuclearWang that if the statistical population is defined as the UK population, then when it changes, so must the parameter.
