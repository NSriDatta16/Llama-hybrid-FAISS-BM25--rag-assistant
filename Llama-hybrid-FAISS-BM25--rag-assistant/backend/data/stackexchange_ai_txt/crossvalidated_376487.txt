Normal max entropy

In the following link, at the bottom of the page. https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/sasp/Maximum_Entropy_Property_Gaussian.html The Gaussian maximum entropy is derived. I have a question about this, Why are we allowed to simply use $\int_{\mathbb{R}}( x^{2}p(x) -\sigma^{2})dx$ for one of our constraints, given that $E[X]=\mu \lt \infty$ To me it seems, unless the mean was zero, that we would need $\int_{\mathbb{R}}( (x-\mu)^{2}p(x) -\sigma^{2})dx$ . Which would give a different result when we differentiate with respect to $p(x)$ and solve for the Lagrange multipliers. i.e in the first case we would get $\lambda_{0}-1+\lambda_{1}x+\lambda_{2}x^{2}=\log(p(x))$ so $p(x)=\exp(\lambda_{0}-1+\lambda_{1}x+\lambda_{2}x^{2})$ while in the second we would get $\lambda_{0}-1+\lambda_{1}x+\lambda_{2}(x^{2}-\mu)=\log(p(x))$ I also have some confusion about how many Lagrange multipliers we need. For example, on the above page and example we have three, for three constraints, ie that it is a valid distribution, that it has finite mean and that it has finite variance (ie finite second moment combined with finite first moment). But in The Bayesian Choice by Christian Roberts, we only have two Lagrange multipliers ( at least that seems to me). Whereby the author writes it as proportional to $\exp(\theta \lambda_{1}+\theta^{2} \lambda_{2})$ , is one our $\lambda$ here just 1 and cancels out? As I am trying to understand reference measures and such, and one example asks about having the standard normal as a maximum entropy prior. When it was Lebesgue measure with known mean and variance, we had it was proportional to $\exp(\lambda_{1} \theta+\lambda_{2} \theta^{2})$ If Lebesgue is just the most basic, then for another distribution h as a reference would we simply have the maximum entropy prior proportional (assuming exists). to $\exp(\lambda_{1} \theta +\lambda_{2} \theta^{2}) h(\theta)$ As the author Christian Robert asks about reference measures that are absolutely continuous to one another, and from what I can gather this just means they have the same null set? But would that not be true for any continuous distribution? Since from what I can gather, Lebesgue is zero over points, non zero over intervals or such. Similar to continuous distributions which are zero at any given point.
