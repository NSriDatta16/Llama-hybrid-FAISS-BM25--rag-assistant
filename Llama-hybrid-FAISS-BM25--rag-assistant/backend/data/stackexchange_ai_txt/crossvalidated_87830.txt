SVM model does not support probabiliy estimates?

I am doing some classification task with Support Vector Machines (SVM). I am using libSVM (with Matlab support) to predict probability estimates matrix. However, the libSVM displays message that; Model does not support probabiliy estimates Below is my sample code; (train_label contains labels for training data and test_label contains label for test data) model = svmtrain(train_label, train_data, '-t 2 -g .01 -c 0.7 -b 1); [y,accuracy,prob_estimates]=svmpredict(test_label,test_data,model,'-b 1'); Can someone tell me if there is something wrong with the way I am doing it? Any help/suggestion will be appreciated.
