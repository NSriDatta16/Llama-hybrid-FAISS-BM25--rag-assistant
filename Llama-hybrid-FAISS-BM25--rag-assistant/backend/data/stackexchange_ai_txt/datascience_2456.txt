You have a great idea going, and it might work for your specific project. However there are a few considerations you should take into account: In your first sentence, Obama in incorrectly classified as an organization, instead of a person. This is because the training model used my NLTK probably does not have enough data to recognize Obama as a PERSON. So, one way would be to update this model by training a new model with a lot of labeled training data. Generating labeled training data is one of the most expensive tasks in NLP - because of all the man hours it takes to tag sentences with the correct Part of Speech as well as semantic role. In sentence 2, there are 2 concepts - "Former Vice President", and "Dick Cheney". You can use co-reference to identify the relation between the 2 NNPs. Both the NNP are refering to the same entity, and the same entity could be referenced as - "former vice president" as well as "Dick Cheney". Co-reference is often used to identify the Named entity that pronouns refer to. e.g. "Dick Cheney is the former vice president of USA. He is a Republican". Here the pronoun "he" refers to "Dick Cheney", and it should be identified by a co-reference identification tool.
