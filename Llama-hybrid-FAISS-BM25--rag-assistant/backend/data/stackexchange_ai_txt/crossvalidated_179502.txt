Garten et al. {1} compared word vectors obtained by adding input word vectors with output word vectors, vs. word vectors obtained by concatenating input word vectors with output word vectors. In their experiments, concatenating yield significantly better results: The video lecture {2} recommends to average input word vectors with output word vectors, but doesn't compare against concatenating input word vectors with output word vectors.
