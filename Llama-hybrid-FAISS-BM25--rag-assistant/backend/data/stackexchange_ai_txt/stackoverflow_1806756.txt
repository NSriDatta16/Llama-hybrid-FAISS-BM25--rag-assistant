If you want to go the managed route, try the XNA Game Studio from Microsoft. I think it's a good place to start, and you might not get discouraged (as I have) with some of the more powerful and complicated technologies, like pure DirectX or OpenGL programming with C++/WIN32. A lot of that stuff is abstracted away so you can focus on actually creating something. Heck, you could even make something that can end up on Xbox Live. It's free to start developing and there's sure to be a lot of resources out there to get you started.
