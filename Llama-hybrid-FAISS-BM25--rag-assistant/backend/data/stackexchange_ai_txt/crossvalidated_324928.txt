Plotting the results of a logistic regression

I ran a logistic regression in R and then I went to plot it and I'm not sure how to understand the plot. Here's the logistic regression - glm(formula = outcome ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = dataframe) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.2917 -0.2904 -0.2904 -0.2904 2.5247 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.144947 0.095262 -33.01 Here's the code I used to plot it - curve(predict(model,data.frame(dataframe=x),type="resp"),add=TRUE) I ended up with just this - If this is right - what does the y axis represent? Is the x axis the probability that outcome will occur?
