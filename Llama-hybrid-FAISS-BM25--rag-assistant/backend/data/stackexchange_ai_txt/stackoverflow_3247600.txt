Sure it is possible and can be a good speed improvement. I'm using the cms "contenido" (www.contenido.org) where this practice is used for some editable components, (layouts/modules/data types etc.). Finally all code for one article is stored in one field and is performed with one eval call. Contenido is not perfect, nevertheless a good example for this practice. Missing version control is a disadvantage. But it is not a real problem with a simple way to export and import the code fragments.
