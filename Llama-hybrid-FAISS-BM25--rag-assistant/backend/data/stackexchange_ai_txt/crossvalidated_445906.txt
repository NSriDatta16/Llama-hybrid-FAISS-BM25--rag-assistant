If you adopt a Bayesian approach then you should be able to fit such a model. This can be estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for example with JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) or Hamilton Monte Carlo with Stan. Both can be set up and run from within R. I appreciate that you say it may take a long time to run, but there are ways to speed things up such as running multiple chains on multiple compute nodes.
