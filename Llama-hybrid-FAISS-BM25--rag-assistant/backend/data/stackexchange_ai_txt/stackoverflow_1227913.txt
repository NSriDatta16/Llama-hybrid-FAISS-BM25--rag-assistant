Drupal Views combine 2 columns into 1?

I've got two content types, both have a node title and a document attachment, the doc attachment fields are different names (being from two different content types). In my view, I'm displaying the node title and the file name in a table. The node titles are great all in one column, but the two content typed attachment fields are displaying in two separate columns, making three columns total when there should only be two. Every row has a single doc title, but one or the other column is always blank now depending on which content type's doc title is displayed. How can I combine these two fields to display in the same column so it looks seamless? It is not important to know that these docs came from two different content types. These are organized by larger taxonomy terms so it's not feasible to just do two different views.
