What is a dragon king?

I am studying a system of cities where the largest city appears to be in many aspects an outlier . The distribution of city size - in any country - are often claimed to follow Zipf's law. According to Wikipedia Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency). The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is linear. However, I recently stumbled upon a paper where it is stated that an alternative view is that the "largest observation" are Dragon Kings . Offcourse there is also a wiki article on the topic Dragon Kings to be found here . However I'm not sure I follow what is at stake in perceiving some observation as a Black Swans rather than a Dragon King and how this relates to Zipf's law. Can anyone make this more plain or define in intuitive terms what a Dragon King is?
