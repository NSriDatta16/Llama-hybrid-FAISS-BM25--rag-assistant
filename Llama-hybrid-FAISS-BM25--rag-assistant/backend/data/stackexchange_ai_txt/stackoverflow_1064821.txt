Typically USB drives are formatted with FAT32 or NTFS, both of which are usable in Linux. You might also find the Wikipedia article on USB mass storage devices interesting. In particular: The USB mass storage specification does not require any particular file system to be used on conforming devices. Instead, it provides a simple interface to read and write sectors of data—much like the low-level interface used to access any hard drive—using the "SCSI transparent command set." Operating systems may treat the USB drive like a hard drive, and can format it with any file system they like.
