Time Series Data Multi-Class Classification

This is a very general question, as I'm still very much in the learning phase with machine learning. I have some utility data around problematic meters. Even tho the data is "time series", I believe I can perform a multi-class classification (looking at 3 labels) towards the data, but would like some opinions before I pursue down that road. I have been doing some feature engineering to derive other data points to help with the classification process (examples below are columns "Error1" and "Error2"). The meters come in 2 classes, those that are estimated issues ="1", and does that are non-estimated issues ="0". My dataset roughly looks like below (I have several other Error features): Estimated Meter ID Date DaysInDuration Error1 Error2 0 BBA 11/19/2019 31 0 0 0 BBA 12/19/2019 62 1 0 0 BBA 12/19/2019 92 1 0 1 JJL 11/2/2019 120 1 0 1 JJL 12/2/20019 150 1 1 1 JJL 1/20/2020 180 2 2 What I would like to attempt is to use a classification model that can handle multi-class classification (possibly a decision tree), and produce a output such as below: Estimated Meter ID Date DaysInDuration Error1 Error2 Classification Label 0 BBA 11/19/2019 31 0 0 1 0 BBA 12/19/2019 62 1 0 1 0 BBA 12/19/2019 92 1 0 2 1 BBA 11/2/2019 120 1 0 3 1 JJL 12/2/2020 30 1 1 1 1 JJL 1/20/2020 60 2 2 1 Labels Meaning = "1" = low risk issue/ "2" = medium risk issue/ "3" = high risk issue The model would classify the either "1","2", or "3" depending on the length of days the meter has been in the "DaysInDuration" column, and the number of counted errors in the "Error1" and "Error2" columns. In my thoughts it feels like classification would still work, including with train test splits, as the classification is moreso from other data points versus the actual order dependency in a typical time series problem.
