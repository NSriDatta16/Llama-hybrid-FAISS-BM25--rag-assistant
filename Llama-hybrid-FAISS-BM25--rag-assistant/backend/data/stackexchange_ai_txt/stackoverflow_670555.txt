Once i cd'ed into such a long directory, i have that in the history. Then i just type Ctrl-R for the "(reverse-i-search)" prompt and type in a few characters, like Dev/C that appear somewhere in the path, and it shows me the command what i issued back then and i can easily jump to it again. That works pretty well in practice. Because it won't find an entry if you haven't typed that path for quite some time, which would mean doing work to make things easier probably wouldn't be worth the time. But it definitely will find it if you used it recently. Which is exactly what i need. In some way, it's a self-organizing cache for long commands & path-names :)
