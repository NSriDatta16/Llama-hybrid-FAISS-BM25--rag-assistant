In simplified terms you can think about it like this: suppose you are preparing pupils for an exam. You have three sets exercises from previous exams: A, B, and C. But the exercises in the upcoming exam will be different. Nonetheless you want to test how well students will do on the unseen exam tests, when trained on similar tests from the past. Here is how you can do it: you give exercises A and B to student one, and after he learns to solve them you test his ability on C. For another student you give exercises A and C and test how well she does on the remaining set B. And for the third student you give B and C and test on A. This way the scores obtained on the unseen tests, by all students, will be the average score you can reasonably assume those students will get in the upcoming exam. However if instead you show all your exercise sets: A, B, and C, to a student - then how will you able to test how well is he or she prepared? If you give the student the exercise he or she saw in training then the student might answer it perfectly from memory alone. Same with classification methods. If you show them all the data - what data will you use to check how well "trained" they are? A simple silly method that memorises everything would score 100% on such a testing strategy. But the same method might be completely lost when presented with an unseen data point.
