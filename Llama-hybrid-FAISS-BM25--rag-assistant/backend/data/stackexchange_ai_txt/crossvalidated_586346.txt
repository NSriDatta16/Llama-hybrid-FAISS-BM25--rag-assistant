Instead of doing successive differences you could instead consider all pairwise differences (if your sample is indeed IID instead of a time series then this should be better estimate of this quantity) quick and dirty code for something like that would be all_pairs_slack I think this quantity is estimating $$ \text{E}\left[\sqrt{(Y_1-Y_2)^2 + 1}\right] $$ Where $Y_1 \sim Y_2 \sim Y$ have the same distribution (and are independent). This is actually pretty close to variance. If you didn't have the square root and that pesky $+1$ then you would have $$ \begin{align*} \text{E}\left[(Y_1-Y_2)^2\right] &= 2\text{Var}[Y] \end{align*} $$ See this blogpost: https://aaronjfisher.github.io/why-divide-n-1-pairwise-differences.html As for the Cauchy phenomenon: cauchy variance is undefined, so the "fits so nice" that you are seeing is probably just because the scales are so different (observed variances for your cauchy variables are in magnitude 10^7) if you plotted vars and slacks on log scale you would see they are not perfectly correlated
