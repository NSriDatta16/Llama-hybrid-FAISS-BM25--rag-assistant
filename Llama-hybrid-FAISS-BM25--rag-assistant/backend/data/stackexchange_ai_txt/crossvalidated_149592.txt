How to use a varImp function to select features from training set?

Till now I have used a following flow for training a random forest model. create 10 folds of data. for each fold i: - use ith fold as validation data - use remaining 9 folds as training data - apply normalization on training and validation data - # apply feature selection on training data - # select same features from validation data - train random forest on training data - predict values for validation data combine all predictions. Now I want to do feature selection using varImp() function. I am confused as it is said that varImp itself trains a model on training data to find out best set of features. How should I use varImp to get important features (say using partial least squares ) and then again apply training model on training data?
