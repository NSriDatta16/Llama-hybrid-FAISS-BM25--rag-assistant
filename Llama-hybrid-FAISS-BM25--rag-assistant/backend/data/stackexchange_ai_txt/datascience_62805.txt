Can I download Twitter data via web scraping for research?

I want to do a sentiment analysis using twitter data. Was thinking about hardcoding a cURL script to download data, from a Google Cloud service (I'll run the data on a neural network on the server, to label each tweet), but I have this question: Am I allowed to do this? I know twitter sells the data, so I am not sure if I can get in trouble for downloading it directly (I have to disclose the data gathering methodology on the paper).
