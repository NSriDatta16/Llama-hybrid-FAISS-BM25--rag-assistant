agile software development process metrics

I'm interested in where to find information about agile software engineering development process metrics, what kind of variables are assessed to evaluate such processes? I'm interested in productivity, timeliness, staff utilization, and quality. I'm building an agent-based simulation to model an agile software development process and I'm trying to find real world data to see if my model is predicting things correctly. To be more specific, does productivity (and staff utilization) follow an oscillating pattern over time throughout a software process? Thanks!
