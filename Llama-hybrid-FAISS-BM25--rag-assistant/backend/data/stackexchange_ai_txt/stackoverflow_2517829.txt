I would; 1) Assign unique identifier (GUID) to each image 2) Tag/Name the image with that GUID 3) Store GUID in the OS (File System) 4) Store Fully Qualified File Name (FQN) pointer in the database. Storing images in the database is too expensive in terms of storage and maintenance. Storing just the FQN pointer would provide better solution. You can also build back-end integrity check through triggers and some stored procedures.
