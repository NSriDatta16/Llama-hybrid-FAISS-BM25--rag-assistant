Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances. These two points are pretty much contradictory, as one feature is typically one-dimensional (some features may be multidimensional but it is less common). The first point is the correct one, see SVM, Overfitting, curse of dimensionality and Number of features vs. number of observations for more details.
