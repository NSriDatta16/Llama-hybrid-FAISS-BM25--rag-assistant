Where is IndexedDB? And how do you use it?

Wow! Web standards regarding databases seem to be a mess at the moment. Anyone care to help me codify the current state of IndexedDB because I can't for the life of me find a reasonable reference? It seems this post is no longer valid and the correct reference to the FireFox 4 IndexedDB is now window.mozIndexedDB . As for Chrome and IE NONE of the below examples seem to work for me and the objects they attempt to declare seem to not exist by testing using the browser development tools. Specifically I refer to window.webkitIndexedDB in Chrome and window.IndexedDB in IE. http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/ http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/01/indexeddb-statu.html PS: Im using Firefox 4, Chrome 10.0.648.204 and IE8
