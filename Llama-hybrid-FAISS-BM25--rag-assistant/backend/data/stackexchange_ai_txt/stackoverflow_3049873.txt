What causes the obvious line Colors are interpolated across the triangle. Each triangle has only 3 colors. Therefore interpolation routine simply doesn't "know" that there is a fourth color (on adjacent triangle) that should be taken into account, which produces inaccurate result. and how might I be able to avoid it? Two solutions: Use textures instead of vertex colors. This requires additional memory for texture, but you can easily use 2x2 pixels texture. Use fragment shader which interpolates between 4 colors based on texture coordinates. This requires video card with fragment shader support.
