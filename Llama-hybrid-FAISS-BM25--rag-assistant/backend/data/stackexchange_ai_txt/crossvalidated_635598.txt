The time series shows random walk behavior from PACF and ACF plot but adf test shows its stationary

I am new to time series and wanted to practice it by forecasting an hourly time series. The adf and kpss test results show that the series is stationary. ADF test results Test Statistic -1.023836e+01 p-value 4.822092e-18 #Lags Used 2.500000e+01 Number of Observations Used 8.734000e+03 Critical Value (1%) -3.431099e+00 Critical Value (5%) -2.861871e+00 Critical Value (10%) -2.566946e+00 KPSS test results Test Statistic 0.109422 p-value 0.100000 #Lags Used 54.000000 Critical Value (10%) 0.347000 Critical Value (5%) 0.463000 Critical Value (2.5%) 0.574000 Critical Value (1%) 0.739000 However, the pacf and acf plots show that the series is a random walk. Is the series a random walk and is it possible to forecast it?
