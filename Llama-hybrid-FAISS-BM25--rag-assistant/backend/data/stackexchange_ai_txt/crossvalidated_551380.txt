The empirical distribution function $\hat{F}(\cdot)$ is a step function by construction, since it puts a probability (Dirac) mass of $1/n$ on every term in the sample, $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ , hence jumps by the same factor $1/n$ from one observation to the next. As a result, it is not everywhere differentiable and cannot be associated with a probability density function, meaning there is no density equivalent to the empirical distribution function (at least wrt a continuous measure like the Lebesgue measure). is "empirical" in the sense that it is based on an iid sample, $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ , as opposed to the true cumulative distribution function, $F(\cdot)$ , of the sample is a proper cumulative distribution function (cdf), corresponding to an average of Dirac distributions over the sample, $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ estimates the true cdf $F$ with the property of being unbiased that $$\mathbb{E}^F[\hat{F}(x)]=F(x)$$ for all $x$ 's, and is converging a.s. to the true cdf $F$ for the uniform convergence norm. This is the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem . What is a non-cumulative distribution function?
