Assuming these are web applications - you must implement some type of shared trust model between the applications. Under no circumstance should you write your own. That is too easy to screw up and there are plenty of existing (both open and commercial) to choose from. Here are following options: 1 - If everyone is running Windows - you could just Windows Native Authentication (aka SPNEGO) 2 - You could implement some type of SSO system. Popular systems are CAS, Oracle Access Manager, CA SiteMinder, Sun SSO and IBM Tivoli Access Manager. While CAS is open-source, the others will also allow you to implement authorization as well, while CAS only does authentication. Finally - make sure whatever option you choose - that it integrates with your language's native authentication & authorization framework. In Java this would be JAAS. In .NET it would be the .NET security framework. For PHP/Perl - you can leverage Apache modules. The benefit is that you don't have to become a security expert and it will make it easier to use external systems for authentication & authorization without having to re-code your app.
