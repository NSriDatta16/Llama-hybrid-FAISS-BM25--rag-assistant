The issue is that when you append a new element to the DOM, it doesn't inherit the event handlers of the existing draggable elements. You may have some luck with liveQuery This will allow you to create live events on all current and future elements matching a selector. It's similar to the built-in live() method. I haven't used it but it should work with draggable.
