Condensing a sparse confusion matrix for display

I'm trying to display the confusion matrices for various NLP components and a few of them, most notably the part of speech tagger, have rather sparse confusion matrices. So far I've only been able to find resources on how to store a sparse matrix, which isn't particularly helpful since I'm already storing it in a dense way. So given that I want to display the matrices in a table format, what are some methods I can use to achieve a more dense (visual) representation of the data?
