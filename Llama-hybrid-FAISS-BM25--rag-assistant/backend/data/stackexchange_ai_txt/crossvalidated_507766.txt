The unbiasedness of the difference in means estimator for the average treatment effect is a direct result of uncofnoundedness and causal consistency, and otherwise is unrelated to the treatment assignment mechanism (i.e., whether it is a Bernoulli trial or a completely randomized trial). $$E[Y|A = a] =E[Y(a)|A=a]=E[Y(a)]$$ for each treatment vaue $a$ , implying the difference in means estimator, which is unbiased for $E[Y|A = 1] - E[Y|A = 0]$ , is unbiased for $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$ . The first equality is due to causal consistency, i.e., $Y = AY(1) + (1-A)Y(0)$ , which implies that $Y(a)$ and $Y$ are equivalent when conditoning on $A=a$ . The second equality comes from confoundedness, that $A \perp Y(a)$ for each $a$ , which implies that $f(Y(a)|A) = f(Y(a))$ . In a Bernoulli trial, unconfoundedness holds because assignment to treatment does not depend on any factors related to the potential outcomes (i.e., it is a fixed probability for each individual).
