K, I usually tend to champion the Not Invented Here mentality, encouraging people to re-invent the wheel as a learning exercise ... but the way you've asked this question suggests to me that you've decided to build a framework before deciding why you want or need that framework . What do you want this framework to do? Equally, what do you not want it to do? Once you've made that decision, read up on some WebEA design patterns and decide what combination of patterns best suits your goals. Asking "How do you write the core of a framework?" is like asking "How do you structure literature?" in that there's no real answer without knowing if you're talking about a novel or a play or a poem.
