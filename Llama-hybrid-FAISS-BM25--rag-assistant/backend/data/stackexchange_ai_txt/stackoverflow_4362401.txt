You need to rethink things in terms of the event-driven model used by android. You cannot wait for UI events in onCreate, because no UI events can be delivered until after onCreate has returned. Perhaps you could organize things as a software state machine. onCreate would show the EULA and set the state to EULA_SHOWING accept would advance the state to EULA_ACCEPTED and display something next Of course you probably don't want to show the EULA on every startup, but only after install, but you can handle this with something stored in settings.
