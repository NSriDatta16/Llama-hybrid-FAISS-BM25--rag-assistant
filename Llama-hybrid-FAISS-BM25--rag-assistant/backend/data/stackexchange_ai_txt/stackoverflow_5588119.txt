How do I track AJAX sections in Magento Onepage with Google Analytics Async

I have a magento store and I am trying to track the progress of users at the checkout process. I have the Onepage checkout enabled - which does some ajax stuff to essentially load 6 different steps in an accordion format. I would like to track each step with Google Analytics so i know whats putting the users off.. I found this link ( http://magentoexpert.co.uk/2009/03/08/tracking-one-page-checkout-abandonment-with-google-analytics-properly/ ) to do so with Google Analytics - but it uses the old GA code. I am using the Async code which uses the gaq push. So here is the code they recommend to use. gotoSection: function(section) { try { pageTracker._trackPageview('/checkout/' + section + '/'); } catch(err) {} section = $('opc-'+section); section.addClassName('allow'); this.accordion.openSection(section); }, To update this to the Asynchronous version, would i use: gotoSection: function(section) { try { _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/checkout/', + section + '/']); } catch(err) {} section = $('opc-'+section); section.addClassName('allow'); this.accordion.openSection(section); }, Do i need the catch(err) ? What would be the full code - this doesn't seem to work for me?
