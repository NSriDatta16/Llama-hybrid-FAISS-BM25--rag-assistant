Reasoning behind reciprocal link function for exponential regression

The reciprocal link function in exponential regression doesn't constrain to positive values, whilst on the other hand it does thoroughly space out points close to zero when fitting the linear predictor. (a) Regarding the lack of constraint of results to non-negative predictions, my thinking is that, as long as we choose an initial trial parameter vector that results in a non-negative linear predictor, the chances of ending up with negative predictions is negligible since the sheer number of points in the neighbourhood of zero will make the predictions very accurate in that region. (b) I am not clear as to how transforming values close to zero to be spread out over the range of the reciprocal function makes the regression more successful. I can see that it reduces leverage compared with an ordinary regression to fit the means, but is there something deeper connected with it being easier to fit a linear function to points that are reasonably far apart? I was wondering how that reasoning sat with more seasoned modellers of exponential regression, and keen to get some more understanding around what makes a good link function over and above that it constrains predictions to appropriate values. Thanks, Marko
