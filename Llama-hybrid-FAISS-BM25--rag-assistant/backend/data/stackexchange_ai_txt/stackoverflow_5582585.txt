Openlayers and catching drag event

Im using OpenLayers and i need to be able to tell difference between when map has been moved by my own scrip or by user. Yeah im aware that i can use moveend. But it also triggers when the same script is moving or repositioning map based on incoming data from ajax calls. So moveend or other map events wont work. I did some googling and found OpenLayers.Hander.Drag. But all that i managed with it was to stop users from dragging map. My script: this.dragger = new OpenLayers.Handler.Drag('',{ 'dragStart': function(evt){ this.userdragged = true; console.log('drag'); }},{ 'map':this.mymap }); this.dragger.activate(); As you can see, i tried to set userdragged variable to true to use this same variable in moveend event later. Unfortunately all this did was to stop my map from beeing draggable. Can someone assist me please? Alan
