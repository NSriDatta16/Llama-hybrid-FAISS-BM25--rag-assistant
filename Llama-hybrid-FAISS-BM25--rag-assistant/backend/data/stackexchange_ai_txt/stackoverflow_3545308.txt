This all depends on the framework you are using. Well if you ask me its possible to develop entire framework in ur fav OOP language say either C++ or Java or Python. Let me say how. if my Test script contains only the following script While Environment.value("Statement") <> "" Execute Environment.value("Statement") Wend You need to control the environment varialbe from outside using QuickTest API. So when you run the test it runs in an infite loop checking the value of the environment value. Now with the help of a ur fav C++ lang, u had set the environment variable value to "Browser("Google").Page("Google").WebEdit("SearchField").Set 'hello' " this value gets reflected in QTP test and executes the statement. Hence its very much possible to develop you entire framework in java or C++. As i said it all depends on the framework ur organisation is using.
