Microsoft SDK Version

The error I am getting is here: #if defined( _WIN32 ) #ifndef WIN32 #error error // error calls here #endif I wrote a program in MS VS2008 that works fine, however when I transfer it over and compile it in MS VS2010, I get a bunch of errors. Some header files and libraries I include are as follows: #include stdlib.h #include stdio.h #include stdlib.h #include io.h #include math.h #include mmsystem.h #include iostream #pragma comment(lib, "winmm.lib") #pragma comment(lib, "odbc32.lib") #pragma comment(lib, "odbccp32.lib") Now, I think the problem is this. In VS2008, when I right click on mmsystem.h and say "open containing folder", it points me to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include Whereas in in VS2010 when I do this it points me to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include Could this be the source of the errors, and How could I make VS2010 point me to v6.0A\Include rather than v7.0A\Include ? Thanks
