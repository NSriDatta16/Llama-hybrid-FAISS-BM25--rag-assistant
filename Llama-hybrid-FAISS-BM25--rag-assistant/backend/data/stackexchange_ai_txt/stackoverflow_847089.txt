I'm not sure if you even have control over this behaviour. If there is no immediate solution, an alternative would be to create a drag-handle for the div container. So you move the entire div by dragging the handle, and only the handle is sensitive to the drag-action (just like with most Windows forms, you can move an entire window by dragging its title bar).
