One that is common in everyday language: average To the average person out there (bitter irony fully intended), the mean, median, mode and expected value of anything seem to be the same. They have a natural tendency to do a point estimation, with the unconscious and unassailable assumption that there is an underlying normal distribution. And the equally unconscious assumption of a very small variance. The belief that such an estimation 1) exists and 2) will be very useful for them, because they can take it as a practically certain predictor, is so ingrained, that it is basically impossible to convince them otherwise. For a real-world example, try to talk to a cook who is asking "what is the average size potato", absolutely certain that if you tell him a number, he will be able to use this one for any recipe which specifies a number of potatoes, and have it come out perfect every time. And getting angry at you for trying to tell him "there is no such number". Sadly, it happens in situations with much higher stakes than making soup.
