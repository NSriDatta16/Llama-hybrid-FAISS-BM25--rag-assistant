Okay, this one doesn't fit all your requirements, but I think, it's worth a look: http://dynamicaspects.sourceforge.net/ Positives No dependencies except needs java 1.5 due to using the JavaAgent No XML markup needed and just works with POJO classes Tried myself and found it very easy to use (not very complex) Negatives No more activly maintained afaik Poor documentation You cannot do everything a full fledged AOP framework allows you to do I tested it out some time ago and was pretty impressed but found some glitches which I don't remember right now.
