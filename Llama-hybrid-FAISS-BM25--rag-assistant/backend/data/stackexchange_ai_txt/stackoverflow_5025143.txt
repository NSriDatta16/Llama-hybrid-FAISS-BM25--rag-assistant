Crazy Font Issue with NSTextView

I'm knee deep in font metrics with NSTextView at the moment. I was hoping a developer here could shed some light as to what's going on. With Myriad Pro in a default NSTextView (dragged from IB and run in a fresh project), here's what you get: Notice how the selected rect has the same height as the insertion point. Now for behavior from Pages: Notice how the selected rect is similar to the regular text view version, but the insertion point height is actually more reflective of the font (and smaller!). Weird. Why do I care? Here is a screen of my application with Helvetica, and then with Myriad: Notice that in both cases, the outline symbol is perfectly centered with the insertion point height. Those symbols are actually subviews, and not in the text stream. Notice those symbols in Pages. They remain centered for Myriad. Clearly Apple realized something and fixed it. Any ideas what they did? Thanks!
