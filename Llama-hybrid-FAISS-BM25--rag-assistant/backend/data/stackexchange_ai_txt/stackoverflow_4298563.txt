Not everything needs to fit to a clever pattern. There are few more elegant ways to express a long series of imperative statements than as, well, a long series of imperative statements. If there are certain kinds of flexibility you feel you are currently lacking, express them, and we can try to propose solutions. If there are certain clusters of actions and results that are re-used often, you could pull them out into new functions and build "aggregate" actions from them. You could look in to dataflow languages and libraries, but I expect the gain to be small.
