P1, P2, and P3 evidently represent the fraction of 3 different ancestries represented in the individuals' chromosomes. If you are sure that P1 + P2 + P3 = 1 (that is, there are no other ancestries), then you should only include two of the three in your model, say P1 and P2. If you don't transform the proportions, the intercept in your model will represent the situation when P1 = P2 = 0, which is equivalent to P3 = 1. So you don't lose any information this way. The proportions might work OK as predictors; from this perspective it doesn't really matter whether you are doing linear or logistic regression. There is a danger (as with any continuous predictor), however, that the assumption of linearity (in logistic regression, of the log-odds) with respect to the proportions as predictors won't hold. In that case you may need to try some transformation of the proportions to come closer to linearity. See this page and this page for some discussion of transforming proportions used as predictors. The simple explanation of the intercept in the logistic regression, however, won't hold; it will be the situation when the transformed values of P1 and P2 are both 0.
