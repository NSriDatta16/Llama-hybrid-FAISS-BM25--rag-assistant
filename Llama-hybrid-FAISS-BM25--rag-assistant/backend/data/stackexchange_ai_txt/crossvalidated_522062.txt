How to optimise penalty parameter in ridge regression using AIC

So I know for a ridge regression model, we need to find an optimal $\lambda$ value. I also know that we can achieve this by finding an optimal AIC value, that is, we find the $\lambda$ value that minimises the AIC. The AIC is defined as follows, $AIC = n\ln(\frac{SS_{res}}{n}) + 2p$ Where p is the effective degree of freedom, $p = tr(\hat H) = tr(X(X^TX+\lambda I)^{-1}X)$ Combined, we get a function for AIC in terms of $\lambda$ . $AIC = n\ln(\frac{SS_{res}}{n}) + 2tr(X(X^TX+\lambda I)^{-1}X^T)$ Now, this is where my confusion starts. The first term is free of $\lambda$ , therefore it is a constant. The second term seems like it's not a quadratic equation (or any polynomial). I tried plotting this in R. x For simplicity, I put an arbitrary constant for the first term. If you run the code with any X value, you can see that the graph is strictly decreasing, hence there's no optimal AIC. The questions are: Is $tr(X(X^TX+\lambda I)^{-1}X)$ in any way quadratic (or a polynomial)? If yes, what seems to be wrong with the code fragment? If no, is there something wrong with my understanding of $\lambda$ and AIC?
