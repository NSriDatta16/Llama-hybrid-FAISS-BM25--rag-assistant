Modelling in the presence of multiple cointegrating relationships

I am looking for some clarification regarding multivariable cointegration and what steps I should take to avoid spurious regressions. I am analysing a time series $y$ as a function of independent variables $\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$ etc. Let's say, for example, that I test all the series for stationarity. Importantly, $y$ and $d$, $e$, $f$ are I(1) (nonstationary), $a$, $b$, $c$ are I(0) (stationary). I know that I should therefore avoid spurious regressions by testing for cointegration between the variables. Given this set up, my questions are: If I find that $d$, $e$ and $f$ are cointegrated with each other by a linear combination, should I combine them into a new stationary variable? Can I use this variable in my regression analysis? Would I lose any long term information doing this? What is the best way to deal with this scenario? What if $y$ (the dependent outcome variable) is cointegrated with any of $d$, $e$, $f$? What does this mean and how should I proceed with the regression analysis? What if there are multiple cointegrated relationships between multiple variables? $(d,f)$ is cointegrated, and $(e,f)$? What is the best way to deal with this? Basically, I want to make sure that my correlations between $y$ and $\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$ are not spurious. I am a bit confused about the implications of cointegration when there are multiple variables.
