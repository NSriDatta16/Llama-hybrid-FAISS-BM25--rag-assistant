Interpretation of the test of two proportions. There should be no difficulty interpreting the result of prop.test (suggested by @user2974951): The two sample proportions are $58/164=0.354$ and $113/280=0.404,$ as shown at the end of the output. Also, the P-value of the test is $0.35>0.05$ so your proportions are not significantly different at the 5% level. Looking at confidence intervals. If you need additional analyses to be satisfied that there is no significant difference, I suggest you look at Agresti-Coull CI's for the two population proportions. [This slight modification of the traditional confidence interval, has been shown to have better coverage probability.] With $X$ successes in $n$ trials, let $\check p = \frac{X+2}{n+4}.$ Then the 95% CI is of the form $$\check p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\check p(1-\check p)}{n+4}}.$$ For the first case the CI is $(.285,.430)$ and for the second the CI is $(.348,.462).$ These two CIs overlap massively, illustrating again that there is no significant difference. Power analysis. In order to get a test that can successfully distinguish between population probabilities $.35$ and $.40$ about $n=2000$ observations on each are required, as the following power analysis from Minitab shows. So with sample sizes around 200 you're very far from an adequate sample size to distinguish between the two methods; that is, to have probability 0.90 or 0.95 of rejecting $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ against the alternative $H_a: p_1 when $p_1 \le .35$ and $p_2 = .40.$ In public opinion polling to predict an election, where two candidates may each have about half of the vote, one must interview about $2500$ subjects to predict individual candidates' support within $\pm 0.02;$ about $1100$ for $\pm 0.03.$
