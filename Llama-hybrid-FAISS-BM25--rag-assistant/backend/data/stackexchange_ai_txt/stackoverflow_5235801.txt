hmmm by using a MovieClip instead of a Shape. a MovieClip also has a Graphics object. import flash.display.MovieClip ; //import flash.display.Graphics;//not needed //stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, startAnim); //remove enterframe //function startAnim(e:Event):void { //no need for a handler var shape1:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); shape1.graphics.beginFill(0x333333,1); shape1.graphics.drawRect(40,50,250,125); shape1.graphics.endFill(); addChild(shape1); // this will add a MovieClip of rectangle to stage shape1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, dragShape); function dragShape(E:MouseEvent) { shape1.startDrag() } shape1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dropShape); function dropShape(E:MouseEvent) { shape1.stopDrag() } //} no need for that either :) beware that, as such, your function is called on ENTER_FRAME = 25 or more times per second, therefore you'll create and add a clip to stage 25 or more times per second + the reference is created locally, in the function, so you won't be able to access "shape1" from outside, once your object is created.
