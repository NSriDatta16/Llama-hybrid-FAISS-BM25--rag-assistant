I have written an OpenGL-based map view and it's bloody awesome if I say so myself. Sadly it's for a commercial project so I can't offer code. I can however tell you that it has 1 rendering thread, a pool of 8 tile downloading threads, and (most pertinent to your question) 1 storage thread that loads and saves tiles to the NAND flash or the SD card. Rendering is done one tile at a time, each tile being 2 triangles (there are no quads in ES). It's still blisteringly quick.
