Growth models in R - predictions - Bayesian or not Bayesian?

This is my first question here. I am currently working on (nonlinear) growth models using the FSA package in R . I compared several models. According to AIC the logistic model performed best. Now I'd like to predict age from size. First I thought that I simply could solve the equation for age using the parameters obtained with the growth models - but then there arise problems with logs of negative arguments for large specimens since Linf is the mean asymptotic length -> error. Through an internet search I found this article ( http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2981/wlb.00185 ) where the authors follow a similar path but then use a Bayesian approach to predict age from (eye lens) weight - confirming my doubts. Now I need your advice: 1) Am I correct that my first idea is not working? Or what am I doing wrong? 2) If so - I'd be grateful for advise how to get started with Bayesian methods. This is a completely new field for me. Here is my R code and data: require(FSA) age The model in FSA is: size = $\frac{Linf}{1 + e^{(-gninf * (age - ti)))}}$ with Linf = mean assymptotic length; gninf = instantaneous growth rate at negative infinity; ti = age at inflection point which I solved to: age = ti + $\frac{log(Linf/size)-1}{-gninf}$
