Two notes: most unit test frameworks offer the possibility to organize your tests into suites, thus you can run only specific tests. you should consider reconfiguring logging in unit tests so that no logs are produced. Unit test output should be the simplest possible, to avoid drowning your focus into useless details. I.e. if all tests pass, the only output you should see is something like "123 tests passed." or if there are errors, the names of the failing test(s) and the relevant error messages.
