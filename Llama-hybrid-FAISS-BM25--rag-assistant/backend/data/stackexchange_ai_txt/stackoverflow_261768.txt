Off the top of my head I can think of two things that might help you (depending on what it is exactly that you're trying to achieve): If you just want to display an image you've embedded, you can add an Image component to the stage and set the value of its source as the graphical asset ( Class ) that you're embedding: [Bindable] [Embed(source="assets/image.png")] private var MyGfx:Class; myImage.source = MyGfx; If you actually want to draw a bitmap onto a Graphics object, you can do this with the beginBitmapFill() method: [Bindable] [Embed(source="assets/image.png")] private var MyGfx:Class; var myBitmap:BitmapData = new MyGfx().bitmapData; myGraphics.beginBitmapFill(myBitmap); myGraphics.endFill(); You might find the Flex Quick Starts articles on Adobe's site useful, especially the "Embedding Assets" section.
