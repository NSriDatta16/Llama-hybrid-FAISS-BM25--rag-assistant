If all you know is that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, you can't do better than binary search with its guaranteed O(log N) performance (as pointed out by other posters). If you can assume a reasonably uniform distribution of numbers in the array, then interpolation search can give O(log log N) performance in the average case, which is better than binary search. (However, in the worst case - an array with exponential growth - it's O(N) ).
