The NoSQL movement is aimed at huge scale systems, at sizes where the relational model truly breaks. Before you start writing your own storage I highly recommend understanding the relational model, as is one of the best documented and well understood domains in CS. Start with the Gray's and Reuter's Transaction Processing , this book explains everything there is to know about implementing a classic RDBMS. Next on your list should be the Readings in Database Systems , this is a collection of the most relevant scientific papers and articles.
