This is described by Diaconis (1988; see also Diaconis and Freedman, 1980): In 1938 de Finetti broaden the concept of exchangeability. Consider first the special case with two observations $X_1,X_2,\dots;Y_1,Y_2,\dots$. The $X_i$ might represent binary outcomes for a group of men and $Y_i$ might represent binary outcomes for a group of women. If it were judged that the observable covariate men/women did not matter, all of the variables would be judged exchangeable. Often, the covariate is judged as potentially meaningful, the $X_i$'s are judged exchangeable between themselves and the $Y_i$'s are judged exchangeable between themselves. Mathematically, the joint law must be invariant under permutations within the $X$'s and $Y$'s: $$ \mathcal{L}(X_1,\dots,X_n;Y_1,\dots,Y_m) = \mathcal{L}(X_{\pi(1)},\dots,X_{\pi(n)};Y_{\sigma(1)},\dots,Y_{\sigma(m)}) $$ This must hold for all $n$ and $m$, and permutations $\pi$ and $\sigma$. You could check as well the original paper by de Finetti (1938) for discussion and multiple examples as he has very light and clear style of writing, what makes his papers easy to read. Diaconis, P.
