Reading parts of binary data in a string in Python

When you use the .read(n) method on a file object in python you get n amount of bytes back. What if I first load a file in a string, is there some function that lets me do the same thing? Because I guess it's not as easy filestring[0:5], because of different types of encoding. (And I don't really want to pay attention to that, the file read can be a text file in any format or a binary file)
