You might want to check out Nose and the Xunit output plugin . You can have it run your unit tests, and coverage checks with this command: nosetests --with-xunit --enable-cover That'll be helpful if you want to go the Jenkins route, or if you want to use another CI server that has support for JUnit test reporting. Similarly you can capture the output of pylint using the violations plugin for Jenkins
