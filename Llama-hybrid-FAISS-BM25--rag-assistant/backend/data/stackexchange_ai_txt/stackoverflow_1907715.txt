How to use NSUndoManager with a UIImageView or CGContext

I have an app that uses cgcontext to draw things onto a UIImageView that the user draws using touch events, and I want to be able to undo the drawings made by the user. Edit: I am trying to use my touchesBegan to save theUIImage at the begining of a touch to the NSUndoManager And then how do I use it to undo using a UIAlertView. Meaning, I want to call a method from my UIAlertView that undo's then another that will redo, but I don't know how to accomplish this. Please help
