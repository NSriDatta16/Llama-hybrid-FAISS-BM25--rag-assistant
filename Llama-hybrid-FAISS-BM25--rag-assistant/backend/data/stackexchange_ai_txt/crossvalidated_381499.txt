Odds ratio but for linear regression

I have a linear regression model that predicts lifetime customer value. It has coefficients that tell me things like, if the customer is a VIP then they have +$100 value. However if i know that these coefficients actually add to values in more of a percentage way than absolute value, then how can i get an estimate of these percentages? A bit like the odds ratio in logistic regression. Perhaps i shouldn't be using linear regression to understand these features? Any thoughts in how I can understand the percentage value increase of customer value for these features?
