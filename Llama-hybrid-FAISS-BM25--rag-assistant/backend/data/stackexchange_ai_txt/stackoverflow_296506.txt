Cobertura seemed to be able to do the job for us. Once the unit tests were running (a question all to itself), I was able to: instrument the bundles as standalone Jars. re-run the unit tests with a cobertura on the parent class loader class path. The trick here is to use osgi.parentClassloader=app in the config.ini file used to run the unit test. ext == Java extensions boot == the boot class loader (default) fwk == framework? app == application, i.e. just like a normal application, with a classpath specified on the command line. The instrumented code needed runtime access to the cobertura jar, so this last step was imperative.
