Like most things, it depends. If this is something that will make a server side request, then storing it in the session global would be completely acceptable. If it's not, then you would need to find some other method of storing it client side. These would include things like storing it in javascript (only available the page's life), a cookie (like you mentioned) or like Bryan Downing mentioned with local storage. Local storage doesn't have good browser support yet.
