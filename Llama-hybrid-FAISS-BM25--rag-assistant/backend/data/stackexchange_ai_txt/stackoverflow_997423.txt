Yes you can do this, by redesigning the outlook Message form in Tools > Forms > Design a Form . There you can select the Message Form and buttons to the message form. You will have to write some VBA or assign and action on the click event to do your secure send or insert you service URL etc. You can the save and publish the form. User can then select the new "Secure" Message form or you can overwrite the default form in your organisation so that every time a user select new mail they use the form. Overwrite a default forms: Form Design Example: Also there are many addins for outlook that secure email: VSTO may also be a way to go, if you design an addin that added a toolbar to the inspector (mail) window that inserted your url to your secure service say via small winform that looked up that patient by name id etc. (there are loads of examples on the net for this) Marcus
