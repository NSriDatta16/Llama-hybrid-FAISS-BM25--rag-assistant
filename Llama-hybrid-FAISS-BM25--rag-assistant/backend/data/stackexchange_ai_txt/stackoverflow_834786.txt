You should be able to do this if your Controller2 class is a subclass of NSControl . NSControl defines a "sent action" which is what you are connecting to your target object when you drag from NSButton in Interface Builder. That being said, there is (was?) a bug in IB 3.0 that prevented the sent action from showing up in IB. See this cocoa-dev thread for details.
