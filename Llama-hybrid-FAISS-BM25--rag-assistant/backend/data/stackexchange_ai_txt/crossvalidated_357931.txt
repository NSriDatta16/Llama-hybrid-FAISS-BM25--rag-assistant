Should I balance my training dataset for an employee attrition analysis in machine learning?

I need to perform an analysis on employee attrition using Machine Learning algorithms. I intend to do both Supervised Learning analysis ( classification ) and Unsupervised Learning analysis (pattern detection) on the data set. My data set is a list of all employees (actual and leavers) from the past 3 years. The original data set contain around 70% actual employees and 30% leavers. I am confused about how to split my data set for the training set. Should it be equally balanced between actual employees and leavers for the Supervised Learning problem? And should I care about giving this same treatment to the training set when running the Unsupervised Learning algorithm? I have gone through the following post but I am still confused: When should I balance classes in a training data set?
