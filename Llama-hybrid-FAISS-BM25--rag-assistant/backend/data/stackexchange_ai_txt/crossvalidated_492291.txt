What does it mean that a dataset is "biased"?

What does it mean when people within the field of Machine Learning talk about biased datasets? I thought it was only estimators that could be biased. In documenting work I have done, I am being asked: "All datasets are biased in some way. How is your dataset biased?" I have no clue what they mean. Also my dataset is population data so I have a hard time interpreting it as sample selection problem ... The objective of the analysis is primarily descriptive. I will construct three indeces and combining them. The three indeces are 1) Housing price index, 2) Transportation time index and 3) Wage index. I know, that even with population data there is a sample selection problem for the housing prices - because not all houses are traded every year and the subsample that are traded are most likely not a random sample of the total stock of housing. I am not generalizing beyond the time period for which I have data which is a 30-year period.
