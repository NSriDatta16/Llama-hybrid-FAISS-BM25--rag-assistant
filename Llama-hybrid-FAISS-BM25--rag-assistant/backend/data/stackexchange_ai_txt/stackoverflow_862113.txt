By browser: Firefox there is a plug in module called Firebug. It is easy to install and very powerful. It is even better when combined with 'Web Developer' for Firefox. Internet Explorer has a Developer Toolbar, which is not as good as Firebug but good enough to check things still work in IE. Additionally there is a tool called IE DOM inspector. There is also a version of Firebug for IE caled Firebug Lite. Google Chrome comes with built in tools similar to Firebug. See the 'tools->developer' option in the pull down menu to the right of the address bar. This allows you to see the css rules used by each element. It also has Javascript debugging support. Safari uses a tool called Web Inspector. Opera has a built-in utility called Dragonfly.
