Getting Reference to Calling Activity from AsyncTask (NOT as an inner class)

Is it at all possible, from within an AsyncTask that is NOT an inner class of the calling Activity class, to get a reference to the instance of Activity that initiated execution of the AsyncTask? I am aware of this thread , however it doesn't exactly address how to reference the calling Activity. Some suggest passing a reference to the Activity as a parameter to the AsyncTask constructor, however, it's reported that doing so will always result in a NullPointerException. So, I'm at a loss. My AsyncTask provides robust functionality, and I don't want to have to duplicate it as an inner class in every Activity that wants to use it. There must be an elegant solution.
