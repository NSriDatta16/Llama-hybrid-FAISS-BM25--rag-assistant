A good friend of mine calls this tendency of textbooks to have unrealistic examples 'frictionless statistics'. The phrase comes from high school physics books that start every problem with something like "Assuming that there is no friction...". (@Glen_b's spherical cow is equivalent and maybe more amusing.) The answer to the titular question seems obvious: it makes things easy for the textbook author and for the instructors who might choose the book as a course text. I agree strongly with @GrahamWright's second paragraph. I think that one reason for that is that the most fruitful application of statistics to real-world problems requires more understanding of the particulars of the problem, the inferential objectives, loss functions relating to incorrect inferences, and probably many other contextual factors. The questions are mostly posted without any of those details —perhaps because those details are routinely ignored in textbooks— but there is nothing to prevent the answerers from asking for them, or writing about their possible consequences. A textbook that included all of the context and considerations needed to form scientific inferences about the real world assisted by statistical analyses would be a rich and interesting read. However, it would not have space to cover the many topics that are considered to be essential for an introductory statistics course. In other words, such a book would fail to check a sufficient number of recipe checkboxes.
