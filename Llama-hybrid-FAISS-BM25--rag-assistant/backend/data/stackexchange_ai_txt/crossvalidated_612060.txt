How to analyse averaged data (when raw data is not available)

I need to analyse the results of a messaging trial where the value of interest the the click through rate (CTR) on social media ads. I tested 8 ads and a control and I have the CTR for each one (e.g. message one had a CTR of 1%, message two had a CTR of 2%). The issue is I don't know if just using an ANOVA will be ok because I literally just have nine figures (the CTRs) and not a full dataset with multiple rows that the ANOVA would use to take an average and then compare that average to see if there is a statistically significant difference. Can anyone weigh in on how I can understand whether there is a difference between my groups?
