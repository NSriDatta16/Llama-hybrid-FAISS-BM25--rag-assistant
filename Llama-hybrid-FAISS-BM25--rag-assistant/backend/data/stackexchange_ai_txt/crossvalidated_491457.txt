In Bayesian statistics we condition upon the observed data. The Bayesian part of your statement means that the data are known (and hence fixed to known values) and that the parameters are unknown (and hence allowed to vary and take on any plausible values). In frequentist statistics, on the other hand, we compare the observed data to data that could have been observed. So we consider all sorts of hypothetical data (the data isnâ€™t fixed). The fact that the parameters are fixed is a bit more nuanced. But essentially means that the results are not and do not use probability distributions for the unknown parameters. The frequentist results reduce to statements that assume specific values of the parameters or that are true for any assumed values. E.g., confidence intervals would reject the true parameters (whatever they are assumed to be) at a pre-specified rate.
