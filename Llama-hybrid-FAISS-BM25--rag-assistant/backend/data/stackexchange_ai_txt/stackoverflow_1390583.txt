Tomcat is JBoss's servlet engine, so you'll be using Tomcat regardless. I would go for JBoss in your case. It already come with Hibernate, saving you the need to bundle Hibernate in your application. JBoss comes pre-configured with multiple different profiles, so you can pick the profile that does what you need without having much in the way of baggage (i.e. you can safely ignore all the heavy JavaEE stuff). Equally, if your application need to start using more JavaEE stuff (e.g. web services, EJB3), you can easily bring those JBoss services in. Incidentally, you might want to look at GraniteDS as an alternative to BlazeDS, it seems to be a better piece of software.
