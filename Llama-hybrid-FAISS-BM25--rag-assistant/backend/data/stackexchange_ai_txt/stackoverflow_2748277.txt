Lets be pragmatic. Flash will be still alive for some time, at least years, because this kind of technology is too used today to be changed in a short time. Now, as AS3/Flex is not very hard to understand and use, maybe you should learn about both , one at a time, but both in the end. If you don't have time to learn both (even one after each other), choose the one that seem more suited to your current projects. Be pragmatic. Because HTML5 will still be a standard and widely used language/platform. It's different from flash (that is more like a cross-platform graphics-oriented engine) but all versions of future websites will exploit it.
