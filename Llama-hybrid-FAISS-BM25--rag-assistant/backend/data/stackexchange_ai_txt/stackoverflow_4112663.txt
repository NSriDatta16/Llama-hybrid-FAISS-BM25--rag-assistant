In every browser I tested (Chrome, FF and IE) no, not even when wrapped in a parent element that has the cursor property. Probably for security reasons, to preempt shenanigans with custom cursors or empty cursors or whatever. You could put a transparent DIV on it and give that the cursor property, but then the input field won't be clickable any more, of course.
