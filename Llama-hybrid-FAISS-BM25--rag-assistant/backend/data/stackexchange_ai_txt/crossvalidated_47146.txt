"Intervals" for a scale-based answer

I have to analyse data that look at the relevance of some posts. Basically each post is rated by 100 persons, and the scale looks something like this (like a Likert scale): Irrelevant Slightly relevant Relevant Useful Extremely Useful But each person can choose a certain position with a 0.25 increment on this scale. So, more specifically, the scale looks like this [1, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25,...3,...4,...,4.75,5] I was asked to compute some intervals for each post. My first reaction was to compute the mean and the 95% CI, which is evidently wrong since the data is not normally distributed. Which is the best approach for this problem, where should I start looking? I read something about Bayesian Approach on this site, will that do? Thanks
