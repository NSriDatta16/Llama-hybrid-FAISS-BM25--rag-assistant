It boils down to how you feel about assuming the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) as an assumption about choice behaviour. So the first thing to do is look that up. Multinomial logit assumes IIA and multinomial probit does not. The computational price of not assuming it is what gets expensive. Almost any econometrics text will cover the details, but assuming you already understand logistic regression, the intuitive picture is this: In latent variable formulation, logistic regression models need to integrate over a latent distribution to get the probability of a 1 rather than a 0. In choice modelling contexts this is thought of as the expected utility of choosing 1 rather than 0, although we only see the final (stochastic) choice. A similar situation arises when there are multiple choices. If we are happy to assume IIA, that is: that a third choice does not affect your relative preferences over two existing choices, then the integrals are separable and straightforward. If you are not happy to assume IIA (and that can be reasonable when the new choice is a plausible substitute for one of the existing ones) then you will have to estimate an arbitrary (unobserved) covariance structure over all the options and then do the multidimensional integrations to get your choice probabilities out. It is these integrations or replacements for them that cause the computational problem.
