Yes, a posterior is a statistic. As you point out a statistic is any function of the data and the posterior is a function of the data and thus a statistic. Yes, Bayesians use the notion of statistic but typically not describing the posterior as a statistic. We are certainly interested in sufficient statistics since a posterior, i.e. a distribution for a parameter given the data, is equivalent to the conditional distribution of the parameter given a sufficient statistic. Yes it is technically correct and it is moral. You could even look at the sampling distribution of the posterior to understand properties of the posterior over different realizations of the data. Efron does this in this manuscript .
