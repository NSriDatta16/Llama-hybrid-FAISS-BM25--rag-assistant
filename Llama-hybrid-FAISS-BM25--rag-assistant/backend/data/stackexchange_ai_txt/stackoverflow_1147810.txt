Under RFC2616, "POST" is not an idempotent method, which means that the browser will not resend the request unless the user confirms that resend. So, to prevent the prompt, you must ensure that the CLIENT caches the page. To do so, use the Cache Control header: http://www.fiddler2.com/redir/?id=httpperf and ensure that you are not sending back any Vary or Pragma: no-cache headers: http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/06/17/9769915.aspx It would be helpful for you to capture your HTTP POST's response headers (e.g. with Fiddler) and update your question with them.
