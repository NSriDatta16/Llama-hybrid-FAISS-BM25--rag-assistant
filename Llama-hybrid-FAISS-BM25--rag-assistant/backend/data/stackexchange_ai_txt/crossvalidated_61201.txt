Why is k called representer of evaluation in the definition of kernel functions

Why is $k$ called representor of evaluation ? From the book "Learning with kernels" by Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf we have the following lines (page 33): $\langle k(.,x),f\rangle = f(x)$, in particular $\langle k(.,x), k(.,x')\rangle = k(x,x')$ According to the book this interesting property of $\phi$ follows from definition. How? I am unable to understand this and this is crucial for understanding the concept of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces . Any help appreciated. Luckily, the part of the book which needs to be referred i.e. section 2.2.2 (starts on page 32) is a part of the preview in Google books . Also note that this section is independent of other sections.
