Can it (a map), and a linked list be written as a tree? Maps are usually represented with arrays. To determine where an entry goes in a map, you need to compute its key . Look here for a better explanation. Trees (with an undetermined number of nodes) can be implemented using lists (see here for further discussion). Lists are not usually implemented as trees. I'd encourage you to get this book which is a classic on data structures and will give you alot of really great information.
