When you execute your java program are you running it as the same 'user' as when you run the command-line checks? EDIT : Try copying the file to the directory where you run your program from and see if it is able to read it. You can also try the following after copying the file to your execution directory: InputStream in = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/gameTheoryAgentConfiguration.properties"); configuration.load(in); (assuming you have "." in your classpath)
