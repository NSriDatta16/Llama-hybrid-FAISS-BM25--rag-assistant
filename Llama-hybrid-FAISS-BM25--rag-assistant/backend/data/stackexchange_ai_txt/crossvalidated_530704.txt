What kind of machine learning models fit data of this kind?

I have been working with a manufacturing process. It would be very efficient to build a machine learning model for the kind of data that I have. So, my dataset has typically three inputs. VAl_1 VAl_2 Val_3 8 1 1 10 2 2 12 3 3 14 4 1 VAL_1 can be from 8 to 12 and it is a continuous variable. VAL_2 is a number from 1 to 4. (not continuous) VAL_3 is a number from 1 to 3. (not continuous) The output is like a function $y = f(x)$ , where $x$ is a continuous value in the range $(0,1)$ For example, a sample row of my dataset is as follows: VAl_1 VAl_2 Val_3 y(0) y(0.2) y(0.4) y(0.6) y(0.8) y(1.0) 8 1 1 0.00025 0.0856 0.8946 0.00524 0.872 0.5242 I want to build a model that predicts y(x) given VAL_1, VAL_2, VAL_3 How to deal with features that are both continuous and not continuous in the same model? Any ideas or thoughts on how I should proceed with such a dataset would be greatly appreciated. I did try the following: Normalized VAL_1. I tried encoding features VAL_2, VAL_3. Normalized the values of y(x). Tried to fit linear regression, polynomial regression models. But the value of R_square is around 68%. Are there any better ways to improve the model?
