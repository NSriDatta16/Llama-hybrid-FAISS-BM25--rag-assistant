To my knowledge, if you assign a probability to your belief, the bayesian updating rule is the only way to act upon new datas in a consistent manner in line with probabilities. You might have two reasons to leave the bayesian framework : You don't want to assign probabilities to a belief. You don't have (or don't want to specify) an alternative belief. One (amongst other) alternative to Bayesian Inference is the framework of N ull H ypothesis S tatistical T esting (NHST) framework to eventually reject your hypothesis. One could argue that rejecting a belief is a hard form of updating. You do not mention in your question an alternative hypothesis. If your belief has some degree of freedom, this is a special case. There is no straight answer of how to judge which model is the best as different criteria coexist. There is a bayesian way to act ( Bayesian Information Criterion ), but also others (the field is known as model selection ). I don't know if and how a belief can be updated in this case.
