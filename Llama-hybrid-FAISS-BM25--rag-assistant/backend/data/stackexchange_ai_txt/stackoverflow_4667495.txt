Architecture and patterns for cash collection terminals

I have just been handed a huge project for an application that must run on a terminal that securely collects cash drops. It is a rewrite of an existing project, so requirements are pretty well defined, this is the product . Although my employer will supply me most application specific new requirements, I would like some general advice on architectural aspects and areas that I should pay attention to in order to ensure maximum quality for my rewrite. The application will run on XP Embedded. Hopefully folk who have written such applications can maybe advise me on areas to focus on.
