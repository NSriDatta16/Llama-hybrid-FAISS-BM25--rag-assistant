Desktop application DB

I my quest to develop a cross platform application I have decided to use C++ with the wxWidgets for the programing language. Now I am facing a dilemma on what local storage solution should I use for a for this application. Any suggestions? Note: I am thinking of using SQLite, but I plan to store images in the DB and I am not sure if this solution will work. If the worse case scenario I can store the image as an XML file.
