Rohancragg's answer is good, but I'd encourage your urge to use a class name for control. You don't give HTML, but assuming there's a containing element around your label and checkbox, doing $("#content input[type='checkbox'], #content label").click(function(){ $(this).parent().toggleClass("selected"); }); (with #content just being some larger container they're all in, so you don't accidentally apply styles to things outside the area you're interested in) should work. Then in your CSS you can apply styles to several elements and not have to edit your jQuery just to change styles. .selected { background-color:blue; } .selected label { font-weight:bold; color:#ffffff; } and so on.
