Check the MIME-type the ‘file.ashx’ script is returning. If it's something other than application/pdf, or Content-Disposition is getting sent, there might be wrinkles. Otherwise, it can only be (a) something odd in the document — do other documents load OK? — or (b) your setup. In any case I would personally avoid ever embedding a PDF in a web page. A PDF plugin is a pretty inconvenient way to view a document, and the Adobe Reader plugin in particular is both historically awfully unreliable in IE, and also an ongoing security disaster. I'm advising all my clients to uninstall it ASAP.
