That is when you add contentEditable=true attribute to the parent of those paragraphs, select any text, even across paragraphs, then make the call document.execCommand('italic', false, null); and finally if desired set contentEditable attribute back to false. Btw, this works on IE too, except that to enter editable mode I think it is called designMode or something, google for it.
