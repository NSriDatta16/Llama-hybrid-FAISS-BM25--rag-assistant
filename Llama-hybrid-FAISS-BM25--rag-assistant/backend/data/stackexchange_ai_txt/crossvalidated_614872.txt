Constant terms in variational inference and lower bounds

I have a model for which the lower bound takes the following form $ \log p(x) \geq \mathbb{E}_{recog}[\log \frac{gen}{recog}] + \mathcal{c} $ where recog and gen denote the factorization in the recognition and generative models, respectively, and c is $ \mathcal{c} \propto \log(2), $ i.e., a constant term. Given that the optimization is over the family of variational densities, (I guess that) the constant term can be dropped. However, I cannot find any previous paper, or any other reference, where the lower bound has a constant term. At least not in the field of variational autoencoders. Does anyone know if it is usual to remove constant terms in the lower bound? ideally with a reference.
