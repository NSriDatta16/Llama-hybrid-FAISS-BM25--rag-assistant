In Skip-Gram model, what is the intuition of taking average of input word matrix and output word matrix?

In the skip-gram model, we have input word matrix $W$ , and output word matrix $W'$ . The final word embedding we got, is the average of $W$ and $W'$ . what is the intuition of taking average of $W$ and $W'$ ? Why should we do that?
