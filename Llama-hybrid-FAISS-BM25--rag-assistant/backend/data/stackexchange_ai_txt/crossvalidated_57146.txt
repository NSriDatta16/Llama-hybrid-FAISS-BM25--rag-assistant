See this Wikipedia article : For the case of a single parameter and data that can be summarized in a single sufficient statistic, it can be shown that the credible interval and the confidence interval will coincide if the unknown parameter is a location parameter (...) with a prior that is a uniform flat distribution (...) and also if the unknown parameter is a scale parameter (...) with a Jeffreys' prior. In fact, the reference points to Jaynes: Jaynes, E.T. (1976), Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals . In page 185 we can find: If case (I) arises (and it does more often than realized), the Bayesian and orthodox tests are going to lead us to exactly the same results and the same conclusion, with a verbal disagreement as whether we should use 'probability' or 'significance' to describe them. So, in fact there are similar cases, but I wouldn't say the statement in the image is truth if you are, for example, using a Cauchy distribution as likelihood...
