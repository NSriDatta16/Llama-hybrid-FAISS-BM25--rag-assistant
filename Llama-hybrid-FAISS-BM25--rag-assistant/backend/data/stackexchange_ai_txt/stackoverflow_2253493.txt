Powershell v1 - deleteing all files & folders except in a named folder

I want to delete all the content and the children of a given root folder, however i want to keep some files (the logs), which all reside in a logs folder What is the elegant way of doing this in powershell. Currently i am doing it in multile steps, surely this can be done easily... i have a feeling my oo-ness/language bias is getting in the way eg c:\temp c:\temp\logs c:\temp\logs\mylog.txt c:\temp\logs\myotherlog.log c:\temp\filea.txt c:\temp\fileb.txt c:\temp\folderA... c:\temp\folderB... after delete should just be c:\temp c:\temp\logs c:\temp\logs\mylog.txt c:\temp\logs\myotherlog.log this should be simple; i think 12:47am-itis is getting me... Thanks in advance RhysC
