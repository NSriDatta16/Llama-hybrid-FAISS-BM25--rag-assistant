Is there a standard way to Determine Sample Size when doing Bayesian Inference?

I am currently doing Bayesian Inference by using the BayesAB R library. I've observed that that sample size has a big impact on the posterior distribution. When doing Frequentist Hypothesis Testing it seems that everyone agrees on how to determine the minimum sample size required to observe a certain effect based on the power of the experiment. However, is this a valid approach when using Bayesian Inference? If not, is there something equivalent for Bayesian Hypothesis testing?
