This: {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31} Is just an array initializer. It doesn't itself create an array. The first example, when you assigned a string literal to a pointer, DID create those strings in static storage (hidden to you), and then just assigned the pointers to them. So basically, there is no way to initialize your char* with the array initializer. You need to create an actual array, and assign those numbers to it. You would have to do something like: char a[][] = { {32, 30, 0}, {34, 32, 33, 0} }; // illegal But that is illegal. You need to build the array separately and assign them into an array like your last example.
