You don't need modelling (logistic regression or mixture models) to establish a cut-off. Just compute a ROC curve of your data and it's going to give you cut-offs. To select only one cut-off specifically, use the methods described by Perkins & Schisterman or simply the Youden Index. Neil J. Perkins, Enrique F. Schisterman (2006) “The Inconsistency of "Optimal" Cutpoints Obtained using Two Criteria based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve”. American Journal of Epidemiology 163(7), 670–675. DOI: 10.1093/aje/kwj063 . W. J. Youden (1950) “Index for rating diagnostic tests”. Cancer, 3, 32–35. DOI: 10.1002/1097-0142(1950)3:1 3.0.CO;2-3 .
