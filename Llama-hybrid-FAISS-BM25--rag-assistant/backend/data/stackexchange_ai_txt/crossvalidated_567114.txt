Durbin and Koopman (2012) have a useful paragraph when it comes to missing observations. They differentiate between two cases: where all observations at time $t$ are missing and, where a subset of observations at time $t$ are missing. If we use the following set of equations: $$ \begin{align} y_t & = Z x_t + \varepsilon_t \qquad & \varepsilon_t \sim N(0, H) \\ x_{t+1} & = T x_t + \eta_t & \eta_t \sim N(0, Q) \end{align} $$ They suggest reducing the dimensions of the equation at any suitable time points $t$ by introducing a matrix $W_t$ whose rows are a subset of the rows of the identity matrix, so that $y_t^{*}$ only reflects the actual measurements. So essentially you get: $$ \begin{align} y_t^{*}= Z_t^{*}x_t + \epsilon_t^{*} \qquad & \epsilon_t \sim N(0, H^{*}) \\ \end{align} $$ where $$ \begin{align} y_t^{*}&=W_t y_t\\ Z_t^{*}&=W_t Z_t\\ \epsilon_t^{*}&=W_t\epsilon_t\\ H_t^{*}&= W_t H_t W_t^{T} \end{align} $$ Reference : Time series analysis by state space methods by Durbin, J., & Koopman, S.
