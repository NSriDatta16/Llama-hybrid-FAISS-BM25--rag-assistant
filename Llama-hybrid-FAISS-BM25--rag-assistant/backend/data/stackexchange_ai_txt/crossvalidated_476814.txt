4 time points is not necessarily a problem for handling autocorrelation. The lme function in the nlme package has several methods which may be appropriate such as corAR1 for fitting an AR(1) process Edit to adddress @whuber's comment: I can see why the question could seem a bit vague. I took it to mean that, in the context of a mixed effects model used for a longitudinal study, a number of participants say, $N$ , are measured 4 times each. Of course there are many more than 4 observations in total ( $4N$ obviously, if there are no missing data). I think that is where the OP was making a distinction. A single time series of length 4 would be hopelessly inadequate for estimating an AR(1) model, but with many participants, this is a common model to fit, either in a mixed model framework or an SEM (for example. latent growth curve models and extensions thereof) - at least it is common in lifecouse epidemiology where the previous measurement often has a large influence on the next measure, compared to the other covariates, even with just 4 time points. BMI is a good example of this. Perhaps the estimated AR(1) coefficient still does not have a desirable level of precision but I have seen such models where they offer an improved interpretation as well as a better fit. Without the AR(1) process in the model, the covariances between residuals at each time point can be unrealistic. I prefaced my answer with "not necessarily " because, of course it might be too few time points particularly if the level of autocorrlation is small (and hence my example in lifecourse epidemiology where it can be quite large). I may be able to find a toy dataset to illustrate this, if interested.
