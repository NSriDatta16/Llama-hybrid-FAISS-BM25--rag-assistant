I have plone.app.blob installed on some low-traffic sites and installable (ready to roll, if you like) for my busier production sites in the same instance. There's the 4.0 milestone but I'll certainly review (and probably click the install button for plone.app.blob on my production sites) around 3.4 time. A couple of references: http://n2.nabble.com/PLIPs-I%27d-love-to-see-for-Plone-3.3-tp1123218p1130015.html http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8629#comment:2 highlight â€¦ 3.4, when we'll probably have blob filestorage specification support added to plone.recipe.zeoserver and zope2instance. That will give us a standard location for whatever owner/permission fixups the installers need to make. In context: I'm playing roughly with plone.app.blob and a very mixed bag of other add-on products with versions 3.1.7 and 3.2a1 of Plone based on standard and experimental installers. In these environments, without me treating things with kid gloves, Plone sies behave remarkably well and when (as expected) experiments lead to oddities, the support from the community is paced and proper.
