PHP/MySQL - algorithm for "Top Rated"

So I just built a star-rating system and and trying to come up with an algorithm to list the "Top Rated" items. For simplicity, here are the columns: item_name average_rating (a decimal from 1 to 5) num_votes I'm trying to determine the "sweet spot" between number of votes and rating. For example... An item rated (4.6 / 20 votes) should be higher on the list than an item that's (5.0 / 2 votes) An item rated (2.5 / 100 votes) should be below an item that's (4.5 / 2 votes) So in other words, num_votes plays a factor in what's "Top". Anyone know of an algorithm that is pretty good at determining this "sweet spot"? Thanks in advance.
