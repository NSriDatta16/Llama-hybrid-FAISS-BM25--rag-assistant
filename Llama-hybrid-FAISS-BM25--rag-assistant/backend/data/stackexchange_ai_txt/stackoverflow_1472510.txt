Thank's for your answers. The error I was getting was The DataSourceID of 'controlname' must be the ID of a control of type IDataSource I was databinding as you suggested this.combobox.DataSource = userCollection; this.combobox.DataTextField = "Name"; this.combobox.DataValueField = "UserId"; this.combobox.DataBind(); But I figured out that the DataSourceID property had been set in the Designer View, so I removed that and everything began working normally :)
