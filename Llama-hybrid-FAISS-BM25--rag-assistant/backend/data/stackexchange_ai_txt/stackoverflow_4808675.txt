This lightbox alternative has a callback function so you can add events (including onload events I think) within the modal window. It's a great one, and lightweight: http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/ Note: You can handle the post a couple of ways. Option 1: Make an ajax callback api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ You would add this event on submit. Option 2: Call an iframe in colorbox (actually works elegantly)
