Is the odds ratio not a measure of effect size?

I have a question regarding the odds ratio. A paper that I submitted was sent back for revision after peer review. However, one of the authors asked a question that has left me quite confused. In this research, I reported the Adjusted Odds Ratios, 95% Confidence Interval, and P-value for a Logistic Regression Generalized Estimation Equation (Binomial) including more than two million people. Even though I provided the odds ratio as a metric of effect size, one reviewer commented that he could not find the effect size results of the table including >2,000,000 people. Am I off here? Is the odds ratio not a measure of effect size? I am having trouble understanding what the reviewer is requesting me to do. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated!
