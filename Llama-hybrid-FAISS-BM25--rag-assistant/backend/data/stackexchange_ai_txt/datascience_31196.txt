ANN algorithm for system selection

I have a dataset of computer systems with system characteristics as parameters. I want to rank best systems based on these parameters. The system works on a recurrent neural network model with the inputs of all previous transactions considered while choosing the current output. To my understanding, LSTM is something that is commonly used for such usecases but I heard it has limitations when I want to dynamically add new systems. Are there any better alternatives?
