Preprocessing in TensorFlow

Good night, I am working on a paper comparing Python libraries for machine learning and deep learning. Trying to evaluate Keras and TensorFlow separately, I'm looking for information about TensorFlow methods or functions that can be used to preprocess datasets, such as those included in scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing) or the Keras preprocessing layers, but I can't find anything beyond a one hot enconding for labels... Does anyone know if what I am looking for exists? Thank you very much!
