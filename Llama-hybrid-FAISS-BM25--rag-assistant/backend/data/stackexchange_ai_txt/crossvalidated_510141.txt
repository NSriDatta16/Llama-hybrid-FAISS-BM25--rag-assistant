how to fit four parameter logistic regression (poisson) R?

I'm trying to fit a four parameter logistic regression to model bird species richness (Patch_Richness) in response to forest cover (FOREST500). I need to add km as a co-variable to the model (km= kilometers), I'm trying the following (code) but not sure if "km" is properly included in the formula, I just added km after the predictor (FOREST500) logip=function(p,lambda,x){ a=p[1] b=p[2] c=p[3] d=p[4] Riq1 = d+(a/(1+exp((b-(FOREST500+km))/c))) -sum(dpois(x,lambda=Riq1, log=TRUE)) } parnames(logip)=c("a","b","c","d") modTR.log=mle2(minuslog=logip, start= c(a=30,b=30, c=3,d=20), data=list(x=Patch_Richness)) summary(modTR.log) Any suggestions or comments? Is this ok?
