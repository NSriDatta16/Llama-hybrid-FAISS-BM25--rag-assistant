How to make my GUI work

Can anyone tell me on how the swing components drawn from the palette and put into the Jfame can work together? For example If a button pressed can the result show on the textArea, Or Can I drag some listed objects from the Jlist in my JFrame onto the JtextArea/JTabpanel? Thank you!
