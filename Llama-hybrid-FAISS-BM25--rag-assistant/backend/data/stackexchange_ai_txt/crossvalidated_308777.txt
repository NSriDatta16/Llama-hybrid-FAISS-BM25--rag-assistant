Why are there no deep reinforcement learning engines for chess, similar to AlphaGo?

Computers have for a long time been able to play chess using a "brute-force"-technique, searching to a certain depth and then evaluating the position. The AlphaGo computer however, only use an ANN to evaluate the positions (it does not do any depth-search as far as I know). Is it possible to create an chess engine that plays chess in the same way as AlphaGo plays Go? Why has no one done this? Would this program perform better than the top chess-engines (and chess players) of today?
