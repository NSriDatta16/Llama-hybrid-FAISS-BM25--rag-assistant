How to improve the accuracy of SVM regression results (has saturation at high values)

I have a question about using SVM regression in matlab. My training data set has a distribution like gaussian (below figure. A lot of data in 0-5, only few data >5). I separate this dataset into 2/3 for training and 1/3 for validation. They follow the same distribution . The function I used is like this: fitrsvm(Xtrain,Ytrain,'Standardize',true,'KernelFunction','gaussian','OptimizeHyperparameters','all', 'HyperparameterOptimizationOptions',struct('AcquisitionFunctionName','expected-improvement-plus')); The validation show bad results for large values (saturation) . Is it because there are few data >5 in the training dataset? I find 'weights' parameter in matlab fitrsvm function. Do I need to add somes weights to the training dataset? If it doesn't work, how can I improve the accuracy?
