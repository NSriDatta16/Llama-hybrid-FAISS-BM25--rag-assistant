What are we trying to predict with ARIMA if we remove non-stationarity in data

I am beginning to learn time series analysis and I read that for ARIMA models, one needs to have a stationary process...that would mean removing periodicities and trends in the data....but isn't that what we are trying to predict in the first place? That is, if there is a periodicity, i need to be able to use that fact in my prediction and my prediction should reflect that periodicity. Similarly for any non stationary trend. If we remove the periodicities and trends by differencing or standardizing what are we predicting then in the analysis...what is the utility of such predictions where the underlying trends in the data are not utilized? What are the popular algorithms that can best handle non-stationary processes?(other than neural networks) Thanks much
