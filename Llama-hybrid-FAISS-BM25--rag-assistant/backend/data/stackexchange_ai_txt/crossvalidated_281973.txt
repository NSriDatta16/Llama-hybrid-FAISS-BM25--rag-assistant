Instead of the tables you could do a logistic regression where the dependent variable is binary (pass/fail on test 2). The predictor variables would be gender and outcome on test 1. The model will estimate the probability of success on test 2 given the predictor values. If you get additional data you can incorporate it and get new estimates. Initially you should check the goodness of fit of the model to make sure that the estimates are reasonable.
