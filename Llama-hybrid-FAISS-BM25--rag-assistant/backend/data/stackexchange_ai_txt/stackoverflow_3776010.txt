Applying cases to act() in scala

I was wondering how to apply a match and case to my act() method. This is my tempObject class case class tempObject(typeOfData: Int) {} And this is my Actor: object StorageActor extends Actor { def act(TO: tempObject) = TO match { case TO(0) => println("True") case TO(1) => println("False") } } So, what should happen is, when I pass an object to act(), it calls the desired method, depending upon the values inside of the object. Is the above code correct to perform what I desire?
