Regarding graphical models, Petri Net formalises a system behaviour; in that it sharply differs from the rest of the mentioned models, all of which relate to how a judgement is formed. Worth to note that most of the cited names designate quite extensive AI concepts, which often coalesce: for example, you may use a Neural Network to build a decision tree, while the Neural Network itself, as an earlier post discussed, may depend on Bayesian inference.
