If I understand you correctly you have an application based on or similar to the "Tab Bar Application" template, and on the second tab you want to have a button to move to the first tab. You want to do something like tabBar.selectedItem = 0; You probably need to connect the Cancel button to the Tab Bar controller itself, if this is not already the case. EDIT: Here is an example, assuming your application is called "MyApp" In class MyAppDelegate: - (IBAction) cancel { tabBarController.selectedItem = 0; } Drag the selector from the button to the "cancel" action of the app delegate.
