Chance, that there are more talented programmers then YOU (applies for all programmer), is 100%. And if that is true, you can not fix hacking. But you can spend as much time and effort on it to go bankrupt. If you want to make some serious money you need to do some research on your target user group, and behavioral science. You need to make users playing that bring in new money, and thats it. Besides, you got it all wrong. Hackers are most active members of your user base, thy just behave in a way you did not intend them to. Take Zynga games on Facebook for example, do you think thy get hacked? - Sure, and about +100000 players only play, because thy can use bots, that automate everything. Having huge active user base botnet of actual people, makes archiver type gamers want to play the game - and if thy play, and it looks cool, then Avarage Joe will also want to play. If Avarage Joe plays, then his friends might want to play, and thy probably will not care anything other, then being better then his/her friend, killing time or having something to chat about. Avarage Joe friends will most likely be willing to pay to be better then Joe, but rather thy would like to invest in something that makes them able to be better. Besides if the real value is playing the game for free, then users who use the free hacked version, will most likely never would have payed for it. But thy are Avarage Joes and their friends just might. So this is like the cheapest commercial you can have. If you want to make money of your large userbase, then just make new versions of the game with small changes to levels and graphics.
