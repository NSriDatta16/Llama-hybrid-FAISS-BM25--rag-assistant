When you use the back button on many(though not necessarily all) browsers you are not hitting the server, you are retrieving a copy of the page that has been cached by the browser in it's last state. To avoid this you will need to prevent your page from being cached so that it is retrieved from the server instead. Adding the following to your page load will certainly do the trick in IE. Further investigation has revealed that this can also be achieved in Firefox using the no-store attribute: Response.CacheControl = "no-cache"; Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); Response.Expires = -1;
