In logistic regression, it isnâ€™t the case that the log-odds are linearly related to the features. We posit that such a relationship exists and then find the coefficients giving the best fit. That assumed linear relationship between the log-odds and the features might be an awful assumption, and that is why models like neural networks can be useful. If you want to propose a binomial model with $\log(\mathbb E[Y\vert X])=X\beta$ , feel free to do so. In fact, R has no trouble fitting such a model. set.seed(2022) N
