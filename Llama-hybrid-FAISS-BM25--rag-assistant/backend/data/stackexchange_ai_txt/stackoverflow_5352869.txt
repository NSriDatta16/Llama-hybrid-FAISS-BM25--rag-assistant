Getting value from input checkbox without form tag

I have pretty complicated listview component organized as table. On every tr line I have one td with . All this is within form runat="server" tag. I have done check/uncheck all pretty much the same way the gmail has it. Table is reading 50 records for one page and if you check records and click it will duplicate all selected records. What I need to know is how to read values from checked checkboxes and pass them on as JSON/serializeArray. Thank you.
