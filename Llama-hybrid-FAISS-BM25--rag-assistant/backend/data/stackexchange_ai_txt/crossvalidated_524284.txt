Feature Importance for each class when p>>n

I have a bioinformatics-related dataset with ~10k rows and ~100k columns (features) and a single response variable with roughly 25 classes. I want to figure out which of the features are useful in identifying each class. Any thoughts on how to proceed here? Some initial thoughts I had here were to create 25 difference models (one for each class), where I could construct a binary response variable (one vs. all). But still unsure about how to deal with the p>>n case while maintaining interpretability. Would a logistic regression with a lasso penalty work? Or is there a cleaner solution (maybe hypothesis test / anova / etc.) that I'm missing here? Thanks!
