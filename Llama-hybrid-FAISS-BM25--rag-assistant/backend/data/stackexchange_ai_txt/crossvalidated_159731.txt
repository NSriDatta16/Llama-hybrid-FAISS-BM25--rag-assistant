If you think of PCA as an exploratory technique to give you a way to visualise the relationships between variables (and in my opinion this is the only way to think about it) then yes, there is no reason why you can't put in binary variables. For example, here is a biplot of your data It seems reasonably useful. For example, you can see that Doc and Bashful are very similar; that HR is rather unlike the three other variables; Sleepy and Sneezy are very dissimilar, etc.
