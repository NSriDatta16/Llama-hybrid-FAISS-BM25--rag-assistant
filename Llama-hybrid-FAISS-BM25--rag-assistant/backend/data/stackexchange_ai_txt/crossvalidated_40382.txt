Winbugs and other MCMC without information for prior distribution

What happens when you don't have an idea of the parameters distribution? What approach should we use? Most of the time we aim to undersatnd if a certain variable has any influence over the presence/absence of a certain species, and the variable is accepted or not according to the variable importance. This means that most of the times we are not thinking on the expetcted distribution a parameter should have. Is it correct to assume that all parameters follow a normal distribution, when all i know is that b1,b2,b3 and b4 should vary between -2 and 2, and b0 can vary between -5 and 5 ? model { # N observations for (i in 1:N) { species[i] ~ dbern(p[i]) logit(p[i])
