The ability parameter zero corresponds to the 50% probability of a correct answer for the average difficult item. This is the standard notation of a one parameter logistic model (1PL) in the item response theory (IRT) framework: (1) $P(x_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, \beta_j) = \frac{exp(\theta_i − \beta_j)}{1 + exp(\theta_i−\beta_j)}$ The probability of answering an item is the combination of two independent forces, the subject ability ( $\theta$ ) and item difficulty ( $\beta$ ). The inclusion of a different discrimination parameter per item ( $\alpha_i$ ) leads to a two parameter logistic model (2PL): (2) $P(x_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, \beta_j) = \frac{exp[\alpha_i(\theta_i − \beta_j)]}{1 + exp[\alpha_i(\theta_i − \beta_j)]}$ The 1PL is a 2PL with all the discrimination parameters are set to 1 ( $\alpha_i$ = 1). If $\theta$ and $\beta$ are zero in equation 1, their difference is zero, thus the probability of getting item right is 0.5. This happens when the location of the Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) is zero and responder has ability equals to zero, which is the situation of item q2 in the following figure (from STATA ITEM Response THEORY REFERENCE Manual RELEASE 15).
