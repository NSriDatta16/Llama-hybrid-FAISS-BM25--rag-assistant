How to calculate the average salary?

I have data on the average, median, minimum, maximum salary for employees with experience from one to three years and with experience from three to seven years. Is it possible to assume based on these data what the average or median salary will be for employees with experience from three to four years? If it can be calculated, it would be ideal to get a formula for counting. Sample data: Minimum First quartile (Q1) Median Average The third quartile (Q3) Maximum employees with experience from one to three years 100 700 1250 1449 2000 4300 employees with experience from three years to seven 150 2175 3000 3080 3650 7500 (English is not my native language, so I apologize if I made mistakes).
