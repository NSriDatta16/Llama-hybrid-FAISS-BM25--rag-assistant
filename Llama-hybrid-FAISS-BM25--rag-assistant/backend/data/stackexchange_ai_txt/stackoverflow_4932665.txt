Is this response properly encoded?

I am receiving the following headers in response to a web request: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... ... Pragma: no-cache Content-Type: binary/octet-stream Transfer-Encoding: chunked ... Ÿ’âýÝ©ËIJ‹sç ÿ- // in hex the encoded data reads: // 00000000 9f 92 e2 fd dd a9 cb 49 4a 8b 73 e7 0a ff 02 2d IJ s - Question: Is this a valid or properly encoded chunked response? I don't see any 0 length chunks in there. What am I missing?
