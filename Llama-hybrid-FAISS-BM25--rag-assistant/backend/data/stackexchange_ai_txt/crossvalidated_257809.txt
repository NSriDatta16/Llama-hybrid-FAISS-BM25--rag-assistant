Figured I'd throw this answer in for posterity, even if it's likely too late to be useful to you. Larry Wasserman's All Of Statistics was conceived as a course for people with a background in machine learning, other comp sci disciplines, or math who didn't have any formal statistics training -- i.e., people in pretty much exactly your current situation. Having a similar lack of formal stats, a few friends and I formed a self-study group to go through it in grad school. I think I really benefited from that experience. The extra topics Wasserman throws in beyond the typical "probability and statistical inference" course material, like graphical models and bootstrapping, are particularly relevant to someone working in machine learning. I should say that the book can be pretty terse compared to something like Casella & Berger, so if you want more detail or motivation for certain parts (especially proofs) you may have to supplement it with other reading material. That said, I also found the book to be clearly-written with a good number of practice problems, and it's an excellent quick reference. One month is not a lot of time. If you set a very aggressive pace, though, I think you can certainly get a lot out of this text in one semester: we did our self-study group over the summer, for instance. That's especially true if you're mostly interested in linear modeling, which you'll hit by Ch. 13-14.
