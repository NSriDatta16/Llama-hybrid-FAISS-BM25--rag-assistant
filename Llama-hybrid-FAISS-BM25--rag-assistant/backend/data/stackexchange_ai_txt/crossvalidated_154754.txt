How to choose the order of a GARCH model?

In order to model time series with GARCH models in R, you first determine the AR order and the MA order using ACF and PACF plots. But then how do you determine the order of the actual GARCH model? Ie. say you find ARMA(0,1) fits your model then you use: garchFit(formula=~arma(0,1)+garch(1,1),data=XX,trace=FALSE,include.mean=FALSE) I know GARCH(1,1) is the most widely used, but what's the best way to determine the order? AIC?
