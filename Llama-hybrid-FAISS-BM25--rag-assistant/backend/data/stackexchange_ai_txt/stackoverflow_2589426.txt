I would make a user control called "AuthorList.ascx" which outputs the list of authors in the correct format (ie with HTML), as a fragment. (No HEAD/HTML/BODY tags, just straight fragmet type stuff as per usual with an ASCX control. Then I would make my Author List page as per normal, dropping this new control that I just made inside a div: This is enough for case 2. To add to it the ajax updating, I would make a new page, which has nothing but the AuthorList.ascx control in it: Using jQuery I would do: $('#author-list').load('path-to-the-second-aspx-page-containing-user-contor.aspx', { // args here }); Which allows you to update the contents of the author list via AJAX for subsequent requests, such as search, filter, paging etc.
