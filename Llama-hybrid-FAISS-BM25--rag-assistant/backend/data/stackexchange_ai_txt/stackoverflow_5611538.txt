I don't think that there is a really elegant way to do this. The whole point of JavaScript is that it is event based. A way to hack it might be using setTimeout with a very short timeout. var timeout; chrome.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener(function(ev) { clearTimeout(timeout); timeout = setTimeout(function() {eventHandler(ev);}, 5); });
