Where to get started in data analysis

I wish to break into the field of data science, more specifically, analysing data sets, extracting features and classifying them or identifying relationships. However, I have no formal math background and am trying to re-learn it from the ground up. I've started an introductory stats and probability course on Coursera, and am looking at some linear algebra via Khan academy but looking at the math I'm still quite lost. I was wondering if anyone knew of a good introduction to data analysis text that was aimed at non-mathematicians, a "black box" approach, if you will. That would allow me to learn some basic techniques while I progress in my math that I could be getting on with alongside my studies. I've had a play around with MATLAB, sci-kit learn, scipy, numpy for Python but all the texts I use are very math heavy. Is this unavoidable? Should I just knuckle down with the math first? What would your advice be?
