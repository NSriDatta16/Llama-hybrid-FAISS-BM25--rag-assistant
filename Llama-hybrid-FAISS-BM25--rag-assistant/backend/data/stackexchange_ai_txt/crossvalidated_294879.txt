Binomial proportion confidence interval with known distribution of the proportion

If I have a coin that produces head with probability p , I know there are several methods to estimate a confidence interval for p with a given confidence level. If I also know that the coin was randomly selected from a set of coins whose distribution of p is known, I think that it is possible to improve the quality of the estimation. I tried to find if this is a known problem and if there are known solutions, but I found nothing. Is there anyone who knows if this is a studied problem or has any idea on how it could be possible to leverage the known distribution of p in order to improve its estimation?
