Every browser pretty much has its own standard stylesheet with custom css for common elements such as paragraphs, body element, and all the rest of the elements which it supports. Each browsers stylesheet isn't exactly the same, so for example while one browser sets padding on the body, another will set margin on the body element. If you rely on a css reset, you basically attempt to gain more control by explicitly setting certain properties to a consistent value, such as margin and padding on all elements to 0 ( which isn't preferred for form controls ).
