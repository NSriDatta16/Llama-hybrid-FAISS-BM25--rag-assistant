What is the best single measure of brain networks based on functional MRI data?

I want to analyze functional MRI ( fMRI ) data as follows: I am comparing the brain networks of two groups of subjects (patients and matched). For each subject I have a correlation (Pearson) matrix with the correlations between multiple brain regions (above 50000 correlations). I want to get a single measure to represent every subject (maybe the mean of correlations of each subject network). What is the most suitable measure? Should I use Fisher transformation to average the correlation matrix? I assume that the variance of the two groups is different and that the variance in each group is similar: How can check that without doing multiple comparisons?
