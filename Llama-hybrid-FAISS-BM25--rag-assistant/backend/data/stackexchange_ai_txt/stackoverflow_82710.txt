I'm just getting into ASP.NET MVC, so these are some early thoughts comparing it to Rails: Mostly manages to stick with static typing, at the expense of a little extra code. This will either give you the warm fuzzies or make you feel slightly shackled depending on how you feel about dynamic typing. For instance, you can have your views expect particular typed data (and so get compile-time checking of your views). Better separation of bits of the framework. So there's no prescribed data access mechanism such as ActiveRecord in Rails; you're free to choose your own. LINQ feels similar if you want something cheap, if a bit more verbose. You can use the non-WebForms parts of ASP.NET like caching and authentication. Still playing feature catch-up. Preview 5 brought AcceptVerbs, model updaters (similar to Ruby's hash.merge) and more ways to bind forms to models. Feels like there's still more to come before they check off most of the feature set that Rails has. I'm still missing a little of Rails' freedom and elegance (much of which is down to Ruby, I guess), but ASP.NET MVC really does feel quite close.
