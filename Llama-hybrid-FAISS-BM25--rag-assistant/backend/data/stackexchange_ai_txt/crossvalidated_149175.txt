Just came across this MOOC "Autonomous Navigation of Flying Robots" ( https://www.edx.org/course/autonomous-navigation-flying-robots-tumx-autonavx-0 ). In the course the instructors teach participants how to programme (in python) a flying robot for autonomous navigation, exploiting Bayesian statistics for states estimation and other useful techniques (e.g. Kalman filtering of noisy sensor input). The nice thing is that the code that one writes in class is usable for some commercially available flying robots, so one can later play more around with this and seek possibilities how to improve Bayesian state estimation. For the Ipython Notebook "Probabilisic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers", I can also highly recommend it. Haven't come across such a well accessible and comprehensive hands on introduction before and really learned a lot within a relatively short time!
