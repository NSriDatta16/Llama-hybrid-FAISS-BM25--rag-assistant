Bi-normal separation feature selection (BNS) in R

I'm doing binary classification on highly dimensional text data, with a biased class distribution. After reading this paper, i found out about BNS feature selection. Is there any package that implements this (i can't find one)? How hard is to implement it by scratch? Or is there another method (like PCA) which i can use to deal with this kind of data? Thanks!
