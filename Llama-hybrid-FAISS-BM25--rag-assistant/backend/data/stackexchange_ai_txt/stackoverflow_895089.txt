According to http://css-tricks.com/margin-0-padding-0-no-longer-cool/ This is part of the “CSS Reset” theory.This eliminates all differences in padding and margin across browsers Its very heavy on the rendering agent to apply rules to every single element in the document, especially with large web pages, and this can also destroy a lot of good default styling, especially when you want to have default styled submit buttons.
