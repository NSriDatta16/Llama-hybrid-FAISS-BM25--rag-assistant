Techniques to improve accuracy of time series use case

I am working on forecasting weekly revenue of 10,000 sectors. Applied basic time series models and average RMSE(in thousands) on hold-out set (last 32 weeks) as below. In my view, ma12 and ETS(ANN) models seems reasonable. 1. Please let me know techniques to reduce RMSE. 2. Which other time series models can be tried ? ma4 ma8 ma12 stlf ses holt ets-ANN ets-ZZN ets-ZZN12 linear 18.79894 18.65662 18.78054 21.34638 19.66270 19.27242 18.17565 18.52025 20.08258 25.14404 Box Plot.
