Gagan, if you're still having this issue, can you download SysInternals' Process Monitor? You can find it here . Run it, and add columns for memory private bytes, working set, and virtual size. Peak private bytes and working set wouldn't hurt, either, and there are other memory columns you can add for fun : ) Task Manager doesn't give you the virtual size (Windows 7 lets you add Commit Size, don't know if Server 2008 also has that). This should give you a clearer picture of where the memory is going. Let us know if that helps or you need further help pinning down where your memory is going!
