create a uiview object from cgrect

I have a custom table view cell where i create 3 images with: [aUIImage drawInRect:someCGRect]; Is there a way I can create 3 UIView objects from these images, so I can access them in my touchesBegan method to find which image was touched? Or is there a better way? Thanks!
