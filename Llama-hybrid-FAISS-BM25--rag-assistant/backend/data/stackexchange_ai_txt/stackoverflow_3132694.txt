How did Chrome create a different GUI for the browser?

I am interested in how Chrome was able to write such a good looking GUI? What libraries and methods did they use? I am particularly amazed that it acts 100% like a regular GUI - you can drag it by the blue strip and the regular buttons [_, o, x] are made differently. Also tab dragging is so seamless. In fact you can drag a tab outside of existing GUI and it will create a new window fluidly. Does anyone know more details about this? I am asking because I also want to write great looking GUI for my applications. And this is a good start to understand the process.
