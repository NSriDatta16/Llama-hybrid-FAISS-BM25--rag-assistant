You are going to have a hard time finding sample code. Compiler writers use bootstrapping . The first C compiler was written in B. Which was then used to write the first C++ compiler. Which was used to write the C# compiler. Which is very commonly used to write compilers for managed code. This is not a process that ever goes backwards. Although side-ways was common, C compilers often were used to cross-compile a compiler for another operating system. I think I used this book , it has terrific C compiler code in the appendices. Written in C. I used parts of it when writing a Basic compiler I needed in a large project. The expression parser is hard to get right, it has an elegant solution for the operator precedence rules. Targeting a managed language is the easier way to get this going. The language shouldn't matter too much, it is getting it working that is the real challenge. Even though it is a lot easier to get managed code working. If you want to target C, you'll need black-belt machine code skillz and deep insight in the object file format and the linker.
