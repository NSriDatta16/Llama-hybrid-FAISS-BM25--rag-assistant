Multidimensional scaling in R with Spearman's rank correlation

I'm new to MDS, but I found some good starter code here ( http://mhermans.net/static/postdata/r-examples/neighbours-mds/neighbours-mds-example.html ) and which I borrowed for below. The code works fine, but I would like to change the way I calculate my dissimilarity matrix. The data I want to analyze is ecological time series, so I'd like to use a Spearman's Rank Correlation, as opposed to the co-occurrence matrix outlined from the above site. So given a simple data set of 10 species from 6 sites: Site_1 The code that works from the above site looks like this: X I was hoping I could change the dissimilarity matrix like so and still get a working MDS: C But the resulting plot no longer groups the sites according to a pattern of distances that makes sense to the original data. So I'm assuming I can't just substitute a Spearman's correlation in, and more globally, that I don't understand the difference between a co-occurrence matrix and correlation matrix. I hope you can help me out plotting a MDS that makes sense with a Spearman's correlation.
