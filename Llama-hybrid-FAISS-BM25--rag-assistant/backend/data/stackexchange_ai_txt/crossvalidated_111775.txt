Obtaining Standard Error of Weighted Averages using Bootstrapping?

My problem is finding a way to estimate the standard error of a flow-weighted mean concentration. The FWMC is computed by summing the years flow * concentration measurements and dividing by the sum of flow measurements (17 measures of paired concentration and flow for the year). This FWMC number (in mg/L) is then multiplied by the known total volume of water in the stream to arrive at an estimate of the total mass of pollution. I have yet to find a method which accounts for the dependence of mass on flow. Is there a way to do this in R via bootstrapping?
