Using WWW:Mechanize to download a file to disk without loading it all in memory first

I'm using Mechanize to facilitate the downloading of some files. At the moment my script uses the following line to actually download the files... agent.get('http://example.com/foo').save_as 'a_file_name' However this downloads the complete file into memory before dumping it to disk. How do you bypass this behavior, and simply download straight to disk? If I need to use something other than WWW:Mechanize then how would I go about using WWW:Mechanize's cookies with it?
