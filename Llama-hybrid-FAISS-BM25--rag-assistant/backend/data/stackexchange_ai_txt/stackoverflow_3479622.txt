Me.pleaseWaitFrm.Close() That's an illegal call, you are not allowed to close a form from another thread. Not sure how you got away with it, that should raise an IllegalOperationException when you run with a debugger. Review your code and delete any assignment to the Control.CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls property. This exception you're getting is a clear side-effect of this. You must use Control.Invoke() to get the dialog closed. This automatically solves your problem, the delegate target cannot execute until the dialog is loaded. Leverage the BackgroundWorker class, it makes this easy. You can close the dialog in a RunWorkerCompleted event handler.
