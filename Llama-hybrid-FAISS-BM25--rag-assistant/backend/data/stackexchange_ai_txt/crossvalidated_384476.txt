Random Forest - Why does the value for doing the split change?

I created a random forest. When observing the trees that compose it in many of them the first variable to make the split is "age". But here my doubt arises. The values to make the split change. For example: Tree 1 : Does the split if age > 5 Tree 4 : Does the split if age > 6 Tree 18: Does the split if age >15 My question is, why is this happening? If the variable "age" is going to make the first split, shouldn't it always have the same value to do it? IÂ´m ussing scikit-learn and RandomForestClassifier
