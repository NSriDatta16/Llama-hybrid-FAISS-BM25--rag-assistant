Are you sure getting the quote doesn't work? The following code should work: $session = Mage::getSingleton('checkout/session'); foreach ($session->getQuote()->getAllItems() as $item) { print_r($item->getData()); } Of course, if you're not doing it from inside a Magento template/controller/model then you'll need to set up the environment appropriately: require_once 'app/Mage.php'; umask(0); Mage::app(); /* Then put your code here.. */ Source: http://www.nicksays.co.uk/2009/02/testing-magento-modules/ Source: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/19020/#t99651
