Your application's main window does not need to be open. If you launched it as a secondary thread, it will continue to run so long as IsBackground == false . I usually prefer to do this stuff through SQL Server Agent or as a client-server application (nothing prevents a client-server app from both running on the same machine, or even being the same binary). It's been a while... using System.Threading; ..... Thread _t = null; void StartProcedure() { _t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(this.StartProc)); _t.IsBackground = false;//If I remember correctly, this is the default value. _t.Start(); } bool ProcedureIsRunning { get { return _t.IsRunning; } //Maybe it's IsActive. Can't remember. } void StartProc(object param) { //your logic here.. could also do this as an anonymous method. Broke it out to keep it simple. }
