How to share web content between eclipse projects

While the J2EE module reference feature allows your to create common Java library projects, I can't find a neat way to do this for web content. I have common JSPs, CSS files, JavaScript libraries and even descriptor fragments that I would like to use across a number of Dynamic Web Projects, so that these artefacts are edited i only one place, but will be exported into each of the Dynamic WebProject WAR files. I am surprised that I can't find a way to promote reusability in the web space without writing my own scripts and hooking into the export process. Is there a way to do this? Thanks. Matt.
