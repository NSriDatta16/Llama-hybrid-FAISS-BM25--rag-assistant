Use the heat.exe program that comes with the WiX toolset, to generate the wxs registration fragment: heat.exe file -out eg. heat.exe file my.dll -out my.wxs Copy the contents of the tag from that new wxs file and paste it into the of your existing wxs file that references your dll using a tag. Delete the tag you pasted and replace all references to that file Id with the one that was already there; if the existing one didn't have an Id attribute, add it and set it to whatever you want.
