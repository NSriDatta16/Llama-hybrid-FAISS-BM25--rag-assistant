How to use factors generated from PCA?

I have survey data measuring the BIG five personality test. In total, there are 60 variables measuring the five components in a five-point scale. The goal is to look at whether certain experiences in childhood affect these personalities in a regressinal framework. So I need to generate a variable for each personality dimension. Instead of summing all questions to get a score for each personality dimension, I was told to use factor analysis. (Does anyone have reference for the rationale of prefering factor analysis in this context?) I understand the intuition and math for the factor analysis and principal component analysis. But I don't know how to use these factors in an econometric framework after getting the factor loadings. And I am quite confused when people use PCA interchangeably with factor analysis. Are these two the same thing? In the statistical package I use (STATA), the factor command has a few optimizing options. One of them is pf (principal factor), another is principal component factor. And they give substantially different results. How are these two methods different?
