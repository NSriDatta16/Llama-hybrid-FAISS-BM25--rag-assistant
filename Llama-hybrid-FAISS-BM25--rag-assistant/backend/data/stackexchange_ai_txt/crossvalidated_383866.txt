How many word2vec pretrained models are available?

In my experiments with pre-trained word2vec models for NLP tasks, I have so far come across two models - one trained on Google News dataset and another which has been trained on Wikipedia text corpus. Are there other pre-trained models available for the extraction of word2vec embedding ? Google search on this issue only comes up with FastText, sentence2vec models etc. Moreover, can a sentence2vec embedding (obtained from the same dataset) be used as an alternative to word2vec embedding (by naively assuming that the sentence contains only one word)?
