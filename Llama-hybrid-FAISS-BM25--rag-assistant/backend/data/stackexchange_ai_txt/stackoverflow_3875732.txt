Old question but I found this while Googling on the subject and thought I'd update it with the solution. The localstorage databases are sqlite databases and are stored in /Library/WebKit/LocalStorage and the database for your app will be something like file__0.localstorage You can get the path to the file with something like this: NSString* fullPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Library/WebKit/LocalStorage/file__0.localstorage"]; Hope this helps anyone else who's looking into this.
