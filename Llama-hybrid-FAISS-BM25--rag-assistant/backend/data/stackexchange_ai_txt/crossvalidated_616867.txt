How to test for a equality of the mean of two bounded random variables

Good morning all together, as a statistics rookie, I'm facing the task how to test for a difference in the mean of two random variables that are bound between 0 and 1. Both their means are positive and in one case (potentially) autocorrelated as those random variables are time series. In detail, these random variables are generated in two settings, where in setting 1 both variables are the result of a calibration and consequently time series of observations. In the another setting, these variables are the result of a monte carlo simulation, where autocorrelation can be excluded by construction. In both settings, these random variables are possibly correlated (but not correlated by construction but by mere chance). My question is: Which test can i use to check whether the mean of one random variable is larger than the other mean for either setting? In addition, how can i test this if only one random variable is autocorrelated and the other one is not? Thank you very much for your suggestions, Thomas
