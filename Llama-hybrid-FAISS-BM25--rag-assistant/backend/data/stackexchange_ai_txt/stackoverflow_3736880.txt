jquery draggable - Get containment to only contain handle

I'm using jQuery UI's draggable() to make some elements on my page draggable. I've got a handler and a containment set for the elements, but I'd like the draggable element itself to be able to hang out of the containment. I only want the handle to stay inside the container. Like below, pretend the * is the handle. +-------------------+ |Containment | | *----------+ | |Draggable | | +----------+ +-------------------+ Is there a sneaky way to do this without having to calculate a new containment myself?
