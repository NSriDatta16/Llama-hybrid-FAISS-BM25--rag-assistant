A mixed effect model seems appropriate for your study. You appear to be asking the question, "Which covarietes predict skull size (represented by Factor1)?" However, your observations are not independent. For example, covariate observations within populations are perfectly correlated. Thus, a standard fixed effects-only model will underestimate the standard error. For a mixed effects model, the covariates are fixed effects and population is a random effect. Using the lme4 package in R, you might start with: lmer(Factor1 ~ manage + foraging + height + biome + abundance + area + forest + plough + (1|population), data = your.dataset)
