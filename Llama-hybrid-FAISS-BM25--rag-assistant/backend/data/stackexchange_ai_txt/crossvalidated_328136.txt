Some code based on Rob's workaround of setting the negatives to zero and reconcile # Re-reconciliate when zero values present # Extract groups groups % aggts() %>% get_groups() x=0 #Counter # Loop until all positive while(sum(hts.obj[[1]] 0){ # Generate all time series hts.obj % ts() %>% combinef(groups = groups, keep ="gts") # Count up x=x+1 # Break after 10 loops if(x>=10)break } rm("x") # Overwrite remaining negatives by zero hts.obj[[1]][hts.obj[[1]] In this example forecasts are indexed by [[1]] - this might change. Also note that overwriting zeros leads to biased forecasts.
