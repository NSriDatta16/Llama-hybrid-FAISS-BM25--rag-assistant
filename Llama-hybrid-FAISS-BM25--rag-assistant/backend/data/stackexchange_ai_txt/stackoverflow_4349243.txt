Permutation Generation

Some members of my team were discussing password storage and general security issues today. Anyway, the discussion briefly touched upon how quick GPU-accelerated brute-force attacks are compared to the traditional CPU-only implementations. This got me interested, so I decided to play around with some code. Since I've never written anything like this before, I decided to write a simple (CPU-only) brute-forcer. My initial implementation dealt with a fixed length (4 digit) password. For testing purposes, I implemented it a la: for(char a = '0'; a This works well, but is obviously inflexible. I attempted to generalize the above to handle any password length but have failed to do so. For some reason, I can't get my head around the logic that these brute-forcers use to run through 1-n character possibilities given an "alphabet". Is there some common algorithm that allows you to accomplish this? Any examples welcome.
