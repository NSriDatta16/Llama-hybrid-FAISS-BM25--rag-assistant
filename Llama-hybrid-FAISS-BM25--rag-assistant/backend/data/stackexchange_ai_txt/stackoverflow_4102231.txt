Sorting an array is, like, the most imperative task in the universe. It is not surprising that many elegant 'immutable' strategies/implementations fail poorly on a 'sort an array' microbenchmark. This does not imply that immutability is expensive "in general", though. There are many tasks where immutable implementations will perform comparably to mutable ones, but array sorting often is not one of them.
