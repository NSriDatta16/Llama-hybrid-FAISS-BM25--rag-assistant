I can think of two possibilities: you might have an extra space after your backslash at the end of the line; or you might be somehow ending up with the wrong line-ending characters in your source (e.g. Windows-style when your Python is expecting Unix-style, thus disabling the backslashes). Either way, I would take advantage of C-style automatic string concatenation: >>> string = ("some text " ... "more text " ... "and even more") >>> string 'some text more text and even more' Alternatively, if you don't mind newlines ending up in there, use multi-line strings: >>> string = """some text ... more text ... and even more""" IMO these look much nicer, and are much less fragile when refactoring. Does this help?
