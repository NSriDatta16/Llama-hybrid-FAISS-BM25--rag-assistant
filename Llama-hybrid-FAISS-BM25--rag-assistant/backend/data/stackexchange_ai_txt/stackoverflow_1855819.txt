I wrote my own log to file class but I discovered that in the vast majority of cases it was easier to just copy the contents of the debugger console,paste it to a file and use editing or scripts to process it if necessary. That works well even for very large dumps. I've even dumped tables that way. It's inelegant but way, way quicker and less error prone than futzing with files.
