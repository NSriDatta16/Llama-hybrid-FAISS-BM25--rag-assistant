I would shy away from any specific label interpretations and just look at it from a general classification stand point. You have $K$ classes (I omit the region index, because its not important) and empirical multinomial distribution $\hat{p}_1,\ldots,\hat{p}_K$ . Gini index, apart from some other impurity measures like mutual information, is just one of the more sensible measures (its concave, which is very important) you can use. If you want to interpret it in some way then it is an average number of classification errors you make when you sample a random example from the region and assign it a label at random using the empirical distribution $p_k$ . I always found Gilles Louppe's PhD Thesis - Understanding Random Forests: From theory to practice ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7502.pdf ) one of the best reference to understand how the tree-based methods actually work (not only theoretically but how to implement them efficiently).
