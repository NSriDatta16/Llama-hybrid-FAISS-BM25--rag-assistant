How many dimensions should matrix be reduced to with PCA?

I want to reduce the dimensions of my dataset to decrease the complexity without losing too much information. But I am not sure how many dimensions I should reduce to, so that I don't lose too much information. Do we have any direct attribute/function to use for such task? Thanks in advance.
