What events are triggered when calling fetch() on a Backbone.js collection?

In my backbone.js app, there is a Trips collection that holds Trip models , which is working with LocalStorage . I am able to call Trips.create(form_attributes) to create and save a trip to the Todos store . When I first load my app, I call Trips.fetch({ success: trips_fetch_success }) , and trips_fetch_success receives a response that shows the Trip models that the Trips collection holds. I have tried to bind refresh and change events to the Trips collection , but these events are not being caught, making me believe I have the wrong idea about which events Trips.fetch triggers. My question: which events should Trips.fetch trigger? And are the events triggered on the collection or on each of the individual Trip models ?
