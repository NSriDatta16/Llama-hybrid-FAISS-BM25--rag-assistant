Combining time series to increase sensitivity

I have two sensors logging data synchronously. The two sensors are similar, so the recorded time series are correlated except for some special conditions. I recorded data in different input parameter conditions of the system. And I would like to combine the two time series in one. The objective of this combination is to increase the sensitivity to system parameter changes. How can I do it? Do you have any suggestion?
