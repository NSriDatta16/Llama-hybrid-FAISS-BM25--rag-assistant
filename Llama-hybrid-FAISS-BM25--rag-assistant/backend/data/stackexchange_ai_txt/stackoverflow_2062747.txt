You could manually construct the partial views in HTML helper methods. However, the feasibility of that approach depends on whether or not the partial views will be reused in other pages. I build a data grid control from scratch using HTML helper methods. Some of my pages have three or four of these data grids managed by a jQuery accordion control to reduce the screen footprint. I chose building an HTML helper for a number of reasons. First, I expected to use this control throughout my applications. Second, I didn't want to burden my views with a bunch of conditional logic. Finally, I wanted to be able to change the grid's configuration (including the model) within the view, so I wouldn't have to recompile every time I changed it. The grid supports both LINQ-to-SQL models and user-defined classes (using reflection), has a built-in pager control and a search mechanism that supports multiple search fields in a grid. I also set up the columns so that they can either display formatted text, link to a controller action or hold a mailto: link. Within the grid itself, you can define the model to populate the grid, optionally set the columns to display, specify the action and controller for creates, and specify a JavaScript function for deletes (because I use the jQuery dialog plugin for confirmation messages). All these changes are managed in the view itself. Learning how to leverage HTML helper methods gives you the closest thing to ASP.NET server controls that MVC provides.
