Checking for an unregistered/missing service

How can I use ServiceController to tell me if a service has been registered or not? In the code fragment below, the check for a null DisplayName results in a System.InvalidOperationException. Is there a straightforward way of doing this that I'm completely missing? ServiceController sc = new ServiceController("TestService"); if (sc.DisplayName == null) { // unregistered or missing service }
