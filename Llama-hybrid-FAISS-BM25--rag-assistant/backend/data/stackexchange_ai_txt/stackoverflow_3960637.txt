Typically, this is handled by a union in a single query. Normalization gets you to a logical model. This helps better understand the data. It is common to denormalize when implementing the model. Subtypes as you have here are commonly implemented in two ways: Seperate tables as you have, which makes retrieval difficult. This results in your question about how to retreive the data. A common table for all subtypes with a subtype indicator. This may result in columns which are always null for certain subtypes. It simplifies data access, and may alter the way that the subtypes are handled in code. If the extra columns for a subtype are relatively rarely accessed, then you may use a hybrid implementation where the common columns are in the type table, and some or all of the subtype columns are in a subtype table. This is more complex to code.
