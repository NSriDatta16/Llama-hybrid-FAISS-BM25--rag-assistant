Comparison between applications of vanilla transformer and BERT

I try to identify applications of vanilla transformer in nlp, as well as those in BERT. But I don't seem to find good summaries for either of them. Thus my questions are: what are the applications of transformer and bert respectively? in (1), why in some application vanilla transformer is used over BERT? (or vice versa?) What're the reasons? TIA.
