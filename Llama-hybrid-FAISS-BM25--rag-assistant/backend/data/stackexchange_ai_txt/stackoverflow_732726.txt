It seems to me that using the average is a little unfair. If Joke A has 1 rating of 5 and Joke B has 25 ratings of 4, then Joke A will rank above Joke B. It gives unpopular jokes more of an advantage to be ranked higher. I would suggest associating weight to ratings and then ranking by the weight. For example, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 would get a -2, 2 would get a -.5, 3 is 0, 4 is +.5 and 5 would get a +2. So this would allow a joke with 5 "4" ratings to be ranked higher than the joke with 1 "5" rating. The -2 to +2 scale may need some tweaking, but hopefully you see my point.
