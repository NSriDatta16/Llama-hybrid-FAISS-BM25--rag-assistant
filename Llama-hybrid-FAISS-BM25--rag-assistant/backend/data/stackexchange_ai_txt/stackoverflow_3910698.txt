Why does an embedded ogg video work on localhost, but not on the web server?

I have an ogg video which works just fine using the video tag when I run it on localhost in either Chrome or Firefox. However, when I try running the page on the server, the video player controls show up, but not the video. I know the video is up on the server, because I have a download link that works which has the same exact path.. I'm at a loss. There was an error embedding the video. Please download the video to view. After fiddling around with it for a while, I've discovered that, according to the browser, the video simply isn't there. when I check the server, the file is up. However, when I navigate directly to the file within the browser, I get a file not found error. Could this be an issue with my web host, or is there some other possible cause?
