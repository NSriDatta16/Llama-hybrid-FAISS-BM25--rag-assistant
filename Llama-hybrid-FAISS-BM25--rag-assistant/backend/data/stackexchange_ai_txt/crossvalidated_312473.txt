Distribution Regression with Kernel Mean Embedding

I'm interested in doing distribution regression with Kernel Mean Embedding with a variety of kernel methods (SVM regression, Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process). Typically in distribution regression, you have something like that maps $x \to y$. $x$ is typically a distribution (i.e. 10 people have spend \$5, 13 people spend \$6... and convert that to a probability distribution). My question is lets say you have a distribution that you think is correlated with y. However, you also have other variables like location that is also correlated with y that is not a distribution. I'd like be able to input both the distribution and real value variables into my algorithm and use the combination of the two to predict y. Obviously there are work arounds like building two models and ensembling, but I'm more interested in doing the optimization/modeling end to end.
