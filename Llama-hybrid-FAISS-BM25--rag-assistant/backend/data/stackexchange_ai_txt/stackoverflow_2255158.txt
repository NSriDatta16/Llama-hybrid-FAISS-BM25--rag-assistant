How do I insert HTML into a PHP DOM object?

I am using PHP's DOM object to create HTML pages for my website. This works great for my head, however since I will be entering a lot of HTML into the body (not via DOM), I would think I would need to use DOM->createElement($bodyHTML) to add my HTML from my site to the DOM object. However DOM->createElement seems to parse all HTML entities so my end result ended up displaying the HTML on the page and not the actual renders HTML. I am currently using a hack to get this to work, $body = $this->DOM ->createComment('DOM Glitch--> '.$bodyHTML." Which puts all my site code in a comment, which I bypass athe comment and manually add the tags. Currently this method works, but I believe there should be a more proper way of doing this. Ideally something like DOM->createElement() that will not parse any of the string. I also tried using DOM->createDocumentFragment() However it does not like some of the string so it would error and not work (Along with take up extra CPU power to re-parse the body's HTML). So, my question is, is there a better way of doing this other than using DOM->createComment() ?
