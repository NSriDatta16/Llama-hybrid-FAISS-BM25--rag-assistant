time series regression and correlated residuals

Can somebody please introduce me a time series regression dataset that has many variables and data point? In a nutshell, I have a model of the form of $$y_t=X'\beta+v_t$$ where $v_t=\sum_i^p \phi_iv_{t-i}+e_t$ and $e_t\sim^{iid} N(0,\sigma^2 link but no progress. I would be thankful if somebody introduce me a dataset and probably associate paper.
