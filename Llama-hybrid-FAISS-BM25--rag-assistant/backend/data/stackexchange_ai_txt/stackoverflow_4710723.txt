I think there is no encouraging answer. There are two problems: fonts and text layout. I believe that the fonts in Android don't come with tables for Arabic ligatures and letter shaping. Furthermore, as far as I can tell, the layout engine (android.text.Layout and related classes) do not know know how to handle bidirectional text properly. Although this is supposedly in the works, my guess is that it will be some time before an Android release handles rtl languages properly, and even more time before a significant fraction of actual devices will do so.
