From a user's perspective: If the user does not have access to an application's source code, software escrow is the insurance policy that in the event of a "disaster" the escrow agent will release a copy of the source code to the user. The user needs to determine the risk associated with not being able to get the business critical or mission critical software maintained as their business needs change. From a developer's perspective: There are two perspectives. 1) It is a tool to ensure their intellectual property (the source code) is kept in-house unless a "disaster" occurs when the escrow agent will release a copy of the source code to the user. 2) It can also be used as a tool to help marketing their application. "Disasters" or release events are explicitly defined in the escrow agreement. Software Escrow Guardians is an escrow agent and has been providing software escrow services for nearly twenty years. The company has an escrow agreement template suitable as a framework for an escrow service involving an individual user and a developer. It also has an escrow agreement template suitable for multiple users and a developer.
