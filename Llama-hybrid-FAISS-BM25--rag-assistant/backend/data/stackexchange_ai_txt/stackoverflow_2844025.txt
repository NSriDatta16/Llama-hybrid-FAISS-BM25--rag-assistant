The & in function-calls was mandatory in Perl 4, so maybe you have picked that up from Programming perl (1991) by Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz, as I did, or somewhere similar. As for the function prototypes, my guess is less qualified. Maybe you have been mimicking languages where it makes sense and/or is mandatory to declare argument lists, and since function prototypes in Perl look a little like argument lists, you've started adding them? &function is discouraged because it makes the code less readable and isn't necessary (the cases that &function is necessary are rare and often better avoided). Function prototypes aren't argument lists, so most of the time they'll just confuse your reader or lull you into a false sense of rigidity, so no need to use those unless you know exactly why you are. & was mandatory in Perl 4, so they have been best/necessary practise. I don't think function prototypes ever has been.
