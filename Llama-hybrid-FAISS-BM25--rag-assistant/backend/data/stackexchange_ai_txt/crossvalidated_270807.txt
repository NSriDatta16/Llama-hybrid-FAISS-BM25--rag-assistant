Applying T Test for single mean in Likert scale

I have a variable namely "Tourist satisfaction regarding ticket prices, transport cost a tourist have been charged by travel agent". I have created a 5 point scale. 1= Highly satisfied 2= little satisfied 3= Neutral 4= little dissatisfied 5= Highly dissatisfied I am interested to test tourist satisfaction against mean satisfaction level (3=neutral). Can we apply T Test for that. Or is there any other test which is more appropriate.
