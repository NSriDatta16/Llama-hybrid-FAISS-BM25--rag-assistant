I personally like the ReSharper and its "Find all usages" functionality. There is a couple of advanced options but essentially it can quite quickly find all the places where a particular unit is used (function, class, interface). I believe you are confusing the term Code Coverage a little bit, usually what is meant by it is the percentage of code that is covered by test cases (automated unit tests) and this can be easily determined with many tools, e.g. NCover or MS Test coverage in some versions of Visual Studio.
