You can use a taxonomy tree to categorize your content. Having your content organized makes it easier to find for visitors. Depending on your site (size, content, subject) you may opt for a flat taxonomy: "News, Downloads, Support", or a tree, where each item has multiple sub-items for a finer granularity. Tagging is also a great way to categorize content. It allows you to create a taxonomy tree on the fly, and add a piece content to multiple "tags" at the same time.
