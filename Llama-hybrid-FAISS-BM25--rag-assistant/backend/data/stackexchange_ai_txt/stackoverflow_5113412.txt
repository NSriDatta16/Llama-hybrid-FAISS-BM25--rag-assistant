BlackBerry: Screen not scrolling on touch

I am building a BlackBerry Java application and I want my screen to scroll when I drag my finger on touch. This behavior works perfectly on other screens where I am implementing a ListField. However, on the screen where I am having an issue, I am subclassing FullScreen and simply adding a series of BitmapFields (with Field.NON_FOCUSABLE style) and RichTextFields (with Field.FOCUSABLE style) to the screen's main VerticalFieldManager. I have set the screen style to Manager.VERTICAL_SCROLL and scrolling works fine when using the navigation pad. It is only on touch events that the scrolling does not work. Any ideas on how to correct this? Thanks.
