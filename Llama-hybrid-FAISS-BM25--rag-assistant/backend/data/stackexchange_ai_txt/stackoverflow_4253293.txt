How to represent a number greater than the maximum value

How to represent values that exceed the max values of any particular data type (int, long ) ? I am thinking of having another storage space acting like a counter. Once the max value is crossed, the counter updates to say , the variable has exceeded the limit for "x" number of times. Is there some other efficient way of doing it ? How do we display the exact value ? P.S : Just a hypothetical question.
