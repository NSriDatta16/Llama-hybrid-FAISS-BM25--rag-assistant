Android - Screen Resolution and Screen Density

As per managing resources(images) in > Android 1.6 version, we need to keep different-resolutions image in Drawable-Hdpi, Drawable-Mdpi, Drawable-Lpi folder particularly. And as per this page: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html , In Low density section - there are three resolutions used: 240*320 , 240x400 , 240x432 for the Small screen, Normal Screen, Large Screen particularly. same way for Medium density section - there are three resolutions used: 320x480 , 480x800 , 480x854 for the Small screen, Normal Screen, Large Screen particularly. and same way for High density ........ but i am confused here: (1) How do i come to know that whether small, Normal or Large screen is used, i mean is there any way to know ? (2) How do i come to know which type of density i am using ? (3) And in Drawable-Hdpi, Drawable-Mdpi, Drawable-ldpi folder, which resolution's image we should keep particularly?
