@Glen_b has made some good points. Let me just state that I think neither is a reasonable thing to do. If you look at your data (I added a plot with the two lines overlaid for you), you can see that both look terrible. In addition, if we think about the nature of your situation, we see two issues. First of all, you have a time series , so the data are not independent and you should be skeptical of any standard line fitting technique that does not take the non-independence into account. Second, your data are counts , so you should be wary of methods based on the idea of normal distributions. If you wanted to look at drawing some lines for purely exploratory purposes, I might try lowess with different spans (although for even that to be useful, you will need more than 6 data--your use of head() suggests to me that you do).
