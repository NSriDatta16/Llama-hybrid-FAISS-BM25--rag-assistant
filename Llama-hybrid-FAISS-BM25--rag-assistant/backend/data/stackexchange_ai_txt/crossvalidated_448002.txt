Is having a high $p$ and $q$ evidence that ARIMA would be a better model than moving average?

It is my understanding than a time series having a high $p$ and $q$ would mean that the ARIMA model would be more complex as opposed to having, for example, $p = q = 1$ . My intuition tells me that if a time series supports being modeled with a higher $p$ and $q$ then I should not try using a moving average to predict future values, but a more complex model like ARIMA. Is there any research related to this? Thanks
