Importing Excel format data into R/R Studio and using glmnet package?

I have no problem importing Excel formatted data into R/R Studio and use all other R packages that I use. But, when I want to use the glmnet package to develop a regularization model, I invariably run into the following error (after specifying my regularization model and attempting to run it): Error in storage.mode(y) Here is what I have already tried to resolve this: De-format the numbers in Excel (no scientific notation, no %, etc.) Did copy-paste-special values several times At time of importing the spreadsheet, converted every column from "include" to "numeric" type After importing the data, converting it to a matrix. But, none of the above have eliminated the error.
