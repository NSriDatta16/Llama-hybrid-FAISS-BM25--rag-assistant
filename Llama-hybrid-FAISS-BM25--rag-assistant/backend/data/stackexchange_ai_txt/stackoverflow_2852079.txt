It sounds like you're concerned that definition 2 would allow for an infinite wait loop, but such a loop—being infinite —would not satisfy the requirement for completion within a finite number of steps . I take "wait-free" to mean that making progress does not require any participant to wait for another participant to finish. If such waiting was necessary, if one participant hangs or operates slowly, other participants suffer similarly. By contrast, with a wait-free approach, each participant tries its operation and accommodates competitive interaction with other participants. For instance, each thread may try to advance some state, and if two try "at the same" time, only one should succeed, but there's no need for any participants that "failed" to retry. They merely recognize that someone else already got the job done, and they move on. Rather than focusing on "waiting my turn to act", a wait-free approach encourages "trying to help", acknowledging that others may also be trying to help at the same time. Each participant has to know how to detect success, when to retry, and when to give up, confident that trying only failed because someone else got in there first. As long as the job gets done, it doesn't matter which thread got it done.
