Outlier filtering from time series data

I have time series data that I eventually want to cluster after using dimensionality reduction. I am thinking about how to handle outliers. The data has seasonal/periodic patterns. I have tried IQR and similar outlier filtering methods, but they are not optimal for my dataset due to their nature. Are there some outlier methods that would work well with this kind of data, where I try to find unusual patterns? I want to apply the outlier filtering to my raw data, even though theoretically, it could be used after dimension reduction or clustering. I have been thinking, for example, comparing daily averages, and if there are extremely high or low days compared to other days, that pattern makes it an outlier. But I think this only filters individual "bad" rows, but not rows where the all-year's pattern is strange.
