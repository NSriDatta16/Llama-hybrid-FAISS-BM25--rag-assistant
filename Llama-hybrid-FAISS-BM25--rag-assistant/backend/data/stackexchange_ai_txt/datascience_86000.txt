One Challenging Neural Network Question and MATLAB Simulation

I see this example ON NN notes: how this solution is achieved? is there any clear trick or usual step for solving this question quickly?I think the solution in the question be wrong. no idea anyway... please be aware that this is PhD entrance exam question and we should think the information is not enough in the question. some idea tell us that 5, 5 is answer because for NN there is no difference on condition (1) and (2) in the question. some idea tell us there is 3, 3 solution, but with complex neurons (this is not should used here in general, because this is general question even with lack of information) some idea tell us there is at least 5, 5 solution because we cannot model with 3 nodes here... (not for first reason) here one implementation of these structure in MATLAB for each case with 3 or 5 nodes and I think with $5$ we get the better result. $A) 4, 5$ $B) 5, 3$ $C) 5, 4$ $D) 5, 5$
