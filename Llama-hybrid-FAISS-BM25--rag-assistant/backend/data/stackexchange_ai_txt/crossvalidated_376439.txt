How can I tell if an Autoencoder is encoding my data properly?

Autoencoders can be classified as a method of unsupervised learning, and unsupervised learning often comes with a problem where it's hard to tell if the model is working properly. However, some unsupervised learning methods can still be classified by humans as functional or not by looking at the output of the model, such as K-Means. Thus, since autoencoders do not have this "feature" that K-Means has, I was wondering if there currently are any methods to clarify if the model is working. I'm guessing that if the autoencoder can regenerate the input data pretty accurately we can assume that our model is working, but is this a valid means of verification?
