How to install third party msi or exe or bin first and then when its done, start the main application?

Here is the problem, myapp.jar works and runs. But it has other native dependencies. It has other third party libraries dependencies, which need to be installed first in windows and linux/mac depending on the user platform. How the third_ party _will_it_install_or_just_download_only.exe OR third_ party _will_it_install_or_just_download_only.bin Can be installed automatically ? They are themselves separate installations also. > > href="advance.jnlp" > > > > > Test > Testing > > Demo > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >
