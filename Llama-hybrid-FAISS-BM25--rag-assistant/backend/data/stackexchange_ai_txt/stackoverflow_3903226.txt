How to add an eventListener to an Object in JavaScript which will fire when object is manipulated?

I have a complicated UI structure which is manipulated dynamically, and say I have an ui_state object where i keep user's latest UI states such as which tab was visible, what was inside that tab etc. For instance: var ui_states = { tabs : [ { name : "some tab", active : true, children : { ... } }, { name : "some other tab", children : { ... } } ] } I keep this on html5 localStorage and when user refreshes the site it reopens the page the same. Every time when the UI changes this object is changed accordingly. Just after changing it I need to run let's say updateLocalStorage() which is working perfectly. My question is for this flow, can I create a custom event to my ui_states object something like ui_states.addEventListener('onchange', function(){ // do stuff }) to not to run that updateLocalStorage() function every time when I manipulate the object?
