With plain vanilla logistic regression, you don't really need to normalize. There are also no assumptions made about the distribution of the covariates, only about the error, so you don't need to worry about covariate skew either. Sometimes when there are enormous scale differences across the covariates, changing the units to something sensible will help with convergence.
