I would look at some Bayesian classification methods. It would involve training the classifier to recognize particular words as indicating probability that a product belongs to one of your classes. For example, after being trained, it could recognize that if a product description has "Seagate" in it, there's a 99% chance that it's a hard drive, whereas if it has "Mazda" there's a 97% chance it's a car. A word like "new" probably would end up not contributing much to any classification, which is the way you want it to work. The downside to this would be that it typically requires fairly large corpora of training data before it starts to work well, but you can set it up so that it continues to modify its percentages while being in production (if you notice that it classified something incorrectly), and it will eventually become very effective. Bayesian techniques are used quite heavily recently for spam-filtering applications , so it might be good to do some reading on ways it's been used there.
