I'm not sure if ARIMA would be able to decompose the data into interprettable/decomposed time series. I used Proc UCM in SAS which is a state space model. Following is the code of a basic structural model. The data is decomposed into Trend (level+slope) + Seasonal and White noise (Irregular). There is not much white noise left after you model. I'm assuming this is what you were looking for. The model fits the data like a glove. If you have access to SAS, you can try running the following code, you can get the decomposed series. Level + Slope+ Seasonal + Irregular (not Shown). You could also try STL decomposition in R. ods graphics on; proc ucm data = data; id date interval = second; model value; irregular plot = smooth; level ; slope variance = 0 noest; season length = 80 ; dep lags = 2; forecast plot=(forecasts decomp) lead = 80 outfor=forecast; run ; ods graphics off ; Hope this is helpful.
