A recent paper which reviews approaches for dealing with missing values in PCA analyses is "Principal component analysis with missing values: a comparative survey of methods" by Dray & Josse (2015) . Some of the best known methods of PCA methods that allow for missing values are (1) the NIPALS algorithm (implemeted in the pca function of the pcaMethods package with method="nipals" and the nipals function of the ade4 package), (2) iterative PCA (Ipca or EM-PCA), implemented in the pca function of the pcaMethods package with method="svdImpute" and the imputePCA function of the missMDA package) and (3) Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) which is a variant of PCA that uses a probabilistic latent variable model, and which can be fit using the pca function of the pcaMethods package with method="ppca" . The paper concluded that the Ipca / EM-PCA method performed best under the widest range of conditions. For your example syntax is : For NIPALS (you can also use library(pcaMethods) & the pca function with method "nipals" ) : library(ade4) nipals(d[,c(1,2)]) For Ipca / EM-PCA (you can also use library(pcaMethods) & the pca function with method "svdImpute" ) : library(missMDA) imputePCA(d[,c(1,2)],method="EM",ncp=1)
