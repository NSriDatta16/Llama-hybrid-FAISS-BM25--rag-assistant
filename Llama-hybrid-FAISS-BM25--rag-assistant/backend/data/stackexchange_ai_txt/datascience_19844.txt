Why some people add results from PCA and other dimensional reductions techniques as features

I often see in a well-known datascience competition platform, that a lot of people apply some dimension reductions techniques, but instead of using it to reduce the number of features (complexity) of their models, they append the resulting features to their datasets. Is'nt that adding complexity to their model rather than simplifying it ?
