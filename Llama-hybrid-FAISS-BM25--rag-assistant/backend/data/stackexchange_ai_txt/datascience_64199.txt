@Amar, you can start with NLTK, Spacy, Flair and Polyglot to start with your NLP learning. They are easier to start and understand. You can create your own model for your language and contribute if you have the corpus available with you. The nouns, verbs are easier to capture in English when compared to Chinese, Korean and Arabic. Every language has it own beautiful representation of context. You would a good library that can read the language that you are developing. You can also try IBM Watson and AWS SageMaker on trial basis with check for Language detection.
