Redirecting in Admin Site

I have an app called CMS with Category and Article. Quite simple. I overwrite app_index.html to enable ajax-based drag-n-drop ordering and to move articles from one category to another. Now I would like to redirect after saving/deleting an article or a category to cms' app_index.html instead of the model's change_list.html . How can this be done? Thanks class Category(models.Model): order = models.IntegerField() title = models.CharField(max_length=100) text = models.TextField() class Article(models.Model): published = models.BooleanField(default=None) images = generic.GenericRelation(Photo) category = models.ForeignKey(Category) title = models.CharField(max_length=100) text = models.TextField() order = models.IntegerField(blank = True, null = True) Daniel's answer did half the job: Redirect after changing the articles and categories. A not very elegant solution: Redirection in urls.py def redirect_cms(response): return HttpResponseRedirect('/admin/cms/') urlpatterns += patterns('', (r'^admin/cms/article/$',redirect_cms), any other idea?
