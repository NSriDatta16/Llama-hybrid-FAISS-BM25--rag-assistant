The aov() and lm() functions generate a model object that contains quite a bit of data beyond the F-table for the analysis of variance that was in the original post. Of particular importance are the model coefficients. Without the coefficients we can't see whether the food or non-food products have a lower coefficient of innovation (the p parameter in the Bass diffusion model). In order to see the coefficients in an ANOVA model, one must save the model object and extract them. Analysis of Variance is useful when the data conforms to the linear model assumptions , including: Independence of observations Normal distribution of dependent variable & residuals Homogeneity of variances: variance of dependent variable is same across groups As an example, we will use the Crampton 1947 ToothGrowth data to assess whether supplement type (Orange Juice vs. Vitamin C) lead to different rates of growth in guinea pig odontoblasts, including printing of the model coefficients. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in growth of odontoblasts when guinea pigs are given Vitamin C versus Orange Juice. Our alternate hypothesis is that the growth rates are different. We'll set the rejection region for the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05, meaning that we're willing to take a risk of rejecting the null hypothesis 5% of the time when it is actually true. Here is the R code required for this analysis: library(datasets) data(ToothGrowth) aModel ...and the output. > aModel summary(aModel) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) supp 1 205 205.35 3.668 0.0604 . Residuals 58 3247 55.98 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > aModel$coefficients (Intercept) suppVC 20.66333 -3.70000 > How do we interpret the output? First, the Pr(>F) value of 0.0604 is greater than 0.05, our alpha level. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the supplement type (orange juice vs. vitamin C) leads to larger tooth growth in guinea pigs. Second, the coefficients tell us that the average growth for guinea pigs given orange juice is 20.6633 microns, and that the impact of giving vitamin C instead of orange juice was -3.70 microns. Note that in this specific analysis, a second variable, dose explains the effect of supp on len . I cover this in a more detailed article, Commentary of ToothGrowth Factorial ANOVA , where I compare the use of t-test() with aov() referencing an analysis from Robert Kabacoff's R in Action . Using t.test() As noted by one of the comments on the original post, t.test() may also be used for this type of analysis, and the output is somewhat easier to interpret than the output from aov() . oj ...and the output: > t.test(oj,vc,alternative="two.sided", + conf.level=0.95) Welch Two Sample t-test data: oj and vc t = 1.9153, df = 55.309, p-value = 0.06063 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.1710156 7.5710156 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 20.66333 16.96333 From the output we see that the oj vector has a mean of 20.66, and the vc vector has a mean of 16.96, or 3.7 less than oj . Since 0 is included in the 95% confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that tooth growth in guinea pigs is different when they are given orange juice versus a supplement of vitamin C.
