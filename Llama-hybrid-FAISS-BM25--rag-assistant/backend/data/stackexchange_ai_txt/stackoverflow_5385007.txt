Mouse Dragging Logic

Here is some code which makes a GCompound move correctly with dragging. public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { currentLabel.setLocation(e.getX()+DX, e.getY()+DY); } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { currentLabel = (coolLabel) getElementAt(e.getX(),e.getY()); DX = currentLabel.getX()-e.getX(); DY = currentLabel.getY()-e.getY(); currentLabel.sendToFront(); } Here it is without it moving correctly: public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { currentLabel.move(e.getX()+DX, e.getY()+DY); } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { currentLabel = (coolLabel) getElementAt(e.getX(),e.getY()); DX = -e.getX(); DY = -e.getY(); currentLabel.sendToFront(); } Can someone explain why this is so? Seems both versions of my code are using the same thinking... Basically in the first case I take the original GObject and set its location based on the difference from my original position, and in the second case I move the original object based on the difference from my original position.
