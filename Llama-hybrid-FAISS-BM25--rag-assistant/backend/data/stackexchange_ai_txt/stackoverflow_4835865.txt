Database implementation question?

consider a disk with a sector size of 512 bytes, 2000 tracks/surface, 50 sectors/track, 5 doubled sided platters, average seek time is 10 msec. Assume a block size of 1024-byte is selected. Assume a file that contains 100,000 records of 100-byte each is to be stored on the disk, and NONE of the reocd can be spanned 2 blocks. How many blocks are needed to store the entire file?? If the file is arranged sequentially on disk, how many surfaces are required?? Now, i have calculated that 10,000 blocks are needed to store 100,000 records. But i am not sure how to find out the answer of the surfaces required. I only calculated the capacity of track is 25KB and capacity of surface is 50,000 KB But I don't know how to calculate the number of surfaces... Could anyone help me how to get the answer? Thanks a lot!!
