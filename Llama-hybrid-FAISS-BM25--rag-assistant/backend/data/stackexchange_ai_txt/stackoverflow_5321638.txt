When you drag an image, your style is position: absolute; left: 745.5px; top: 788px; after you click on that image, the style is position: relative; left: -0.310859px; top: -43.3109px; . I don't know what your plugin does, but i think you should write your own jquery code. and this certainly is generating an error.
