Yep, leveraging AppDomains make a lot of sense here. I've recently reworked my Windows service to load its various WCF services as plug-ins that operate within their own AppDomain. I've got a few cases in the bootstrapping process where I'm using MarshalByRefObject objects to get things up and running, but once the plug-ins are loaded, communication between the AppDomains is extremely easy using WCF.
