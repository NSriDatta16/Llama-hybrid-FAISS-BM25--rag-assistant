You would not validly explain the use of OLS: If you interpret the OLS outcome as probability of outcome = 1, then your model says that it is possible for P$(Y=1) > 1$, and for P$(Y=1) Your errors are not distributed $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$, thus violating a fundamental OLS assumption. Although you write "None of the coefficients of my independent variable would result in my dependent variable crossing 0 (0%) and 1 (100%)." This seems patently false, although unintended I am sure, for any value of $\beta \ne 0$: your model must cross both $Y=0$ and cross $Y=1$ (regression lines are infinite): what is your OLS model's best guess as to the probability of $Y=1$ when your model says the probability is less than or equal to zero? (And vice versa?) You write "I am using OLS because I am interested in the one unit increase association between my independent (another percent) variable and my dependent variable." You seem unaware that logistic regression is interpretable. With logistic regression you can: answer the question "What is the change in $\ln(\text{odds}(Y))$ (the log odds of the probability of my dependent variable equals 1) given a 1-unit increase in my independent variable," or, if your prefer to talk about relative probability, rather than log odds, you can interpret $e^{\beta}$ as the answer to the question "What is the change in odds$(Y)$ given a 1-unit increase in my independent variable." As user777 has noted: you are misinformed about logistic regression and high (or any) prevalence biasing odds ratios.
