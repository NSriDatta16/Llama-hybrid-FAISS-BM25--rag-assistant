Making code smaller doesn't always mean it's easier to parse. It differs from language to language. In PHP for example, whitespace and line-breaks are encouraged since PHP's lexer first breaks the code up in bits starting with line-breaks and then whitespace. So I do not see a performance issue, unless less whitespace is used. Bad: ($var)?1:0; Good: ($var) ? 1 : 0; It doesn't seem like a big issue, but with lexing code in PHP, whitespace is essential. Plus, it also reads a bit better this way.
