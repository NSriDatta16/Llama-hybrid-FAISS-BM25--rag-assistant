NLP: can I use RNN if word order is NOT important? Or is CNN better?

I want to match users to job posts, hoping to write a neural network to pick up on keywords users are looking for. My initial thinking was recurrent neural networks (RNNs) since we're dealing with language-modeling. But keyword positions shouldn't be important (keyword invariance). Eg, both the following job titles should match positive: "Seeking React, React Native, Node, Postgres developer." "Senior web developer. We use Node and React. Ideally also familiar with PostgreSQL." My guess is that RNNs won't work here, and I should use CNNs instead since invariance is its specialty (at least with images). Alternatively, any other better-suited models than RNNs or CNNs?
