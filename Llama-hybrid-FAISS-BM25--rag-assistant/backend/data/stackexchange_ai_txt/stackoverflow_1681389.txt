Oh man this is so weird.. I found kind of a solution, thanks to all comments, which helped me to get on the right track, but still think this is a bug in Flex. First of all I have to add that (in my code) the MXML and AbstractWizardModel class are in the same package . The 'getButtonLabel()' function that I am calling is declared as [Bindable(event="getButtonLabelChanged")] public function getButtonLabel (buttonId:String) : String { .. } If I remove that [Bindable..] annotation, the code compiles. If I leave it there, I have to add an import for class AbstractWizardModel, although it is in the same package. Anyway, that fixes the problem, too. However :) FB4 removes that import everytime it organizes imports, so that user comment was helpful too. Happy to hear your thoughts!
