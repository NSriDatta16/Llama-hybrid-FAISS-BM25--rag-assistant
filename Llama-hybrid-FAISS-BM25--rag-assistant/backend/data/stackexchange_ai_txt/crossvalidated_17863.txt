As mentioned by the OP, this is probably not the right place for expert advice on legal issues, but we all have to live with such things as software licenses and try not to get into trouble, so here are a few things that I have learned. On the NR homepage you can find the license information and information on redistribution . This is solely a copyright issue regarding the source code provided in the books. The algorithms themselves are not copyrighted, and to my understanding you can't get into trouble by implementing and sharing an algorithm that happens to be in NR unless your implementation is derived from the source code distributed with NR. Hmm, nothing is free ... There is almost always a copyright holder. If the paper is published, the copyright may be transferred to the journal, but in some cases the author retain the right to distribute the paper via his or her homepage, say. Patent law is a completely different ball game, but I actually don't know of any examples related to statistical and machine learning algorithms where a patent protection of the algorithm was a problem. Hence, to me, the most important aspect regarding algorithms in papers, whether published in journals or on the authors homepage, is not to violate the copyright. A trademark is a third thing. To my understanding it protects only the name or symbol. So you just can't implement a program and call it "Random Forests", but you can implement and distribute the random forest algorithm. I have no idea if Frank Masci broke the law, but it is a copyright issue as I see it. Who holds the copyright and which rights did the copyright holder give to others? From my point of view, though violations of patent rights might be serious, the more important issue for the average statistician is that of copyright. If you implement an algorithm from a paper from scratch and cite the paper I don't see any obvious problem with distributing the implementation regardless of the media. But you might think about what is the best way for you to use your copyright on the implementation. I don't know anything about how blogs are generally copyrighted, but if the copyright is transferred to the blog owner automatically, it might, in principle, be a bad idea to post hours of valuable implementations on a blog and thereby effectively give up the copyright of the work to somebody else. If you, on the other hand, modify an existing implementation, you could run into problems with the copyright license. If the license for the original implementation is GPL , the license for the redistribution has to be GPL. Hence, you have to distribute in a way so that the distribution can be under GPL. This works the other way too. If you want to distribute an implementation under GPL but have to rely on a library that is not distributed under the GNU license, then you might not be able to include the library in your distribution $-$ even if the library is open source and "free". The library might be distributed under a copyright license that is incompatible with GPL.
