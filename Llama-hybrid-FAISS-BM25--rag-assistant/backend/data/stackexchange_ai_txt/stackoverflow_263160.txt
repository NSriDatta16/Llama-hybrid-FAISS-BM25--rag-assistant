YES. There are still multiple log-ins. I have to go and log in to my OpenID provider then I have to go to the site and log in again with the OpenID URL. No wants to do more work and OpenID is a lot more work. I know of no one who is not in the computer field that uses OpenID. OpenID is still just too complex. The average user doesn't need to be confused by another layer of abstraction. There is also the issue of tracking where The OpenID users go. I use VeriSign, a trusted name, but what about those who are using less trustworthy providers. No, I'm not going to name names and start a flame war. There is a better answer, it is called RoboForm (or one of the many knock-offs). All of the users passwords and names are kept on their machine and is encrypted. It is easy to use, more secure, and FASTER.
