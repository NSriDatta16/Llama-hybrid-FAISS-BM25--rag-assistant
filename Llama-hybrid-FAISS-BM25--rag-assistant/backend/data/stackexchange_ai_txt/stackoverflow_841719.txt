What does the error message "No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected." mean?

Yesterday I testet a lot on my device. Suddenly I get this error message when I hit Build & Go in Xcode. First, it asks me if it's ok to sign with my key. I click yes, and then that error message appears. My iPod is connected as usual, iTunes starts automatically and I close that to prevent interruptions. I tried restarting Xcode. Doesn't help. My Apple Dev Enrollment is brand new. Any idea what the problem might be? Edit : In Window > Organizer I can see this message: Your mobile device has encountered an unexpected error (0xE8000001) Try disconnecting and powering off the device; then power the device on and reconnect it. I restarted it with power-off, but I still get that message.
