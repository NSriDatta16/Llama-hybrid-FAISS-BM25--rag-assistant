There are (at least) two recent and comprehensive ML books: Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by Kevin Murphy. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron Both authors provide draft/raw versions for free online. The latter one however, as title already indicates, does not provide the same mathematical depth as the books by Kevin Murphy or Hastie et al.
