Linking to Boost.Signals using Xcode

I can't for the life of me get Xcode to link to Boost.Signals properly. I've built Boost using MacPorts, and I even went as far as downloading Boost myself and manually building it. I've set the Library Search Paths to include /opt/local/lib, and I've added "-lboost_signals-mt" to the Other Linker Flags. I've tried dragging and dropping the libraries into the Frameworks folder. I've tried adding the libraries to the build target. I always get the error that the "file is not of required architecture." Just to make sure the problem was with Xcode, I went ahead and wrote a makefile to build the project--it works fine, using the same linker flag shown above. Any ideas?
