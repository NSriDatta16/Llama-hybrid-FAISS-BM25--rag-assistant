How to estimate right-skewed distribution with very small sample size?

Suppose we have a data set consists of, say, 5 or 10 observations. The only thing we know about this set is that it came from a positive right skewed distribution. How can we fit a probability distribution to this data? Is there a paper or method (frequentist, Bayesian, nonparametric) that deals with such a problem?
