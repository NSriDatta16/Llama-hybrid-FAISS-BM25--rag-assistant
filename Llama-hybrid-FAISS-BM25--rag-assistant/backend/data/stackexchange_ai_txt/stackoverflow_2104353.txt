XML in COBOL with nested tables and varying children

Is it possible to use XML GENERATE to create XML with multi-level nested elements of different sizes? For example: 01 SOURCE-REC. 05 REPEATING-PARENT OCCURS 5 TIMES. 10 PARENT-NAME PIC X(7). 10 CHILD-COUNT PIC 9. 10 REPEATING-CHILD OCCURS 1 TO 5 TIMES DEPENDING ON CHILD-COUNT. 15 CHILD-NAME PIC X(6). Compiling this using Enterprise Cobol v4.1 yields: IGYGR1263-S "OCCURS DEPENDING ON" object "CHILD-COUNT" was defined as a table element. The "DEPENDING ON" phrase was discarded. IGYGR1116-S The "DEPENDING ON" object for table "REPEATING-CHILD" was invalid. The "DEPENDING ON" phrase was discarded. Not all parents are going to have the same number of children. How can this be addressed? Edit: I suppose at its heart, this isn't really an XML question. I hit a wall just trying to build the working storage that I later hope to feed into XML GENERATE.
