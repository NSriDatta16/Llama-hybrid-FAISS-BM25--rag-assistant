The open source Jedi VCL library contains a TJvAppXMLFileStorage class (in unit JvAppXMLStorage) which stores the settings in a XML file. TJvAppXMLFileStorage is a data storage backend that stores the data in an XML file. As a descendant of TJvCustomAppXMLStorage it provides the standard interface for storing data (such as settings, form positions and sizes, etc) in a XML file format. This data will be stored in an actual file, represented in memory through the use of a TJvSimpleXML object.
