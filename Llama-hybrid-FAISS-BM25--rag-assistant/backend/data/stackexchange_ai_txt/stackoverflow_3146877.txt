Which library should I use?

I need to design an interface, where user can drag drop elements into page and design a web page. User will be restricted to add elements only to content area and elements which are added to content area also can be nested. For example, an image can be nested inside a paragraph. I have tried using jquery and was successful up to some extent. I would appreciate if some one helps me to choose a stable, cross browser compatible library for this functionality. Thanks in Advance
