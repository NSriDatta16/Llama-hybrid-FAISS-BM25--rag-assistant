Can you obtain classification thresholds for specific features in a Random Forest?

Say I've created a random forest model for binary-classification prediction target of either "Pass" or "Fail" for a group of students based upon numerical features "Hours Studied" and "Amount of Sleep obtained." Is there a way to tell what SPECIFIC number of hours studied or amount of sleep obtained is the classification threshold for the model's prediction? For example, 6 hours of studied = Pass. Is there a way to determine this with a random forest model? Is this even possible or is my understanding off?
