Creating Access 2007 Subforms on a Tab Control

The main entity in my database has about a hundred fields. I organized the fields between many tables and added a 1-to-1 relationship between the tables. For data entry (and later data editing), I envision a "wizard" with a form for each table and a "Next" button to advance to the next screen/table. The primary key would be entered on the first screen and subsequently passed to all remaining screens. I have heard a tab control with subforms might be the way to go. What steps should I perform to create this wizard? Note: Use the following schema as a simplified example of my database. Sample Schema (can't upload images from work)
