Ok, got it working. Thanks for the tips Ricki! 2 things to add to Ricki's solution, if you want to avoid an infinite loop, you have to check to see whether the scrollView's tracking or dragged properties are set. This will insure that only the ScrollView that is actually being dragged is calling the delegate. - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *) theScrollView { if (theScrollView.dragging || theScrollView.tracking) [self.delegate scrolling:[theScrollView contentOffSet]]; } Also, in the scrolling method of the delegate, I set animated to NO, this got rid of the delay between the initial swipe and the other scrollviews getting updated.
