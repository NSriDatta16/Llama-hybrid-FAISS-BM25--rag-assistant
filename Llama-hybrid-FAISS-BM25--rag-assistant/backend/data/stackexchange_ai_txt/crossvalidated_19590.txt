Why does the Breusch-Pagan test fail?

How Breusch-Pagan can't reject the null for a series like that? > x = c(rnorm(10), rnorm(100,sd=10), rnorm(100,sd=25)) > mod = lm(x[-1]^2~x[-210]^2) > plot(mod$res,type='l') > bptest(mod) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: mod BP = 1.1085, df = 1, p-value = 0.2924 The variance change drastically, could someone explain the reason?
