Your code doesn't prepend/append twice at this end. When I run it against this test HTML Testing One Two Three ...I end up with each paragraph in quotes (just one pair, not two). Perhaps your CSS is applying the quotes (look at the quo and ldquo / rdquot CSS classes), and then of course you're also including them in your markup, and so ending up with two of each.
