I guess this is a reported bug in Magento. Apparently if you apply the design change to a store that is not the 'All store views'(like the local machine view), then the design changes wont propagate properly. If this occurs, the you can get Magento apply the updated design by selecting the template in the 'Custom Design' tab on the root category(make sure to apply changes to child elements as well). I reverted these changes and the theme finally stuck. http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/35761/
