I'll state my bias upfront - Oracle is far more complex than Sql Server. So it depends what you'll be asked to do. You say that this is not for a DBA position but that definition is pretty fluid. At my company, Developers are charged with designing tables, adding the correct indexes, determining partitioning. If you say, all I'll do is code in java or c# and call packages written by a DBA or Oracle Developer, then you are safe. But if you take all of your MSSS experience and add semi-colons to the end of your lines you'll kill your Oracle instance. Many standard practices in MSSS are anethema to Oracle. In MSSS it's recommended to have clustered indexes on most every table. In Oracle we build IOTs (Index Organized Tables) only for specific purposes. In MSSS doing DDL in T-SQL is as easy as falling off a log. In Oracle it is made difficult on purpose, it's discouraged and in fact somewhat dangerous. In MSSS you whip off #temp table like they're jelly beans, in Oracle we plan them in advance since they are permanent database objects that aren't just created in the middle of a proc when the logic gets a little tricky. That said, would you be able to make Oracle do something? Well, yah, but the real question is will it work efficiently and scale to meet the needs of the business your agent placed you at. And that's a resounding no.
