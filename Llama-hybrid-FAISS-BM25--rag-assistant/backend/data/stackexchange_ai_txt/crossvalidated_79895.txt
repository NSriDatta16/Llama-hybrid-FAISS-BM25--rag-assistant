You can use some standard Kalman Filter package in R for this - sspir, dlm, kfas, etc. I feel that KF is a much more developed area than online-learning, so it may be more practical. You may use a model $$y_t = \beta_t\cdot x_t + \varepsilon_t, \\ \beta_t = \beta_{t-1}+ \eta_t$$ to allow your regression coefficients to slowly vary with time and KF will re-estimate them on each step (with constant time cost) based on most recent data. Alternatively, you can set them constant $$\beta_t = \beta_{t-1}$$ and KF will still re-estimate them on each step but this time assuming they are constant and just incorporating new observed data to produce better and better estimates of same coefficients values. You can formulate similar model for logistic regression, $$y_t = logit(\beta_t\cdot x_t + \varepsilon_t), \\ \beta_t = \beta_{t-1}+ \eta_t$$ as it will be non-linear, you will need to use non-linear filtering method from above packages - EKF or UKF.
