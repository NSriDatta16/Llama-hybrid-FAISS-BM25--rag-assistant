This line: accelerationX = acceleration.x * 0.05 + accelerationX * (1.0 - 0.05); is a low-pass filter, which works by computing a moving average of the x acceleration. In other words, each time that callback is called, you're only moving the accelerationX by 5% towards the new accelerometer value. That's why it takes many iterations before accelerationX reflects the new orientation. What you should do is increase the 0.05 value, to say 0.2 . I'd make a global #define and play around with different values along with different refresh rates.
