MySQL database size

Microsoft SQL Server has a nice feature, which allows a database to be automatically expanded when it becomes full. In MySQL, I understand that a database is, in fact, a directory with a bunch of files corresponding to various objects. Does it mean that a concept of database size is not applicable and a MySQL database can be as big as available disk space allows without any additional concern? If yes, is this behavior the same across different storage engines?
