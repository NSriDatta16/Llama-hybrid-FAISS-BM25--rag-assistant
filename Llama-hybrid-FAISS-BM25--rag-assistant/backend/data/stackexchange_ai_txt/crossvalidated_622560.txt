Access to the interaction of two three level factors on a mixed model

Using a mixed model (either frequentist lmer or bayesian brms) I have an issue regarding an interaction in my model. I have two factor variable of three level : condition (0-1-2) and Tps_real (0-300-600). I am running a model such as Tps_estimated ~ condition*Tps_real (condition|subject) The output is Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 373.794 16.238 53.734 23.019 I know and understand that the model use the first level of my factor to make the comparison, so for instance the first line of the output Tps_Real300 give the results against the of Tps_Real0. The same for Condition1 that is against Condition0. However, I don't understand why in my interaction Tps_Real:Condition I do not see the Tps_Real0:Condition1 and Tps_Real0:Condition2 which are supposed to be against Tps_Real0:Condition0. Could someone explain me either why it is the case or how I can make this contrast appear in my model. Or more specifically, do you have a suggestion to have my Tps_Real0:Condition1 and Condition2 referenced on Tps_Real0:Condition0?
