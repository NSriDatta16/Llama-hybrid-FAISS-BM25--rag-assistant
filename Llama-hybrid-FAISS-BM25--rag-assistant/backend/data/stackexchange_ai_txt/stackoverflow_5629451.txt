I would strongly suggest simply getting rid of your use of thread-local storage, or at least coming up with a method to clear the thread-local storage when a request first enters the pipeline (with a in web.xml, for example). Having to reconfigure something basic about Tomcat to get it to work with your app points to a code smell.
