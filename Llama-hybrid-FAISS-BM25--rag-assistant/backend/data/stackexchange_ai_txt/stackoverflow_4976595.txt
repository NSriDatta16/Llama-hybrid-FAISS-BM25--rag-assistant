ASP.NET SessionState mode SQLServer serialization with protobuf-net

Problem Background I have been thinking of ways to optimize the out of state storage of sessions within SQL server and a few I ran across are: Disable session state on pages that do not require the session. Also, use read-only on pages that are not writing to the session. In ASP.NET 4.0 use gzip compression option. Try to keep the amount of data stored in the session to a minimum. etc. Right now, I have a single object (a class called SessionObject) stored in the session. The good news is, is that it is completely serializable. Optimizing using protobuf-net An additional way I thought might be a good way to optimize the storage of sessions would be to use protocol buffers (protobuf-net) serialization/deserialization instead of the standard BinaryFormatter. I understand I could have all of my objects inherit ISerializable, but I'd like to not create DTO's or clutter up my Domain layer with serialize/deserialize logic. Any suggestions using protobuf-net with session state SQL server mode would be great!
