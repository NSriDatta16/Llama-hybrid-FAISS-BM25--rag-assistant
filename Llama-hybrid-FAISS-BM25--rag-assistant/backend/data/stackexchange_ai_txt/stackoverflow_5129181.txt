is it possible for php to know and echo the full current link all the way from the first httpL//.... till #anchorxxx ? No. The fragment identifier is handled purely by the client. It is never sent to the server. Whats the php function to show the entire current url? If you exclude the fragment identifier you can join it up from the various bits in $_SERVER . http://dev.kanngard.net/Permalinks/ID_20050507183447.html has more details.
