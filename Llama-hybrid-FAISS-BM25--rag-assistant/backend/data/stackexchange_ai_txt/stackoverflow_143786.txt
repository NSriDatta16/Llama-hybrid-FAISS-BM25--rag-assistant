This is a pretty good list. The two topics I would definitely add to the mix are discrete math, and networks. Other topics that may be interesting to you are compilers, computer graphics, distributed operating systems. There are also cool sub-fields of AI, like computer vision and machine learning. And in order to handle all that, you definitely need linear algebra and probability. And it goes without saying that you cannot really do computer science by just reading books. To really understand each topic, you have to do projects in it. I would also suggest looking at MIT's Open Courseware, where professors post syllabus, lecture notes, and assignments.
