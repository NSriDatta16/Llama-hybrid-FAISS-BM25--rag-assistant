Logistic regression - Sample period longer than outcome period

In a credit risk model, the probability of defaulting 18 months in the future is estimated as a function of a set of characteristics $x$. We index individuals with $i$ and periods with $t$. An outcome variable $y^i_t$ is constructed so that: $y^i_t = 1$ if $Default^i_{t+18m} = 1$ $y^i_t = 0$ if $Default^i_{t+18m} = 0$ Then the regression has the form: $logit(y^i_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^i_t +...$ However, due to very few observations data from 60 months is aggregated and the regression is ran on the aggregated sample . My main concern is that in the new sample there will be observations for the same clients at period $t$ and $t+18$ so that: $logit(y^i_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^i_t +...$ $logit(y^i_{t+18}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^i_{t+18} +...$ Could this be a cause of endogeneity and other problems? For example, since $y^i_t = Default^i_{t+18}$ , If the default in any period depends on the characteristics for that period so that: $Default^i_{t+18} = f(x^i_{t+18})$ then we would be estimating $f(x^i_{t+18}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^i_t +...$ Furthermore, the default flag is very correlated across time, i.e. once an individual defaults at $t$ it will also be defaulted at $t+18$ so that: if $Default^i_t = 1$ then $Default^i_{t+18m} = 1$ Any reference to relevant literature will be highly appreciated. Thanks!
