Simulate multiple forecasts with fixed accuracy

I have a time series forecast along with actual historical data, and its accuracy (MAPE, probability coverage etc.) is calculated. Now I want to estimate how improving some or all of the accuracy measures would affect a business KPI (which can be directly calculated from the forecast). I thought that I could simulate multiple forecasts with fixed accuracy (e.g. MAPE = current_MAPE - 1%) and get an empirical distribution of the KPI. What would be a proper approach to generate such forecasts?
