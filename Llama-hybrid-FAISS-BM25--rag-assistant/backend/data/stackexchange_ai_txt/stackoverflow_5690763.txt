Well, there'd be a lot more elegant solutions if you were actually using objects ... That being said, just pass in something on the command line that says you want to manually control the game: public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 1 && args[0].equals("debug")) SMLD(); else SML(); In your SMLD() method you'd take input from the command line and control the game manually.
