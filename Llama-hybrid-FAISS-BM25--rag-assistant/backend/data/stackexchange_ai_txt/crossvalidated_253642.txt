Why do not we use just one FC for that? Why this hierarchical arrangement of the fully connected layers is possibly more useful? For the same reason as why two-layer fully connected feedforward neural networks may perform better than single-layer fully connected feedforward neural networks: it increases the capacity of the network, which may help or not. Note that the last fully connected feedforward layers you pointed to contain most of the parameters of the neural network: ( source ) The number of last fully connected feedforward layers is empirically chosen. Sometimes having only one is good enough, e.g. GoogLeNet:
