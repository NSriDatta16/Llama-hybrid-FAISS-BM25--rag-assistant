Google Search Appliances versus Microsoft Enterprise Search (FAST)

I am .NET developer and I have been working with various search providers but Google Search Appliance/Mini has been always the best fit for requirements when implementing enterprise level search. I have not worked yet on Microsoft Enterprise Search so I would like to hear developers experiences on it. These days I am getting a lot Enterprise Search sales propaganda from Microsoft telling me that FAST is really great. Does Microsoft have products like Google Mini (cheaper, limited API) and Google Search Appliance (expensive enterprise with API)? If we take all sales talk out of it and just look these two products side-by-side what are advantages for developers and on Microsoft Enterprise Search when comparing to Google Enterprise solution? Update: I was searching some more info in this subject and it seems that FAST is really focusing more on unstructured data where Google Appliance is more for searching web/intranet pages. Is this true?
