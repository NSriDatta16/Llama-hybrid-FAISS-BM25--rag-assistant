Perhaps DataTable ? Or just use an xml DOM ( XmlDocument or XDocument ) as data-storage? Neither is ideal, of course - but there is little point creating a type at runtime just for this if your real code will ever see it. What purpose would the extra class type serve? Among other issues you'd have to use lots of reflection just to talk to it. The other option is a custom property-bag and IXmlSerializable , but that is effort.
