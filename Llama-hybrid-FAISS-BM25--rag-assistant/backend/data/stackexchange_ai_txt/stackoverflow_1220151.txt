If you're worried about the validation: text-decoration: blink; is still valid CSS You could do it the AJAX way ;) Having elements which blink can definitely be very annoying to your users, but, as with everything, don't pay too much attention to the rules which include the word "never". Right now in my operating system there are blinking icons to alert me to things which need my attention. In whatever web application you're making, you could have a similar situation. Just remember to use it sparingly...
