.NET namespaces

My background is primarily as a Java Developer, but lately I have been doing some work in .NET. So I have been trying to do some simple projects at home to get better at working with .NET. I have been able to transfer much of my Java experience into working with .NET (specifically C#), but the only thing that has really perplexed me is namespaces. I know namespaces are similar to Java packages, but as from what I can tell the main difference is that with Java packages they use actual file folders to show the seperation, while in .NET it does not and all the files reside in a single folder and the namespace is simply declared in each class. I find this odd, because I always saw packages as a way to organize and group related code, making it easier to navigate and comprehend. Since in .NET it does not work this work this way, overtime, the project appears more overcrowded and not as easy to navigate. Am I missing something here? I have to be. Should I be breaking things into separate projects within the solution? Or is there a better way to keep the classes and files organized within a project? Edit: As Blair pointed out this is pretty much the same question asked here .
