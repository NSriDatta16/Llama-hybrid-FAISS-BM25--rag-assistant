what should be done first, handling missing data or dealing with data types?

In data science, Which process should come first, handling missing data or handling data types. I am asking this question because I have problem in following cases: 1) Handling Missing data first, then handling data types - It would be difficult to handle missing data for categorical columns 2) Handling data types first, then handling missing data - if we create dummies for catergorical values, it might happen that while handling missing data, we might assign two different categories to same row.
