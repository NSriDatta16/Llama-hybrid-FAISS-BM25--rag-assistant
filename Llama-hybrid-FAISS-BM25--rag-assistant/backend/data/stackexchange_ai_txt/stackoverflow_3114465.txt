That's the whole point of that meta tag, isn't it? The moment you have this: IE8 starts behaving on the client-side as IE7: Your pages will all render as they would in IE7 Your conditional comments targeting anything older than IE8 ( ) will also be read, and the code inside executed, so ie.css is loaded However, the IE7 switch only takes place after IE8 reads that meta tag. Since your HTML is returned as part of the response, IE8 has to request it first. Since IE8 has no idea beforehand that this meta tag would appear, the user-agent string it sends is MSIE 8.0 . PHP then recognizes it as IE8.
