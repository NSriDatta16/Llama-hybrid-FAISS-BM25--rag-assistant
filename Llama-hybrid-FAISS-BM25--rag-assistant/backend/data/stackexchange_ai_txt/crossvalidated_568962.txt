Heteroskedacity and non-normality - What to do?

I conducted an experiment in which I am trying to model the relationship between my response weed_coverage [%] and the predictors soil moisture [%] + treatment + distance. Weed_coverage and soil_moisture are continuous, treatment and distance are categorical with 2 levels each. I measured soil moisture on 5 dates, at 7 kettleholes each date and at 8 subplots per each kettlehole, with 4 measurements per each subplot. I checked diagnostic plots for the model mod_1 and to me it looks like I am dealing with non-normality and heteroskedacity of residual errors of Y. Also I have non-independent observations. As far as I see it I have these options: Transform Y to get rid of non-normality + use robust standard errors with the sandwich package and apply a linear mixed model Use a better fitting distribution for Y , e.g Beta and apply a generalized linear mixed model (with a beta response) I did a GLMM with a beta response, but to me the results are very unintuitive to interprete, because you get log-odds or whatever and I dont really understand those. I heard that transforming Y is not optimal either. Below are the diagnostic plots So what do you think? What is the best option in my case? I am new to statistics, so I am looking for the "simplest" approach that still delivers adequate reliable results and is easy to interprete and understand. Thanks a lot for your help
