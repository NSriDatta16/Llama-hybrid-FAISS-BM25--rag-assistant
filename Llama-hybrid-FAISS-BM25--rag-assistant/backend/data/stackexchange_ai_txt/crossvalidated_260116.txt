When to use Gaussian mixture model?

I am new to using GMMs. I was not able to find any appropriate help online. Could anyone please provide me right resource on "How to decide if using GMM fits to my problem?" or in case of classification problems "How to decide if I have to use SVM classification or GMM classification?"
