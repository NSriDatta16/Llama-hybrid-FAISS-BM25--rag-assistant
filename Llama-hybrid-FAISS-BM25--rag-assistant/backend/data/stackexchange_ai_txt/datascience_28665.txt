This is a great place to start! While not catalogued in a "process flow", Daniel Jurafsky's book, "Speech and Language Processing" talks through the various calculations and steps related to analyzing text that you will find useful. The reason I say that a process flow is not provided is because Jurafsky - in great detail - explains the pros and cons of particular methods applied throughout a pipeline, and how this could change results. As an example, when calculating perplexity (an inverse metric that quantifies how well a language model can predict the next word in a statement), you should capture beginnings, ends, and stop words of statements - as opposed to other methods that require the removal of stop words.
