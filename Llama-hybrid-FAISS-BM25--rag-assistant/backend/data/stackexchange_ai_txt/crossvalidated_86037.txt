As @Clayton pointed out sample autocorrelation function cannot tell if series is non-stationary. Problem is that there is various levels of non-stationarity, deterministic OR stochastic trends are just one way time series to be non-stationary. Non-constant variance can be also problem even when expected value is independent of time since confidence intervals based on simple sample statistics are invalid.
