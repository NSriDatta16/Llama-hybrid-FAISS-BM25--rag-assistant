I missed that FAQ entry. Anyway, for future reference, the complete query is: SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='{table_name}'; Where {table_name} is the name of the table to check. Documentation section for reference: Database File Format. 2.6. Storage Of The SQL Database Schema This will return a list of tables with the name specified; that is, the cursor will have a count of 0 (does not exist) or a count of 1 (does exist)
