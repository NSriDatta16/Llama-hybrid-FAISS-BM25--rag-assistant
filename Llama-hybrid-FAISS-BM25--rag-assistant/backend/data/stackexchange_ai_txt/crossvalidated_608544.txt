Way of making odds ratios more manageable from logistic regression

In R I have fitted a logistic model for polygenic risk scores in cases and controls as well as a number of covariates : model The PRS column have values from around -0.1 to 0.2 The summary of my model looks like this: Apologies for the picture but I work in a data airlock so can't copy paste out. I am trying to work out the oddsratios of the ldpred_beta_sum when factoring all the other variables. exp(coef(model)[2] ldpred_beta_SUM 116.549 Does this mean per integer increase the odds of developing the disease increase by 116? In reality everyone has scores Ultimately I would like to know the odds ratio of having the disease given the PRS, ideally on some kind of scale. Many thanks for the help!
