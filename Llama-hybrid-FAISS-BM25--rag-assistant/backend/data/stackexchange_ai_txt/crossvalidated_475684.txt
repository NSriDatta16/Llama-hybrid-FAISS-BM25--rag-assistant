I think the problem here is one of notation. The notation $X \sim p_G$ as used in the GAN paper is not meant to indicate $X$ is distributed according to $p_G$ , but rather sampled from $p_G$ . Of course this raises the problem about why the following equality holds in the proof: $$ \mathbb{E}_{Z \sim p_Z}\left[ \log (1-D(G(z))\right] = \mathbb{E}_{X \sim p_G}\left[ \log (1-D(X)\right]$$ This is effectively a change of variables provided $G^{-1}$ exists. If not, one can use the result of the Radonâ€“Nikodym theorem to change the measure.
