I think you're referring to measuring effect size in Cohen's D. If so, the effect size would be the difference in means, divided by the pooled standard deviation. So, let's say you're looking at groups' comprehension scores on a test. Let's say your control group scores an average of 50, standard deviation 10. And let's say your treatment group scores an average of 57.5, standard deviation 5. Then the Cohen's D would be = (57.5-50) / ((10+5)/2) = 1 (Note that this assumes equal sized control and treatment groups. Deriving the pooled standard deviation is actually a bit more complicated than averaging the two groups' standard deviations, if the two groups have different sample sizes. See wikipedia page on Cohen's d , for example.) In your code, 0.15 refers to the minimum effect size (in Cohen's D) that you want to be powered to detect. What this means for your data depends on your samples' standard deviation(s). You haven't collected the data yet, so you'll have to make assumptions here based on similar past experiments, the literature, your judgement, etc. Researchers often run multiple power calculations using different assumptions and create a table that shows the various sample sizes required given these different assumptions. For example, you could look at the sample sizes needed given various effect sizes, and/or given various standard deviation(s).
