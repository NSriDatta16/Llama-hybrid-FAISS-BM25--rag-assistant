In neural networks, how to tell the feature which contributes the most to the output value?

I have a neural network which uses input features $N$, some input layers $L$ which predict a continuous variable $X$. Can we say which features or combination of 2 features of the initial $N$ features contribute the most to the change in $X$? Example: Suppose I am trying to predict the house prices on basis of number of rooms, area of house, porch area, length, width. Can I identify the feature $x$ or combination of 2 features that causes the most change in prices of house? I was thinking of a brute force approach by varying one feature and keeping rest constant and see varies the prices the most. If there's a standard way, please share some resources to read.
