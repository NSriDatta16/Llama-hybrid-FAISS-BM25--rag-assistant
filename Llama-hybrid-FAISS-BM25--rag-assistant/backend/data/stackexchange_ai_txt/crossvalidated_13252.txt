Using Cleveland dot plots to visualize time-series data

When I'm dealing with time-series data I'm generally thinking about visualizing that data with a bar graph (small n) or a line plot (large n). For example, I might create something like the below: However, is there any instance in which a dot plot can be used to visualize time-series data? ( a clevland dot-plot is what I mean, with dates on y-axis and values on the x-axis) Here's the data and code I used for the previous graph. conv = c(10, 4.76, 17.14, 25, 26.47, 37.5, 20.83, 25.53, 32.5, 16.7, 27.33) click = c(20, 42, 35, 28, 34, 48, 48, 47, 40, 30, 30) dat EDIT: My question may not have been clear. I'm NOT asking how to generate a cleveland dot plot. I'm asking whether it's all right to use a cleveland dot plot to visualize time series data. According to the 'statistical visualization rulebook', are cleveland dot plots a good way to represent time series data?
