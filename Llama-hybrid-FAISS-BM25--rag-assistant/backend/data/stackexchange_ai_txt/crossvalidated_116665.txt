Answering your second question first: Should I maintain the same ratio as in real data or I should distribute entries evenly? In my opnion, it makes sense to maintain the same proportion of classes as in the complete set of data. Typically, there is a reason why this distribution is skewed (e.g., it may be naturally observed in the event being studied) and hence learning in the presence of this skew would help to generalize better to the unseen samples. This would be my suggestion in the general case. Subjectively, things could be different. And, of course, you will then have to be careful about how you evaluate the performance of your classifier. There is literature on how to handle such skewed cases. Now, to answer your first question: How should I distribute entries according to classes? You could use stratified folds to prepare your training sets. This will let you maintain the proportion of the classes in your training folds as in the complete data. I am not sure if you work with Python, but to get you started, scikit-learn , a popular Python package for machine learning, has this provision for you in sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedKFold .
