Example of auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model

I need simple example of ARIMA model, that performs forecasting on a small time series set e.g., (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4), (x5,y5), (x6,y6) I found many definitions from various placesâ€¦ but I couldn't find a solved example.
