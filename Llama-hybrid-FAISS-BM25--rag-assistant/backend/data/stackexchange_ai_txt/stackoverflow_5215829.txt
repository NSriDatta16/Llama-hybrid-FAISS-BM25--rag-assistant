I would highly suggest using Mercurial. With visual studio, there is a free plugin http://visualhg.codeplex.com/ . In addition, there is a windows shell package you can install called tortiseHG which makes it super easy to deal with Mercurial in windows. http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/ There are other plugins that you can use for SVN and GIT. For GIT, you might use msysGIT, which again has nice shell integration features: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ As well as visual studio extensions http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/ For SVN, there is AnkhSVN http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/ If you havent used alot of SCM's, I would highly recommend trying out Mercurial. Distributed SCM's are quickly becoming the optimal way to deal with source control. It's just the right way to do things. Here are a couple of resources to get you started if you are interested in Mercurial: Excellent tutorial by Joel Spolsky: http://hginit.com/ Thorough coverage of Mercurial features: http://hgbook.red-bean.com/ Best of Luck.
