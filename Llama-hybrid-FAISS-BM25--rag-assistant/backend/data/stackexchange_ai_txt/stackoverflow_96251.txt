Methods must always be complete, compilable code; macros may be code fragments. Thus you can define a foreach macro: #define foreach(list, index) for(index = 0; index And use it as thus: foreach(cookies, i) printf("Cookie: %s", cookies[i]); Since C++11, this is superseded by the range-based for loop .
