Logistic Regression: Using weights?

I am running a logistic regression model with the following data and variables: Independent variables (characteristics of a person coded as dummy) Test score (continuous variable between 0 and 1) Education (dummy variable for Ivy league degree; categorical variable for type of major) Age (discrete variable) Dependent variable (person's performance at task) Task is to select a company that will be successful at given point in time (success is coded as dummy variable: 0: fail, 1: success -- based on a definition from the specific literature) I want to run the regression such that each combination of person-task (task meaning company selected) is one observation. There are 2 issues I am not sure how to account for in the model: Most persons completed a different amount of tasks at different points in time (some selected only 5 companies, others 60), thus I am concerned that those with more observations will be weighted more heavily. Some persons selected the same companies, thus they share the same outcome (success or failure) and hence, I am concerned that some outcomes are overweighted if a company was chosen several times by different persons (one person cannot choose the same company more than once). How can I account for this in the logistic regression model? I have been looking at using weights and clustering standard errors , but I am not sure if this is entirely correct. Thank you in advance for your help!
