"In short: Is there some rational, technical explanation for Oracle's seemingly piss poor error feedback, or is this more likely the result of a lack of motivation (on Oracle's part) to improve due to their almost 'monopolistic' popularity status? " Bear in mind that Oracle is a venerable technology, stretching back thirty years. There is a huge extant code base. So changing fundamental behaviours could have widespread ramifications. Whether you regard that as a "rational" or "technical" explanation is a matter of taste. Most of us who use Oracle databases have learned to live with its quirks. for instance, it is a simple matter to reveal the table responsible for an ORA-00942 error: prompt Dropping non_existent_table drop table non_existent_table / It's not elegant but then not knowing the condition of our target schema is far from elegant. In fact, blindly issuing DROP TABLE statements is the blunderbuss approach to schema management. "this also begs the question of whether other competing (particularly OSS) DBs provide any better feedback" Certainly the equivalent MySQL error, MySQL Error: 1146, names the table. Of course, Oracle now owns MySQL, so its status as a competing DBMS is debatable :)
