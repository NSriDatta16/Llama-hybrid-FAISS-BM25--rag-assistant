Logistic regression requires ten events (i.e., 1s) per predictor entered in the model. If this is violated, parameter estimates and hypothesis tests are invalid. That is the case here. You are getting wild estimates because the data cannot support the model you proposed. You should not trust any of the coefficient estimates. In general, massive coefficients arise due to perfect separation, which means that the variable perfectly predicts whether a zero or one was observed. This is a frequently asked-about topic here, so you can search for it to find causes and solutions. Some of the solutions (e.g., Firth's bias-corrected logistic regression) may not be available in SPSS. The solution to your problem is to get more data. Logistic regression is a large-sample method. If you can't do that, you can't test your hypotheses.
