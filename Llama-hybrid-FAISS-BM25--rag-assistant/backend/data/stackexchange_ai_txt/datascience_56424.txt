The gradient of the average error doesn't always equal to the average gradient of errors. The source for the difference between them lies in the non-linear layers of the model. Example: You can easily see it in the following example with the gradient of the sigmoid function: The sigmoid function is defined as: It has a very convenient derivative: We now take 2 inputs and calculate the mean of the sigmoid's gradient with respect to them: We now calculate the sigmoid's gradient with respect to their mean: These 2 results are clearly not the same. If you want further proof, just calculate the numerical results for: You will get that the mean gradient is ~0.2233, and the gradient of means is ~0.235.
