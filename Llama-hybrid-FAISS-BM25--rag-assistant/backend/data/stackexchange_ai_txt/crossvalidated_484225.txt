Here is an approach using the maximum observation (the sufficient statistic for $\theta),$ rather than the sample mean and standard deviation. (Of course $\mu = \theta/2$ can also be estimated by $\bar X,$ but with more variability; see Notes at end.) Let $W$ be the maximum of $n=10$ observations from $\mathsf{Unif}(0, \theta).$ Then it is not difficult to show that $W/\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(n, 1):$ $$P\left(\frac{W}{\theta} \le w\right) = P(U_1 \le w, \dots U_{10} \le w)\\ = \prod_{i=1}^{10} P(U_i \le w) = w^n,$$ for $U_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim}\mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ and $0 \le w \le 1.$ This is the CDF of $\mathsf{Beta}(10,1).$ Thus for $n=10,$ $$P\left(L \le \frac{W}{\theta}\le U\right) = P\left(\frac{W}{U} \le \theta \le \frac{W}{L}\right) = 0.95,$$ where $L$ and $U$ cut probability 0.025 from the lower and upper tails, respectively, of $\mathsf{Beta}(10, 1).$ A 95% CI for $\theta$ is of the form $(W/0.9975,\, W/0.6915).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975),10,1) [1] 0.6915029 0.9974714 In particular, consider the simulated sample of size $n=10$ below from $\mathsf{Unif}(0, 15).$ The maximum is $W = 14.9248$ and a 95% confidence interval for $\theta$ is $(14.96. 21.58).$ set.seed(822) x = runif(10, 0, 15) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu.

The page linked above uses the mean and variance of a sample of size $n=10$ from $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ to get CIs for $\mu.$ A simulation shows that nominal "95%" CIs really have coverage probability about $94.7\%$ and proposes a more exact interval based on midrange and range. This page uses a sample of size $n = 10$ from $\mathsf{Unif}(\mu-.5,\mu+.5)$ and an Answer shows that $\bar X \stackrel{aprx}{\sim}\mathsf{Norm}(\mu, \sigma=1/\sqrt{12n}),$ which is used to make a 95% CI.
