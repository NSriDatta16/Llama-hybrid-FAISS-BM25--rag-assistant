Symfony 1.4: use relations in fixtures with propel

I just started to use the PHP symfony framework. Currently I'm trying to create fixture files in YAML to easily insert data into my MySQL database. Now my database has a couple of relations, I have the tables Organisation and Location. Organisation org_id (PK) org_name Location loc_id (PK) org_id (FK) loc_name Now I'm trying too link these tables in my fixture file, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how. Since the org_id is auto-incremented I can't simply use org_id: 1 In the location fixture. How can I fix this?
