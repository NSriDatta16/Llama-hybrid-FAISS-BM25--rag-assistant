No, the Oracle bug database is not public. It is available to Support customers through My Oracle Support (the website formerly known as Metalink). If your organisation pays for support you can register on MOS. You will need to know your CSI number. Then you'll have to wait while your organisation's account administrator authorises your registration. If you don't have a support contract you're out of luck. Oracle's Support sales comprise pretty much all of its profit margin , which is why they're keen for us to shell out.
