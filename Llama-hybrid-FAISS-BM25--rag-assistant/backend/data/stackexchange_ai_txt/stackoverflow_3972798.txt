What are some 3rd party UI components for .NET MVC 2?

I'm looking for a 3rd party UI component library to be used in .NET 4.0 C# MVC2 web application. When I google it, Telerik comes up all over the first google page. To be honest, I actually do like it a lot. So, I'm just wondering what are other alternatives out there? What are some drawbacks/problems that people have experienced with Telerik? Also, I've looked at Infragistics and Component Art and here is why they're out of my picture: Infgragistics: No MVC support (period) Component Art: Every single component is made with element. Even something as simple as a dropdown box. I mean, a UI-expert company should know better than this.
