SharePoint Cascading Dropdown with CAML query that filters one of the choices

I have made a cascading dropdown form using http://spservices.codeplex.com but want to add a filter to the third cascading dropdown. So SPServices have a function called CAMLQuery where I can add this filter but I want the filter to be specified with the value from the top dropdown on the form. One example that is given on the page is: CAMLQuery: " Active " I want this Status column to get its value from the choice selected on of the fields on the form. Is this possible and how would I write that? Edit: I am trying to make an asset list with cascading choices to find the right asset after picking unit and department. Code example after trying the below answer and not getting anything coming up in the "Asset" chooser. There are two lists, one containing Units and Departments and one containing the assets with a Department and Unit key to filter with. If I replace the "dynamic" queries with a static one such as: CAMLQuery: " Unit 1 " the assets appear filtered for that unit. Current code: var sCamlQuery = ""; $(document).ready(function() { $().SPServices.SPCascadeDropdowns({ relationshipList: "Departments", relationshipListParentColumn: "Unit", relationshipListChildColumn: "Title", parentColumn: "Unit", childColumn: "Department", completefunc: function() { sCamlQuery = " " + $("select[title='Unit']").attr("spcascadedropdown_selected_") + " "; } }); $().SPServices.SPCascadeDropdowns({ relationshipList: "Asset Database", relationshipListParentColumn: "Department", relationshipListChildColumn: "Title", parentColumn: "Department", childColumn: "Asset", CAMLQuery: sCamlQuery }); }); The HTML: Unit (None) Unit 1 Unit 2 Â¨ Department (None) Administration IT Kitchen Production Production Sales Warehouse Asset (None) Computer Copy machine Dishwasher Dishwasher Oven Verifying function: var sCamlQuery = ""; $(document).ready(function() { $().SPServices.SPCascadeDropdowns({ relationshipList: "Departments", relationshipListParentColumn: "Unit", relationshipListChildColumn: "Title", parentColumn: "Unit", childColumn: "Department", completefunc: function() { sCamlQuery = window.alert("completefunc");//" "+ $("select[title='Unit'] option:selected").text() +" "; } }); $().SPServices.SPCascadeDropdowns({ relationshipList: "Asset Database", relationshipListParentColumn: "Department", relationshipListChildColumn: "Title", parentColumn: "Department", childColumn: "Asset", CAMLQuery: sCamlQuery }); }); Departments list: Title Unit IT Unit1 Sales Unit1 IT Unit2 Sales Unit2 Asset Database: Title Department *Unit* Asset1 IT Unit1 Asset2 IT Unit2 David
