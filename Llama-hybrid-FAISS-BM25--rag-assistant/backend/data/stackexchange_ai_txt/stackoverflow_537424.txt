NSTimer with Touch capability? Any other options

I am creating my very first iphone app and need help here. My programming background is not C and I am bit lost. Basically what I want my application to do is to display random bitmaps and let user touch individual bitmap and validate them. The method I used to display the bitmaps is NSTimer with UIImage for the actual bitmaps. So far, it was working fine in displaying the bitmap. But I am stuck on the next step, which is registering the touched bitmaps. I tried to use tag on the bitmap then touchesBegan function. I got a runtime error everytime I touched screen (I think.) My questions are: 1. Given my requirement, is the method I am using is a good method, or even technically possible? 2. If q#1 answer is no, do you have alternative solution? Thanks and I appreciate your help!
