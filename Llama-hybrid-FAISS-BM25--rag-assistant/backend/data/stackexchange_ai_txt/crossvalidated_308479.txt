It's my understanding that the only reason for this distinction is that in numerical analysis, it's the standard to talk about convex optimization rather than concave optimization, even though they are really the same procedures. For example, if you do a google scholar search for "concave optimization", you get about 300,000 hits, but "convex optimization" gets about 2,000,000. Because convex optimization is talked about more in the numerical analysis literature, this nomenclature is followed in the machine learning community. As you state, the differences are trivial, so the reason for the distinction is trivial.
