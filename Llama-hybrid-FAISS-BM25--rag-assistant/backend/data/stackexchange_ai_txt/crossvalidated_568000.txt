Is an unbalanced categorical independent variable a problem for binomial logistic regression?

My dependent variable is a yes/no measure; I'm trying to predict the probability of an event to lead to a yes or no. The independent variable is a categorical predictor with 3 levels. My data is unbalanced; I have an unequal number of events in each of the 3 levels of the independent variable (i.e. 311, 180, 238). Is that okay for a binomial regression or do I need to have an equal number of events across the 3 levels? (I'm not asking about unequal yes/no answers within each level, but about the total number of events in each level). I would appreciate any advice on this.
