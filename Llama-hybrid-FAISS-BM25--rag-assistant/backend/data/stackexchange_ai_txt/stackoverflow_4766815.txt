There are several ways to handle this. First off lets be clear: to do this in a secure manner, it cannot be done in javascript, only on the serverside - using javascript to securely enforce input sanitation is doomed to fail Encode the chars that make up html when you output user generated data When the user generated data is outputted on your webpage, change a few of the charachters to make it secure. Namely the characters , > and & should be changed to &lt; , &gt; and &amp; respectively. This is the best way to do it, if the user should be allowed to edit the text, since you don't actually alter the text in storage, and you can let the user change the unmodified text via a textarea Encode the chars that make up html when you store the user generated data Do the same as above, but do it before you store the data in your db. This has a performance upside, since you don't need to encode it every time you output it, but it will not let your users edit the unmodified text, which can be a serious downside, depending on what you are building Strip the characters before output or storage Strip the and > characters before either output or storage - this is not a very good solution in my opinion, since it is an unnecessary altering of user input, but some people prefer it.
