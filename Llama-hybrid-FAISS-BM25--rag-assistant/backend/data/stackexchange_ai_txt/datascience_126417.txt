There's at least two ways to approach these requirements. Pick the 20 columns of greatest interest to customers for prediction. Train, evaluate, and deploy 20 regression models. In data science we learn the "shape" of business data. Computing covariance can help with this. We find that some combinations of feature values will be routinely observed, while other combinations are extremely rare. Take advantage of this in order to serve your customers. Choose a distance metric, and use a clustering technique such as K-means to characterize your training data. At inference time, given a feature vector of length 19, use it to identify nearest cluster and to predict the target feature.
