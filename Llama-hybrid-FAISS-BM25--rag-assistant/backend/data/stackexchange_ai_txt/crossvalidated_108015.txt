One uber-robust and uber-conservative approach would be non-parametric signed rank or matched pairs sign tests . In the first test, you assume identical distributions of two groups; in the second, you explicitly incorporate coupling of the two distributions. . signrank trapped0 = trapped1 Wilcoxon signed-rank test sign | obs sum ranks expected -------------+--------------------------------- positive | 0 0 7.5 negative | 5 15 7.5 zero | 0 0 0 -------------+--------------------------------- all | 5 15 15 unadjusted variance 13.75 adjustment for ties -0.13 adjustment for zeros 0.00 ---------- adjusted variance 13.63 Ho: trapped0 = trapped1 z = -2.032 Prob > |z| = 0.0422 . signtest trapped0 = trapped1 Sign test sign | observed expected -------------+------------------------ positive | 0 2.5 negative | 5 2.5 zero | 0 0 -------------+------------------------ all | 5 5 One-sided tests: Ho: median of trapped0 - trapped1 = 0 vs. Ha: median of trapped0 - trapped1 > 0 Pr(#positive >= 0) = Binomial(n = 5, x >= 0, p = 0.5) = 1.0000 Ho: median of trapped0 - trapped1 = 0 vs. Ha: median of trapped0 - trapped1 = 5) = Binomial(n = 5, x >= 5, p = 0.5) = 0.0313 Two-sided test: Ho: median of trapped0 - trapped1 = 0 vs. Ha: median of trapped0 - trapped1 != 0 Pr(#positive >= 5 or #negative >= 5) = min(1, 2*Binomial(n = 5, x >= 5, p = 0.5)) = 0.0625 Basically, these tests both say that five differences only happen to fall on the same side (higher counts for the "More" condition with 1:2^5 = 1:32 probability if the null of no differences were true. However, these tests may not have much power with the sample size of 5, and you can get stronger results by making stronger assumptions. Since you are dealing with counts, an appropriate tool for your problem will be a generalized linear model, namely Poisson model for counts. Denoting the sites as block , and the conditions as treat , I am getting Poisson regression Number of obs = 10 LR chi2(5) = 47.17 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -11.51985 Pseudo R2 = 0.6718 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ trapped | IRR Std.

The p-value here is much stronger than from a non-parametric test with p = 0.0005.
