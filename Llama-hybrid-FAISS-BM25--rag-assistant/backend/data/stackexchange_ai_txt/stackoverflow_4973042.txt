I have a real-time video application that uses Mitov's VideoLibrary. It's a collection of objects that are well-designed, threaded, and takes advantage of all the CPU cores available. When I go to his library with some new need, I'm usually pleasantly surprised to see he anticipated it. Support has been very good also. It's not cheap: $450, but for my needs, has been worth every penny. It's free for non-commercial use: http://www.mitov.com/html/videolab.html . His CaptureBitMap demo captures successive frames to a bitmap. You simply drop several components on a form, and write six lines of code! The library has lots of hooks to go further than this simple example. (In Win 7, Delphi 2010, the demos are installed here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\7.0\LabPacks\Demos\Delphi2010\VideoLab\CaptureBitmap. But, I know he supports as far back as Delphi 7.) One thing that differentiates his library is that it makes use of the Intel IPP libraries: http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-ipp . When running on Intel chipsets, if you choose to ship the Intel DLLs, you get the best performance that Intel's engineers could squeeze out of their chips. If Mitov's library with IPP can't process your video fast enough, I'd be surprised if any video library can. Mitov has some standing in the Delphi community: he was a speaker on multi-threading at CodeRage: http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage5/sessions (Thursday session.) The above may sound like I'm a shill for his company. I don't have any relationship other than as a very pleased licensee. I'm just very happy (and relieved) that I found his tools and decided to use them.
