How do you check ergodicity of a stochastic processes from its sample path(s)?

How do you check ergodicity of a wide-sense stationary stochastic processes from its sample path(s)? Can we check ergodicity from a single sample path? Or do we need multiple sample paths? One motivation of checking ergodicity is in time series to ensure that you could safely use the average of a sample path over time as estimate for the population mean?
