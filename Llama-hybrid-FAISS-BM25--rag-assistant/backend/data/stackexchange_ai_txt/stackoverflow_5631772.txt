Flexibility of Scala's Actor Model

I've been using actor based programming model with Microsoft's Asynchronous Agents library for C++ . Having started experimenting with Scala, it seems to me that its model is not that rich as in Asynchronous Agents. For example Async Agent provides a lot of different Asynchronous Message Blocks which can be combined in different ways to make network of agents. How does this map to Scala's native actors, or actors using Akka?
