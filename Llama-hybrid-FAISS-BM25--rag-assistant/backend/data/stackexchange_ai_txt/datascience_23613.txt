What is PAC learning?

I have seen here but I really cannot realize that. In this framework, the learner receives samples and must select a generalization function (called the hypothesis) from a certain class of possible functions. The goal is that, with high probability (the "probably" part), the selected function will have low generalization error. Actually we do that in every machine learning situations and we do latter part for avoiding over-fitting. Why do we call it PAC-learning? I also have not get the meaning of the math too. Is there anyone that can help?
