Validation set for hyperparameter tuning of ML time series model

I'm developing an ML-based model to forecast the daily sales of a whole month. This model takes as input a set of precomputed time series features: day_of_week , day_of_month , day_of_year , week_of_year , month and so many more. Additionally, the time series have an strong month seasonal pattern, and the patterns might greatly differ from one month to another. The problem is that I've been experiencing a high variability in the hyperparameters of the model, depending the chosen validation set. Let's say I want to forecast July-2019 , then I tried using different months, starting from July-2018 to June-2019 as validation set, finding a very different configuration of hyperparameters in each. I think this is due to the changing sales pattern between months. For these reasons my intuition tell me to use June-2018 as validation set, as it is more "representative" of what my testing set would look like. However, It also seems that I'm loosing 11 months of data to validate the model. Which approach for selecting the validation set you would recommend in this problem?
