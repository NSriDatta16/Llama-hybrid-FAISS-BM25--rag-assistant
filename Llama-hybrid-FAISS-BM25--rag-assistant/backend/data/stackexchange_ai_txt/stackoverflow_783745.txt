filesystem permissions while developing on different machines

I have installed a xampp (apache + mysql + php) stack on a portable volume (truecrypt volume on a usb drive) that I use on different linux machines, for webapp development. This volume is formatted in ext3, so I run into permissions problems as I can't be the same user on each machine. For example I tried to check the git status of a project started on the other machine and access is denied. Last time I ran into a similar problem I did chmod 777 (or was it chown?) the whole directory, so I guess the permission status of my php files is messy. This time I am also worried about special cases like git files and the symfony web framework I installed lately. How should I deal with this situation? I would love to set this permission issue properly. Thanks a lot for your attention. Edit : I may need to write a script to locally "sudo chown lampp:lamppusers" each time I use a different machine. Or some git voodoo trick with local-only repositories export? Any idea?
