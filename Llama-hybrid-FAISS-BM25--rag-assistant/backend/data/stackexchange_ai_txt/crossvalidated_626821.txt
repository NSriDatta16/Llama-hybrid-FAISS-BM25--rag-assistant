To answer your first question (why this can be beneficial), from a biological perspective: the reason for using short (length k) subsequences of the long sequence is that these short sequences (called DNA motifs) are often biologically relevant, especially when dealing with cis-regulatory regions, as is the point of DNABERT. This is also briefly mentioned in the material and methods section of the DNABERT manuscript (2.2.1 Tokenization). At the same time, there is no delimiter in DNA sequences, and in fact multiple overlapping k-mers could exist that are relevant. AGCTTAACG | Input sequence AGCT | GCTT | CTTA | 4-mers TTAA | TAAC | AACG | I am not really an expert on positional encoding, but as I understand this would require some knowledge on boundaries, i.e. start and end of words. For DNA sequences, these boundaries are not known, and they are not evident from the sequence. It could also simply be for historical reasons, k-mer based approaches for DNA sequence analysis are very popular and used in many areas of sequence research, especially for alignment and assembly of DNA. (see e.g. Sense from sequence reads: methods for alignment and assembly )
