In spatial data analysis data is most of the time sampled irregularly in space. So one idea would be to see what is done there, and implement variogram estimation, kriging, and so on for one-dimensional "time" domain. Variograms could be interesting even for regularly spaced time series data, as it has diferent properties from the autocorrelation function, and is defined and meaningful even for non-stationary data. Here is one paper (in spanish) and here another one.
