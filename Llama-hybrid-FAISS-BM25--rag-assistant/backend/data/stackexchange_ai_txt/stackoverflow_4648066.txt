Google has a full specification on how to make ajax-powered sites like this crawlable. The trick is to update window.location.hash with an escaped fragment whenever you want specific content to be linkable, and treated as its own page, without having to reload. For example, Twitter rewrites their URIs from http://twitter.com/user to http://twitter.com/#!/user . From an SEO standpoint these are both valid and will be regarded as its own separate page. They can be directly linked to, and be used in browser history navigation. If you update your meta-data (keywords, description etc.) and sitemaps accordingly, SEO will be the least of your worries.
