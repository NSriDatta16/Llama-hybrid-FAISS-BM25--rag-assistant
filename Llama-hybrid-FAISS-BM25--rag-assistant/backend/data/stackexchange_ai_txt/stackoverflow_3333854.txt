Handling Scroll bars with jQuery event Drag and Drop

I have a room div with some toy divs arranged on it, see Toys are absolutly positioned and are drag-able with in the walls of the room . The room container div has a fixed height and height, so the room has horizontal as well as vertical scrolls. I use jquery event drag plug-in for setting up DnD. I managed to set up the toys drag only with in the lomits of the wall, but when there are scrolls, component is moving a little ouside the wall (only up to the actual width of the wall). I want to show only a portion of the toy as shown below I tried setting the z-index , but has no effect, any one has better idea?
