I came across much the same confusion. I agree that the documentation is not very clear. I now use LINQ in three projects, and I rather like it. If you're using LINQ to SQL, create your LINQ class by creating a connection to your server in Server View and dragging your table across into your Data Context. Otherwise, just set db as the collection of your Scan objects. 1) Get a count of scans, grouped by Date where Delivered = True Dim db = new BrettsDataContext Dim Query = From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True _ Order By s.Date 2) Get a count of scans, grouped by Facility where Delivered = True Dim db = new BrettsDataContext Dim Query2 = From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True _ Order By s.Date 3) Get a count of scans, grouped by State where Delivered = True Dim db = new BrettsDataContext Dim Query3 = From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True _ Order By s.State That last one will get all the result rows. If you just want the count as a number: Dim count = (From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True).Count If you wanted all the separate Delivery Dates, you could do the following query: Dim db = new BrettsDataContext Dim Query4 = From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True _ Order By DeliveryDate To set as a data source, just do the following: Dim db = new BrettsDataContext Dim Query = From s as Scan in db _ Where s.Delivered = True _ Order By s.Date gridview1.DataSource = Query Hope this helps!
