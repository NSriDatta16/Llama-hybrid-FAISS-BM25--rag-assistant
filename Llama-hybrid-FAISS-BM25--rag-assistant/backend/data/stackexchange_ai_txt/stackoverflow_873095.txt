As far as getting the mouse coords for the proxy to drop it in the correct location try this: assuming you are initiating the drag on mouseDown get the coords using e.currentTarget.contentMouseX and e.currentTarget.contentMouseY in your handler. then add these to the dragSource ( I did it as an object ) like: var drgSrc:DragSource = new DragSource(); drgSrc.addData( { x:e.currentTarget.contentMouseX, y:e.currentTarget.contentMouseY }, 'drgXY' ); then in your drop handler ( assuming you are dropping it into a Canvas named drpCvs ): var newImg:Image = new Image(); newImg.x = drpCvs.contentMouseX - e.dragSource.dataForFormat( 'drgXY' ).x; newImg.y = drpCvs.contentMouseY - e.dragSource.dataForFormat( 'drgXY' ).y; I found this while looking for a way to get rid of the shrink animation, so thanks for that. Thought I'd RTF.
