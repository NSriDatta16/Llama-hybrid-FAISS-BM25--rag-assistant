Agree with Justus, You usually don't need the iFrame, and the toggle function does the work elegantly. If you still like to use the iFrame, you can set its contents this way: $('#myframe').contents()[0].body.innerHTML = $('#mydiv').html(); To an HTML that looks like this: Date Link 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 2010-04-20 10:26:01 And if you'd like to toggle the iFrame itself, use Justus' approach on the iFrame's id.
