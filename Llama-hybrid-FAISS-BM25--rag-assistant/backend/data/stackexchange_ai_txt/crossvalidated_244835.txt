For arima modelling the best route is using the Arima and auto.arima functions in the forecast package. To answer questions directly: You don't need to subtract a lagged variable you can use the equasion: Y(t) = αX + βY$_{t-1}$ + βY$_{t-2}$ The Arima model as below will assign a negative value to your second Beta coefficient if such a pattern is found in the data. 2. Ar model with 2 lagged variables and exogenous regeressor: library(forecast) model Use model and a model will be automatically selected for you based on aicc comparison of multiple models. Use ?auto.arima for further details. forecast(model, h= 12) will forecast the model for 12 more values. Also look into Time series model cross validation for further model comparison.
