It seems you don't understand something about C. int i; actually DOES define the variable in addition to declaring it. There is memory storage. There is just no initialization when in function scope. int i=0; declares, defines, and initializes the storage to 0. if (!i) is completely unnecessary before assigning a value to i. All it does is test the value of integer i (which may or may not be initialized to a specific value depending on which statement above you used). It would only be useful if you did: int *i = malloc(sizeof int); because then i would be a pointer you are checking for validity.
