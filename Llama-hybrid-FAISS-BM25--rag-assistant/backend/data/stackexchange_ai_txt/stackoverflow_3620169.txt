SpringMVC - Change view when accessed by Mobile

I was wondering if someone has already solved this. I have a SpringMVC app and we are adding support to WebKit type mobiles (iPhone and Android basically) so I was wondering someone has found an elegant way of defining specific views depending on the client that sent the request. I know that a simple if in a Controller implementation can do the trick, but I'm looking for something more flexible/elegant (a specific ViewResolver implementation, or an interceptor maybe). Help will be greatly appreciated... as always =) This is a pretty old question. What you need to do is use Spring-Mobile to achieve this in a standard elegant manner
