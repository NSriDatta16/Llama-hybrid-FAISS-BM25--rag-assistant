Ziliak (2011) opposes the use of p-values and mentions some alternatives; what are they?

In a recent article discussing the demerits of relying on the p-value for statistical inference, called "Matrixx v. Siracusano and Student v. Fisher Statistical significance on trial" (DOI: 10.1111/j.1740-9713.2011.00511.x), Stephen T. Ziliak opposes the use of p-values. In the concluding paragraphs he says: The data is the one thing that we already do know, and for certain. What we actually want to know is something quite different: the probability of a hypothesis being true (or at least practically useful), given the data we have. We want to know the probability that the two drugs are different, and by how much, given the available evidence. The significance test – based as it is on the fallacy of the transposed conditional, the trap that Fisher fell into – does not and cannot tell us that probability. The power function, the expected loss function, and many other decision-theoretic and Bayesian methods descending from Student and Jeffreys, now widely available and free on-line, do. What is the power function, the expected loss function and "other decision-theoretic and Bayesian methods"? Are these methods widely used? Are they available in R? How are these new suggested methods implemented? How, for instance, would I use these methods to test my hypothesis in a dataset I would otherwise use conventional two-sample t-tests and p-values?
