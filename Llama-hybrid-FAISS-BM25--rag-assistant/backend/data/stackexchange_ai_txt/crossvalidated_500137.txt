It does not make much sense to take the average of a categorical predictor. It would be better to set the values of Pred 1 and Pred 2 to some "typical" values, say their modes, and then draw the graph of the effect of Pred 3. Unless you have interactions, the graph will look the same to matter which values you set Pred 1 and Pred 2 at; just the vertical scale will be different (shifted). If you have interaction, say between Pred 1 and Pred 3, you can set Pred 2 to its mode and draw an interaction plot. If Pred 2 does not interact in you model, then the graph will look the same no matter which value you set Pred 2 at, again the vertical scale will be shifted. If you have a three-way interaction, then the two-way interaction plots will look different for different values Pred 2, so you should draw all of the interaction plots, one for each Pred 2 value, in order to understand the meaning of the three-way interaction. See "interaction.plot" in R for a good graphical display.
