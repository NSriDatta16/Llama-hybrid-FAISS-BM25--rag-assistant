I don't think it is possible to find the "optimal" amount of dimensionality reduction without testing for accuracy at every level. The complexity will increase as more and more dimensions are included which not neccessarly means that the classifier will perform better. But without prior knowledge of your data, you could try to look at the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and include, let's say, 95% of your data by taking the dimensions there describes your data with 95% accuracy.
