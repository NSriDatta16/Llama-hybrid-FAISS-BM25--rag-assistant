The aim is to predict pm2.5 ( target variable ). Step 1: Data Cleaning. Remove unwanted features and fill the missing values. Step 2: To learn about the features, perform data visualization. You can plot a linear plot with TEMP and pm2.5 and see how it varies with change in temp. Step 3: The next step is to find the relationship between features. Some features are not needed for prediction. Remove those features. Step 4: Apply a suitable machine learning technique and predict.
