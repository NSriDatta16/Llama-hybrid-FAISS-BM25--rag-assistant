Sounds like you're off to a good start. Like any other software tool, the best way to learn about Crystal is to use it, make mistakes, and learn from your mistakes. Also like any other software tool, it has limitations and advantages. Here's a few things for you to try out: You should familiarize yourself with the concept of "sections", i.e. Report Header & Footer, Group Header & Footer, Page Header & Footer, and the Details. Your base data should be in the Details section with summaries in the headers & footers. You can also suppress sections if you don't need them. "Grouping" is the concept of grouping... your hospital patients by the doctor they are seeing. That can give you the average number of patients per doctor, for example. Conditional formatting lets you change the colors/font settings according to changes in the data. Very convenient for highlighting inventory that is out of stock. Graphs! There's a fair number of graphing options in there. They just don't work well in the Details section. In time, you should learn about Subreports to display subsets of data. (I'm using the previous version of Crystal, but I don't think any of the above is out of date)
