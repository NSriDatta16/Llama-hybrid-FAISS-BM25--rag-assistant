Organize Questions & Answers from database in php and mysql

In my database I have questions and answers. Every post has a 'postID' and only answers have a 'responseID', which references the 'postID' of the question. I can identify which answers go to which question since responseID = postID I'd like to write some php code that would display the data in the following format: Question: - answer - answer - answer Question: - answer - answer - answer ...and so on Additional Info: The Questions and Answers are in the same tblQA table. The colums are QAID, PosterID, ResponseID, TimeStamp, Category, Body. So, every post has a QAID. A question would have a category, and an answer would have a responseID that equaled the questions QAID. This would grab ALL questions: SELECT * FROM tblQA WHERE category IS NOT NULL This would grab all answers: SELECT * FROM tblQA WHERE ResponseID IS NOT NULL
