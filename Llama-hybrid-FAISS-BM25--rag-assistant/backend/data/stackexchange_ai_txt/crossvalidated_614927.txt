Minimum number of observation in multivariate regression

Given a multivariate regression, in a form bellow, what would be the minimum number of observations ( $n$ )? $$\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{E},$$ where $\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{E} \in R^{n\times m}$ $(n>m)$ and $\mathbf{B}\in R^{m \times m}$ . You can treat each column of $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ as a time series. Based on Frank Harrell's book, Regression Modeling Strategies, if you expect to be able to detect reasonable-size effects with reasonable power, you need 10-20 observations per parameter (covariate) estimated. I wonder if this would still hold in multivariate regression rather univariate? In the univariate the dependent variable $Y$ is one time series (vector format) and in multivariate one, it consists of more than one time series (matrix format). For more info on multivariate reg: This starting from p.43.
