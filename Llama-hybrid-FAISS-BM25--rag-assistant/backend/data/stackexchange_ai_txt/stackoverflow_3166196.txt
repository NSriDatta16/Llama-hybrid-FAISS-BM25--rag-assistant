301 redirect from previous asp verion

I have found this. Link Can some help me organise this into an aspx/aspx.cs file as I'm not overly familiar with all the code here. Hi, I have built a new website using asp.net. The previous version was built using asp. Here is the problem. My client wants 301 permanent redirects on pages with query strings. How do I go about redirecting from a page that doesn't exist on my server any more eg. From www.example.com/dolls/detail.asp?id=15 to www.example.com/search_results.aspx?section=Dolls&title=Hat I have read a few articles but they don't explain how to remedy this particular problem. Many thanks, C
