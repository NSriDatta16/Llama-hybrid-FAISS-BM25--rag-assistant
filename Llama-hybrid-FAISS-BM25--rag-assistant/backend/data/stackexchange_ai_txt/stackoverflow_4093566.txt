Can I use a webview for charity donations in an iOS app?

I am building an app for a charity and they've requested the ability to receive donations from the app. In reading the app store guidelines I came across this: 21) Charities and contributions Apps that include the ability to make donations to recognized charitable organizations must be free The collection of donations must be done via a web site in Safari or an SMS I can build the solution in Safari, that is not a problem, but I was wondering if anyone knew if apple would accept the application if the web donation form was accessed within the app through a WebView Control. I have seen other apps accept credit card payments within an app using a webview, so is it possible to do the same with charitable donations or is it a requirement that you actually have to use the Safari application and leave the application to make a donation? Hope this make sense.
