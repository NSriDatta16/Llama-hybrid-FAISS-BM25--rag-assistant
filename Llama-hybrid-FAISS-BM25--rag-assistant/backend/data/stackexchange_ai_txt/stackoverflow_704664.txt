There are almost no inconsistencies in JavaScript implementations across browsers. If there were, it would be a nightmare multiplied (by the multiple inconsistencies in DOM implementation). So "Top Ten Javascript Incompatibilities/Inconsistencies" can probably only be populated with "Bottom One" you spotted. Indeed there could be a pair more, but I would hardly expect them to be major or even worth attention.
