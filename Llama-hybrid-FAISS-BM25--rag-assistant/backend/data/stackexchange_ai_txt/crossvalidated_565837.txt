Can using 4/5 years averages as regressors cause endogeneity?

I have a panel related to political election. Id is country and time is NOT the year but the election event sequentially ordered (first election in the country, second...and so on), so that you have, in each row, data that belong to different years. Example: you can have election n.1 in Italy belonging to year 2000 and election n.1 in Slovenia occurring in 2005. I was wondering whether I can use as regressors averaged variables (averages across elections: so that you can have 4 years averages in some cases and 5 years averages in other cases). My doubt is about correlations and endogeneity since we have a quite complicated mix of error term entering into the regression at different point in time. Thanks!!
