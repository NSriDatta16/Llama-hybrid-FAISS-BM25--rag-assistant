For basic, back-prorogation neural networks, the most important things are: Calculus Linear Algebra Basic Stats / Probability If you are just looking for more specific topics (you said you already took Calc, so I'll leave that out), here are some subjects that will be useful to know, if not necessarily directly applicable to building a neural network: Solving Linear Systems of Equations (you'd learn this in a Linear Algebra course) Least Squares Regression Optimization theory You should realize that there are several other methods that can be used to solve certain problems along with neural networks. Often the most difficult aspect of solving a problem is determining the best method to use.
