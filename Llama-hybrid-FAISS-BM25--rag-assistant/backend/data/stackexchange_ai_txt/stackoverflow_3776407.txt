You should carefully customise the HTML hosting page to avoid scaring away potential customers. Turn off Javascript to experience what they see: Never use the default "Silverlight missing... download it" page/image. Show a HTML page with a look/style similar to your actual Silverlight application. Show examples of what they are missing with images, sale pitch text etc. Duplicate basic functionality on your website (see below). Any Silverlight website that wants to employ SEO needs an ASP.Net site backing it up (to provide indexable content pages to the Search engines), so you might as well add a bit more to that ASP.Net site that duplicates initial functionality of the Silverlight App (i.e. your registration pages). So, rather than replace the Silverlight login, duplicate it on your ASP.Net site. Then by the time they have registered, and read how fantastic your Silverlight site is, you will be more likely to encourage them to download SL. If you use RIA services, it is also consumable by Asp.net, so you can share a lot of functionality between your website and application. Regarding 1.5Mb download. As AnthonyWJones implies.... that is bad. You want to make your initial Silverlight load less than a few 100kb if possible. Internet users expect to see something within seconds or they will leave. This is possible using modular loading techniques like MEF or Prism (which now includes MEF support). We have a 20Mb Prism Silverlight application (42+ modules), but the initial load is under 500kb (and looking to reduce that back to under 100kb).
