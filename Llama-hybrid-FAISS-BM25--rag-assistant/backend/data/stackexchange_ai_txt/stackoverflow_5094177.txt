Running Jetty with instrumented files (cobertura)

I've several Selenium tests and want to know their coverage (measured with Cobertura). I'm using Maven 2 as a build framework. Before executing my Selenium tests, I launch the web application using mvn jetty:run . In order for the coverage data to appear in my report, I need Jetty to use instrumented code. I can explicitly instrument the code using mvn cobertura:instrument . But how can I tell Jetty to use the instrumented code (directory target/generated-classes/cobertura) ? Thanks in advance Dmitri
