Detecting if ANY window is being dragged

Is there a way (without using any undocumented API) to figure out if ANY window (not just the application from which the code is running from) is being dragged? I can use [NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:] but this is just for general dragging and there's no way to tell if a window is beign dragged or not. Thanks! Update: I think the answer might lie with these two functions: CGSGetWindowBounds CGSNewRegionWithData If someone can tell me what these functions do and where I can find the documentation for them, it would be great! Thanks.
