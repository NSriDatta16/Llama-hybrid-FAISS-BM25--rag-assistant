Checkboxes to indicate inclusion in a list?

I have two tables, called Machine and Type . Since they have a many-many relationship, I have a MachineType resolution table in my DB. No problem. The end user needs to be able to manage these - create new types and assign them to machines. I have an XtraGridView that I am using to display the Machine as master and Type as detail. Initially I used a Lookup to add Type dropdowns to the MachineType detail view. But that creates duplicates and is not the best way to display this information. I'd like a series of checkboxes (one for each Type options available) so the user can click the appropriate ones for each machine, thus avoiding duplicates. Upon saving, the appropriate MachineType rows can be generated. I was going to just code this manually but if there's some kind of binary collection mapping in either DevExpress or the .net framework I can use, I'd prefer that than to reinvent the wheel. Cheers EDIT: This is what I mean. From this thread . However, they store it as a collection (a string delineated by commas) and not a series of DB rows.
