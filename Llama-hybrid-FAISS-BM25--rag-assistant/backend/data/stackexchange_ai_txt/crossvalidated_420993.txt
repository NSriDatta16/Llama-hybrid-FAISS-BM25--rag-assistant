The problem, as stated, is a little weird. You say your sample has classes A, B and others. But you are unsure about the others as they may belong in A, B or something else completely? You need to decide what you are going to do here, are you going to assume the classes are known and do supervised learning? Are you going to assume the classes are not really known and do unsupervised learning? Or maybe something in the middle like reinforcement learning? I would suggest unsupervised learning in your case, if you are not sure about the classes. But first, 10000 variables is a lot of variables, you will get suboptimal performance with these many variables and your sample size, you may consider removing some variables in a pre-filtering stage based on some criteria. As for the model, something like kmeans / pam / klara could work, where you would determine the number of clusters by using one of the measures for this, such as silhouette, gap statistic, wss. Also, for feature selection, something like NSC (Nearest Shrunken Centroids) will work, which automatically selects features.
