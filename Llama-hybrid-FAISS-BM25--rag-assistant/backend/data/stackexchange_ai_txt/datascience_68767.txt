If in your training data you don't have any observations that are less than 10,000 and greater than 20,000, then Random Forest will never make a prediction outside of this bound. Therefore, if you eliminate these observations from the training data you will get the desired effect. I am only suggesting this as an option, I am not familiar with your problem, so I don't know if this is a good approach or not.
