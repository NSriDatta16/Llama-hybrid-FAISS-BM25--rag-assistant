Logistic regression shows linear margins for different levels of independent variables

Having read about logistic regression, I understand that the probabilities of the success of the DV, P(Y=1) , do not necessarily grow the same at every level of the independent variable. This is why you can't interpret the coefficients right away like for OLS, saying an increase in one unit of x1 increases P(Y=1) by b1 (=the coefficient of x1 ). Using margins and marginsplot in Stata, however, can help interpret the results. However, I'm getting a linear relation in my marginsplot between P(Y=1) and some (maybe every..haven't checked them all) independent variables. What does this tell me? Is this suggesting, that I'm doing something wrong or indicating that I should look into something again. I'm just curious, because usually you would expect margins to be somehow not linear (that's why you do the marginsplot in the first place)..and this perfect linear relationship kind of sets off my alarm bells :)
