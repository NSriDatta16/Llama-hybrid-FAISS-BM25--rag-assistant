In the database, the attribute should be saved in the table catalog_product_entity_datetime organized by its attribute_id. First get the entity_type_id (since mine is apparently different than yours): select entity_type_id from eav_entity_type where entity_type_code = 'catalog_product'; I get 4 on that last one, but substitute as applicable. The following query should list any saved values: select * from catalog_product_entity_datetime where attribute_id = (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where entity_type_id = 4 and attribute_code = 'my_update'); To make sure that you have actually added the attribute to the database: select attribute_id from eav_attribute where entity_type_id = 4 and attribute_code = 'my_update' If you see values in that space, your problem may be that you haven't selected the attribute to be loaded. For instance, if you are loading products from a catalog product collection, there is a method necessary to load attributes: $collection->addAttributeToSelect("my_update"); Please give more context on your product loading if you see that the data is actually saved. Hope that helps. Thanks! Joe
