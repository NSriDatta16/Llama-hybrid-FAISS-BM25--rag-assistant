Iphone reduce Image file size

Is there anyway to reduce the Image file size or Raw RGB buffer ? Actually I have RGB buffer which it has 500KB with 320X420 size.I tried to save it to disk using UIimage and it comes to 240 KB. As per the image size, I want it to have less than 50KB or so.(loosing quality is OK) Is it possible ? Thanks, Raghu
