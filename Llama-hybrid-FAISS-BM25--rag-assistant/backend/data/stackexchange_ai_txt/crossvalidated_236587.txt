Interrupted Time Series Analysis: Autocorrelation greater than 1?

I am running an interrupted time series analysis. (Basically, I run a "before" and "after" linear regression, and measure the change in Constant/y-intercept.) My objective: to measure the sudden drop in prescribing rate of a certain drug, which occurred at time t . I want to prove that case A is singificant, and cases B and C saw no change. Everything I've read seems to indicate: You adjust for seasonality, but you don't transform to remove trend from the data. (Because trend is usually relevant to your study.) ARIMA(1,0,0), that is, a single order of autoregression, seems pretty standard. My question: when are higher levels of autoregression appropriate in ITS design? I'm using weekly data, so there's a fair amount of noise. My data looks like this: and my Ljung-Box test tells me that there's still autocorrelation in my data. (Significance Should I use a higher order of autoregression? Importantly, will doing so inappropriately underestimate the sudden change at time t ?
