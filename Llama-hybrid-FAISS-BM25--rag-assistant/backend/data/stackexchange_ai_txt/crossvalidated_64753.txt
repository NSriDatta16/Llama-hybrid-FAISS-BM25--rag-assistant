I'm not aware of any. The smallest singular values correspond to modes that don't contribute much to the reconstruction of the original matrix, or to use the PCA interpretation, don't describe much of the variance in the data. Typically, the modes with smaller singular values are just noise. This doesn't rule out the possibility that some meaning could be found in them, but I think it would be highly dependent on the data which make up the original matrix and — honestly — pretty unlikely.
