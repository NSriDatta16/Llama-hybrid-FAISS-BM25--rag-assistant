I would say depends on the requirements and how much effort you want to give the task. Using regex is definitely easier but in the some time you will not be able to cover everything specially if the text you have is not structured as you expect all the time. So in this case you will be updating you regex patterns each time you miss something ... If you go for machine learning approach then you will need data to train your models on it ( a lot of this data). Time for training, and enhancing the quality of your model. Hopefully you will get something good. As a conclusion, I think, if you can cover the requirement with regex go for it. If regex will not be a good solution then start thinking in machine learning solutions.
