When you have a series that is consistently related month to month (1 year ago) this is routinely handled by a seasonal arima component. When you have just a few months that are related in this manner a much more efficient procedure (ignored by most of the free and commercial arima software approaches) is to use/add seasonal dummies for those effected months. Empirical identification of these special months is done via Intervention Detection or very often by eye via an examination of the residual plots from the deficient arima model . The acf is not useful as the seasonal effect only exist for the few special months. I would be glad to demonstrate this for you if you post 1 of your time series.
