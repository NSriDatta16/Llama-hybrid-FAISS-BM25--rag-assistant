#pragma mark not showing in methods in Xcode 4.0

In Xcode Version 4.0 I notice that #pragma marks within methods are no longer showing up in the Jump Bar. The only #pragma marks that are showing up are those that are between methods. I was using these #pragma marks to make it easy to quickly organize and get to information that appears in different sections of my tableviews and I would really like to get that functionality back. Anyone know how to get them to appear again?
