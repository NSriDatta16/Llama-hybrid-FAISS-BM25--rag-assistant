Java : Which Code Coverage tool to use?

Here is what I want to do: 1) A running application has been instrumented. The byte code is clean - means that the tracing info should be added on the byte code level. 2) The running application might run for days or weeks. I want to have a trace file once per day. 3) If the tracing period is over I want to merge all trace files together and produce one HTML report for the developers. Here is what I have investigated so far: Emma seems to do a good job when it comes to issue 1) Instrumentation on the fly is very simple. Cobertura says the are able to do byte code instrumentation but I havent found an example. Neither Cobertura nor Emma talk about periodical trace file dumping. Im not sure about clover. Maybe somebody has had a look at it before. Has somebody done this before and can help me with these Issues ? Thanks, detlef
