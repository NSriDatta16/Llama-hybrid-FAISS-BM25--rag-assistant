It sounds like you need a multivariate mixed effects model. In R, there is the sabreR package and an accompanying book : The only other package in R that fits such a model natively, as far as I know, is MCMCglmm . I can also think of some non-native alternatives; one is to use BUGS or JAGS which both have an R interface and are free but you would have to code the model from scratch. Another is MPlus which is not free but has an R interface and finally in Stata (again, not free but does have an R interface) you could try GLLAMM.
