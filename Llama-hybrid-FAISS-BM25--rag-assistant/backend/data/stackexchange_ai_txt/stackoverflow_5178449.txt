Socket input stream doesn't read fragment by fragment

I have problem in my app, I read from socket with ip=192.168.0.3 and port =502. Another program write messages to that port fragment by fragment ( mac fragmnet length is 205 bytes) and I need to read that messages fragment by fragment. But when I wrote this I get all fragments in one big. boolean last=false; int numberFragment=0; while (((!last)) ) { numberReceived = socketInputStream.read(buffer); numberFragment++; tempBuffer = new byte[numberReceived]; ByteBuffer baferce = ByteBuffer.wrap(tempBuffer); baferce.put(buffer, 0, numberReceived); //System.out.println("RECEIVED="+(new String(tempBuffer))); last=ResponseFragmentCheck.IsLastFragment(tempBuffer, numberFragment); System.out.println("LAST ="+last); PrintBytesArray(tempBuffer); received.add(tempBuffer); } Is there any way i Java to read fragment by fragment ?
