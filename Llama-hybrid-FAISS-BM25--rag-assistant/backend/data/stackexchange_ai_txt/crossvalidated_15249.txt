Matching and Balance The general issue falls under 'matching', which is the process of sampling units to create subsamples that are maximally 'balanced' i.e as similar as possible on uninteresting (e.g. non-treatment) covariates while differing on an interesting one, with an eye to making causal claims about the latter. Ideally, matched samples have the same distribution of uninteresting covariates. Less stringently, their covariates have overlapping support. Propensity scores are one approach to the balance problem, but there are a more, not all of which are so dependent on building another model to make a matching 'score' and implicitly relying on its assumptions. For example, a recent alternative would be 'coarsened exact matching'. Reference This field is getting pretty big, but here is an unsystematic sample from my shelf and hard disk, that might prove helpful. Gelman and Hill ch. 9 and 10 are very good, I think, assuming that you're operating in a regression framework to start with. For just a reference to the issue and its possible solutions, this might be a good one. You might also find Imai et al. (2008) helpful, mostly for the error decomposition. More generally, there are a bunch of article length reviews available from Stuart's papers page or from King's causal inference page . Morgan and Winship is a thorough book length treatment of causal inference that puts the common support issue in a bigger picture.
