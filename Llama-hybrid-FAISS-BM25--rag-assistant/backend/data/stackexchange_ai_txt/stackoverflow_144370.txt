Are you using SQL Server 2005? Recursive queries make querying hierarchical data much more elegant. Edit: I do think materialized paths are a bit of a hack. The path contain non-normalized redundant data, and you have to use triggers or something to keep them updated. Eg. if a node changes parent, the whole subtree have to have their paths updated. And subtree queries have to use some ugly substring matching rather than an elegant and fast join.
