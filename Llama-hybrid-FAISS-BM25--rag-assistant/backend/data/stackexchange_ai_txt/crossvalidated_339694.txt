IID in real life /Machine Learning - When is data truly IID?

In a course I am studying at Berkeley, some student said about a particular Dataset "Data is not iid" and the lecturer agreed with him. https://youtu.be/kl_G95uKTHw?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwTmSbCv9OVJB3YaO4sFwkX&t=910 So once and for all, I want to understand, for real data, how often is it really iid and how can I decide myself? For example, let's say that I take 20 million images from Facebook "randomly" (let's say that each image has some unique integer associated with it, and I pick a random integer every time). Is this iid? What if I take a particular user's images, and then his friends's images etc in a BFS kind of way? Is this iid now? While I understand the math definition I don't have the underlying distribution so it's very unclear to me. My gut feeling is that a real life dataset is almost never truly iid by the way.
