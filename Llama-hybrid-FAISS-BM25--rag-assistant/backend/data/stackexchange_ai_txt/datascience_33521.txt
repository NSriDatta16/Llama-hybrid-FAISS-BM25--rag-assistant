Choosing parameters for testing

I have a DL4J project DL4J Framework for a CNN for Classification and Scaling. (Separate projects). My question is that how can I tune my parameters to achieve my goal? Note that my question is general-purpose and not related to framework or the problem. How can I approach tuning parameters for CNNs? I know you need to really know the field of machine learning but I would like to know the approach (even if it means throwing me some reading material) in order to execute a Deep Learning model.
