How can I tell Gradle to use my testng.xml file for Test Classes and Ordering?

I am attempting to have Gradle execute some tests defined using a testng.xml file. My testng.xml file looks like this: So why do I need this? I want to ensure that my tests are organized in a way that's defined by annotations similar to that which was listed here . As you might guess, TestOrderer is an IMethodInterceptor. Here's the problem, Gradle seems to be taking over my testng.xml file and scraping the test directory to find the tests it wants to execute. Even if I disable this, it fails to execute the methods appropriately. Here's what I think should work, but just, doesn't. test { useTestNG() options.suites("src/test/resources/crazyTestNG.xml") # Adding # scanForTestClasses = false # causes zero tests to be executed, since the class names don't end in Test } It seems like it should be a no-brainer...fork the TestNG process and let it run, but I can't figure out how to tell Gradle to get out of the way and just execute my tests.
