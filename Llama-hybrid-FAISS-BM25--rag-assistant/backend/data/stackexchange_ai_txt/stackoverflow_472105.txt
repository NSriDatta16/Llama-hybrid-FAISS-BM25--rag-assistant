Jared Spool shares some results of research conducted at UIE about the importance of performing a goal rather than download time .

Since goals are often complex and require the users to be thoughtful, the best designed sites seem to get away with slower-than-average pages. The original research from 2001 he references is The Truth About Download Time by Christine Perfetti and Lori Landesman.
