Your situations combines multiple features that make this a bit trickier than usual, namely that you want to model differences in distribution parameters (also known as distributional regression) and that you have multiple measurements per subject (repeated measures). You should somehow reflect that observations from the same subject are likely somehow correlated (in the example below I allow for completely unstructured covariance matrix), for which you could choose a MMRM (mixed effects model for repeated measures). The default implementation thereof (e.g. in the mmrm R package or PROC MIXED in SAS) would let you estimate different covariance structures (and let you constrain them to have the same variance for each day, if you want) for the two groups, but would not let you model explanatory factors for the variance. That's mostly a lack of flexibility of existing software rather than a theoretical problem, but at least the brms R package lets you do this (the below assumes DAY and Treatment are factor variables): brm(Y ~ 1 + Day+ Treatment + Day:Treatment + X1 + X2, autocor = ~unstr(time=Day, gr=Subject), sigma ~ 1 + Day + Treatment + Day:Treatment + X1 + X2) This all works with the existing data structure you have and would deal gracefully with any missing days for some subjects (which some other formulations of the problem would not deal with this so easily). Whether the particular models for the mean outcomes and the residual standard deviation (or rather the log-thereof, because brms will by default use a log-link for sigma parameter) is what you want to look into depends on what you want to investigate. E.g. you could say the SD is the same on all days and omit Day terms in the model for sigma , or you could investigate whether differences in X1 or X2 explain differences in sigma (in which case you might have them as main effects as above), or whether Day / X1 / X2 influence the variance differently by group (in which case interactions with Treatment make sense). Note that brms is a R package for flexible modeling in R using a Bayesian approach (building on top of Stan ) that by default uses the NUTS MCMC sampler. The tidybayes , posterior , ggdist and various other packages are great for working with the results from such analyses.
