How does softmax relate/backpropagate probabilities with binary label?

When the softmax is the last layer in the neural network, it usually takes input from a fully connected layer (say of size 1000) and then outputs probabilities of each of this output (if I understand it correctly). Assuming that our task is to recognize an object, how does the layer helps in propagating back the information that given image contains an object or not?
