touchesShouldBegin Returns NO in ScrollView: Then What?

I'm getting exactly the behavior I want in a UIScrollView : when I return NO for touchesShouldBegin , the scrolling behavior happens. Otherwise, the content views get the event. However, I'd like to show something on touch down and touch up when the scrolling behavior is occurring. Unfortunately, returning NO for touchesShouldBegin blocks the touchesBegan and touchesEnded methods. The delegate method: -(void) scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { doesn't work because sometimes the user touches but doesn't drag. How can I register touchUp and touchDown events yet preserve scrolling behavior?
