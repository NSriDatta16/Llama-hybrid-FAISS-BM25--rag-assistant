Depend on how exactly you implement the scenario which you describe you could has any data in the internal data parameter of jqGrid existing always if one use local datatype or loadonce:true in your case. Direct accessing to the data parameter per jQuery("#grid_id").getGridParam('data') get your reference to the data array. The data array contain all data of the grid (not only the current displayed page) and the data are not yet placed in the element. So the data are unmodified and could contain for example any XML fragments. UPDATED: To make you easier to understand what I mean I made the small demo . If you double-click on a row you will see the XML data associated with the row. The "note" column can be hidden. Because all hidden columns exist in grid as HTML markup I made it visible. You can see the difference what can be saved as grid internal data and what can be displayed (also as hidden data). UPDATED 2: You can consider to use autoencode:true option in your grids.
