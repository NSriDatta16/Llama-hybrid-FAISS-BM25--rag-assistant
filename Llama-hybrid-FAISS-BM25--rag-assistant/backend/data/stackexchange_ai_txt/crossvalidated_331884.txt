With an appropriate significance test. Any introductory statistics textbook can help you choose null hypotheses and tests for them. If you were hoping for specific advice on that, you need to provide much more detail . I guess that by "reliable" you mean to refer to the uncertainity in your conclusions. The uncertainty of an estimate can be quantified with tools such as confidence intervals and Bayesian probability, but these tools need data.* You can't tell in advance how precise your estimates are going to be, because that depends on the data. If you collect at least some data, you can estimate the variability in your variables of interest and hence get a sense of what sort of sample sizes will get you what sort of precision. In any case, though, you generally want as large a sample as you can feasibly obtain, at least in human-subjects research, where within-group variance tends to be large. You can't, because power depends on the true population effect size, which is unobservable. The closest you can get is a power analysis, which tells you what the power would be if the population effect size were equal to some value you select. Power analysis isn't very useful in practice because estimating an effect size is typically the whole point of a study. * Technically, you can do a fully Bayesian analysis with no data, but all this will do is reproduce your preexisting beliefs, of course.
