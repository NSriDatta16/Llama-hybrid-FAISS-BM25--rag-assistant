I am assuming that you are currently using the "copy" feature to send the admin email. Let me know if that's not the case. Because the same email is currently being sent to multiple recipients, it would be difficult to change the content for each recipient. You could send multiple emails with a little bit of code, though, which would allow you to use a different email template for each. This could be achieved by creating a new class: class MyModule_Model_Sales_Order extends Mage_Sales_Model_Order { /** * Sending email with order data * * @return Mage_Sales_Model_Order */ public function sendNewOrderEmail() { parent::sendNewOrderEmail(); /** * Your admin email sending code here. Copy it out of the sendNewOrderEmail * function in Sales_Order. */ return $this; } } And then telling Magento to override the core class inside your module config: MyModule_Model MyModule_Model_Sales_Order You'll need to create the template you want and be sure that your overridden model uses that template instead.
