is it possible to redefine { and } in C?

Is there any way you do something like... #define { { printf("%s,%s",_FUNCTION_, _LINE_); { this won't compile. But I'm wondering if there is some kind of trick to effectively get the same functionality? (other than writing a tool to hook at the preprocessing step) The point of doing this is a pondering on how to get a poor mans code coverage.
