I solved the problem by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. After reading (again) the process for ordinal logistic regression on this and this website I considered ANOVA, due to probable violation of the normal assumption I decided based on this answer on CrossValidated that a Kruskal-Wallis test does the job just right. Hereby I use the following command in R: kruskal.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...) Formula is defined in the manual as: a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs gives the data values and rhs the corresponding groups. My lhs is the continuous data (average of all four questions measuring dependence), rhs is my ordered data.
