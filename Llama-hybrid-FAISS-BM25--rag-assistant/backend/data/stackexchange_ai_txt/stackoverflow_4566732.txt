This is completely dependant on the server hardware, it's caching ability and configuration, and the type of hardware it uses for non-volatile storage (e.g., a RAID array of hard drives with spindles or SSDs?), not to mention the type of query and database being queried, including: Number of joins Indexes Number of rows in the tables queried Size of the result set Concurrent load etc... Without knowing all of these factors, it is impossible to estimate performance. The best estimate comes from actual profiling, performed under normal operating conditions with the type of queries that will actually be presented.
