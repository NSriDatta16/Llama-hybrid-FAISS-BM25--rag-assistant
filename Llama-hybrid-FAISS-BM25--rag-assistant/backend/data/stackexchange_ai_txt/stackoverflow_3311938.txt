Saving JQuery Sortable (new order) to ASP.Net MVC controller?

I've implemented JQuery sortable, and it works fine. The problem is I can't pass the list in its new order to a controller so i can save it. $(document).ready(function() { $("#sortable").sortable({ axis: "y" }); }); $(function() { $("#submit-list").button(); $("#submit-list").click(function() { debugger; $.ajax({ url: '/Admin/SortedLists/', data: { items: $("#sortable").sortable('toArray') }, type: 'post', traditional: true }); }); }); Edit Roles and my controller: [HttpPost] public EmptyResult SortedLists(List items) { return new EmptyResult(); } List items comes back with the corrent number of elements - except each item are empty strings. If the original list looks like this 1 - Car 2 - Boat 3 - Motorcycle 4 - Plane And the user drags and resorts to be 4 - Plane 1 - Car 3 - Motorcycle 2 - Boat How can i pass that new order? I suppose id pass the whole thing on submit, delete the entire list and resubmit this whole list unless theres a better way? Taking advantage of Linq (using Linq to SQL) where i can insert the new order on everychange and do a submit changes?
