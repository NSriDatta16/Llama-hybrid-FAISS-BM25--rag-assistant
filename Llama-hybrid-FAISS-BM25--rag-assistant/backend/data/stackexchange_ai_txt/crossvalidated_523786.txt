Optimal regression model for categorical independent variables and continuous dependent variable

I have a continuous dependant variable (engagement rate) and two categorical independent variables (type and type2) with 4 categories each, trying to regress the relationship. I want to know what is the optimal way of doing this, is it linear regression or logistic regression or some other way, was hoping for some insights into this. Dependent variable Engagement rate Independent variable Type(Competition, Promotional, Message, Recruiting) Type2(Video, Photo, Link, Album)
