In support of @Mark Bayer's answer, here is a one-liner for reading the contents of a file into a String. String s = org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.readFileToString("someFile"); Here's the Javadoc for the Apache Commons FileUtils class . And you can trivially implement the equivalent functionality from scratch; e.g. StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); Reader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("somefile")); try { int ch; while ((ch = r.read()) != -1) { sb.append((char) ch); } } finally { r.close(); } String s = sb.toString(); Embedding monstrously large strings into source code ... even as a throw away test ... is so lame .
