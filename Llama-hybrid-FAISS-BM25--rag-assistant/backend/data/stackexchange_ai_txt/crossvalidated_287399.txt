What should be examined when feedforward neural network does not fit the training set well?

In theory, feed forward neural network should be able to approximate any smooth functions given enough nodes in the hidden layer. In other words, it could significantly overfit the training data set. I was expecting feed forward NNets to fit the training set with a sign accuracy close to 100% without any penalization, but for some reason, the accuracy gets quite low from time to time. Can anyone provide some guidance why training accuracy can be very low, even when there are enough hidden layers? Edit: As @ThomasW pointed out, one of the possible causes is local minima. what are some other causes? Is there a way to tell whether a specific cause is indeed the problem?
