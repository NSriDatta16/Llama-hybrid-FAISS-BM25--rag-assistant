I dont think there is anything within Domino or in the Domino space that would do true byte-level replication on file attachments between servers. But, you might want to consider an approach in which you extract / detach attachments from Domino documents to the file system, then use a commercial file-replication product to replicate the files, and use standard Domino replication to replicate the (now much smaller) documents. (In a way, this mimics what DAOS in Notes 8 does, but DAOS is ignorant of replication). It would be simple to create an agent to extract file attachments (and maybe leave a placeholder in the rich-text fields). If you wanted to get fancy, you could replace the attachment with a file icon image inside an action hotspot which has code to launch the appopriate file from the OS. (I'm not sure if all that's needed for that is exposed in the Lotuscript classes, but it's certainly possible from the Notes API).
