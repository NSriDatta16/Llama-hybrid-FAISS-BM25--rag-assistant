Given that if you constructed a $2 \times 16$ contingency table the sum of all the elements would exceed 90 (as each person can answer yes to more than one question) I think a $\chi^2$ test or similar would be inappropriate. The comments saying that your sample size is small are valid, but this would be my approach if there were no such concerns: Perform logistic regression with the 16 answers as predictors and the sex as the dependent variable. Any predictors which come out as significant could be interpreted as differences in the two groups. Note additionally that the answers to the survey questions will not be independent, which will complicate things.
