Since Y is calculated from X, I calculated the null by shuffling X from the original sample, calculate Y, the slope between them. Repeat 1000 times. Find the average slope. Use the equation of the slope to calculate NULL.y from the original x value. The NULL.y turns out to be a negative correlation. Now, I want to test if the slope for yi are different from the null. So you attempted to run a permutation test. What you did incorrectly however was averaging the slopes. Instead, to run a permutation test you would shuffle the $X$ values, calculate the slope for the $(y, X_\text{shuffled})$ and calculate the test statistic between the slope calculated on the raw data vs shuffled data, for example $\mathbf{1}\big(\hat{\beta}_0^\text{raw} > \hat{\beta}_0^\text{shuffled}\big)$ (this will differ, depending on your hypothesis), and repeat it many times. The fraction of the cases where the condition is met would be your $p$ -value.
