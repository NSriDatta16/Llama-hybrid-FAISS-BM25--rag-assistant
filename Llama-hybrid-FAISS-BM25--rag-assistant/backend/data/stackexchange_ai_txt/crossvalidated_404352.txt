I would start with dropping all records with NS. In your example you'll end up with only 2 records. The reason is that by doing anything else, such as backfilling, you will not add additional information, but risk overstating the significance of information about correlation by propping up the p-values through artificially inflating the sample size. For instance, what if series 1 were very volatile, and the trues values were 3,2,2,2,5,4,5 and the true values of series 2 were 3,4,4,4,3,5,5 ? This is in the absence of the time series model. If you somehow know the process that generates the timeseries, then things are different. Using this model you could recover some information that is hidden behind NAs. For instance, you know that the process is a random walk with a drift. In this case you could estimate the parameters, such as the drift, and use them to impute the missing values. You're still risking to inflate the significance of correlation this way. So, I'd be very careful with this approach.
