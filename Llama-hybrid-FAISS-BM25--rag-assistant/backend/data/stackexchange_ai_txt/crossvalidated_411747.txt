Omitted-variable bias is an important issue in logistic regression, as noted on this page with an analytic result presented for the related probit regression. Omitting any predictor associated with outcome will bias estimates of coefficients for other predictors, even if the omitted predictors are uncorrelated with the included predictors. So best practice is to include all predictors reasonably expected to be related to outcome as you develop your model.
