How do I set Expires: header when using send_data

I have a method in my controller which uses send_data like this: def show expires_in 10.hours, :public => true send_data my_image_generator, :filename => "image.gif", :type => "image/gif" end Using expires_in results in headers being sent like this: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Connection: close Date: Fri, 25 Jun 2010 10:41:22 GMT ETag: "885d75258e9306c46a5dbfe3de44e581" Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary X-Runtime: 143 Content-Type: image/gif Content-Disposition: inline; filename="image.gif" Content-Length: 1277 Cache-Control: max-age=36000, public What I would like to do is add an header like Expires: (some exact date) to keep the user agent from revalidating. But I don't see how to make send_data set that header? I guess I could set it explicitly in the response.headers hash, but surely there must be a wrapper for that (or something)?
