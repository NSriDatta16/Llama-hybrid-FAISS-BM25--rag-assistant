Don't know if this will be helpful, but...awhile ago I was getting DragDropException when my WinForms app was being run on a thumb drive, not a full system. The form generating the error had no drag-and-drop feature. I never figured out the problem, but I saw that a UserControl on that form had defaulted AllowDrop=true unnecessarily. Once I turned that off, the problem went away. If your form is intended to support drag-and-drop, I'd look into on what thread the form generating the exception is instantiated. My understanding is that Microsoft's implementation of drag-and-drop is COM-based, which must be initialized in an STA thread. Putting the [STAThread] attribute before your program's entry point will accomplish this.
