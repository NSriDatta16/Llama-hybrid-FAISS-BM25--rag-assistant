I think it can be made more clear through an example. Let's say you have two input vectors: X1 and X2. and let's say X1 has range(0.1 to 0.8) and X2 has range(3000 to 50000). Now your SVM classifier will be a linear boundary lying in X1-X2 plane. My claim is that the slope of linear decision boundary should not depend on the range of X1 and X2, but instead upon the distribution of points. Now let make a prediction on the point (0.1, 4000) and (0.8, 4000). There will be hardly any difference in the value of the function, thus making SVM less accurate since it will have less sensitivity to points in the X1 direction.
