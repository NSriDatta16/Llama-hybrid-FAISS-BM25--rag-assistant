Population bias in survey leading to inaction

This isn’t exactly an academic statistics question, but it is a real problem that I’m trying to understand with regards to bias in survey statistics leading to issues in real-world decision making. I’m working with our local government organization, and they have used responses from a survey of our city’s general population as an indicator of the level of service for sports facilities. For instance - the survey asks “Do you find the current state of softball fields adequate?” But, of course - most of the general public doesn’t use the softball fields at all, and the local government is using this survey result as an indicator that they should not do anything to improve the state of softball fields. Is there a name for this kind of logical fallacy or bias - where a general population is asked about something and this is used to justify inaction? If this kind of logic were applied to its full end, there would be no existence of any kind of facilities whatsoever, as there are no majority of users for any kinds of facilities. I’ve found the term “sampling coverage error” to describe the fact that the softball population was not surveyed - but i have NOT seen any research around the justification of inaction this leads to. Is there a name for this kind of bias in decision making?
