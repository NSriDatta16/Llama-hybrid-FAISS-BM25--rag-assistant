Client-side validation with a model-less view in ASP.NET MVC 2

I'd like to use the new client side validation features in MVC 2 but I have a particular view that just has a couple textboxes on it and I don't want to create a strongly typed model for it. Can someone describe how to leverage the validation goodness in MVC 2 w/o a strongly typed model?
