Create select list with first option text with mvccontrib?

Trying to create a select list with a first option text set to an empty string. As a data source I have a List of a GenericKeyValue class with properties "Key" & "Value". My current code is as follows. x.State).Options(ViewData[Constants.StateCountry.STATES] as IList , "Value", "Key").Selected(Model.State) %> This gets fills the select list with states, however I am unsure at this point of an elegant way to get a first option text of empty string.
