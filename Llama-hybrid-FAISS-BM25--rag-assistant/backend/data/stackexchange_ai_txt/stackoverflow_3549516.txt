You could use QT for the GUI front end. But I'd actually just write your library first. Then do your GUI last. Some helpful advice Be sure to write unit tests WHILE writing your code. Be sure to use a code coverage tool to evaluate your unit tests while writing your code. Be sure to avoid BOOL types since those are usually defined in the platform API (like win32). Use bool instead. Forward declare as many types as you can in your header files. Include as few as possible header files in each library header file. Expose as minimal an interface as possible. Be sure to follow good coding practices for c++. Herb Sutters Book C++ coding standards is excellent in this regard. Once you do write your gui, put as little business logic in your GUI event handlers as possible. Basically you want your library to be agnostic towards your GUI. Someone else mentioned the MVC pattern here. That is excellent advice.
