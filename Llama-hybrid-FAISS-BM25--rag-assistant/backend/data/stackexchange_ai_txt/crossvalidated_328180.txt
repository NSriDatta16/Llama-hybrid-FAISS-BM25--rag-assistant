I would assume there are two approaches to your task: Remove outlier first and then apply your clustering algorithm (for this step itself you may use clustering algorithms!). Please note that k-means itself is not a Soft Clustering algorithm so it does not model the overlaps. For that you may use algorithms like Fuzzy C-Means . There you can define an overlap by clusters for which the memberships of a sample are closer than a threshold. Ignore the outlier removal and just use more robust variations of K-means, e.g. K-medoids or K-Medians , to reduce the effect of outliers. The last but not the least is to care about the dimensionality of the data. K-Means is not a proper algorithm for high dimensional setting and needs a dimensionality reduction step beforehand.
