Influence of TV spots on the number of visits to the website (time series problem)

I have hourly data regarding the number of visits to the website. A single record consists of date, time(0-23) and number of visits. In a separate table I have data about the display of advertising spots of my company on various television stations. In this table, a single record consists of the TV station, the emitted program, the date and the hour of the spot emission. I am not able to say how many visits are caused by which station. I would like to check if and which TV stations affect the number of visits to the website. My first idea is to count how many spots were transmitted at a given hour of the day, divided into stations, and according to what I have found I should investigate seasonality in the time series of visits to the website. And I am not sure what I should follow next? Should I choose some model, e.g. regression (then cyclically code the date and time to deal with the seasonality?) or a model including a feature importance module to check the impact of features? However, I am also not sure if I should use lags (e.g. 24 lags by hour) or use pd.shifts()? Can I count on a hint on this topic? Here is simple example of data: And my firs idea how to combine this two tables:
