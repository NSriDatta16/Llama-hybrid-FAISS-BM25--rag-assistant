You would need to prevent those events from bubbling up to the outer ListView, thus preventing the triggers from firing. You may need to use a custom class that derives from ListView (e.g. MyListView) and override OnDragEnter/OnDragLeave and set e.Handled to true. You may also be able to use a class handler for the ListView type, where again you'd set e.Handled to true. This may occur before the EventTrigger though, which would effectively prevent your trigger from firing.
