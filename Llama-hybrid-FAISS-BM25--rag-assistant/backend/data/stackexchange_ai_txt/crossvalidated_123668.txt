The question as posed was "...a bus arrives at the bus stop every 15 minutes and a passenger arrives at random." If the bus arrives every 15 minutes then its not random; it arrives every 15 minutes so the correct answer is 7.5 minutes. Either the source was incorrectly quoted or the writer of the source was sloppy. On the other hand, the radiation detector sounds like a different problem because radiation events do arrive at random according to some distribution, presumably something like Poisson with an average waiting time.
