SQL - Table join where primary key in first table is part of key in second

Hi I am fairly new to SQL - so be gentle with me! I basically have two tables that I am trying to join where the primary key in the first table is used multiple times in the second table (and forms the primary key in the second table along with another column) It's probably best if I provide an example: Table 1 : TravelRecords TravelEventID EventType RecordLocator OfficeID 0001 F ABC123 LDN 0002 F ABC234 LDN 0003 T BDF232 SOU 0004 F DFD890 GLA Table 2 : TravelRecordRmks TravelEventID RemarkNo Keyword Text 0001 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0001 2 TVL CREDIT CARD USED 0001 3 PSG COST CENTRE REQUIRED 0001 4 PSG EMPLOYEE NUM REQUIRED 0002 1 TVL CREDIT CARD USED 0002 2 AGT BOOKED BY AGENT 0002 3 AGT CONFIRM WITH AIRLINE 0002 4 TVL LOWEST FARE CONFIRMED 0002 5 TVL NO CANCELLATION CHARGE 0003 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0003 2 TVL CARRIER : EASYJET 0003 3 TVL LOWEST FARE CONFIRMED 0004 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0004 2 TVL CREDIT CARD USED For the second table the key is the combination of the TravelEventID and the RemarkNo which combined gives a unique ID. Basically all I am trying to do is join the tables together and return the record locator for bookings that have a remark text line of LOWCOST BOOKING AND CREDIT CARD USED (so in the example above only ABC123 and DFD890 should be returned. I've tried something along the lines of : SELECT TravelRecords.RecordLocator FROM TravelRecords INNER JOIN TravelRecordRmks ON TravelRecords.TravelEventID = TravelRecordRmks.TravelEventID db WHERE (TravelRecordRmks.RemarkText = 'LOWCOST BOOKING') and (TravelRecordRmks.RemarkText = 'CREDIT CARD USED') ORDER BY dbo.vw_gTravelOrderEvent.RecordLocator However - that returns nothing. This is probably really simple - but I can't get it to return the required response when I am looking for the single TravelEventID to contain both Remark Text fields. Any help much appreciated Cheers
