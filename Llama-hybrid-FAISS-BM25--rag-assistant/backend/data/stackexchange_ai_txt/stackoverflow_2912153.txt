If libpcap supports it, you might try using pkg-config . (I know that libpcap++ supports it, but not sure about libpcap). That said, if you don't already have an established build system, then I suggest you try using CMake which makes this kind of thing and all other aspects of creating a C++ project significantly simpler. For an example or getting started quickly using CMake, see the C++ Project Template.
