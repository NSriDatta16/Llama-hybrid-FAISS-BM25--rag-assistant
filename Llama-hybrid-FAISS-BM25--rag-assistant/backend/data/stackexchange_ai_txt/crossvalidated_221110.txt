This issue doesn't come up often because when people use fully Bayesian methods, they don't usually create a null hypothesis and then make a choice on the basis of a hard threshold of relative probability, as you have. After all, a lot of the motivation for using Bayesian methods is to avoid such things. I'd recommend avoiding the various forms of the word "significant" to avoid any confusion, although the analogy with classical null-hypothesis significance testing is clear, and is worth pointing out in your paper. Just say something like "Using the decision rule specified by Equation 2, I accepted $H_a$."
