Why I get errors when I try to out a compiler defined macro using a pragma message?

I would like to know why the Visual C++ compiler gets me an warning/error if I use the following code: #pragma message( "You have " _MSC_FULL_VER ) Here is what I get: error C2220: warning treated as error - no 'object' file generated warning C4081: expected ':'; found ')' The problem reproduces for _MSC_FULL_VER or _MSV_VER but not if I try to use others like __FILE__ or __DATE__ . These macros are defined, they are documented on msdn
