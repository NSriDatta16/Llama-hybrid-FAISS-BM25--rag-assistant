Basically the strategy of RhoMobile is to leverage the browsers on each device to create a "native feel" by styling the web controls to look like "standard" controls on each device. This means you're somewhat limited in what you can do by what the web capabilities are of each OS/device. So each app is a native app, but it still essentially "runs in the browser". I'm also unsure of how deployment works with the various platforms, like the App Store and Android Market.
