The google gadget specification currently relies on iframes: http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/spec.html Currently they are the only simple way to provide isolation for javascript apps that are pulled from multiple domains/providers. Also many of the widgets that people embed on their websites from third-parties use iframes. While they do have their drawbacks, iframes provide a pragmatic solution to common problems on the web. I'd have to guess that they will be around for some time to come.
