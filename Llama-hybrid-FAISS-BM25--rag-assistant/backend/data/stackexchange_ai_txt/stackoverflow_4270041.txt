It's a tricky question. On its own (as a string) Location is a URI, but you have to take into account the context in which it is defined (that being the response header list) In essence a tuple (browser::request::protocol, browser::request::domain, response::locationHeader) constitutes a URL as request adds a retrieval mechanism.
