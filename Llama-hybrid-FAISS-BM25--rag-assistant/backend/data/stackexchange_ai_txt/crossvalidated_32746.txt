It is very unlikely that Excel would be able to do this easily or reliably (you should really not use Excel for any but the simplest stats, and sometimes not even then). If you know (or think you know) what the common x intercept is (not just estimate it from the data) then you can subtract that value from all the x variables and do a regression without intercept (because the line should go through 0,0 now). You can compare that model to the model with each line having its own intercept (if they all go through the same fixed intercept then all the fitted intercepts should simultaneously be not significantly different from 0. A quick way to get a feel for if your x intercepts are likely to be the same would be to reverse your x and y variables and fit the lines, this means that now the y-intercepts would be the same which is easier to test. However this also changes the direction of the error and so answers a bit of a different question and should probably be followed up by something more formal. You could create bootstrap estimates of the x intercept (computed as -b/m) and use that to estimate if the intercepts differ. You could fit a nonlinear least squares model to estimate the model with a common x-intercept and compare it with a model where each gets its own intercept to see if they are significantly different (the model would be of the form slope*(x-x0) with slope and x0 as the parameters (x0 being the x-intercept). You could fit the similar model using Bayesian techniques as well to compare. Any of these would be doable in R or other statistical packages.
