Would this be modeled as a mixed effects model or regular logistic regression?

I have data that looks like the following >df id response Factor Count1 Count2 1 0 A 6 1 1 0 B 5 2 1 0 C 4 3 2 1 A 3 4 2 1 C 2 5 2 1 D 1 6 The goal is to see how the Factor and the Count covariates effect the response. My current set up is glm(response~Factor+Count1+Count2,family=binomial(link=logit)) The problem is that I am getting wild residual plots. I am wondering if i should try running a mixed effects model since I have multiple observations for each id . I also wonder if my ratio of 1 s to 0 s in the response are to great. I have 11,000 rows and 1,500 are 1 s. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks! Edit: I just came across this post about each id being drawn from a Bernoulli. It turns out that I was able to find a natural grouping for my ids and make proper proportions from there. My Normal Q-Q plot is not great, but at least they don't have a large gap in them anymore.
