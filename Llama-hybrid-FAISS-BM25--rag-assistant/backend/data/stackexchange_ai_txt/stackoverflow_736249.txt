I've found no reliable and sustainable way to obfuscate the code. If there's a way to obfuscate the code, I'd bet that: it would affect the performance of your code it would be just a matter of time before someone makes/finds a decompiler for that obfuscation method I wouldn't consider a good practice to rely on the security of your client code. Even if the code couldn't be decompiled, the swf is run on the client and communicates with the Internet via a network connection the user has access to. The packets can be sniffed and all the data that's being transfered can be easily analyzed. I think you should find a way to develop a secure application, even considering that the client knows everything you do. You should try to use server-side constraints and filter all inputs before using them. Also, requesting all the sensitive data from a server-side script, instead of embedding it in your AS code could be a good start.
