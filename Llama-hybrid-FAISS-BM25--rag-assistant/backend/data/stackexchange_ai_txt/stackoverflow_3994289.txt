This destroys the 'distributed' nature of git. It makes every commit somewhat global. The cvs "commit" is analogous to the git "push" which is what communicates with the remote end. If you truly want to take advantage of the distributed model, you should encourage and make your team understand the point of local commits rather than make the system hit the central repo on every commit (which is sawn off centralised).
