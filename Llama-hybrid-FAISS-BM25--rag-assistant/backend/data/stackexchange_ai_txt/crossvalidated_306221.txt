as you noted it would not be wise to consider such data as a planar point pattern where the general metric between points would be Euclidean distance. Consider for example the dataset which is presented in the following paper, where the author of the thesis discusses distribution of crime along streets of Chicago or distribution of spider webs between bricks. Here's the link : https://www.google.cz/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj89qrh2tbWAhXiCpoKHW6RCo4QFggwMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fescholarship.org%2Fuc%2Fitem%2F1t01p61g&usg=AOvVaw21vMqoh9q0-oS8eGaTfWXR Therefore in such cases you would define something which they use in spatial statistics called Manhattan distance. So for example you were during an analysis of taxi trip duration in NYC, you would use Manhattan distance because that is how the streets are organized.I hope the paper helps you.
