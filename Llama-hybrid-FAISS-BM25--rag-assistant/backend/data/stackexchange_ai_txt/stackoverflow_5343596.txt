Many examples of using SQLite in Cocoa apps mention the approach of storing an empty "template" database copy as a resource within the application bundle. It's important to note an app bundle is not supposed to be writable, so this approach requires you copy the template to a writable location (use the standard storage locations, please) and use that file as your writable copy. Could this be your problem?
