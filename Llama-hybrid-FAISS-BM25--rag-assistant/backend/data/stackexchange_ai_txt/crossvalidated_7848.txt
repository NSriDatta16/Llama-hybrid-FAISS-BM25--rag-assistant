Logs and reciprocals and other power transformations often yield unexpected results. As for detrending residuals(ie Tukey), this may have some application in some cases but could be dangerous. On the other hand, detecting level shifts and trend changes are systematically available to researchers employing intervention detection methods. Since a level shift is the difference of a time trend just as a pulse is the difference of a level shift the methods employed by Ruey Tsay are easily covered by this problem. If a series exhibits level shifts (ie change in intercept) the appropriate remedy to make the series stationary is to "demean" the series. Box-Jenkins errored critically by assuming that the remedy for non-stationarity was a differencing operators. So, sometimes differencing is appropriate and other times adjusting for the mean shift"s" is appropriate. In either case, the autocorrelation function can exhibit non-stationarity. This is a symptom of the state of the series(ie stationary or non-stationary). In the case of evidented non-stationarity the causes can be different. For example, the series has truly a continuous varying mean or the series has had a temporary change in mean. The suggested approach was first proposed Tsay in 1982 and has been added to some software. Researchers should refer to Tsay's Journal of Forecasting article titled "Outliers, Level Shifts, and Variance Changes in Time Series " , Journal of Forecasting, Vol. 7, I-20 (1988). As usual, textbooks are slow to incorporate leading edge technology, but this material can be referenced in the Wei book (ie Time Series Analysis), Delurgio and Makradakis cover the incorporating interventions, but not how to detect as Wei's text does.
