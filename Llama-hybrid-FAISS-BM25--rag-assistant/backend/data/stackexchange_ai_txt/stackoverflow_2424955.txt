I would normally suspect the issue is with orgid that is getting passed in to your method, but you say that you have checked to make sure the right code is being passed. Just to confirm, show us the code that assigns the value to that. Additionally, there are a few problems with your code, SQL injection risk being one of them. orgid is an int, offering some protection, but if at some point orgid is changed to require characters by your organization, a developer may just change the data type to string, suddenly opening up the app to SQL injection. You should remove the String.Fotmat, and use a parameterized query instead.
