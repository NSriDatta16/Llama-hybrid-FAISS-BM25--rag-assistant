Let's say you trained a forecasting model using the following base data: time | index_1 | index_2 | label 01/01/2018 | 80 | 70 | 1 01/02/2018 | 60 | 30 | 0 01/03/2018 | 75 | 90 | 1 You used time, index_1 and index_2 to predict label. Then you would simply need a dataset like this to predict 01/04/2018: time | index_1 | index_2 01/04/2018 | 60 | 75 Using your model on this data set should predict the label-value. Now in a time series this can be more complicated, let's say what you actually want to predict is the label-value of time X from the indicie values of time X-4 months . In this case your data to build the model should look like this: time | index_1_lag_4_months | index_2_lag_4_months | label 01/04/2018 | 80 | 70 | 1 01/05/2018 | 60 | 30 | 0 01/06/2018 | 75 | 90 | 1 This model would predict the label-value for 01/ 04 /2018 based on the indice values of 01/ 01 /2018. To actually get a prediction we again give a data set like this: time | index_1 | index_2 01/04/2018 | 60 | 75 Only the output would not be the label-value for 01/ 04 /2018 but instead for 01/ 08 /2018.
