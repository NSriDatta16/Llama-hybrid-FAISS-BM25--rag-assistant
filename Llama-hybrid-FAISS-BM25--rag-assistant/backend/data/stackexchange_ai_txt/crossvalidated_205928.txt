Normalization factor of truncated multivariate normal distributions (Normalization factor from samples)

I would like to evaluate an expectation of the form $\int p(x) \;\mathbb{1}_\left(Bx \leq 0\right) dx$, where p(x) is a multivariate normal distribution. I.e. the probability of a linear constraint being fulfilled for random variables distributed by a Gaussian. It seems that this expectation would be the normalization factor of a truncated multivariate normal but while there are a couple of MCMC based approaches to sampling from truncated multivariate normal distributions, they do not represent the normalization factor explicitly. Is there a tractable way to calculate or approximate this expectation?
