What do you want to do with the data? Store it? Pass it around? Display it? These questions should drive your search for an appropriate technology. Simply asking how you should format your data is like asking what language you should program in, without specifying what you want to accomplish. For most data tasks, well Dr. Codd has the cure: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd . Databases should be able to do just about anything you have in mind. If you're passing it around, I advocate plain text. When you roll your own binary format your data goes away when your parser goes away. With plain text, the deeper question is where to put the metadata. Should it be external to the data file, or internal ("self-describing"). For example, XML is plain text, but so is source code. With a source file, there is a specification that goes in to great detail as to the syntax and semantics, while XML is supposed to be self-describing. The problem is that it isn't. Furthermore it evolved right out of document presentation and markup, but is now being abused for all sorts of data serialization, transfer, and storage.
