How to distinguish a causal chain model from a double effect model?

I am used a linear mixed model on two datasets (two different species), with the same explanatory variable (an environmental variable) for fixed effects. I then select the top 0.1% response variables most associated with the explanatory variable (according to their Z-scores) in both datasets. The response variables are tranformed (Hellinger transformation) counts of alleles (gene forms) for many sites in the genome (genetic material of an organism) of thousands of individuals. I have now two sets of genetic sites for two different species that are putatively associated with the explanatory variable I am interested in. Those sets will show co-variation. However, a professor just made me realize that this co-variation could be due to either: a double causal effect a causal chain Do you have any idea of how I could tell those to hypotheses apart? Here are a few code lines which create an fake environmental variable and two fake genetic datasets (10 genetic sites for 1000 individuals)for two species: #environment env_var The only thing I have thought of as you can see is partial canonical redundancy analysis but it may not enable me to choose between the two illustrated hypotheses stated earlier.
