Filling missing values for Embedded List in Python3

I searched for a similar question but I didn't come across. And I'm new in this area, I hope I explained my question well enough. I have a dataset consist of text data. I store them in a list and every row of a list consists of a string value. But every row length is not equal. I want them to be equal, so I can use them in a self-attention model. The sample of my dataset In [8]: myList Out[8]: [ ['the first line of my dataset'], ['the second line'], ['the 3rd'], ['the 4th'], ['the 5th'], ['the 6th'], ['the 7th'], ] So as you can see the first one is longer than the rest of them. I want to fill with a certain value like # to equalize the word count. The sample output I'd like to do In [8]: myList Out[8]: [ ['the first line of my dataset'], ['the second line # # #'], ['the 3rd # # # #'], ['the 4th # # # #'], ['the 5th # # # #'], ['the 6th # # # #'], ['the 7th # # # #'] ] If this would be a dataframe I could use fillna() function of Pandas library . I tried to apply this: train_X = pd.Series(train_X).fillna("#").values but since it is an embedded list(I guess) it didn't work. Is there a better way to do that? Any recommendation is appreciated.
