Saving Perl Windows Environment Keys UPCASES them

I have a framework written in Perl that sets a bunch of environment variables to support interprocess (typically it is sub process) communication. We keep a sets of key/value pairs in XML-ish files. We tried to make the key names camel-case somethingLikeThis . This all works well. Recently we have had occasion to pass control (chain) processes from Windows to UNIX. When we spit out the %ENV hash to a file from Windows the somethingLikeThis key becomes SOMETHINGLIKETHIS . When the Unix process picks up the file and reloads the environment and looks up the value of $ENV{somethingLikeThis} it does not exist since UNIX is case sensitive (from the Windows side the same code works fine). We have since gone back and changed all the keys to UPPERCASE and solved the problem, but that was tedious and caused pain to the users. Is there a way to make Perl on Windows preserve the character case of the keys of the environment hash?
