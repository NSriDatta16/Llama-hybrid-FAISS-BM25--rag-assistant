How to programmatically override / change endorsed standards in Java?

In this document: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/standards/ it is describing only a single non programmatic way to override endorsed standards in Java (e.g. to provide a different TransformerFactory implementation etc...). by putting the jars in \lib\endorsed Is there a way to spefify an endorsed jar programmatically? (looking at Tomcat's endorsed dir, I assume it is possible, after all Tomcat is written in Java)
