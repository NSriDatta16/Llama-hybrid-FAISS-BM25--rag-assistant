If both unemployment and vacancy have a trend in the long-run, then regressing one against the other would be very misleading. (Every time series with strong positive trend could be well regressed with practically anything that also has a strong positive trend!). That is a classical example of spurious regression; more generally speaking you should be cautious to think over whether time series in the regression are stationary. Including time trend is essentially a form of de-trending. (If you include linear time trend, it means fitting and subtracting a linear trend.) Makes sense if the time series become stationary by de-trending. Chapter 10 of the Wooldridge book discusses the basics of this question. Actually, Section 10.5 is dedicated to your very question.
