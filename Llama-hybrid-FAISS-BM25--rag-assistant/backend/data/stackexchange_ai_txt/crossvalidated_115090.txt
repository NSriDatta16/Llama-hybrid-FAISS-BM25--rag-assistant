Why do I get zero variance of a random effect in my mixed model, despite some variation in the data?

We’ve run a mixed effects logistic regression using the following syntax; # fit model fm0 Subject and Item are the random effects. We’re getting an odd result which is the coefficient and standard deviation for the subject term are both zero; Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) [glmerMod] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: GoalEncoding ~ 1 + Group + (1 | Subject) + (1 | Item) Data: exp0 AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 449.8 465.3 -220.9 441.8 356 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.115 -0.785 -0.376 0.805 2.663 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Note: log-likelihood calculations are based on the Laplacian approximation. the results are as expected with a non-zero coefficient / s.e. for the Subject term. Originally we thought this might be something to do with the coding of the Subject term, but changing this from a string to an integer did not make any difference. Obviously the analysis is not working properly, but we are unable to pin down the source of the difficulties. (NB someone else on this forum has been experiencing a similar issue, but this thread remains unanswered link to question )
