I lose my time index in R all the time â€“ what can I do about it?

Or put it differently: How can I keep my ts index? Most of the time I use a time series in a calculation it's not a ts object anymore. What strategy should I follow when writing functions to return a ts object and keep the index information? E.g.: #standard Hodrick Prescott Filter hpfilter However, I feel that this clumsy and cumbersome. Is there a more elegant way to do it (maybe I should into classes..)?
