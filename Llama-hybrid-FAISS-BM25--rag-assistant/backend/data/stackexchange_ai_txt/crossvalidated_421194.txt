Average of correlations over time

I currently work on my bachelor's thesis and analyse the correlation between 13 countries over a time period of 117 years. I built a correlation table and now want to say somethin about the average correlation over time. I divided the full sample into three subperiods of different size. Now two questions came up: Is it possible to simply compute the mean for each period by averaging the single correlation coefficients? Or is it analogue to this: Working with correlation coefficients When Building the weighted average of the three subperiods, should it equal the average of the full sample? (currently not the case)
