Cannot use httpwebrequest with listbox

I am facing a strange problem with listbox. I need to scrab whois information. I used the following code to get source code of the whois query. It works fine if I use a textbox. But I need to use this for multiple url and therefore need to use lixtbox to loop through url list. Unfortunately when I use listbox1.selecteditem or listbox1.text it does not work. But this same code works with webbrowser. Please help me solving this problem Dim request As System.Net.HttpWebRequest = System.Net.HttpWebRequest.Create("http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=" & listbox1.selecteditem) request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)" Dim response As System.Net.HttpWebResponse = request.GetResponse() Dim sr As System.IO.StreamReader = New System.IO.StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()) Dim html As String = sr.ReadToEnd() sr.Close() Thanks
