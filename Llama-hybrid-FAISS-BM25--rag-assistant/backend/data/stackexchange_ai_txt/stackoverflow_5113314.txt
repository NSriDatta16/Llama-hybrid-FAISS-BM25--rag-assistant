Redis stores strings (and a few other data structures of strings); so you can serialize into Redis values however you like so long as you end up with a string. JSON is probably the best place to start as it's lean, not overly brittle, works well with live upgrade patterns, and is readable in situ. Later you can add more complexity to meet your goals as needed, e.g., compression. #to_json and #from_json are already on ActiveRecord if you want to use JSON (with YAJL or its ilk that shouldn't be excessively slow, relatively speaking.) #to_xml is also there, if you're into S&M. Raw marshaling can also work, but occasionally goes horrifically wrong (I've had marshaled objects exceed 2MB after LZO compression that were only a few K in JSON.) If it's really a bottleneck for you, you'll want to run your own efficiency tests for your goal(s), e.g., write speed, read speed, or storage size, with your own objects and data patterns.
