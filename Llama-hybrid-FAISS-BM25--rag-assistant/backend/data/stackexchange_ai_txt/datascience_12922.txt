Guidelines for Machine Learning model

I'm trying to build a model of Machine Learning for the first time, and I'm looking for some guidelines. My final purpose is to identify customers who are planning to flight abroad. From my existing data, I identified customers who flew in the past, and I've flagged some potential variables (features) that might indicate that one is about to flight abroad. My questions are: 1. What techniques should I use, in order to choose the right features for my model? 2. What approaches (models) would you use in such a problem? because this is the first time I'm experiencing ML, I'll be happy to hear any further suggestions you have to give me. Your help would be appreciated.
