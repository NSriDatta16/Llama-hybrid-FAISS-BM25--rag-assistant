I would use some form of seasonal time series model that accepts external regressors, like auto.arima from forecast in R. There's a nice example from Rob Hyndman here . Likely any method you use will decompose the series into seasonal, trend, level and residual in addition to the contribution of the external regressor, but it is easy enough to re-combine everything except the external regressor to achieve the plot you're after.
