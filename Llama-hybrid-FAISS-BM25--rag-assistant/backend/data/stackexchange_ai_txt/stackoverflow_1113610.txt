strtotime any help? It can parse a data back to a unix timestamp, which is what date() expects as an input. edit after comment: You can try creating a custom version of app/code/core/Mage/Sales/Model/Order.php under the app/code/local folder (it goes here so magento updates don't overwrite it). It contains a method called getCreatedAtFormated - you could apply the same principle to the shipping data and see if that achieves what you need to do.
