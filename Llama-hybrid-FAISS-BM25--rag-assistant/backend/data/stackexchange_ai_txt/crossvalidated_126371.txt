Here's the explained variance plot $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{124}\lambda_i}$. You need 90 PCs to explain 90% of the variance. In my opinion, your kernel is not so good. Maybe you should try other kernels and see if this plot become more like in the picture below, which is from this paper: Williams, Christopher KI. "On a connection between kernel PCA and metric multidimensional scaling." Machine Learning 46.1-3 (2002): 11-19. It's good when the explained variance is very steep on the left.
