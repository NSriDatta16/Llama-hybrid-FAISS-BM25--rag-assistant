I think your intuition is correct and you've answered your own question. The built in speech recognition provided by google only supports the dictation and search language models. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognizerIntent.html You can get back results using these recognizer models and then classify or filter the results to find what best matches your limited vocabulary. There are different techniques to do this and they can range from simple parsing to complex statistical models. The only other alternative I've seen is to use some other speech recognition on a server that can accept your dedicated language model. Though this is costly and complex and used by commercial speech companies like VLingo or Dragon or Microsoft's Bing.
