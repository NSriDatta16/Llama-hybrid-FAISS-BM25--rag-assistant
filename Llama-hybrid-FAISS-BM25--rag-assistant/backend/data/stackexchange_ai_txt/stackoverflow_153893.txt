There are a variety of ways of processing the audio data, the simplest of which is just to display it as a rapidly changing waveform, and then apply some graphical effect to that. Similarly, things like the volume can be calculated (and passed as a parameter to some graphics routine) without doing a Fast Fourier Transform to get frequencies: just calculate the average amplitude of the signal. Converting the data to the frequency domain using an FFT or otherwise allows more sophisticated effects, including things like spectrograms . It's deceptively tricky though to detect even quite 'obvious' things like the timing of drum beats or the pitch of notes directly from the FFT output Reliable beat-detection and tone-detection are hard problems, especially in real time. I'm no expert, but this page runs through some simple example algorithms and their results.
