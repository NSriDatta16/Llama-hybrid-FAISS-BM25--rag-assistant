Pivotal quantity inference statistics of Exponential distribution?

Bus waiting times are distributed like this (they are independent) I know the average time is 8 minutes. I need to find the pivotal quantity of Theta parameter and after it of P. (P is the probability that waiting time will take more than 5 minutes ) I don't know How to treat each of them separately ? (P and $\theta$ ) ?
