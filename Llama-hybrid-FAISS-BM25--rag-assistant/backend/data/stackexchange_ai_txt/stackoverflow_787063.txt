Set the svn:ignore property. Don't add them to your version control system. Anything generated by the build process doesn't belong there. What does belong there are the things needed to complete the build process. I'd recommend adding a continuous integragion server like CruiseControl.NET to the mix - it can build the project from the source, and then do the deploy from that. This will put you in the position of using 2 best practices instead of 1, and still solve your problem.
