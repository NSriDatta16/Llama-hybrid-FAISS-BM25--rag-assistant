In a WPF Grid, how can I find the Row & Column at the mouse location?

I have a WPF Grid with some rows and columns, e.g. With a handler for MouseMove in the .cs file, e.g. private void OnMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { var position = e.GetPosition(myGrid); // What row & col is the mouse over? } I want to be able to find which row and column in the grid the mouse is over, is this possible? [Note: this is a simplified version of the problem, so it looks a little odd to present it in this way - it's part of some drag & drop between grids functionality]
