For what type of problems nearest neighbor performs better

I'm trying to predict house prices. I use features like the area of the house, age of the house, etc. I turns out that knn (k-nearest neighbor) algorithm beats all the other powerful algorithms like Neural networks, SVMs, linear regression. What might be the reason of this? And in general for what characteristics of data knn works better than other algorithms? One answer I think of is that if the underlying relation is too complex then it might be difficult to find a model, this explains the poor performance of the model based algorithms. Any other ideas or better explanations? Thanks
