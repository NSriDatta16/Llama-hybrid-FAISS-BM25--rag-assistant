I'm looking for good references to learn more about POMDPs, preferably from a more mathematical stand point. The only good reference I've been able to find so far is: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~darius/papers/POMDP_survey.pdf which does a good job, I'm wondering if people could recommend more references.
