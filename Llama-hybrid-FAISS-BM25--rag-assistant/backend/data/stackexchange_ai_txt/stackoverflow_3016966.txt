Your initial question and code don't match. If you want to do something on the QMainWindow either create a sub-class and re-implement closeEvent or connect to MainWindow::destroyed() . See the 3rd paragraph for a note however. But your code is showing what appears to be a 3rd class that is connecting a child of the MainWindow being destroyed to some slot called close() . centralwidget will be destroyed AFTER MainWindow is already destroyed so this most likely won't help you anyway. Also, this depends on how you created MainWindow (stack or heap) and if you are destructing it properly. Ideally, you should create a subclass of QMainWindow (which if you used the designer you probably already have).
