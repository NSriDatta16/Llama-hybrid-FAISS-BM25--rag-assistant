Overview Gaussian processes refer to stochastic processes whose realization consists of normally distributed random variables, with the additional property that any finite collection of these random variables have a multivariate normal distribution. The machinery of Gaussian processes can be employed in regression and classification problems. Formulation We consider a Gaussian process as an infinite version of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and has two parameters: mean function $\mu$ corresponding to the mean vector positive definite covariance or kernel function $K$ corresponding to a positive definite covariance matrix Consider $x_1,...x_n$ as a finite collection of points in $\mathcal{X}$. For a Gaussian process over function $f \in \mathcal{H}$ the probability density of $\mathbf{f} = \\{f(x_1),...,f(x_n)\\}^T$ is a multivariate normal: $$\mathbf{f} \sim MVN({\bf \mu}, {\bf \Sigma})$$ with: mean vector $\mathbf{\mu} = \\{\mu(x_1),...,\mu(x_n)\\}^T$ covariance $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ij} = K(x_i,x_j)$ $\mu(x) = E[f(x)]$ $K(x_i,x_j) = E[(f(x_i) - \mu(x_i))(f(x_j) - \mu(x_j)]$ Software Packages mlegp , GPfit and CGP for R.
