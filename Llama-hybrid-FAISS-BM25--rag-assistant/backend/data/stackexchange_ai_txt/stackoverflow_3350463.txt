No, I'm fairly sure this is not possible - but be thankful! This is a "feature" of C-based languages that I would never encourage the use of, because it is probably misused or misinterpreted more often than not. I think the best approach is to try and express "one thought per line", and resist coding that combines two operations in the same line. Combining an assignment and a comparison in this way usually doesn't achieve much other than making the code more difficult to understand.
