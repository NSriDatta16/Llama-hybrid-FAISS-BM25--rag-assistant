@Tim made some excellent points. One method of determining what (if anything) colinearity is doing to your results is to use the perturb package in R. This adds random noise to the variables and then sees what happens to the results. It requires "some kind of model object" but that need not be a regression. I don't know whether the random forest methods in R produce the right kind of object (I am not a user of random forests).
