Like fuzzy lolipop I would highly suggest git as well. Especially because of it's low taint footprint. SVN leaves .svn folders in each subfolder of your repo, this can get costly if your automated scripts copy/paste them around. What i suggest is you have a central git repo and a publish script that checks out a version, then copies the files to their locations. Alternatively You could segment your repo out a bit and use symbolic links to wire up your website, however it's probably poor practice to point your production source into a repo, i'd still leverage the replication script method listed above.
