MySQL finding subtotals

EDIT: I'm told that making you guys read means I get less attention. My apologies. Here's a simpler version: Bill got $100 dollars worth of items from a store. He wants to return enough of the items to get exactly $30 dollars back. The store has a Point of Return system that will help him do this. Here is the data after he scans his items: item ¦ price ¦ socks 4.00 cheap tv 22.00 book on tape 9.00 book on paper 7.00 party hats 3.00 picture frame 10.00 hammer 5.00 juicer 16.00 mysql guide 24.00 total items ¦ total price ¦ 9 100.00 Option 1 =============== item ¦ price ¦ cheap tv 22.00 party hats 3.00 hammer 5.00 =============== Option 2 =============== item ¦ price ¦ socks 4.00 picture frame 10.00 juicer 16.00 =============== Option 3 =============== item ¦ price ¦ book on tape 9.00 hammer 5.00 juicer 16.00 I probably missed a few options, since I made all of this up. So, the big question is: Is there a way (with GROUP BY, probably) to have one query that would return ever possible combination of items? Thanks! a
