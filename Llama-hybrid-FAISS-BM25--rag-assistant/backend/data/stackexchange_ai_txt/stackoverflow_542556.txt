Custom (IDictionary) XML Serialization for SOAP/asmx/WebMethods?

Using ASP.NET WebServices, by default you can't pass any IDictionary objects, because xml serialization for IDictionaries isn't supported. I have found various ways to serialized dictionaries ( http://weblogs.asp.net/pwelter34/archive/2006/05/03/444961.aspx , http://blogs.msdn.com/psheill/archive/2005/04/09/406823.aspx , http://www.mattberther.com/2004/06/14/serializing-an-idictionary-object/ ) but, I can't find any way to hook this into the Asp.NET web methods. Is there a way to hook it up so that I can use IDictionaries with WebMethods?
