Searchable Table - What would you do?

I'm trying to determine how to best design a storage facility for fast searching of text. There will be a different file format for each customer These files are XML, and the field names and attributes are not standard, and do not follow a schema The customer has an option to choose certain fields to be searchable There could be 100,000 records per file, per customer. I'm processing these files and generating a table based on the columns specified by the client configuration. What type of database schema would you chose, be it SQL, or flat files, or any other technology. There is going to be a lot of rows to search, and I don't know what way is best to go about this. Create a table called SearchColumns Id CustomerId DisplayValue Create a table called "SearchRecords" Id SearchColumnId SearchText With this scenario, the SearchRecords table is going to get very large, very fast, and because SearchText is going to be varchar(200), LIKE queries are going to be incrediably slow. I've also considered full-text search on the SearchRecords table, but in testing on a sample table, i'm not getting results as I would expect. I've also considered separate databases per customer This will help with table size in the short term, but after months or years, the table size and speed is going to be slower. What would you do to make a FAST searchable table, that will potentially hold millions of records? Edit: Information regarding the data i'm storing: I'm pulling values such as FullName, Address, and Account Numbers from the xml file. These fields are pretty small, and would most likely never reach over 200 characters.
