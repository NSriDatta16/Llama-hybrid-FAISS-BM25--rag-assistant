Novell Identity Manager (NIM) 3.6: How to make an image part of the resources for HTML reports?

This question might not belong here, and since this is related to HTML and reporting, I thought I could ask nonetheless. I'm currently working to list all of the user identities in Designer for Identity Manager, by Novell. I used the User Application connector and built the required queries. I also created a Provisioning and Request Definition with the necessary fields. I can populate an HTML table with the results of the selected query, and get the user information from the Vault. Aside, I could use the organization's logo on the top-left-hand corner, the project name on the top-right with the report title just below on the right-hand side. My concern is to set the organization's logo on the report. Question How can I define this image logo as an image resource into NIM so that I can use it in my HTML identity report? Shall it suffice to include the path of the image into the HTML document? If so, how shall I set this image path? I don't know much about HTML. EDIT #1 I know that NIM uses Tomcat as Web Server to handle the responses. Perhaps moving the image in its directory should suffice? If so, how can I find out what is this path where I can put the image, so that it is considered part of the Website resource?
