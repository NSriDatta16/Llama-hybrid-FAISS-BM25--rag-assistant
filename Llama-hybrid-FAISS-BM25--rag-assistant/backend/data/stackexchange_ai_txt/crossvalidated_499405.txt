Suppose $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \mathsf{Binom}(n = 10, p=0.3),$ a skewed distribution. plot(x, PDF, type="h", lwd=3, col="blue", main="PDF of BINOM(10, .3)") abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v=0, col="green2") Then the average $\hat p = \bar X_{1000}$ of $m = 1000$ of these $X_i$ s is very nearly normal, as illustrated in the following simulation in R, based on 100,000 replications of this estimate $\hat p$ for $p.$ set.seed(2020) p.est = replicate(10^5, mean(rbinom(1000, 10, .3))) summary(p.est) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 2.814 2.969 3.000 3.000 3.031 3.195 sd(p.est) [1] 0.04594069 hist(p.est, prob=T, col="skyblue2", main="Simulated Sampling Dist'n") curve(dnorm(x, mean(p.est), sd(p.est)), add=T, col="orange", lwd=2) According to a Shapiro-Wilk test on the first 5000 simulated values of $\hat p,$ they are consistent with a random sample from a normal distribution. [The S-W test in R is restricted to a maximum of 5000 observations.] shapiro.test(p.est[0:5000]) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: p.est[0:5000] W = 0.99971, p-value = 0.727 Nevertheless, The distribution of $\hat p$ s based on a thousand observations is discrete (even though the histogram doesn't reveal that). Among the 100,000 realizations of $\hat p$ from the simulation above, there are only 355 unique values. length(unique(p.est)) [1] 355
