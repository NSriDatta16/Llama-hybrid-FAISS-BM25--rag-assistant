Given the small number of hotels within each region, consider using agglomerative clustering and look for large changes in some cluster metric. If being implemented this by hand, it sounds like each region only has one cluster which makes things much easier by using a modified agglomerative clustering algorithm. For example, first join the two locations that are closest together into a single cluster. Then for each location not in the cluster, look at the average distance from it to every location already in the cluster, and add the candidate location with the smallest average. Continue until there is one cluster containing all locations. As the cluster is being grown, compute the average distance between all pairs of locations in the cluster after adding each location. Then plot the average distance vs the number of locations in the cluster, there will be a sudden increase in distance when outliers are added to the cluster. There are many possible variations to be considered. When looking for candidate locations to add to the cluster, consider Minimizing Average distance from candidate location to all other locations in the cluster Finding candidate location with minimum distance to the closest location in the cluster Finding candidate location with minimum distance to the farthest location in the cluster. When plotting the current "quality" if the cluster, consider these metrics: Average distance between all pairs of locations in the cluster Maximum distance between any pair of locations in the cluster. If there is concern about multiple clusters within each region, take a look at Wikipedia's full description of agglomerative clustering . It also provides many more variations.
