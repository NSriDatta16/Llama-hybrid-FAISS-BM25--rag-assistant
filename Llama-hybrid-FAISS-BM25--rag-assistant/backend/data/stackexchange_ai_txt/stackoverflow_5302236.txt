Since your list appears to be homogenous, you can take advantage of the built-in conversion functions that are part of the .NET framework: var x = SchedulerMatrixStorage.Resources.Items .Select(col => Convert.ToInt64(col.Id)).ToList(); The Convert static class provides several conversion functions, one group of which will convert objects of various types to various built-in value types, like long . Most of these functions also have an overload that takes an object parameter (which I'm assuming is what your collection fundamentally contains). Note that this function will fail at runtime if the supplied object is something that can't be converted into a long (such as if you were to pass in, say, a Form ), but judging by your screenshot this should work for you.
