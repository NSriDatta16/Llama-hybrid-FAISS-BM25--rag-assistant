As you seem to know, Adobe helps a lot. They've been doing great work on media protection. You might also want to check their other formats from this article . The summary is here: RTMP: unencrypted RTMPT: tunneled over HTTP, means RTMP data is encapsulated as valid HTTP data RTMPS: sent over a secure socket layer (SSL) RTMPE: an enhanced and encrypted version of RTMP, faster than SSL and does not require certificate management as SSL does RTMPTE: encrypts the communication channel, tunneling over HTTP. The key benefits over SSL (RTMPS) are performance, ease of implementation, and limited impact on server capacity. If you also plan to use Adobe's Open Source Media Framework as you say in your original post, I can't see why you can't secure your content in the way you described. The answer to your question is that I doubt you'll find anything better. Check out this interesting blog post by Google and pay attention to paragraph 6. If Google uses them, I think you should take that as a hint. Content Protection YouTube doesn't own the videos that you watch - they're owned by their respective creators, who control how those videos are distributed through YouTube. For YouTube Rentals, video owners require us to use secure streaming technology, such as the Flash Platform's RTMPE protocol, to ensure their videos are not redistributed. Without content protection, we would not be able to offer videos like this.
