In addition to Clojure's approach to concurrency via immutable data, vars, refs (and software transactional memory), atoms and agents... it's a Lisp, which is worth learning. You get Lisp macros, destructuring, first class functions and closures, the REPL, and dynamic typing - plus literals for lists, vectors, maps, and sets - all on top of interoperability with Java libraries (and there's a CLR version being developed too.) It's not exactly the same as Scheme or Common Lisp, but learning it will help you if you ever want to work through the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs or grok what Paul Graham's talking about in his essays , and you can relate to this comic from XKCD. ;-)
