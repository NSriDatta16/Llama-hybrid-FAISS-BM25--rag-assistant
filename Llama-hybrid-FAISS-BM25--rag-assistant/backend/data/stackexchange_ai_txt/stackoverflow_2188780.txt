You can also try to use this pragma (it requires GCC >= 4.4) : #pragma GCC optimize opt_list void f() This pragma allow you to turn on and off specific optimizations for given function. opt_list is list of -f* options without -f. There is also function attribute to change optimization level: int f() __attribute__((optimize(1))); You also can change global optimization level (apply to all subsequent functions): #pragma GCC optimize 1 #pragma GCC optimize 0 You also can use (apply to all subsequent functions): #pragma GCC optimization_level n and for Intel C compiler ( doc ; applied only for next function) #pragma intel optimization_level n
