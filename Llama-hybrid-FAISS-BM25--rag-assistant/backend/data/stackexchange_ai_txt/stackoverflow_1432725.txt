I wouldn't use a tag to group a label and its field, since it's not a paragraph. If you have no other use for you could use one per "row". If you have three inputs for birthday then a fieldset is totally appropriate. A definition list as Gavin suggested isn't a bad idea but it does seem like unnecessary markup - you can just style the labels and inputs to the right widths and float them. Adding wrapper classes is also perfectly valid - remember that you don't have to use them in CSS, they add a semantic layer regardless. There may even be a microformat you can use in some cases. You can also use attribute selectors to style inputs nicely: input[type="text"], input[type="password"] { border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; } input[type="submit"], input[type="reset"] { border: 1px solid #666; background: #ccc; }
