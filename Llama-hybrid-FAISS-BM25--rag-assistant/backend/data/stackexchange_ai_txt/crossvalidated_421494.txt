Causality has nothing to do with regression. You can regress any variables that are not causally linked. Better way of thinking of regression is "response of Y to X", or "relationship of Y and X". And in this regard it does not matter if the link function is identical (as in the normal regression) or logit function (as in the logistic regression). In logistic regression the response of Y to X will just have different shape due to the logit link function than it would have in normal regression. So the answer is no, there are no differences in causality.
