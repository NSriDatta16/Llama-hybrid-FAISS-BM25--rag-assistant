Question on how to sample randomly from the given distribution

I have following distribution which looks as follows: $P\left(\kappa| u,v,\lambda,y\right) \propto \kappa^{-\frac{n}{2}}exp\left\{-\cfrac{1}{2\kappa}\left[\epsilon + (u_1-u_2)^2 + (u_2-u_3)^2 \right] \right\} $ I want to generate samples from above distribution. This distribution is also referred to in article, : BAYESIAN IMAGE RESTORATION,WITH TWO APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS, by Julian Besag et. al. Page 9, equation 4.6 The author proposes to sample via using standard chi-square distributions. I am not sure how to do above. The standard chi-square distribution looks as follows (a bit different from above): $P\left(\kappa\right) \propto \kappa^{\frac{n}{2}}exp\left\{-\kappa/2 \right\}$ . My questions is, given the structure of the distribution in beginning, is it ok to sample from chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom? Or shall I assume it to be same as Inverse Gamma with parameters: $\alpha = \cfrac{n}{2} - 1, \beta = \cfrac{\left[\epsilon + (u_1-u_2)^2 + (u_2-u_3)^2 \right]}{2}$ , Thanks
