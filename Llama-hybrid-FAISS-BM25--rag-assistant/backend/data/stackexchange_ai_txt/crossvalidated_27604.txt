Independence means that the joint density function for a set of variables is a product of their individual marginal densities. This doesn't change in the context of time series. $f(x,y)$ is the joint density for $X$ at $x$ and $Y$ at $y$. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent then it is the product of $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$. Note that $X$ and $Y$ do not have to have the same density. That is why Wikipedia used the subscripts and you should have too. Now in general if the variables are dependent than you need to know the form of the density and the value of the parameters. For example the bivariate normal density looks as follows: $$ f_{X,Y}(x, y) = c e^{-q(x,y)} $$, where the normalizing constant is $$c = \frac{1}{2π \sqrt{(1-ρ^2)} σ_x σ_y} $$ and $$q(x,y) = \frac{ \left( \frac{(x-μ_x)^2}{σ_{x}^2} - \frac{2 ρ (x-μ_x)(y-μ_y)}{σ_x σ_y} + \frac{(y-μ_y)^2}{σ_{y}^2}\right) }{2(1- ρ^2)} $$ We have two variances a correlation and constants in the formula. Given the parameters $ρ$, $σ_x$, $σ_y$ and $μ_x$ and $μ_y$ the joint density can be calculated.
