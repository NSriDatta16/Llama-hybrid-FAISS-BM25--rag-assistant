Are Deep Learning and GPUs changing the game?

"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." --- Box, George E. P.; Norman R. Draper (1987). Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces, p. 424, Wiley. ISBN 0471810339. There is a great post on this topic in a previous post What is the meaning of "All models are wrong, but some are useful" I just wanted to have some opinions regarding whether this holds true for modern Deep Learning models as well ? I mean arent all models useful nowadays ? I mean look at Alexa, Siri, Google maps, all of these have made our lives incredibly smoother. Isint it ?
