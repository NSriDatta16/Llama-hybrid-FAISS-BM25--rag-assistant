I think people have decided to take the root of MSE to make it more interpretable by rescaling it to that of data. And I don't see any problem with your interpretation of on average being wrong by about 11 units. This becomes more sensible when you take into account the range of your data. For example, an RMSE of 11 for predicting people's height in 'mm' could be very good but not satisfactory in 'cm'. Hence, interpreting RMSE and judging how good it is depends on the context of the problem you are trying to solve.
