I have mixed feelings about #11. On the one hand, I think a few casual interview white board questions can be very misleading. Candidates don't always expect it, they are nervous and asked to code in front of an audience. Gah! On the other hand, I feel like you could get a feel for how someone would fit in your organization with a short computer quiz. If you use a temp service with temp to hire, does that count if you do code reviews on their early work? Then the job becomes the quiz.
