That's most likely the "best" way. But keep in mind that it's not just alpha-trans that IE6 doesn't implement properly when it comes to PNG files; the color space is corrupt due to IE not implementing the gamma properly, and thus PNG files often show "darker" than they should. One alternative "solution" that we implemented on a recent project was to mark every png image with a "toGif" class, in the CSS of which a custom behavior .htc is called which changes the .png extension to .gif if the browser is detected to be one we've marked as a problem. We just include a GIF version of every PNG alongside it in the same path, and if the browser is found to be one that doesn't handle PNGs properly, it swaps it out with a GIF version of the image. We therefore sacrifice the alpha blending in favor of guaranteed full-on transparency and color accuracy, and only do so when we know it's probably not going to look right as-is. It may not be an ideal solution, but it's the nature of cross-browser I suppose. Edit: Actually now that I look at the project in question, we used an .htc behavior for an img class called "alpha" as well which tosses the correct filter on the image automatically. So you're detecting the browser using javascript instead of an IE6-only pure CSS hack, so it might be a little bit more elegant... but it's basically the same thing.
