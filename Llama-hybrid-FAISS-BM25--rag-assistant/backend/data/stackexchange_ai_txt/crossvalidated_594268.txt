Multivariate logistic regression R

I have 6 binary response variables, and I wish to explore what variables can predict these binary outcomes. glm(cbind(Y1,Y2)~X1+X2, data = dt) doesn't do the work. It gives me an error: eval(family$initialize) : y values must be 0 Also, both glm(Y1~X1+X2, data = dt) & glm(Y2~X1+X2, data = dt) work. This means data are in the right class This answer suggested to use glmer() , but glmer() gives me an error saying that random effects were not specified, and I don't need random effects This answer didn't provide a way to do multivariate logistic regression Both Bayesian & frequentist methods are welcomed
