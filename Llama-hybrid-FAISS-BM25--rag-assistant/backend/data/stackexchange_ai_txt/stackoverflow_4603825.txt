In your application delegate should be the methods: - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application you will also be notified when someone push the home button or switch the app. //EDIT: if you generally want to log the power settings: go to your iPhone settings and choose 'Developer Settings' (I think there have to be a developer profile installed). There you can enable 'Power Logging' (the log file would be transferred to your XCode Organizer tool)
