No correlation found between dataset features

I'm trying to build a classification model that predicts the price of New York taxi trips (year 2018). Datasource page Since the original file is very large (112 234 626 rows), I constructed the smaller sample file (1 000 000 rows) to make the first exploratory analysis. By using this sample file I constructed Heatmap chart to display the correlations between dataset features. I found out that the model's dependent variable (fare_amount) is only correlated to trip_distance variable. The other independant variables didn't have any considerable correlation. Does this mean that the dataset I use is not appropriate for the classification task? Or I haven't solved the task correctly? How many independent variables should correlate to the dependent variable to count it "good enough" for further analysis? Which method should I prefer for feature selection and dimensionality detection? Should it be Heatmap chart, PCA or something else? My code in GitHub
