Parametric tests assume that your data come from some sort of parametric model. For example, it can be as simple as assuming your data are iid draws from a normal distribution, to a complicated time series model where the variables come from some parametric distribution and possess a parametric functional relationship. For example, we can say $Z_t=\phi_1\varepsilon_{t}+\phi_2\varepsilon_{t-1}\phi_3\varepsilon_{t-2}$ where $\varepsilon_t \sim F_{\theta}$ Here, we have two types of parameters, $\phi$ which define a functional relationship, and $\theta$, which specifies the particular member of a parametric family (e.g., $F_{\mu,\sigma}=N(\mu,\sigma)\to F_{0,2}:=N(0,2)$). So, if you have a bunch of $Z_i$, then you'd use the above model to estimate these parameters (e.g., using maximum likelihood estimation). Nonparametric models are somewhat of a misnomer, since they still impose structure on your problem. However, they usually only partially specify the model, often very partial. A good example is the signed rank test , which assumes only that the distribution is symmetric, and you are trying to estimate its median.
