If your data is correct then i see a factor of gender also. I hope that is taken into account and also take Disp_action as categorical variable (one hot encoding). Also, try to club pre and post action scores in one fields as output variable. Another field can simply tell if the output score is pre action or post action. This feature engineering, I hope will give better results.
