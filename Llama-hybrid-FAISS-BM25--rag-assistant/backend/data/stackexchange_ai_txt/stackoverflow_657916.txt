If you need to retrieve this path programmatically then you can do something like: using(DirectoryEntry de = new DirectoryEntry("IIS://Localhost/w3svc/1/root/storage1/test")) { string pathToFiles = de.Properties["Path"].Value; // Do my file tidy up tasks.... } There are a couple of things to note: The number ' 1 ' in the path of the DirectoryEntry constructor is the IIS number of the site. In the path IIS://Localhost/w3svc/1/root/storage1/test , the first part IIS://Localhost/w3svc/1/root is your website's 'root' application. You always need this part. You would need to add a reference to the System.DirectoryServices assembly to your project.
