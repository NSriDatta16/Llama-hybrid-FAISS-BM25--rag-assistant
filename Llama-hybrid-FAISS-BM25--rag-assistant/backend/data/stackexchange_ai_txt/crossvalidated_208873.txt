Sure, you can reduce dimensions, but you need the original 50k gene expression information -- so don't throw anything away, yet. First, filter out genes that are not significantly differentially expressed across the categories. To do this, use ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Once you identify genes significantly differentially expressed across categories, run the R-Project's Random Forests decision tree classification package, which will provide Importance Scores for the genes that contribute the most to prediction accuracy of the classes (categories). Let the Random Forests package do the "heavy lifting" for you, and it will be helpful if you reduce the 50K down to something on the ~2-3k level before running RF.
