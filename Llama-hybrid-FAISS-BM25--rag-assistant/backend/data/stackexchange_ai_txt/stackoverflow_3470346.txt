I suggest you check if the string contains /home/adam/Projects/red , and if it does, you use substr to get the part after it, and you glue it with http://localost . $path = '/home/adam/Projects/red/storage/*snip*.jpg'; $basePath = "/home/adam/Projects/red"; if (strpos($path, $path) !== false) $url = 'http://localhost' . substr($path, strlen($basePath));
