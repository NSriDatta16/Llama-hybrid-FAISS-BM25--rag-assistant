I think your 1K thing is a red herring. There have been a number of similar questions asked with good answers, have a look though these: How do you make sure email you send programmatically is not automatically marked as spam? Avoid being blocked by web mail companies for mass/bulk emailing? Sending solicited mass email Note that the primary requirement to avoid being your mail being marked as spam is NOT TO SEND SPAM. Your description sounds a lot like spam, in which case no amount of clever tricks will help you. Providing you are not actually sending spam, a professional organisation such as http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ or http://www.mailchimp.com/ is probably cheaper than the amount of time you will require to do this properly.
