I personally find reports of "effect sizes" to be less compelling than seeing results in original scales. My hesitation to recommend "effect size" measures is enhanced by the extra difficulties in just what an "effect size" means in mixed models or generalized linear models. The R emmeans package provides a way to calculate Cohen's d from many types of models when it makes sense, with an eff_size() function. See the pairwise comparisons section of the vignette for an introduction. Nevertheless, the package author, Russ Lenth, discusses why presenting Cohen's d isn't always a good idea, in comments on this answer about the degrees of freedom (d.f) to specify to get an "effect size" for a mixed model. In particular : In a simple lm() model, things are a lot more straightforward. In a mixed model, there is a lot more ambiguity. But to me, the d.f. to use is the smallest issue. What's bigger is deciding what you are even talking about when you compute an effect size. There is a lot of discussion on this, and from where I sit, the question is nearly unanswerable. I don't really believe in effect sizes. I provided the function because I thought [it] was important to account for uncertainty in the SD estimate if you insist on computing an effect size. As Robert Long points out , Cohen's d doesn't make sense for generalized linear models. He recommends using odds ratios as a measure of "effect size" for logistic models. See if you can present your results in the original scales as much as possible. That will remove ambiguity in the meaning of the term "effect size" and be most directly related to the things that you are measuring.
