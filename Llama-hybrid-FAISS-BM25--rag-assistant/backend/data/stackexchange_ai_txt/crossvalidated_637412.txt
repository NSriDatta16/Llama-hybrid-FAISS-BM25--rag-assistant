I was using the letter $g$ to denote estimators (e.g., $g_\theta$ or $g_{\mu_X}$ ), but I became concerned because the letter $g$ is widespread to denote Hedge's $g$ in meta-analyses. I believe there is no single letter in the English alphabet that isn't already commonly used to denote something else in statistics, much less in mathematics broadly. This is not necessarily a deal-breaker for the use of the letter $g$ , but we could use a more descriptive string of characters to denote the function, much like how statisticians may use $\operatorname{var}(\theta)$ to denote $\sigma^2_\theta$ , $\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)$ to denote $\sigma_{X,Y}$ , $\operatorname{Bias}(g)$ to denote the bias of an estimator $g$ , etc. Thus, here is a suggestion: parameter: $\theta$ estimator of $\theta$ : $\operatorname{estr}_\theta$ estimate of $\theta$ : $\hat\theta$ standard error of $\operatorname{estr}_\theta$ : $\sigma_{\operatorname{estr}_\theta}$ estimator of $\sigma_{\operatorname{estr}_\theta}$ : $\operatorname{estr}_{\sigma_{\operatorname{estr}_\theta}}$ However, a major disadvantage of putting the estimand into the subscript is that it is likely too small for readers, especially when considering standard errors and estimators of standard errors. As far as I am aware (I also asked ChatGPT 4), "estr" is not an operator name that is already used in other areas of mathematics, thus there is little to no risk of cross-disciplinary confusion with using it. Notice the letter 'r' in $\operatorname{estr}$ is important, otherwise it would be $\operatorname{est}$ which novices may easily misinterpret as "estimate". Note: I have a prior similar answer on this page, which I updated to reflect a major limitation of that one.
