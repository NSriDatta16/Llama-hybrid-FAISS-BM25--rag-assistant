LDA is also called Fisher’s linear discriminant. I refer you to page 186 of book “Pattern recognition and machine learning” by Christopher Bishop. The objective function that you are looking for is called Fisher’s criterion J(w) and is formulated in page 188 of the book. The Fisher criterion is defined to be the ratio of the between-class variance to the within-class variance.
