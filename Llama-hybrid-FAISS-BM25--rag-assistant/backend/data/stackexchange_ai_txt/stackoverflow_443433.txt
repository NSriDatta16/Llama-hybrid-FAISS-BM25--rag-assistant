I'd actually consider it to be 3 operations: read, increment (or whatever), write. That's assuming it's reading from some sort of shared memory into some sort of local storage (e.g. register or stack), operating on the local storage, then writing back. How many operations it is at assembly level will depend on what you're incrementing, the platform, the hardware etc.
