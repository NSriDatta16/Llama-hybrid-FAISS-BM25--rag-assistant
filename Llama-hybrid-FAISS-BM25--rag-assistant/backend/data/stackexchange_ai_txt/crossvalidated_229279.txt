Software for computing with extremely wide probability distributions

My friend and I need to make some calculations involving probability distributions over extremely wide ranges of values. For example, I want to be able to take a bunch of random variables with lognormal PDFs, add and multiply them together, then use this as a likelihood function in a Bayesian update of a Pareto distribution prior, and take the mean of the resulting posterior distribution. My distributions often have significant probability mass over 50 orders of magnitude. So I can't just approximate everything as log-normal distributions. My friend has currently implemented this with buckets on a log scale, with about 4 buckets per order of magnitude. This is somewhat slow and we haven't proven any error bounds on this approach. I feel like it's quite foolish to try to write statistical computation software as an amateur. Is there an existing library that implements this kind of functionality?
