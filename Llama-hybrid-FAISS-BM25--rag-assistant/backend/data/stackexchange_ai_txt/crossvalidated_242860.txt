What is the difference between denoising autoencoder and contractive autoencoder?

Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) works by inducing some noise in the input vector and then transforming it into the hidden layer, while trying to reconstruct the original vector. However, I fail to understand the intuition of Contractive Autoencoders (CAE). Does the CAE say that the hidden layer will only learn the features that differentiate one input from the rest of the inputs in a vector? If so then how would we reconstruct the original vector?
