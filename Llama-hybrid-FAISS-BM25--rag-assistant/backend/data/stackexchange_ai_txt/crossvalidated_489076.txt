EWMA covariance matrix number of lags

When calculating an exponentially weighted covariance matrix for t observations, formula 10.2 here: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/analysis-of-financial/9781118017098/c10_level1_1.xhtml Uses observations 1 (earliest) to t-1 (oldest-1). Why doesn't it use the oldest observation, t, like a simple moving average or exponential moving average? It says "For a sufficiently large t such that λt−1 ≈ 0....", so if you have a smaller number of observations where λt−1 >0, you would use observations 1 to t in formula 10.2? Thank you
