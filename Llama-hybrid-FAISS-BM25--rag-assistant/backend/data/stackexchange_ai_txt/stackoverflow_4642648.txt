My current stack of Testing tools is: Steak, instead of Cucumber. Capybara with driver Akephalos, instead of Selenium. RSpec Machinist2, instead of factory girl. https://github.com/cavalle/steak https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara http://rspec.info/ https://github.com/notahat/machinist I learned a lot about testing with the book: The Rspec Book, by the Pragmatic Programmers. http://pragprog.com/ You have more detailed information in this other question: Rails: Good Rspec2 example usage? (Also: Cucumber, Pickle, Capybara)
