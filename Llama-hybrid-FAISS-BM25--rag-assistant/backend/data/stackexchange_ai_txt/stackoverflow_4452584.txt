I haven't used draggable objects yet, but the website says... To manipulate the position of a draggable during drag, you can either use a wrapper as the draggable helper and position the wrapped element with absolute positioning, or you can correct internal values like so: $(this).data('draggable').offset.click.top -= x You can also apply a style to the .ui-draggable-dragging class, but that's only a band-aid.
