Unsupervised image segmentation

I am trying to implement an algorithm where given an image with several objects on a plane table, desired is the output of segmentation masks for each object. Unlike in CNN's, the objective here is to detect objects in an unfamiliar environment. What are the best approaches to this problem? Also, are there any implementation examples available online? Edit: I am sorry, question may have been a bit misleading. What I meant by "unfamiliar environment" is that objects may be unknown to the algorithm. The algorithm shouldn't need to understand what the object is, but should only detect the object. How should I approach this problem?
