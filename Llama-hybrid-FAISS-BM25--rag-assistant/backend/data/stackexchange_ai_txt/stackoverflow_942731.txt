In Java, prefuse is by far the best graph drawing package. It has a very fast force-directed layout algorithm, and since you can tweak the parameters in real time and drag nodes around to get the graph looking the way you want, you’ll be able to explore and arrange much larger graphs than with any non-interactive system. Try out this demo applet and you’ll fall in love with it too...
