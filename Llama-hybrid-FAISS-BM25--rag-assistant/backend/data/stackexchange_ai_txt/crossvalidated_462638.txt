Not sure about T test's sample size

I have a dataset that has when a user clicked over a period of 31 days in an app. Its possible that all users won't have 31 days of clicks as they might not be using the app on a particular day. The questions I am trying to answer "Would you conclude Rafa and Roger's average numbers of click per day to be different?". Hence, I was considering to do a T test But I am not sure if sample sizes should be 23 and 26 respectively as Rafa and Roger have only 26 and 23 days of data in the month of Jan'19 or it should be 31 for both of them? Here is the dataset: Rafa Roger 1/1/2019 264 1 1/2/2019 352 98 1/3/2019 243 396 1/4/2019 243 4 1/5/2019 3 631 1/8/2019 637 438 1/9/2019 1247 229 1/10/2019 634 7 1/11/2019 4 4 1/12/2019 711 3 1/13/2019 2 1/15/2019 58 963 1/16/2019 1005 729 1/17/2019 782 108 1/18/2019 613 237 1/19/2019 565 838 1/20/2019 291 1/21/2019 2 11 1/22/2019 786 466 1/23/2019 968 417 1/24/2019 638 1940 1/26/2019 2 1/27/2019 4 20 1/29/2019 676 546 1/30/2019 530 149 1/31/2019 573 483
