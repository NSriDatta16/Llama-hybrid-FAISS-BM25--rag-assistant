Does HTML5 ban th cells from tbody?

I have the following markup as a part of a Razor view: Presidents Name Born Died Washington 1732 1799 With the "target schema for validation" set to HTML5, Visual Studio complains thusly: Warning 1 Validation (HTML5): Element 'th' must not be nested within element 'tbody tfoot'. Is this really true? If so, could someone link to the spec? My understanding was that using for row headers was not just legal but encouraged. It certainly seems fairly common, I could link dozens of tutorials explaining (seemingly sensibly) that it helps with accessibility. Is this a VS bug? A real change coming with HTML5 (a good one? a bad one?)? What's the story?
