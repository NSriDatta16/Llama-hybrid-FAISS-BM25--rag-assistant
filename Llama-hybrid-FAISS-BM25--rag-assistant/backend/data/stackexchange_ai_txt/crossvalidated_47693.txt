Defining Empirical Risk Minimization

I am reading Machine Learning - A probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy and in chapter 6.5 the author discusses Empirical Risk Minimization , and provides the following definition: $p_*(\mathbf{x}, y) \approx p_{\text{emp}} (\mathbf{x}, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_i \delta_{\mathbf{x}_i}(\mathbf{x})\delta_{y_i}(y)$ and then defines the empirical risk as follows: $R_{\text{emp}}(D, D) = R(p_{\text{emp}}, \delta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_i L(y_i) \delta(\mathbf{x}_i)$ I am having a hard time understanding the two formulas above, but mostly, what is the difference between $\delta_{\mathbf{x}_i}(\mathbf{x})$, $\delta_{y_i}(y)$, and $\delta ({\mathbf{x}_i}) $?
