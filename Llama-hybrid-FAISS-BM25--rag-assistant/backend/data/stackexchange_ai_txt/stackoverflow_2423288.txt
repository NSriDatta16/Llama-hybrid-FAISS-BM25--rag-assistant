Ways to do timeouts in Perl?

I frequently use the following pattern to set an upper bound to the running time of a particular code fragment in Perl: my $TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 5; eval { local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "alarm\n" }; alarm($TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS); # do stuff that might timeout. alarm(0); }; if ($@) { # handle timeout condition. } My questions: Is this the right way to do it? Are there any circumstances under which the running time can exceed $TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, or is the above method bullet-proof?
