Best way to implement tab stops in valid XHTML?

For explanation imagine a simple address. Written in a HTML paragraph with line breaks it would like this: Street: Example Street 1 City: Vienna Zip Code: 1010 Country: Austria Most of the time that's completely okay, but sometimes I have to achieve the following output: Street: Example Street 1 City: Vienna Zip Code: 1010 Country: Austria My thoughts so far: Should be valid XHTML and work or degrade gracefully in all major browsers Using tags in a semantically correct way is strongly preferred Because of point two: I hope there's a better solution than tables The problem is not limited to addresses - would be useful in other situation too How do you achieve this output (using HTML and/or CSS)?
