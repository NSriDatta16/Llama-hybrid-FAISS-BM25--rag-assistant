Robert Long already gave a nice answer, but let me add my three cents. As already noticed by Dave in the comment, when fitting fixed effects models you are asking the question what are the differences between those particular cities , while with random effects model you ask what is the variability between cities . Those are quite different questions to ask. If you are interested in more in-depth discussion of differences between both types of models, you can check my answer in the Fixed effect vs random effect when all possibilities are included in a mixed effects model thread. It's a different question, but the answer discusses the kind of issues that are closely related to questions as yours.
