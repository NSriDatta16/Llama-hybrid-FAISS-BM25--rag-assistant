I suggest defining some kind of "global base path" and deducing the other paths from there. Like, define('BASE_PATH', '/home/me/'); ... include(BASE_PATH . 'Config.php'); include(BASE_PATH . 'subdirectory/other.php'); and so on. This kind of (semi)absolute paths are less fragile than relative paths containing lots of ../ s. (Not to say that there's anything fundamentally wrong with relative paths, but they're harder to get just right and tend to break more easily. If /a includes b/c and b/c includes ../d/e , is that relative to /b/ or relative to / , or does it depend on whether we started from /a vs. called b/c directly? I don't even know. Better just use the absolute paths, they're easy and unambiguous :-).
