Regarding the likelihood, there is no difference in the mathematical formula and computation. Suppose there is one data point $y$ ans we assume $y\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ . Then the likelihood is: $$\dfrac{1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}} e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {y-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}.$$ If any, there is one theoretical difference. That is the way we treat the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ . In the Bayesian framework, the parameters are random (that is why we need priors), whereas in the frequentist inference, they are fixed.
