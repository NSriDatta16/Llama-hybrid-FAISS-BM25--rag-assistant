I resolved this problem, but it feels like a hack. I had to add a stream timeout (5 seconds) to the ReadByte call. The host drops the stream and the client does not detect it. In order to keep the timeout from firing due to inactivity, I had to add a keepalive thread that sends a mouse move if the client is idle. I think there is a more elegant way to do the keep alive, but it's working for now.
