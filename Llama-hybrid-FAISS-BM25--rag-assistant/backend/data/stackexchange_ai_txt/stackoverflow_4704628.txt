XElement NullReferenceException

I have the following code. XElement opCoOptOff = doc.Descendants(ns + "OpCoOptOff").FirstOrDefault(); String opCo = opCoOptOff.Element(ns + "strOpCo").Value; Now if the element I return is null, I am getting a NullReferenceException since the XElement is null. So I changed it to the following. String opCo = opCoOptOff.Element(ns + "strOpCo").Value; if(opCoOptOff != null) { String opCo = opCoOptOff.Element(ns + "strOpCo").Value; I am hoping there has to be a more elegant way to do this since this scenario comes up often and I would like to avoid doing this type of check every time there is an issue. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated
