Check if that port is actually reachable from the node. At the node you can try to telnet MASTER_IP 59204 . The Hudson master machine may have a firewall that's currently blocking such access. Hudson by default uses a random port number for each node to connect via JNLP. You can configure it to use a fixed port number. This works well if you have a firewall and only want to expose a limited number of ports for connection from the outside. Go to Manage Hudson and change TCP port for JNLP slave agents to a fixed port number.
