I'm unsure of the technique that you are using. It also seems that you are considering an uncommon transformation. If I'm understanding correctly, the base variable is $Z \sim \chi^2_n$ and the transformed variable $X = f_Z(Z)$ , the probability density function (pdf) of $Z$ . To be precise, we consider the transformation $$ X = \frac{1}{2^{n/2} \Gamma \left(n/2\right)}Z^{n/2-1} \exp \left(-Z/2\right). $$ In order to find the pdf of the transformed variable, $X$ , we need to find the inverse of the above equation. The transformation is one-to-one and the support remains unchanged; however, there is no closed-form solution for the inverse of $X$ . The inverse function can be shown to be a Lambert W-function. Specifically, $$ Z(X) = -(n-2)W\left(- \frac{\left(2^{n/2} \Gamma \left(n/2\right)X\right)^{2/(n-2)}}{(n-2)}\right). $$ Therefore, by definition, the pdf of $X$ is $$ f_X(x) = f_Z(Z(x)) \left| \frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d} x} Z(x) \right|, \quad x>0, $$ where the derivative of the Lambert W-function can be simplified. If one wants to find the moments of $X$ , then its a question of evaluating powers of the density of a $\chi^2$ random variable. Using the first formula, we have that \begin{eqnarray*} \mbox{E}[X] &=& \frac{1}{2^{n/2} \Gamma \left(n/2\right)} \mbox{E}\left[Z^{n/2-1} \exp \left(-Z/2\right)\right] \\ &=& \frac{1}{2^{n} \Gamma^2 \left(n/2\right)} \int_0^{\infty} z^{n-2} \exp(-z) \mbox{d} z \\ &=& \frac{\Gamma(n-1)}{2^{n} \Gamma^2 \left(n/2\right)} \\ &=& \frac{\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2})}{4\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) }. \end{eqnarray*}
