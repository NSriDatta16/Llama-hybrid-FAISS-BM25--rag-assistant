Oblique vs. Orthogonal Rotation for EFA

Will orthogonal relationships show up when using Oblique rotation? Based on the articles I have read on EFA rotation my understanding is that although oblique rotation procedures might be expected to be superior to orthogonal rotation procedures on theoretical grounds, that superiority has yet to be demonstrated empirically.
