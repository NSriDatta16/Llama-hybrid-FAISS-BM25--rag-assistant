Why logistic regression cannot be solved by OLS

I know I mess up different things. However I want to get better understanding what is motivation behind logistic regression. $p(y_i=1|x_i)=(1+e^{-x_iw})^{-1}$ and according to OLS $S(w)=\sum_{i}^{}(y_i-\hat{y_i})^2$,where $y \in \{1,0\}$. What if $\hat{y_i}=p(y_i=1|x_i)$ and estimate $w$ by finding minimum to $S(w)$. Why this is incorrect approach?
