WPF Listbox auto scroll while dragging

I have a WPF app that has a ListBox . The drag mechanism is already implemented, but when the list is too long and I want to move an item to a position not visible, I can't. For example, the screen shows 10 items. And I have 20 items. If I want to drag the last item to the first position I must drag to the top and drop. Scroll up and drag again. How can I make the ListBox auto scroll?
