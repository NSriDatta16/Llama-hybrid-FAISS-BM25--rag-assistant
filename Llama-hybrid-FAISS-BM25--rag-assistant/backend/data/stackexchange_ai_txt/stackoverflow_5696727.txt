I don't know if you still be able to copy text, I think not. But here is how to deal with it. In your touchesBegan method put this if statement //Get the touch object from touches set. if(![NSStringFromClass([[touch view] class]) isEqualToString:@"UIWebView"]){ [theTextField resignFirstResponder]; } the theTextField is the object responsible for displaying the keyboard. Hope this helps.
