It is not recent but many textbooks, video series, etc in Econometrics still do not acknowledge this. You can have a look into the papers below. The classic reference would be the Sims, Stock and Watson paper. Definetly also look into Lütkepohl, he is an authority when it comes to SVARS. You are incorrect in stating that "there has to be cointegration" to use VAR in levels. You can also estimate VAR in levels of non-stationary variables when there is no cointegration present! However, the Phillips, Durlauf and Ashley, Vergbugge papers argue for SVARs in levels instead of VECMs if cointegration is present (under certain conditions). Sims, C. A., Stock, J. H., & Watson, M.
