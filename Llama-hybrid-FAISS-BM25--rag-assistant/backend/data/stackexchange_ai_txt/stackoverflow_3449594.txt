Ok, now I see your original code I think I see where the advice came from. Instead of imageNamed: you might want to use imageWithContentsOfFile: (as you did in your earlier question). The former caches its images whereas the latter does not. I'm not convinced this is your problem here though. What is less clear is where this code fits into your bigger system. I presume the first stretch of code (all the imageNamed: calls) is in an init method? Is that the case? Is the //start animation section really in the same method, or somewhere else. This is not clear because you then include your touchesBegan: method in its entirety. You also don't show where myimageview is being created - and who owns it. If you create it within the same class then you should also be releasing it in dealloc . Talking of dealloc it seems to be missing from this version - was that only in the new version? You need it here (more so). I know its hard to post snippets of code unambiguously - but in this case I think these are the things that need clarification. If your setup code (the imageNamed: stretch) is being called every time that may well explain it - as might the lack of releasing myimageview .
