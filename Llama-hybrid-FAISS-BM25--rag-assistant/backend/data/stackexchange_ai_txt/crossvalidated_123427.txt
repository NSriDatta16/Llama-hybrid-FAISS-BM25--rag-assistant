One or two output neurons for a binary classification task with an artificial neural network

Suppose you have a classification problem in which you want to classify inputs into two exclusive classes (y1 and y2) with an artificial neural network (which models P(y|x)). Among the two following architectures for the output layer, which one is better to model P(y|x)? use two output neurons, one for each class, with a softmax activation function. If a1 and a2 are the outputs of the two output neurons, P(y=y1|x)=a1 and P(y=y2|x)=a2 with a1+a2=1. use a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function. If a is the output of the neuron, we can set P(y=y1|x)=a and P(y=y2|x)=1-a. I can see the two following advantages, which suggests that the choice depends on the specific problem: In 1., the last layer has twice more parameters than in 2. and thus has more flexibility and can potentially model more complicated relationships. In 2., the last layer has twice less parameters than 1. and thus is less prone to overfitting.
