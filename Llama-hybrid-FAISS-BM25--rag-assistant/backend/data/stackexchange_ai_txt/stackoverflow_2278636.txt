Resetting all styles to get rid of the differences in the browser stylesheets might be a good idea. YUI's reset.css can do this for you. then you can start from scratch to format your paragraphs, using percentages for font size , spacing etc. (see YUI CSS cheatsheet ). EDIT: Just saw your comment to cletus' answer. So: what CSS are you using for laying out your text?
