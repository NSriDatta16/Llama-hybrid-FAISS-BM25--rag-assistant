How to make a pipeline for Videos Dataset for TensorFlow [Sequence Matters] & train Model Effectively with Low Memory System

I am working on a Deep Learning project and I am facing an issue with the size of the dataset. I want to make a pipeline for video dataset [Sequence Matters] . Because if I try the load the whole dataset then TensorFlow throughs an error which indirectly means out of memory . I read on the Official TensorFlow documentation about the tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator , tf.data and tf.data.Dataset for making pipeline for image dataset to load them in batches and avoid memory bottlenecks. This issue is that I want to do the same thing but with video dataset. As you know Videos consists of frames and the sequence of the frames matter a lot in recognition problems. I want to extract the frames from each video and load them in RAM in sequence to train my model, and I also want to achieve this in efficient manner (Loading 5 Videos samples at a given time to avoid full memory problem) File Structure of the dataset is attached below:
