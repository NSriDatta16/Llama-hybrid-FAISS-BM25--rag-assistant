Use a lazy initialized singeton with appropriate field to store your data. eg of this singleton at http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/singleton.html You can have the property to be of type "IDictionary " if you want them organised by Category and iterable by keyword. You can use "IDIctionary " IDIctionary if you want to be search able by category and keyword. If I read your question correctly, this would be an appropriate choice for you
