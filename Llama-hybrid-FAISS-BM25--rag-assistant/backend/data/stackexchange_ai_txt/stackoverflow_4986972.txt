PHP Document management

I am looking for a mature PHP-based, preferably Open Source, Document management solution. Requirements: Manage documents, preferably in a folder structure Clean architecture Half-way nice-looking interface (I can customize but need a clean basis) Can fulltext index PDF, OpenOffice and ideally MS Office formats Multi-user capable Must be a browser-based web app, no Java clients etc. Self-hosted solution Nice to haves: An API to read / write documents would be great PHP5 based architecture Versioning (Storage of multiple versions of a document) Image thumbnails Tagging I am aware of KnowledgeTree (about to do a test install) OpenDocMan (very interesting, about to do a test install) and would appreciate any additional hints and links to related projects - also in the direction of Asset Management for advertising agencies and such. For a brilliant, totally outstanding killer application that does most things out of the box I would also be ready to go beyond PHP (but it has to be a web app). I checked through the dupes but found no question going into the right direction.
