One example should satisfy all of the assumptions above, A standard choice here would be a $d$ -dimensional target which has all coordinates drawn iid from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . another example should be a target density $\pi_d$ which is not of the product form above, but numerically agree with the result of Roberts et al. and A standard choice here would be to sample $u_1, \ldots, u_d \sim^{iid} \mathcal{U} [0, 1]$ , and consider the $d$ -dimensional target with independent coordinates in which the $i^{th}$ coordinate is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, u_i)$ . the last example should be a target density $\pi_d$ which is again not of the product form above and numerically disagrees with the result. A standard choice here would be to consider the deterministic sequence $v_i = 2^{-i}$ , and consider the $d$ -dimensional target with independent coordinates in which the $i^{th}$ coordinate is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, v_i)$ .
