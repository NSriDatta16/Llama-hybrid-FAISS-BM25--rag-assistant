Dealing with a dataset with a mix of continuous and categorical variables

How do the choice of machine learning algorithm and preprocessing change when some of the independent variables are categorical while others are continuous? Can such data be directly applied to the algorithm with categorical data converted using one-hot encoding? For example, 2 columns are: Age and Race, Age being continuous and Race is categorical. Update: Ideal buckets for a continuous variable is not known.
