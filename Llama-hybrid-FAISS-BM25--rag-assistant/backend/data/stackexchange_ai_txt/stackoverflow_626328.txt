How does "static reflection" work in java? (ex. in mockito or easymock)

I'm a .NET guy - and I mainly code in C#. Since C# 3.0, we can leverage lambda expressions and expression trees to use static reflection . For example, it is possible to implement GetMethodName in the following snippet to return the name of the method passed in parameter: string methodName = GetMethodName( o => o.DoSomething()); Console.WriteLine(methodName); // displays "DoSomething" Now, when I look at Mockito samples (or EasyMock ones) in the java world, I see: LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class); when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first"); How does it work? How does the when method work ? How does it interpret mockedList.get(0) as a call to the get method with 0 passed as parameter and not as a value?
