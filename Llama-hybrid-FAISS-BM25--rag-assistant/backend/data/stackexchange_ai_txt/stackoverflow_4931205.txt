At this link you can find an alternative solution/workaround for Oracle, inspired by C language enums: http://www.petefinnigan.com/weblog/archives/00001246.htm Shortly put, Pete suggests to define some integer constants and to use a SUBTYPE to constrait them: RED constant number(1):=1; GREEN constant number(1):=2; BLUE constant number(1):=3; YELLOW constant number(1):=4; subtype COLORS is binary_integer range 1..4; After that you can declare variables, pass parameters and return values from functions and so on, with type COLORS.
