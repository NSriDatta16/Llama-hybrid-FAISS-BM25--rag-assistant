I think the real question is how can I develop my OO application and still being able to persist its data (objects) in a relational storage, regardless of ORM or no ORM. You should be OK with your approach of being concerned strictly with your object model until you reach real volume, where the impedance mismatch may hurt you. It is still not possible to develop any relational database backed system without thinking about the system's relational model, be it OO or not. Also, the only classes in your object model that need to be "dumbed down" are the ones subject to persistence. All others can be as complex and sophisticated as you wish.
