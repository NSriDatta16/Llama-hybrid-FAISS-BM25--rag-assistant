Amazon Cloud Image istance most suited for R data mining

I'm new to the field of machine learning, I always used my laptop for regular statistical analysis with no performance problems. Though lately I started programming with caret and I find myself stuck with hours optimizing models and resampling datasets. I saw EC2 istances but I can't understand the difference between the different classes, I know that generally the one with highest numbers of cpus and RAM are most performant but what is the best type of istance for R programming (for example p one vs c one)? Then I'll chose the right amount of memory for my applications but I'm wondering if one subset is more suited than the others
