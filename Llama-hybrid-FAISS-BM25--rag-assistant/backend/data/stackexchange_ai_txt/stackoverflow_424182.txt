.NET Deployment (ClickOnce or MSI) Client Settings/Parameters

I've created a windows forms application. I have a requirement of storing some information (in the Registry, Isolated Storage or other serialization method) like ClientID which is a GUID generated from a registration form before the user can download the installation package which is currently ClickOnce deployed. The application is run offline so adding querystring parameters is not an option based on some articles i've read. I thought creating a module to modify the config.deploy file before the client downloads the setup but it might cause some issues when multiple users simultaneously download the app. I'm also looking at having the User enter an email address or any login info at the app's first run, so the necessary info can be downloaded from the web server and stored in the client's machine but i'm not yet sure if they'll approve this method. I hope I've written this clear enough so I can get some answers soon enough. Any comments/suggestions will be appreciated.
