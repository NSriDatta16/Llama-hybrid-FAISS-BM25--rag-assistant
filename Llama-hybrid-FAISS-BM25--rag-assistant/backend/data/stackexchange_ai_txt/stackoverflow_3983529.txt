How do I get a reorder-able, reloading list on a website?

I need a playlist that's editable from multiple computers. It can be or but you must be able to drag rows around. This gets sent to the server, which pushes it down to everybody, so I need updates without reloading the page. I never worked with JavaScript before, but it all seems doable with http://jqueryui.com . Alternatives? (the server seems the easier part, so I'll decide that depending on the widget, but I like Python)
