Full text search algorithm c#

I have a list of object: list(brought from an sql database). Every student has an attribute called Article=article written by this student like: public class Student { public string Article { get; set; } } From my asp.net page users need to search words ,phrase in students articles. The students matching the user search are shown in a datalist. For example when the user type: phrase="Object Oriented Programming" , I need to find all students whom the article contains one the possible combinations of words of the typed phrase:Like "programming", "Object Oriented", "Oriented", .... I have tested with full text index in the database, and it's very slow and I have a problem in embedding wildcard % in a dynamic sql string. Any suggestions?
