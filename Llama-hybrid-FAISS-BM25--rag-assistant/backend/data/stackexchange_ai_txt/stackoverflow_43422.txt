Is there any way to see the progress of an ALTER TABLE statement in MySQL?

For example, I issued an ALTER TABLE statement to create an index on a MEDIUMTEXT field in an InnoDB table that has 134k rows where the size of the index was 255 bytes and the average size of the data in the field is 30k. This command has been running for the last 15 minutes or so (and is the only thing running on the database). Is there any way for me to determine if it is going to finish in closer to 5 minutes, 5 hours, or 5 days?
