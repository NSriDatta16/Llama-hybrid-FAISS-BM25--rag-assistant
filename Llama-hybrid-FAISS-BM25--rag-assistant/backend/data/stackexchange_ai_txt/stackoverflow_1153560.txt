PHP cannot do this, only a client-side language like JavaScript can. That being said, the jQuery library would allow you to do this really easily with its AJAX functionality . Index.php Could be refreshed with the following JavaScript: $("#scores").load("index.php #scores"); That would load the contents of #score from index again without refreshing the entire page. You could even automate it to refresh every 30 seconds using setInterval() ; var $scores = $("#scores"); setInterval(function () { $scores.load("index.php #scores"); }, 30000); You can read more about $.load() at http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments .
