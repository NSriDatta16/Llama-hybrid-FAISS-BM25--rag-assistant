How can different classification algorithms expressed as neural networks?

I have heard that each of the different classification algorithms can be expressed as neural network architecture. How can the different algorithms like Logistic Regression , SVM (Support Vector Machine), ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) be expressed as a neural network? Is there a way to convert the vector equation of a classification algorithm into neural network architecture?
