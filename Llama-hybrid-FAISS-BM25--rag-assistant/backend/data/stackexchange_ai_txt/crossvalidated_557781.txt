It sounds like what you are after is a meta-analysis. This is the frequentist analog to a Bayesian analysis using an informative prior. A meta-analysis can come in many forms. One option is to combine the subject-level observations into a single data set and run a single model to produce p-values and confidence intervals. This is the ideal approach. Another option is to combine summary-level statistics or estimators into a single value and estimate its standard error. One can then perform a hypothesis test to produce a p-value and invert a hypothesis test to construct a confidence interval. Another option is in line with what you proposed, which is to use simulated data that mimics the observed results from a historical study and use option one. Here is a related paper on meta-analysis and transfer learning.
