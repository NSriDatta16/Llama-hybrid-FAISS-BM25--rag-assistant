Applying k-means over PCA

I have a dataset containing 20 columns and 200 rows. This is an unlabeled dataset and I applied PCA to this dataset for dimensionality reduction. After successfully using PCA, I received a dataset with 2 columns(PC1 & PC2) and 200 rows. Then I executed the k-means algorithm on the output dataset(200x2). In the end, I got a graph plotting 5 clusters(X-axis is PC1 and Y-axis is PC2). But, how can we understand what X and Y axis on the graph represents? Also, how is it possible to figure out the understanding from this final graph when I don't have any clue about the values I obtained from PCA?
