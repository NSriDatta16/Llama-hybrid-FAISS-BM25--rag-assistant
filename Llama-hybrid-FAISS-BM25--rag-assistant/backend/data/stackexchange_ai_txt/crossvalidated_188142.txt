Picture in your mind's eye the whole train schedule is already generated; it looks like a line with marks on it, where the marks represent a train arriving. On average, two consecutive marks are fifteen minutes apart half the time, and 45 minutes apart half the time. Now, imagine a person arrives; this means randomly dropping a point somewhere on the line. What do you expect the distance to be between the person and the next mark? First, think of the relative probability of landing in each gap size of mark, and then deal with each case separately. Does this help? I can finish answering but I thought it's more available to provide some insight so you could finish it on your own.
