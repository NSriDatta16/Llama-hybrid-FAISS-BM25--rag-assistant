Well, some thoughts would be to try some of the following: cr.getFontSize() could be used at the beginning of a paragraph to see if the range changes font size. That in conjunction with bold, italic or underlined would be a good identifier. cr.getFontName() could also be used to determine when and where the font changes in a given range. cr.getColor() would be another possibility to help identify if the user is using different colors for a font. I guess I would iterate over the range and create multiple CharacterRun items each time the text characteristics change. Then evaluate each item based on position in the paragraph as well as all of the afore-mentioned characteristics (size, color, name, bold, italics, etc.). Perhaps create some sort of weighting scale based on the most common values. It might also be of value to create a Title object and store the values for each set of characteristics to help optimize searches in later character runs in the same document.
