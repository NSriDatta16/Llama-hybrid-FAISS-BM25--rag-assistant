What enforces more separation than there should be is each discipline's lexicon. There are many instances where ML uses one term and Statistics uses a different term--but both refer to the same thing--fine, you would expect that, and it doesn't cause any permanent confusion (e.g., features/attributes versus expectation variables, or neural network/MLP versus projection-pursuit). What's much more troublesome is that both disciplines use the same term to refer to completely different concepts. A few examples: Kernel Function In ML, kernel functions are used in classifiers (e.g., SVM) and of course in kernel machines. The term refers to a simple function ( cosine, sigmoidal, rbf, polynomial ) to map non-linearly separable to a new input space, so that the data is now linearly separable in this new input space. (versus using a non-linear model to begin with). In statistics, a kernel function is weighting function used in density estimation to smooth the density curve. Regression In ML, predictive algorithms, or implementations of those algorithms that return class labels "classifiers" are (sometimes) referred to as machines --e.g., support vector machine , kernel machine . The counterpart to machines are regressors , which return a score (continuous variable)--e.g., support vector regression . Rarely do the algorithms have different names based on mode--e.g., a MLP is the term used whether it returns a class label or a continuous variable. In Statistics, regression , if you are attempting to build a model based on empirical data, to predict some response variable based on one or more explanatory variables or more variables--then you are doing regression analysis. It doesn't matter whether the output is a continuous variable or a class label (e.g., logistic regression). So for instance, least-squares regression refers to a model that returns a continuous value; logistic regression on the other hand, returns a probability estimate which is then discretized to a class labels. Bias In ML, the bias term in the algorithm is conceptually identical to the intercept term used by statisticians in regression modeling. In Statistics, bias is non-random error--i.e., some phenomenon influenced the entire data set in the same direction, which in turn means that this kind of error cannot be removed by resampling or increasing the sample size.
