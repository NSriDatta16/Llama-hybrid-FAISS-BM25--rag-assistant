Storing a bunch of 3bits long binary data with PHP

My PHP program is working with an array of values ranging from 0 to 7. I'm trying to find the most effective way to store those values in PHP. By most effective I mean using the less number of bits. It's clear that each value only need 3 bits of storage space (b000=0 to b111=7). But what is the most efficient way to store those 3bits values in a binary string ? I don't know in advance how many 3 bits values I'll need to store or restore, but it might be a lot, so 64bits is clearly not enough. I was looking into pack() and unpack(): I could store two values in each byte and use a pack('C', $twoValues), but I'm still loosing 2 bits. Will it work ? Is there a more effective way of storing those values ? Thanks
