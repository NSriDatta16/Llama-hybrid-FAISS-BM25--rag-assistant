Did you remember to quote your filename? e.g., it should be: include 'report.class.php'; not include report.class.php; In the latter case, the lack of quoting causes PHP to interpret the strings as constants, then fail with an E_NOTICE, and assume that you intended to use string literals. The periods will be interpreted as string concatenation operators, and PHP will end up interpreting your command as equivalent to the following: include 'reportclassphp'; If this is, in fact, what happened, then make sure to turn PHP NOTICE level errors, and pay attention to them. While NOTICE level errors may seem obnoxious, most of the time they may hint at actual logic issues in your code.
