Slightly off-topic, but perhaps interesting to see is this approach: public static class NumbersSequence { public static IEnumerable Naturals { get { int i = 0; while(true) yield return i++; } } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { foreach (int i in NumbersSequence.Naturals.Take(1000)) Console.WriteLine(i); } } C# 3.0 afaik. Pay attention to the seemingly endless loop in the getter, and the call to Take(1000). With this method you now have an 'endless' sequence of natural numbers (endless up until the maxvalue of an int). It won't get stuck, as long as you tell it to take a specific amount. DISCLAIMER: Most of the code borrowed from Earwicker's answer.
