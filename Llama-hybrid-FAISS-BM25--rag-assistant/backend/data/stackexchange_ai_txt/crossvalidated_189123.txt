I don't think there is an existing test for any given number of dimensions. However, you could (brute force) bootstrap the 95% confidence interval of directions of one set of measurements, and then see if the average vector of the other set of measurements is withing that interval or not. This will probably only work if N is several times P - not sure how many times.
