Google-maps? Or something else?

I need something like Google-maps, usable on a commercial project. Can I use GoogleMaps? What if they should change the terms of service? Would I be better with somethin elike Open Street Map? I need full coverage for North America, but also for Europe and Asia. Which might be best? Thanks
