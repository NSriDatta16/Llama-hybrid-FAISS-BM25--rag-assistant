Controls moving from one tab page to another

I am using Visual Studio 2008 and recently a wierd bug has appeared. In my forms I have a tab control with multiple tab pages. I can place a control on a tab page fine, but when I move it by way of clicking it and dragging it to another location, it leaves behind an outline of where it should be. Looking around, it has moved to the first tabe page. I can move controls around by clicking on them, and using the arrow keys, but that slow and tedious, and all the line up features are not used. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any solution to it? And yes, I am on the latest service pack.
