You talk about "order_verification_pending, order_verification_done, order_visited, order_not_visited, all_verified, all_not_verified"... but that seems to double the number of booleans, for example: if you have order_visited then you don't need order_not_visited... it is just " !order_visited ". When there are more than two states involved, use an enum instead of a lot of complicated, overlapping booleans. For example, if verification might be pending, done, failed etc. but these are all mutually exclusive, then store the single current state in that enum . It's more elegant to have a set of pending operations, and remove elements from that set until the set is empty or the whole verification times out. That way, you're not checking operations you already found succeeded.
