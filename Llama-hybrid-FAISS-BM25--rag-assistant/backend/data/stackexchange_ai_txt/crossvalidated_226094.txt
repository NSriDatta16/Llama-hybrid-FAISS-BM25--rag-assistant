The gold standard in time series model selection is to use a holdout sample. Hold out the last few months of data, fit the different models (with different combinations of regressors) to the data before that, forecast into your holdout sample and pick the model with the lowest forecast error - MAE or MSE. That said, I would expect readership numbers of different Wikipedia articles to be correlated, especially if used as a proxy for "has a lot of time on his hands". So you might want to look at dimension reduction techniques, like principal components analysis (PCA) or similar, to reduce your regressors to only the first few principal components. Fewer orthogonal regressors will yield a more stable model and probably better forecasts. (The problem is that interpretability suffers.)
