You will create 1 central repo per project. If I were you, I would think about hosting via Kiln . It wraps very good review tools and a nice web interface around Mercurial with unlimited repositories and storage. They take care of all the nasty bits of hosting and backing up for you. I would also highly recommend Joel's Mercurial tutorial .
