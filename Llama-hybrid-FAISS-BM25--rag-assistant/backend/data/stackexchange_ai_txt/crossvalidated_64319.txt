First, a 14 point Likert scale is quite unusual. I don't think I've ever seen one. Is this the sum of two 7 point questions? Second, given that you are actually interested not in birth month, per se, but in time in school, why not use that? Beware that, by using birth month as a proxy for this, you are assuming that all the children in your study go to schools with the same cut-off. This isn't necessarily the case. In NY city, for instance, public schools have one cutoff and private and parochial schools have another (last I checked, these were Dec. 1 and Aug 1, but my memory might be off). Third With that assumption, birth month is usable as an IV. You could do either ordinal logistic regression or possibly ordinary least squares regression. 14 points is a lot for ordinal but not enough really for OLS. In situations like this, I usually run both models, then I compare the predictions. If they are similar, I use the simpler model (in this case, OLS).
