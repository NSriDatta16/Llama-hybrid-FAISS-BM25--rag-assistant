I actually ran some of my own data to answer my own question. Really I was just being lazy. So for anyone out there who wants to know, yes you can simply multiply the point estimate and lower and upper bounds of the regression coefficients after you have run the analysis. So multiplying the regression coefficient by 4 after analysis results in the same coefficient as creating a new predictor where the values of the original predictor are divided by 4 prior to running the analysis. This also works with the log-odds coefficients from logistic regressions, with an important caveat: make sure you multiply the log-odds coefficients (and upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals of the log-dds coefficients) by the constant before you exponentiate it to odds-ratios, not after.
