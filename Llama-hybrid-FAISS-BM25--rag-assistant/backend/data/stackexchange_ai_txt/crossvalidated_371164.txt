PCA: mean of marginal distribution of high-dimensional vector

Consider the following probabilistic model: $$p(x) = \mathcal{N}(0, I_d), \ x \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ $$p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}(Wx + \mu, \sigma^2I_D), \ y, \mu \in \mathbb{R}^D, W \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times d}$$ Alternatively, one can say that: $$y = Wx + \mu + \epsilon, \ \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2I_D)$$ Marginal distribution p(y) will be again a Gaussian. I saw several times (e.g. in Bishop) as people find mean of the Gaussian: $$\mathbb{E}(y) = \mathbb{E}(Wx + \mu + \epsilon) = \mu$$ They omit PDF which makes the derivation vague. I tried to make it explicitly: $$\mathbb{E}(y) = \int (Wx + \mu + \epsilon) p(y) dy =\mu + \int (Wx+\epsilon) p(y) dy = ?$$ How to proceed?
