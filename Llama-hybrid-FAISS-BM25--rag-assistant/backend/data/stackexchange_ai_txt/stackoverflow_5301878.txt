Cappuccino, Spoutcore or Homegrown solution for web based drawing application?

I'm currently looking at building an application for drawing entity relationships (data models). Looking at both Sproutcore and Cappuccino they both look beefy enough to handle that kind of thing (see 280 slides for cappuccino example)... Ideally I need a framework which lets users drag and drop components and then link them together and then when the user is done to be able to "freeze dry" these objects as JSON ready to be stored in some kind of database so they can be loaded again... Which of the mentioned frameworks are more geared towards that already? Or is the easiest to extend in the places where its lacking? Or would it be easier in the long run to make my own using jQuery/prototype?
