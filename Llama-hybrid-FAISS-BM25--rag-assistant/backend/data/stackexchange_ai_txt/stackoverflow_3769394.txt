I already like Pascal and Andy's answers so not to repeat. A usefull alternative is to start a Kanban Board. Henrik Kniberg also has a good 'book' about it, available here: http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg/2009/04/03/1238795520000.html It allows you to organise your work and be isert some Agile thinking into the company. As Andy said, Scrum is an All-in, if not you will find that 'It doesn't work'.
