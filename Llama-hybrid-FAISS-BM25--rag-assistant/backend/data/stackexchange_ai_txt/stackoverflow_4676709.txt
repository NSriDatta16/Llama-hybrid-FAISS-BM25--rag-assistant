Machine learning revolves around developing self-learning computer algorithms that function by virtue of discovering patterns in data and making intelligent decisions based on such patterns. Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions about data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions rather than following strictly static program instructions. NOTE: If you want to use this tag for a question not directly concerning implementation , then consider posting on Cross Validated , Data Science , Artificial Intelligence , or GenAI (beta) instead; otherwise you're probably off-topic. Please choose one site only and do not cross-post to more than one - see Is cross-posting a question on multiple Stack Exchange sites permitted if the question is on-topic for each site?
