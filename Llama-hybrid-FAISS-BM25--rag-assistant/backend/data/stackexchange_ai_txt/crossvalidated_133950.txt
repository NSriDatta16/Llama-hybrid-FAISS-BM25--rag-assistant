How fair is it to use the word "predict" for (logistic) regression?

My understanding is that even regression does not give causality. It can only give association between y variable and x variables and possibly a direction. Am I correct? I've often found phrases similar to "x predicts y" even in most course textbooks and on various course pages online. And you often call the regressors as predictors and the y as the response. How fair is it to use it for linear regression? How about logistic regression? (if I do have a threshold t with which I can compare the probability?)
