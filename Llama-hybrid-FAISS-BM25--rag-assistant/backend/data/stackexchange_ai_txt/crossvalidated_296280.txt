The short answer is "No". Basically you need to remember that p-values are random variables themselves and more importantly remember that the "difference between significant and non-significant is often not significant" . Basically it is not hard to find a case where effect A is not significantly different from 0, but effect B is significantly different from 0 (at some specified significance level), but A and B are not significantly different from each other. The same will be true of correlations like you are asking about. A better approach may be to jointly model all 3 variables together, probably using a Bayesian model, then look at how the joint distribution of the correlations of interest looks.
