Winform usercontrol in WebForm

I want to display a "folderview" which I can drag and drop files into but via WebForm. I am doing this via a webbrowser control pointing at local drive. The code works in a win form user control but what I want is to embed this control in web form. This is an intranet so security etc is less of an issue. However when I add things like AllowDrop or the webbrowser control to my control it stops working - I get the image placeholder which I take to mean an error. Can anyone give me an idea what is wrong or perhaps suggest a different solution.
