Tuning svm and cart hyperparameters

I am trying to optimize the hyperparameters of SVM and CART with tune() function of e1071 R package, but I have a doubt. Should I tune the parameters on the training data, fit the model on the training data and then test it on the test data, or may I avoid the second step?
