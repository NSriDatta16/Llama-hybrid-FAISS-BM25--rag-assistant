namespaces are a way to provide a logical organization to your code. They provide a way to reuse names by applying it within a certain context. There is nothing wrong with having classes in two namespaces depend on each other. Cyclic depedancies in assemblies is a bit more complex. Last I checked visual studio wouldn't allow this type of relationship directly.
