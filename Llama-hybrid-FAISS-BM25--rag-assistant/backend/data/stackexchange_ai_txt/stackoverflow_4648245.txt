Do we need to test all of them? No. To start with it would be worth following the bugs. Every new bug should end with at least one unit test demonstrating it. Ideally however you would want to retrofit a reasonable automated test suite. Crap4J and Clover can give you an idea on where to start. Clover has its Project Risks and Quick Wins clouds (basically views on cyclomatic complexity and test coverage) which will give some guidance on what should be testing and what will help keep the moral up.
