Your parameter search sweeps over a large area. So probably it is your features' fault. Open your data with a Tool like "Weka Explorer", when loading it make sure to use the apropriate "...ToNominal"-attribute-filter. Then examine your features in the "Select attribute"-tab. There you can get an impression how correlated your features are with the target variable. For some insights, take a look at Hall, "Correlation-based Feature Selection for Machine Learning", 1999, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.37.4643
