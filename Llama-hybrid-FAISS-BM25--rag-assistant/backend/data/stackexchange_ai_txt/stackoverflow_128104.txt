How do you find Leapyear in VBA?

What is a good implementation of a IsLeapYear function in VBA? Edit: I ran the if-then and the DateSerial implementation with iterations wrapped in a timer, and the DateSerial was quicker on the average by 1-2 ms (5 runs of 300 iterations, with 1 average cell worksheet formula also working).
