Customize a TextBlock in WPF

I need to "decorate" a textBlock with a custom background (say, when IsSelected) Actually I have two separate elements textBlock and its background rectangle: Now, when I want to Hide the textBlock I need to hide the rectangle too, etc. I think there is should be a more elegant way to do it. Any remarks appreciated. EDIT Border approach
