RBM was one of the first practical ways of training/learning a deep network, having more than just one or two layers. And the deep belief network was proposed by Geoffrey Hinton, who's considered one of the 'father's of deep learning, I suppose, although Yann LeCun is the other main 'father' of deep learning, I think, or thats how I see it. Of course, everything was already invented years ago by Jurgen Schmidhuber :-) So, RBMs are famous because 1. one of the first ways of doing deep learning 2. Geoffrey Hinton. However, in practice, they are surely used, and useable, in academic research, since there are lots of people trying to find some unique niche, that they can be expert in, and being the worldwide expert in some niche of RBMs is a good niche as any other. However, in practice, in industry, whilst I wont claim they're never used, but they come up extremely rarely. There are simply so many very standard techniques, that train really fast and easily, like logistic regression, and feed-forward convolutional neural networks. For unsupervised, things like GANs are really popular at the moment.
