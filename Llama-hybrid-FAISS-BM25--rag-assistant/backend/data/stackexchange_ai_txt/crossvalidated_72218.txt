I don't know if the models you described above can find this relationship. For regression purposes when you want to learn the regression function maybe you can do this with Bayesian machine learning using Gaussian Processes. These can be used for regression - classification now matter what form has the true regression function. You can check the monograph of C. E Rasmussen and C. K. I Williams which is available for free online
