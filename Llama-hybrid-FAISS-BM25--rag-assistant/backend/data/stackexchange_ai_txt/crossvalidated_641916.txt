Principal components analysis missing data SPSS

I have a large data set (27k) There are 63 variables of interest. I attempted PCA as a dimensionality reduction strategy. The items are scored on different metrics ranging from dichotomous variables to variables with 7 response selections. There is also a lot missing data. When I try to run PCA (in SPSS) I get an error message. I have tried standardizing the scores and listwise and pairwise deletion of missing cases but still get the error message. What am I doing wrong? Please advise. Thank you
