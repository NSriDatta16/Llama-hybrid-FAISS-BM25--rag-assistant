paperclip doesn't create thumbnails on heroku

I've been trying to get paperclip to upload images to amazon s3, but all I get is the original file being uploaded. No thumbnails are generated. My model has this in it: has_attached_file :screenshot, :styles => { :thumb => "100x80>", :medium => "195x150>", :large => "390x300>" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => ":attachment/:id/:style.:extension" The original file is in fact uploaded, but none of thumbnails appear. If I copy the src of a thumb format image, for instance, I get NoSuchKey The specified key does not exist. screenshots/8/thumb.png B8A408560070E836 âˆ’ HAHUCuNxGKVDvqE3GnhGT1RcBgFGUxa35kqXmyRE+ii60DJS6r22ChDr22cOeCea This is running on heroku, which forces me to use a service like amazon. Not a problem but all the documentation I can find makes this look straightforward. I can't find any dependencies (bundler is happy), and I've been using AWS for 2 years now, without these problems, on another site, with a different bucket on the same account. Is it a problem of connecting the bucket to the account? I'm using the same credentials as in the other site. Only the bucket changes. A couple more things. The directories that are being created in the path of the image that is being uploaded are permissions 000 or whatever the aws equivalent is. Nobody is permitted to do anything. using Rails 3.
