Why is there a compile error when including OpenSSL static library?

I have some problems using OpenSSL. I'm following the tutorial for compiling OpenSSL for iOS , but it is still not working. Here is my problem: Change directories into crypto/ui/ui_openssl.c . Build OpenSSL for i368 iPhone simulator. Copy the include , libcrypto.a and libssl.a to the project folder. Drag libcrypto.a and libssl.a to project tree. Change the build info. It worked with openssl-1.0.0c . Then as I was coding #include and building, I got the error "no such file or directory." Help! Thanks a lot!
