A bit vague answer, but I'll give it a chance. I always felt that the size constraint is the central idea behind this method -- without is seems just to converge to other approaches, effectively to 2-means and ideologically to unsupervised SVM. The previous rather invalidates this idea, the latter way is more intriguing while you may hope to save some pain using SVM optimization framework and kernel tricks.
