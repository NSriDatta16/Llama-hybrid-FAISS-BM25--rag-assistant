What do you call an anomaly/signature detection algorithm in data science

If I have an algorithm for detecting a set of data points that indicate with a high level of certainty that some event has occured OR that behaviors outside of a set model are occuring. What would you call the algorithm used to detect these anomalies? And Would calling it an "analytic" be incorrect?
