What to do in Box-Jenkins framework when time series has deterministic trend and seasonality?

I'm self-studying time series and I'm puzzled by apparent lack of consistency between : the "classical" decomposition of time-series and the Box-Jenkins methodology. Concerning the classical decomposition, you will find that a time-series can be decomposed into many components, including a : deterministic trend stochastic trend (that is, a unit root) seasonal component some other forms of periodicity that are not seasonal (like Kitchin and Juglar economic cycles) a residual or a stationary component When it comes to Box-Jenkins however, it seems that only four combinations of the latter components are considered : the series is stationary the series is Trend Stationary (TS) (Deterministic Trend) and you should de-trend to stationarize the series is Difference Stationary (DS) (stochastic trend = unit root) and you should differentiate the series at order of integration ( ARIMA case ) the series is DS but also exposes some seasonality , so you must difference the series two times : first to filter out the seasonality, and secondly to filter out the unit root ( SARIMA case ) However, it seems that Box-Jenkins makes no particular case for a time series that has both : a deterministic trend (as for Trend Stationary series) and a seasonal component So is the Box-Jenkins framework "incomplete" and does not take into account this specific case ? Or does it mean that seasonal components are just seen as a particular type of deterministic trend ?
