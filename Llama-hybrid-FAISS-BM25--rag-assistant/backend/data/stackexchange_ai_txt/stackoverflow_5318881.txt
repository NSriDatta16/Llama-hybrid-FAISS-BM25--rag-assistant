Saving js variables for Lat/Lng in a google map

I have a map with a marker which can be dragged. Once the user drags the marker, I get new coordinates. I try to make an AJAX call and put them into the session, but for some reason that does not seem to be working. The test page is here: http://www.comehike.com/outdoors/parks/add_trailhead.php And the ajax I have looks like this: $lat = $_GET['lat']; $lng = $_GET['lng']; $_SESSION['trailhead_lat'] = $lat; $_SESSION['trailhead_lng'] = $lng; My question is really, how do I save the lat/lng from the dragged marker location so that I can save to as the coordinates when the form is submitted? Thanks, Alex
