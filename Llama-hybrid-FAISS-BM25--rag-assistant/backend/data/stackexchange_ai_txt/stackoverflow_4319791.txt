Did you try the solution from the blast2go start page ? "Blast2GO needs more memory? Use the dynamic memory JNLP URL:" http://bioinfo.cipf.es/blast2go/webstart/makeJnlp.php?mem= It is not clear what is going on here, but I think it is likely that blast2go is doing some manual memory management tricks. (The fact that it claims to report how much memory is used is indicative of this.) If that is the case, then there may be application specific arguments or properties that need to be set if you tweak the JNLP file.
