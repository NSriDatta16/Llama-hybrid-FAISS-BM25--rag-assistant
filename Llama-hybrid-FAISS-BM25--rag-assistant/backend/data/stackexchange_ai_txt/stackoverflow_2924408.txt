iPhone stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth only makes "D"s

UIImage *aImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"Gray_Button.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:25 topCapHeight:0]; Trying to make a "glass pill button". What does "stretch" do if the image is bigger... and the button I'm trying to use it on... is smaller? Does the image 'stretch' and 'shrink'? The reason I ask... is because all my images end up look like a "D" shape. The left side is squared-off... and the right side is rounded. What would a D-shape tell you that I'm doing wrong? Too much.. or too little... "leftCap setting"? Too large an image?
