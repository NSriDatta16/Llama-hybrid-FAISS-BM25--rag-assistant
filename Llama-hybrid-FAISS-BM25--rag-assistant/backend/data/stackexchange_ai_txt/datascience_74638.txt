Online Audio annotation tools

I need to find a decent online annotation tool to transcribe audio. There are some requirements for a potential tool: I should be able to deliver audio files to a few labelers. I should be able to track which files went to which labeler. It should be safe in terms of data storage. Any suggestions?
