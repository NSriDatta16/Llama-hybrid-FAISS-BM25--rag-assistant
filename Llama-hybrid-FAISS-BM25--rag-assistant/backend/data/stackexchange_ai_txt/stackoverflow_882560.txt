Globalisation in ASP.NET should do everything for you pretty much. See this MSDN article , entitled How to: Set the Culture and UI Culture for ASP.NET Web Page Globalization . This should be exactly what you want, as you simply need to set the current (UI) culture for the current thread when the user logs in. You can then call date.ToString() and it will return the text representation in the correct format. Equivalently, you could do something like this: var culture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-GB"); var dateString = date.ToString(culture.DateTimeFormat); But it's really just doing the same thing manually, and is far less elegant. You might as well make use of the ASP.NET globalisation framework here.
