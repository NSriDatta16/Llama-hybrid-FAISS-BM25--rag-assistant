Pay attention to one aspect when doing "purchase_date>(sysdate-30)": "sysdate" is the current date, hour, minute and second. So "sysdate-30" is not exactly "30 days ago", but "30 days ago at this exact hour". If your purchase dates have 00.00.00 in hours, minutes, seconds, better doing: where trunc(purchase_date)>trunc(sysdate-30) (this doesn't take hours, minutes and seconds into account).
