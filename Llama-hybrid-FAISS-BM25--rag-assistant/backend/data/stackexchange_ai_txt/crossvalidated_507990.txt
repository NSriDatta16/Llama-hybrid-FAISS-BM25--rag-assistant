Right, but the number of epochs is your choice. You can decrease it a bit if you want LOOCV. Since you're going to train the model from scratch for each training fold, it'll be $e\times n$ looping over, where $e$ is your epoch number. Yes, you'll have n different set of parameters. Averaging is not good, even if the problem is convex like this one. For testing, you need to retrain using your training set.
