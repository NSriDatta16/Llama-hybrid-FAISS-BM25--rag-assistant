In Xcode4 you basically create a build and sign it afterwards, while in Xcode3 you had to select this upfront. Archive your app (Product > Archive) and in the Organizer select the Archives tab. Here you can select an archived app and when you share it, you can select a provisioning profile (for instance your ad hoc provisioning profile) to sign it with.
