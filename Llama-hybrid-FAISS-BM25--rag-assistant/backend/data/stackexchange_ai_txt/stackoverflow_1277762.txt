MySQL: Searching a single table multiple times?

I have a table that's holding metadata for entrys from another table. The metadata-table looks like this (I removed relating Ids so it's more obvious): id entry_id property value 1 12 color blue 2 12 shape circle 3 13 color red 4 13 shape circle 5 14 color blue 6 14 shape square 7 15 material stone 8 12 material plastic Now I want to search this table for the properties, like choosing all entries where color is blue : select entry_id from table where property = 'color' and value = 'blue' So far, so good. But how do I expand the query when I have multiple conditions? For example I want to search for all entries where color is blue and shape is circle . Right now I'd achieve this with unions: select entry_id from table where property = 'color' and value = 'blue' union select entry_id from table where property = 'shape' and value = 'circle' this obviously gets ugly the more properties I want to look for. And I think it's not very fast, too. Is there are more elegant way to do this? The reason for this table is, that I have objects with metadata which can be set by the user. Thank you!
