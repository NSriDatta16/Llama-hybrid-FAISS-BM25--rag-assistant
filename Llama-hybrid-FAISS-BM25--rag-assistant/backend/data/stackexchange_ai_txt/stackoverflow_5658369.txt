How to input a regex in string.replace?

I need some help on declaring a regex. My inputs are like the following: this is a paragraph with in between and then there are cases ... where the number ranges from 1-100 . and there are many other lines in the txt files with such tags The required output is: this is a paragraph with in between and then there are cases ... where the number ranges from 1-100. and there are many other lines in the txt files with such tags I've tried this: #!/usr/bin/python import os, sys, re, glob for infile in glob.glob(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '*.txt')): for line in reader: line2 = line.replace(' ', '') line = line2.replace(' ', '') line2 = line.replace(' ', '') line = line2.replace(' ', '') print line I've also tried this (but it seems like I'm using the wrong regex syntax): line2 = line.replace(' ', '') line = line2.replace(' ', '') line2 = line.replace(' ', '') line = line2.replace(' ', '') I dont want to hard-code the replace from 1 to 99.
