My best guess is that Delphi seems to be producing too many Geocode elements - there doesn't appear to be any thing that corresponds to NS2:Geocode in the C# produced XML. If you can intercept the XML and change it so that it looks like this, who knows - it might work: ... ... The other problem could be that the Bing service doesn't support the way Delphi organizes the SOAP request. It that doesn't work, perhaps you can find another SOAP library you can use with Delphi - perhaps resorting to wrapping a library with a C or COM interface.
