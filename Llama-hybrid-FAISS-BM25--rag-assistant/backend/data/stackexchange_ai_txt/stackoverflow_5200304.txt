In addition to what David stated (deploy through the "deploy" folder) you'll have to select your theme for the community, organization or just one page by selecting Manage/Page/Look&Feel when it's deployed to tomcat. Somehow I had the impression that you expect it to show up immediately. If you want to deploy directly to tomcat you'll have to build your theme in the plugins-sdk with "ant direct-deploy" - this creates a tomcat-deployable theme.
