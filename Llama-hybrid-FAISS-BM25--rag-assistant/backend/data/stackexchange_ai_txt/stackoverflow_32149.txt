Does anyone have a good Proper Case algorithm

Does anyone have a trusted Proper Case or PCase algorithm (similar to a UCase or Upper)? I'm looking for something that takes a value such as "GEORGE BURDELL" or "george burdell" and turns it into "George Burdell" . I have a simple one that handles the simple cases. The ideal would be to have something that can handle things such as "O'REILLY" and turn it into "O'Reilly" , but I know that is tougher. I am mainly focused on the English language if that simplifies things. UPDATE: I'm using C# as the language, but I can convert from almost anything (assuming like functionality exists). I agree that the McDonald's scneario is a tough one. I meant to mention that along with my O'Reilly example, but did not in the original post.
