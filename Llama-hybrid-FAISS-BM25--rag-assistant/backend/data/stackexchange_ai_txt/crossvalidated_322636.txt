Logistic regression check linearity assumption in R

How to check the assumption of "linearity of independent variables and log odds" for a logistic regression model in R What is the best way to check for the assumption: linearity of independent variables and log odds? Which log odds to use? Log odds of the model including all independent variables OR use the log odds of the model that includes only the independent variable you want to check (i.e. separate models for each independent variable)? How to determine which polynomial needs to be added to fulfill the linearity assumption? I created a simple dataset as an example of my real dataset (not possible to include). Note, that the distribution of age in this example is different from my real dataset (Don't know how to make the age distribution more realistic). set.seed(1234) library(ggplot2) n Fit the full model and check the assumption with a plot. Is this the right way? fit Fit a model with only age as a predictor. Is this the right way? fit Are there other (better) ways to check the linearity assumption in a logistic regression model?
