Ordinal Logical Regression in R using polr interpretation

I'm using the polr package to do a ordinal logistic regression on my data. We did a survey for university students asking them a bunch of questions. To analyse the results i want to do an ordinal logistic regression for the satisfaction with their living situation. This is an overview of my variables: Dependent variable: Satisfaction with their living situation (Ordinal). Levels: (Very) satisfied; neither, (Very) dissatisfied Independent Variables: Type of Hosuing (Nominal). Levels: Shared flat, with parents, alone, with partner and/or children, student hall of residence, other Rent (numeric) Commuting time (numeric) The summery of the regression is as follows: polr(formula = Satisfaction_category ~ Housing_ + Rent + Commuting_Time, data = wohnen_english, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value Housing_Shared Flat -0.4576984 0.1476243 -3.1004 Housing_With parents -0.0695956 0.2031696 -0.3425 Housing_Alone -0.6447934 0.2300704 -2.8026 Housing_With parner and/or children -0.6181128 0.2085561 -2.9638 Housing_Student hall of residence 0.2524551 0.5477611 0.4609 Housing_Other -0.4506929 0.3711785 -1.2142 Rent -0.0003418 0.0002263 -1.5101 Commuting_Time -0.0024082 0.0026482 -0.9094 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value (Very) dissatisfied|(Very) satisfied -2.4992 0.1921 -13.0083 (Very) satisfied|Neither 1.7141 0.1989 8.6171 Residual Deviance: 1751.174 AIC: 1771.174 (49 observations deleted due to missingness) EDIT 1: This is the updated output the following has been changed: Independent Variable Satisfaction is now an ordered factor with (Very) dissatisfied The Predictor variable "Housing" is now a factor wohnen_english$Housing_ --> This changed the number of levels of the Housing predictor in the regression model. "Shared flat" has disappeared. polr(formula = Satisfaction_category ~ Housing_ + Rent + Commuting_Time, data = Wohnen_english_clean, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value Housing_With parents -0.8871301 0.2148701 -4.1287 Housing_Alone -0.3660180 0.2595436 -1.4102 Housing_With parner and/or children -0.0409912 0.2446531 -0.1675 Housing_Student hall of residence 0.8844630 0.0126353 69.9992 Housing_Other -0.1635978 0.4694203 -0.3485 Rent -0.0002885 0.0002354 -1.2254 Commuting_Time -0.0064948 0.0023769 -2.7325 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value (Very) dissatisfied|Neither -2.6118 0.2031 -12.8612 Neither|(Very) satisfied -1.9759 0.1954 -10.1126 Residual Deviance: 1721.161 AIC: 1739.161 (50 observations deleted due to missingness) I calculated the p value and combined them with the results and got the following table: EDIT 2: Updated the table to the new regression model EDIT 3: Ignore the old questions, new questions have arised: New Questions: I can see which predictors are significant. but I'm not sure why the "Shared flat" level of the "Housing" variable has disappeared from the regression model. Do the predictor variables have to be specified somehow? (Have a certain type or scale that R needs to know about?) The outcome of the regression model heavily changes if "Housing" is not defined as a factor. Then the "Shared flat" level is part of the regression model, so I'm not sure which model is the correct one. Old Questions that can be ignored for the moment below To my question: I'm having trouble interpreting the results. I'm fairly sure that I used the correct statistical method, since me DV is ordinally scaled. But i don't really know what they mean. the p values indicate that only the Types of Housing "shared flat"; "with partner and/or children"and "alone" are significant. (alone almost with p = 0.0507). How should the significant coefficients be interpreted? Are students in shared flats (coef = -0.46) more or less satisfied with their living situation? and how much more? same for Students living with partner (coef = - 0.62) and Students living alone (coef = - 0.64) Can the following be definetaly stated: The satisfaction with the student's living situation is NOT significantly influenced by rent (v_25_1), commuting time (v_26_1) and the other Types of Housing? Furthermore: If i do an ordinal logical regression for Satisfaction ~ rent the p value is highly significant. I don't quite understand why the relationship between Satisfaction and the independent values changes based on the number of IVs in the regression? It's imported that i correctly interpret these findings, and i don't want to claim something that is not true. Any advice how to interpret it?
