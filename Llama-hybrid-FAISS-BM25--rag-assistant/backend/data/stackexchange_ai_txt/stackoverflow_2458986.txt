The obvious disadvantage is that the list might disappear unpredictably. As the session is garbage collected after it expires anyway, I don't really see a use case for SoftReference. If the list gets considerably big (at least considerably enough to justify using a SoftReference) I'd rather suggest different storage (DB, temporary files).
