Wow...not even any views on this question all day. Well, I figured it out and thought I'd share the wealth. I can't share the code directly, but it's just three nested loops, one looping through the paragraphs, then the paragraph runs, then the styles. The XPath for each of those is: .//w:p ./w:pPr ./w:pStyle Once you find a run with the style you like, you pop back up a level to get the first run, which will contain the styled text. From there on, it's just Comp Sci 101 stuff. I think the real breakthrough was to not even try to mess with the Open Xml SDK (aside from the IO Packaging stuff), and go straight to XML manipulation.
