Comparing the performance of a fuzzy model and a probabilistic classifier

For a binary classification task, I have (1) a fuzzy model (Mamdani) that outputs a number between 0 and 20 (after defuzzification) and (2) a logistic regression that outputs a number between 0 and 1. Even though both systems are based on very different theoretical basis (possibility theory vs probability theory), I was wondering if it is possible to compare their performance with something like ROC AUC. The final user will use the outputs of both models to assess the risk that a certain event presents. As such, both systems can have a threshold of acceptable risk and this means, AFAIK, that they can be compared in terms of ROC AUC. EDIT: The question is: how can I compare the performance of a fuzzy model and a probabilistic classifier, assuming that both have a continuous output? My first bet was to use ROC AUC because I'm interested into the ranking ability of each model. Also, I'm asking this because this kind of comparison is very unusual, AFAIK.
