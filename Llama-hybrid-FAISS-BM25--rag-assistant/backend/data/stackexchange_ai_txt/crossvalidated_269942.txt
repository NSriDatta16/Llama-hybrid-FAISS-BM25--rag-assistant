I am working on a movie pizza data set movie data set example(single row) Date Day Elite Seats Premium Seats NOM7 UM Pizzac 11/12/2012 "Tuesday" 230 300 2 4 5 NOM7 Now I would like to build a regression model but I am unable to know which independent variables are affecting pizza count Since I am new to stats and machine learning I am sub-setting all data and just using elite and premium seat count in some machine learning models, I saw formula where more than one independent variables exists Can I know what is the process which I must follow to know which factors are affecting my regression model
