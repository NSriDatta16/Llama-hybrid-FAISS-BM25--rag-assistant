DataTables is now supporting ColVis, which allows you to show/hide columns as well as fixed header/fixed columns. It's not the scrolling you're looking for necessarily, but may be a more elegant solution to your problem. With the amount of data you'd dealing with, you could also take advantage of the sorting, filtering, and paging to make it a little easier for the end-user to consume.
