I did it in both J2ME and Symbian (S60). For a Symbian example check this example (you might need to register to forum Nokia), in order to use the front camera simply initialize using camera index 1 (index 0 is the back camera): m_pCamera = CCamera::NewL(*this, 1) Although make sure that the device does have a front camera using CCamera::CamerasAvailable() (if it has a front camera and a back camera then that call will return 2). For J2ME check out this example from the SDN, instead of initializing the default camera (the back camera) like this: mPlayer = Manager.createPlayer("capture://video"); You simply need to initialize the front camera: mPlayer = Manager.createPlayer("capture://devcam1"); Enjoy!
