nvarchar(max) is definitely your best bet - as i'm sure you know it will only allocate the space required for the data you are actually storing per row, not the actual max of the datatype per row. The only con i would see would be if you are constantly updating a row and it is switching from less than 8000 bytes to > 8000 bytes often in which case SQL will change the storage to a LOB and store a pointer to the data whenever you go over 8000 bytes. Changing back and forth would be expensive in this case, but you don't really have any other options in this case that I can see - so it's kind of a moot point.
