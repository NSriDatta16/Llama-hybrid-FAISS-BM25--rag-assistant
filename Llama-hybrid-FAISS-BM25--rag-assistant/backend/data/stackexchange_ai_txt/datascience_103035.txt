There are 2 things you can do here: 1.) Use libraries like Dask to speed up your data preprocessing. Here is the link 2.) Use cloud computing services like Azure, AWS or GCP. I am not aware of other two but I have worked on Azure and it provides a lot of options for implementing a data science solution. You get options like Auto-ML, Azure Designer, Python ML SDK etc. So it depends on you. If your limitation is your compute setup, using Dask will be of little help and you should go for cloud services. But if that is not the case, go for Dask.
