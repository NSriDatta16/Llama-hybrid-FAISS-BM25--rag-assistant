How to show that $var(\hat{\mu}) < var(\bar{X}) $for a stationary process ${X_t}$, where $X_t = \mu + Z_t + Z_{t-1} $?

If ${X_t}$ is a stationary time series with mean $\mu$ then the usual estimator for $\mu$ is the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{X_1+...+X_n}{n}$ . Assume we have $X_t = \mu + Z_t + Z_{t-1}$ , where ${Z_t}$ is a white noise $WN(0,\sigma^2)$ . Can we find an unbiased estimator for $\mu$ of the form $\hat{\mu} = a_1X_1+...+a_nX_n$ such that $Var(\hat{\mu}) ?
