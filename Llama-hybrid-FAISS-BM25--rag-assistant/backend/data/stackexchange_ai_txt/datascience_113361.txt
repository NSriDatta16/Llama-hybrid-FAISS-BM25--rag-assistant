Training with code scripts to achieve a specified goal?

I am quite new to machine learning and therefore need to ask if some ideas might be possible. Imagine an application that is managing the state of an Actor by scripts. The timed iteration in the following is called a tick . The application is using a script that defines what should happen to an actor every tick. example script: logic body_system { actors::state(hydration).minus(5); actors[state.hydration So every tick the body_system and the drink logic is called. The first one will decrease the hydration state while the drink logic wants to prevent death by increasing the hydration state. However as you might have seen the drink logic is only increasing by 2 while body_system is decreasing hydration by 5. In the long term the Actor will die with these scripts. The state of the actor is checked after every tick . If state.health the Actor is considered dead. Now since I have an input of data (the scripts) and a way to check the true and false required state (the death of an Actor ) is it possible to create a training model by this? I know I need a large set of different scripts with different outcomes. But given that - is it possible to train a machine towards the goal to generate a very good script that might keep the Actor alive for a long time? I just want to figure out if I understand the concepts or better said the requirements to training data in the context of machine learning.
