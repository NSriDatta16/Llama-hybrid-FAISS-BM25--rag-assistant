Reading books about Bayesian Model selection

I was trying to find some "good" reading books about Bayesian Model selection. So is there any recommendations? To be specific, I was trying to understand the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) implementation in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes. And why the current understanding of both of the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) and WAIC is not very satisfactory. I was trying to find some books, but the books I found are not that complete. And for some papers which mentioned these topics, they are too specific on some other directions and too little about these topics. Any recommendations or comments will deeply appreciate!
