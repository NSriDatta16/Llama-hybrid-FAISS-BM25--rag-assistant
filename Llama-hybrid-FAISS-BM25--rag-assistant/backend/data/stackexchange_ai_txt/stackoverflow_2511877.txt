After finding this answer I came up with what I think is a better (at least more elegant) way of doing this, thought I'd come back and share it here. Page_Load: DropDownList1.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Response)); DropDownList1.DataBind(); LoadValues: Response rIn = Response.Maybe; DropDownList1.Text = rIn.ToString(); SaveValues: Response rOut = (Response) Enum.Parse(typeof(Response), DropDownList1.Text);
