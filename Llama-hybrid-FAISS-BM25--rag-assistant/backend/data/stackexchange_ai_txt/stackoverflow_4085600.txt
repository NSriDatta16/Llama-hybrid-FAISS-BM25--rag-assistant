Liquibase - Rolling back a set of changesets

We do database releases which are made up of a group of change sets and our database change logs are organised in the following way MasterChangeLog.xml ---> Release0001.XML ---> AddCustomerTable.XML ---> AddOrderTable.XML ---> Release0002.XML ---> AddNewColumnsToCustomerTable.XML ---> AlterOrderTableXML ---> Release0003.XML ---> AddPreferedCustomerTable.XML I would like to know how I would go about rolling back a set of change sets. I was hoping that I could use tagDatabase with the release number (Release001, Release002 or Release003) and just roll back using the tag I would expect to be able to do something like this if I wanted to rollback all change to Release001 java -jar "liquibase.jar" --changeLogFile="MasterChangeLog.xml" Rollback "Release0002" Could you please tell me how I would go about getting this to work with Liquibase? Thanks
