Solved this, in Flash CS4. Must be a Flash bug! Did a couple of things and it sorted it, not sure which did the trick. Saved a new version of my file Made the text field 'use device fonts' instead of the 'anti-alias for readability' with embedding. Published the file, the bullets displayed fine. Changed the anti-alias back to anti-alias for readability, flash then busted a prompt saying 'you need to embed these fonts' (just like they were before...) - so I re-embedded them through the field (and they were already exported for actionscript in the library) Whatever it was, seems to have fixed it.
