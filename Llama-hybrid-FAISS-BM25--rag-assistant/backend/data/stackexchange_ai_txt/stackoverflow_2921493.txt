The pattern name_ matches the string "x" which results in Apply[Symbol,"x"] which returns an object with head String . This is then passed to Pattern which returns what you see. To get what you expect you have to pass a Symbol to Pattern . Examine the various outputs you get with FullForm[] . You can probably do this by changing the fragment: Pattern[Apply[Symbol,name],_]] to Pattern[Evaluate[ToExpression[name],_]] but this will only work if ToExpression[name] returns a Symbol . I found that I had to force evaluation.
