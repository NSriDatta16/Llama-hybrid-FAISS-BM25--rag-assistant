The line in the example reads: currentID = Convert.ToInt32(GridView1.DataKeys[r.RowIndex].Value); This line assumes that you are setting datakeys on your grid, pay special attention to the DataKeyNames attribute in the example: DataKeyNames="EmployeeID" This example is a little easier to follow. If you would like help debugging the other example please post the error your getting as well.
