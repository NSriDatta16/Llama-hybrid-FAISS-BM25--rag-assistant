For the reason you mentioned, it is unwise to set the time to 0. It is also unwise to set the time to infinity, because the neural network will not be able to cope with such an input. Instead, for each timestamp input, you should also incorporate corresponding a one-hot boolean vector to indicate whether a particle passed through the sensor or not. If not, then it is ok to leave the timestamp as 0. Feed both the timestamps and the indicator vectors into the network.
