What is the maximum number of weekdays in a year? How would you code it?

In order to allocate enough space for an array element for each weekday of a year, I'm trying to work out the maximum number of rows I would need. That lead me onto the question of how I would work it out. Would you have to calculate the number of days in every year for the next n years and go with that? Or is there (as I suspect) a more elegant solution involving the numbers 365, 366, 2 and 7? Which libraries would help?
