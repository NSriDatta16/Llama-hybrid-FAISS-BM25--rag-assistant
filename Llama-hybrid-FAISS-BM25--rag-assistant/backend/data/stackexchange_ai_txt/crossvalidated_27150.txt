At the top level, Kolmogorov identified independence as a key assumption in statistics - without i.i.d assumption, many important results in statistics aren't true, whether applied to time series or more general analysis tasks. Successive or nearby samples in most real-world discrete-time signals are not independent, so care must be taken to decompose a process into a deterministic model and a stochastic noise component. Even so, the independent increment assumption in classical stochastic calculus is problematic: recall the 1997 econ Nobel, and the 1998 implosion of LTCM which counted the laureates among its principals (though to be fair, the fund's manager Merrywhether likely is more to blame than quant methods).
