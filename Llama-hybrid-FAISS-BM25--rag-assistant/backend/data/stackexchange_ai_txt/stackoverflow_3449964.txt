SHould I Use a Wordpress 3.0 Custom Post Type?

I am coding a wordpress theme for a magazine. One aspect of the site, is that the homepage is static, and it features the current issue of the magazine in one area of the homepage. I need help figuring out the most practical way of replacing content for the most recent issue on the homepage. Basically, every month, an image, as well as a title and a short paragraph of text will change on the homepage. My homepage is a static page (from a template). I would like the client to be able to change the picture/text from the back end of wordpress. That said, is the best way to go about this is to write a custom post type? This is unrelated to the blog (posts section). There is probably a very simple way of going about this. Any ideas?
