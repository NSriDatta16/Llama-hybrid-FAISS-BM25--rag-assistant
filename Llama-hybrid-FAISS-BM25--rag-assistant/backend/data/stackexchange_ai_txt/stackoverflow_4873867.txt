What's the best way to override a user agent CSS stylesheet rule that gives unordered-lists a 1em margin?

I'm working on a web app that has a topBar similar to facebook's blue bar at the top. I have an unordered list within the div of that bar to list some items, like Inbox, Notifications, etc. The UL has a 1em margin as defined by the user agent stylesheet of my browser. This is a problem because it's pushing my topBar down 1em. How can I override this to make the border of the ul = 0? I've read that overriding user agent stylesheets is a bad idea so I'm curious to learn what is best to do. Thanks. Here's the CSS file: body { margin:0px; padding:0px; } #topBar{ background-color:#CCCCCC; height: 50px; width:100%; z-index:-1; } #mainNav{ margin:0 auto; width:900px; } #logo{ float:left; } #mainNav ul li{ float:left; border:0px; margin:0; padding:0; font-size:10px } And the html: ff Inbox
