R built-in Breusch-Pagan Test getting different results from manual Calculation

I was using the following code to calculate the bp-test (eaef.csv can be found here ). student.dat the output is: data: student.lm2 BP = 20.338, df = 18, p-value = 0.3141 However, if I construct the test manually: #direct construction of bptest aux.lm I got different p-value 0.3745022 . The way I construct the manual test is by following the definitions in this slide (page 38). Any idea why is there a difference?
