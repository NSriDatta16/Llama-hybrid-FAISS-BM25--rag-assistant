R array manipulation

In python lists can be sliced like this x[4:-1] to get from the fourth to the last element. In R something similar can be accomplished for vectors with x[4:length(x)] and for multidimensional arrays with something like x[,,,,4:dim(x)[5],,,] . Is this more elegant syntax for array slicing for a particular dimension from an element in the middle to the last element? Thanks
