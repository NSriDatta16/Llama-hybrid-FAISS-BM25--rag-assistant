There is no problem with setting the maximum depth of a Random Forest (or more specifically, of any tree) higher than the number of features. For instance, you could have two features, Age and Sex . Then you could have a series of splits that first check whether Age>18 , if so check whether Sex=M , if so check whether Age>40 . The end result would be four leaves/bins, one for Age , one for Age>18 & Sex=F , one for 18 and one for Age>40 & Sex=M .
