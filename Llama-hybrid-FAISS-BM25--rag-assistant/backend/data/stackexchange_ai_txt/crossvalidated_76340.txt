ORCLUS is really really limited in usefulness. I have yet to see someone report good results in practise. In essence, it is Proclus reiterated with PCA, if I recall correctly. And proclus also had similar issues in all of my experiments! If you want to try out some more advanced methods, have a look at ELKI which includes a number of subspace and correlation clustering algorithms. Including ORCLUS, so maybe this implementation works better for you?
