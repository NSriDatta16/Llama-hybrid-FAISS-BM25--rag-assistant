C++: How to iterate over a text in a std::string line by line with STL?

I have a text in a std::string object. The text consists of several lines. I want to iterate over the text line by line using STL (or Boost). All solutions I come up with seem to be far from elegant. My best approach is to split the text at the line breaks. Is there a more elegant solution? UPDATE: This is what I was looking for: std::string input; // get input ... std::istringstream stream(input); std::string line; while (std::getline(stream, line)) { std::cout
