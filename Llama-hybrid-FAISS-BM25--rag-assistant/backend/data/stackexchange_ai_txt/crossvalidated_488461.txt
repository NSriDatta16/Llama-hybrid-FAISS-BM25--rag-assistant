How to check to use linear models for huge data?

Generally, whenever we had the data when we want to use linear models we try to make numerical features to have normal distributions. And we check it with by plotting distribution or qqplot. It's the first time I am working on huge dataset which is having around 2000 columns. In which except 50 columns all others are numeric features. Now, how do I need to check for those many features whether there are having normal-distributions or not? how to get clarity whether to use logistic regression or not?
