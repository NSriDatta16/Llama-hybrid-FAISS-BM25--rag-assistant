rxc contingency tables

I am trying to analyze categorical data and to construct a contingency table based on a survey data. In the contingency table, there were 5 ordinal ratings(blank, unacceptable, below average, above average, outstanding ) and 3 categories for male, female and undisclosed. I am trying to test if gender plays a role in the distribution of the ordinal ratings, is it wrong of me to construct the contingency table from the male, and female categories , ignoring the undisclosed category? I am trying to ask if it is wrong of me to exclude a row of the data since i am thinking there might be a possibility that it might affect the end result of the hypothesis test?
