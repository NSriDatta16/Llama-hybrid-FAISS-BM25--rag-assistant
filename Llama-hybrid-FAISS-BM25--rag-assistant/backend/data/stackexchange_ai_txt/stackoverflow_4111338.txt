I would like to be able to let people login/logout on the first page of my grails application

I'd like to have login and logout on the first page of my grails application and have any error messages displayed there. I have an authentication function coded in my User domain along with a logout function. After someone logs in in the authenticate function, I manage to get them back to the main screen by doing a redirect: redirect(uri:"") If I do the same thing with the logout, I get an error when the page is rendered, saying it can't find the user object. Below is the output. Error 500: Executing action [logout] of controller [com.thornglatch.pingo.UserController] caused exception: No such property: name for class: com.thornglatch.pingo.User Possible solutions: games Servlet: grails URI: /Pingo/grails/user/logout.dispatch Exception Message: No such property: name for class: com.thornglatch.pingo.User Possible solutions: games Caused by: No such property: name for class: com.thornglatch.pingo.User Possible solutions: games Class: UserController At Line: [25] Here is the stuff it's trying to render, I believe: ${session.user?.firstName}&nbsp;${session.user?.lastName} | Logout Login Thank you for your time and attention. Here's the Authenticate code: def authenticate = { println "Authenticate Entered" def user = User.findByLoginAndPassword(params.login, params.password) println "User = [" + user + "]" if (user) { session.user = user def name = user.firstName ?: user.lastName flash.message = "Hello ${user.login}" redirect(uri:"") } else { println "Should be saying sorry" flash.message = "Sorry, ${params.login}. Please try again.}" redirect(uri:"") } } // authenticate This version works. In the one that didn't, the flash.message line was: flash.message = "Hello ${name}" I can live with this, but would like to know why using name didn't work.
