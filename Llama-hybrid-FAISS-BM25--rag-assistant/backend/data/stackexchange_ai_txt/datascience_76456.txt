Why do we use 2D kernel for RGB data?

I have recently started kearning CNN and I coukdnt understand that why are we using a 2D kernel like of shape (3x3) for a RGB data in place of a 3D kernel like of shape (3x3x3)? Are we sharing the same kernel among all the channels because the data would look the same in all the channels?
