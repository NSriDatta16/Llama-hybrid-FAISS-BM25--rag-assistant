TMTOWTDI , chose the method that best fits how you work. I use the environment method so I don't have to think about it. In the environment : export PERL_UNICODE=SDL on the command line : perl -CSDL -le 'print "\x{1815}"'; or with binmode : binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8"); #treat as if it is UTF-8 binmode(STDIN, ":encoding(utf8)"); #actually check if it is UTF-8 or with PerlIO : open my $fh, ">:utf8", $filename or die "could not open $filename: $!\n"; open my $fh, " or with the open pragma : use open ":encoding(utf8)"; use open IN => ":encoding(utf8)", OUT => ":utf8";
