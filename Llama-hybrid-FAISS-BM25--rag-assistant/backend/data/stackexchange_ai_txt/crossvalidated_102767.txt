$F(x)=0.5$ gives $x$ as the median of the distribution, which you could say is the centre of probability mass. I think your understanding of the expected value being the 'centre of mass' of a distribution is a little misguided. Expected value is more of a weighted average than a centre of mass, in the discrete (and finite) case what you're doing is weighting the possible values your distribution can take on by the probability of that value occurring. In continuous distributions the analogy isn't as clear, but you're still weighting possible values your distribution can take on by their probability.
