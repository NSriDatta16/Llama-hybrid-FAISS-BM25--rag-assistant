Personally, I've been using #pragma once because it's supported on the compilers I care about and you can avoid the kind of problems you mention here. If you want to use #include guards, then you may need to be clever about it. Otherwise #include ing Foo/header.h may not work because you already #include d Bar/header.h . I don't agree with the style guide in other cases, but Google recommends _ _ _H_ . Although that does mean that if you copy files around to different paths you're going to have to update the #include guard.
