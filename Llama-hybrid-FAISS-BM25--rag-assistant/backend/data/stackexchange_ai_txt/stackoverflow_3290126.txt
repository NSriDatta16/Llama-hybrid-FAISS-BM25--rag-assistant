I don't think that a plist is a model, it's just a way to store your model data. It's one part of the model. You could use an SQLite database to store the data without changing the model of your program. You should be able to change the way your program stores its information without the controller parts having to change. A plist is good for a small amount of data, up to around 50 items. It starts to get less manageable after this, and a database is a better option. If you want to do searching or ordering a database can make your life easier. So suggesting a plist for the model (storage) is only correct in some situations. Thinking that the plist is the model is not the full picture. I found the MVC descriptions in the Big Nerd Ranch iPhone book to be one of the best.
