If you're not knowlingly deserializing any XML, then I can only guess that either: the app's isolated storage contains some app-state XML (e.g. from AppSettings) or that there's a problem with the configuration XML for your app To try to fix this, you could: Take a look in the Properties folder of your project - are the XML configuration files there OK? If you open them in the editor, are there any warnings or errors shown? Uninstall the app from the emulator and/or from your phone (you can even try restarting the emulator or factory resetting the phone) If not, post more info and we'll try to help more - interesting problem!
