Thanks. This is an interesting problem...... Formally, speaking, the problem can be solved with neural networks if we discretize the range of the data into M bins. Then every input is a 1-by-M vector. In the intermediate layers, we build the NN in the usual way. The second to last layer has M neurons, each implementing $g(x_i)$. The last layer is non-typical but perfectly allowed. Not only does it connect to the previous layer but also to the input nodes. It takes all of information available and calculates $ \sum g(x_i)f(x_i)\Delta_i $ This is a roundabout approach though. I'm sure better approaches exist, after some thinking.
