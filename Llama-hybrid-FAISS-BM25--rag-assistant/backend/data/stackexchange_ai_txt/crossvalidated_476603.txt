Standard machine learning procedure goes like this: split data into training and test. Perform CV on training set in order to find best performing hyper parameters. Determine generalization error on Test set. Once you know your generalization error, take your entire dataset and perform CV again to find the best hyper parameters, ignore the error you find here, the error rate is the one you found in the step before. Once you have these new hyper parameters build your model on the entire dataset using those hyper parameters. Even better is something called nested cross validation, you can look that up if you wish.
