In Random Forest, cross-validation can be avoided using the out-of-bag sample?

I have heard that the main reason to use out-of-bag sample(OBB) over CV is that OOB is faster to implement and usually gets the same results(for tuning the hyper-parameters) as implementing CV when the Random forest model is used. If this isn't true, in which cases using CV gives better results?
