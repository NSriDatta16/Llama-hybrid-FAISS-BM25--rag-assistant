For me it'd have to be FileMaker . The ScriptMaker This screenshot shows the until recently named "ScriptMaker", which had many improvements in FileMaker 9 such as Ctrl+C Ctrl+V shortcuts for copying and pasting, and a non-modal dialog so you could edit more than one script at once. http://images.macnn.com/macnn/reviews/filemaker/9proadvanced-ice_feature1_main.png You edit individual Scripts using this dialog box. script "steps" (shown on the left) are added into the list on the left hand side (by double clicking), and are moved up and down (using the little blob to the left of "Set Web Viewer"). Only one line can be moved at once, and commenting for the purposes of temporarily disabling script steps is only available in the Advanced version of FileMaker Pro. Constructing a Script effectively ruins your wrists, as you're swapping between keyboard and mouse thousands of times an hour typing stuff into the the little config boxes and re-arranging your lines of code. A script is technically a procedure, and can be passed ONE parameter. Yup, just one. If you want more than one, you have to effectively combine your parameters using some delimiter, pass it to the script, then split the parameters out. Before scripts could have parameters at all (before FM7 IIRC), it was normal to use globals to pass data around. This guy wrapped most of his hate into a hoax FileMaker 11 sneak preview.
