SOM is able to tolerate missing data, so some nodes might be empty due to incompletely defined data. In terms of using a SOM as a histogram, you might want to have an average of 50 records per node for statistical significance. This heuristic is given in http://docs.unigrafia.fi/publications/kohonen_teuvo/ . For your data (10k observations), that would mean that a dimension like 10x20 could make sense. If the node is empty, then you might use the nearest neighbors method for selecting a label. You can take a vote among the nearest neighbors (some number of neighbors of your choosing). But in a 200 node map, it would seem curious if there were more than a handful of nearly empty nodes.
