c# code to validate organisation/company number?

I have a javascript which validates an organisation/company number but I need it in c#. Does anyone have something like this lying around? It's not an assignment and I could translate it myself, but if someone's done it already I wouldn't have to go through the work =) If it's country specific I need to use it in Sweden. Here it is in javascript, found at http://www.jojoxx.net function organisationsnummer(nr) { this.valid = false; if (!nr.match(/^(\d{1})(\d{5})\-(\d{4})$/)) { return false; } this.group = RegExp.$1; this.controldigits = RegExp.$3; this.alldigits = this.group + RegExp.$2 + this.controldigits; if (this.alldigits.substring(2, 3) Thanks in advance!
