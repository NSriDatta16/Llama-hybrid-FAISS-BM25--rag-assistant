How do I get the classpath, as file paths, of an IJavaProject in an Eclipse plugin?

I'm working on an Eclipse plugin that needs to build a classloader that can access all the things in the classpath of a project in Eclipse. I have an IJavaProject, and I'm trying to build a list of URLs to pass to a URLClassLoader: final IClasspathEntry[] resolvedClasspath = javaProject.getResolvedClasspath(true); for (IClasspathEntry classpathEntry : resolvedClasspath) { urls.add(classpathEntry.getPath().makeAbsolute().toFile().getCanonicalFile().toURL()); } But any project dependency (either manually added, or in the "Maven Dependencies" container from the Maven plugin) show up as a just "file:/projectName", instead of an absolute path. Other experiments have involved using javaProject.getAllPackageFragmentRoots(), but this don't seem to include project dependencies inside the "Maven Dependencies" container.
