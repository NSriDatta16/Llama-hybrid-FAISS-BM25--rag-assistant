Display a deleted DataRow in a (Infragistics.Ultra-) grid

is it possible to display a DataRow from a DataTable which has the DataRowState.Deleted? Scenario: The user can edit some kind of lookup-informations which are presented in the grid. Now he/she can delete, modify or insert multiple entries and finally store all his/her changes with one click to the database (assuming there is no primary-key-violation or some other problem). Now i want to colorize the different rows according to their edit-status, but the deleted rows disappear immediatly. Do you have any idea or another approach to solve this problem?
