Use BIC or AIC as approximation for Bayesian Model Averaging

I want to compare "real" Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) performed with the EM algorithm and information-criterion based BMA. Which one, BIC or AIC, is a "closer" approximation to the "real" BMA? BIC as the name is indicating? I would like to compare apples with apples. My models are not nested with 1 parameter at minimum and 3 parameter at maximum.
