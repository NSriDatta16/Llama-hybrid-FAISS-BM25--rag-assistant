Extra when using builder to generate XML

I'm trying to generate KML using Builder. I know their are some options out there to help with this but I will be doing some 2.2 specific things that aren't supported by the KML gems I've looked at and would generally like to be able to accomplish this leveraging just an XML framework. I get a tag at the end of the file when rendering my kml/xml. I strongly suspect I'm missing something basic with setting up my Builder object or with how I'm rendering the output it. Here's a simple example that demonstrates the issue: def kml2dot2 @site = Site.find(params[:id]) xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(:indent => 2) xml.instruct! xml.kml("xmlns" => "http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2") { xml.Placemark do xml.name @site.mapNameFull xml.Point do xml.coordinates @site.lat.to_s + "," + @site.lng.to_s + ",0" end end } render :text => xml, :type=>"text/kml" end Produces: Seattle City Hall 47.6040746,-122.33005,0 I'm trying to understand how to avoid the being included and what I'm doing wrong with Builder. Thanks for any insight.
