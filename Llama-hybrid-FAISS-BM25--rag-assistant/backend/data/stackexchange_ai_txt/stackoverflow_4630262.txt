How to get rid of this errormessage? There is no error message here. This is just a warning telling you that the convention is to never modify tags in SVN, for good reasons. Otherwise, what would the distinction between a tag and a branch be? This convention is the only thing separating both concepts. If you just click "yes", TortoiseSVN will proceed and modify the tag anyway. The preferred method of right-drag the files to the tags Preferred by you perhaps, but this is not the normal way to create tags. Conceptually, a tag is just a name for a particular important revision, so that you refer to it by name instead of by revision number. Therefore, creating a tag should not involve making changes. You should create tags with the Branch/Tag menu item in the TortoiseSVN context menu, preferably on the root of the trunk or a branch.
