If you are only interested in predictive performance, then simply using regularisation (e.g. ridge regression, SVM, regularised logistic regression etc.) will probably be as good as anything. Feature selection is difficult as it is easy to over-fit whatever criterion you use to select the features (as there are so many degrees of freedom involved), whereas for regularisation, you generally only have to optimise a small number (often only one) regularisation parameters. This is pretty much the advice given in the appendix of Miller's book on "subset selection in regression". The LASSO type regularisation results in feature selection, but that doesn't mean it necessarily gives better predictive performance than the standard L2 "ridge" regression approach.
