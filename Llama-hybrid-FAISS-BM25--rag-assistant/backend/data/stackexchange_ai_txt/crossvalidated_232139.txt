Yes it is fine to run RF having two set of variables for the same ID, as your LapseQtr are showing different point in time. You although need to include this variable as your predictor variable.. this is often seen in cases where you convert your data from wide to long format. For your second question:you do not have values for other predictors of Q2- 2017... so i think you might have to think of creating new predictors, such as if it's q1, q2, q3, or q4... or number of years from your base year... i.e given your base year is 2012, 2015 will be three years from you best year... you need to do some feature engineering here I believe based on your context.
