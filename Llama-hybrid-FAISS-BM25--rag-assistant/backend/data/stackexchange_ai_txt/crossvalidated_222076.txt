1) change the loss, say increase the loss of predicting young as old or old as young. Sounds like a reasonable approach. 2) turn it into a regression problem, young, middle-aged, and old are represented as say 0, 1 and 2. It depends on the regression learner you are employing, but this can be a bad idea (trees and derivatives would probably be safe against it, for example). Are you sure the "distance" (whatever it may mean) between young and middle-aged is the same as between middle-aged and old? As you are learning nominal variables, I recommend you to treat this problem as classification. More specifically, as you know there's a latent relationship between classes, ordinal classification. You can try the strategy proposed by Frank & Hall [1], where you code your $N$ response variable to $N-1$ binary problems. So you try to learn the distincion between old and not-old and young and not-young, and these actually give you information about the three categories. This is a really simply heuristic that can beat the naive multiclass approach and does not change the underlining workings of the learners. [1] Frank, E., & Hall, M. (2001, September).
