Welcome to the wonderful and sometimes intimidating world of machine learning! Building on El Burro's reply, I would start with a recurrent neural network, and put a logistic layer at the top. Recurrent neural networks are times series models in machine learning. They take input (the value of a variable at each point in time), perform some transformations, and give an output (a class label, in your case, but they can also be used for sequence-to-sequence prediction). One specifically relevant blog post for you might be sequence classification .
