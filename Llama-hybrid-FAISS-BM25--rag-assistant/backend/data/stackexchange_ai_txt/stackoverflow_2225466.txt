Is there a WPF control which will show a list of files in an Explorer-like view?

I often need to display a list of files to the user, say, as a result of a search query. Typically I describe my own simple DataTemplate for FileInfo . But I'm lazy to re-implement all the Explorer's functionality: the Views, Sorting, Context Menus and drag&drop. I feel like the problem is common and someone has already assembled a good library for this purpose.
