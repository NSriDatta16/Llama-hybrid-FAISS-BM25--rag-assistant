At the end of the day, what do you do with Bayesian Estimates?

I have often heard that in certain instances, it can be more beneficial to use Bayesian based methods because they provide "a distribution of possible answers" (i.e. the posterior distribution) instead of a single answer (as done in the frequentist case). However, it seems that at the end of the day, the analyst is still required to transform this "distribution of possible answers" into a single answer. For example : if a Bayesian model is used to estimate the posterior distribution of "mu", the analyst is still required to either take the MAP or the Expectation of this distribution to return a final answer. Is this the main benefit of Bayesian models? If the priors are correctly specified, the credible intervals associated with the expectation of the posterior distribution (of the parameter of interest) are more reliable?
