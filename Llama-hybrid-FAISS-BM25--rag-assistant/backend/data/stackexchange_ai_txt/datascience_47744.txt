How to label overlapping objects for deep learning model training

I am training yolov3 to detect a custom object (chickens). In a lot of my training images I have overlapping chickens (can only see a partial chicken etc). Is there a common practice for how to label the data (bounding box) in these cases? Should you only label the portion of the image which you can see?
