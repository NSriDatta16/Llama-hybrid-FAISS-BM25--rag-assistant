For me, data analysis represents something like.... What is an insightful KPI to get out of our data? If we are an eComm retailer, for example, that might be what % of page visits did we have to pages which we still had in stock? or What percentage of orders are dispatched within 2 days? Machine learning, is a whole different game. You might re-state Q1 and Q2, for example: Can we build a predictive algorithm that predicts what pages will be out of stock? Can we build an optimizer which helps us to dispatch orders faster? In some deeper level, data analysis you are typically using the machine to automate some fairly trivial tasks. With machine learning, you are letting the machine automate a lot of the learning process - where you would be typically passing in that knowledge as a data analyst. Does that help clarify at all?
