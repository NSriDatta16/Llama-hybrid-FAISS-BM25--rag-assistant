This is considered hacking (using a browser to write data on the client's computer). Whether the users trust you or not, there's no possible way (other then illegally using exploits) to do this, whether you use C#, JavaScript or any other technique. Just suppose for a moment that it is possible. You can write to c:/windows/ and destroy a user's system. Even if you don't intend to and promise the world that you do it right, if it is possible, other people can do it that are less trustworthy. And considering the amount of actively exploited leaks in IE by criminal organizations, that's not a thing you should want. That said: to gain full trust and be able to do anything, can be done by one of the following: Write an extension or plugin for the browser. Write an ActiveX control that needs full trust. Write an application that the user must install. Use full-trust VBScript or JScript and open and use FileSystemObject from the script. Either of these give you full freedom. Option 3 is the most common though, for obvious reasons. And all of these require the user's permission (they'll get a popup and have to click yes one or more times). An example of option 4 is as follows (note, drop the idea of using C#, that's server side only and can't be used in a browser): // this is JScript and works within in IE only function CreateSomeFile() { var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject"); var myFile = fso.CreateTextFile("c:\\somefile.txt", true); myFile.Writeline("this is Hello World from Outer Space"); myFile.Close(); } Update: added code sample
