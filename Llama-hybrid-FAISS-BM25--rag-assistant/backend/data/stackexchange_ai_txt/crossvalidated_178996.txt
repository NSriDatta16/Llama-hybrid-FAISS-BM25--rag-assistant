Clustering or other mechanisms for implementing generic spam detection

In normal case I had tried out naive bayes and linear SVM earlier to classify data related to certain specific type of comments related to some page where I had access to training data manually labelled and classified as spam or ham. Now I am being told to check if there are any ways to classify comments as spam where we don't have a training data. Something like getting two clusters for data which will be marked as spam or ham given any data. I need to know certain ways to approach this problem and what would be a good way to implement this. I am still learning and experimenting . Any help will be appreciated
