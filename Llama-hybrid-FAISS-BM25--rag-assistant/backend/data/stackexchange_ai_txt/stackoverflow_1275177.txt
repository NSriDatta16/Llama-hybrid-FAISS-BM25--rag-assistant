My requirements: Collect stats without impact to application - e.g. don't fill up memory, allow data to be collected away from apps under question Ability to specify measurements simply and repeatably (data driven) Automatable so that I can repeat measurements without point and click, and without UI Enable us to understand issues related to the WPF and other declarative technologies such as DLR or WF No installation - no gac, msi etc, even better if can be run over a network Support 64 bit from outset Don't try to know all the the analysis that could be done - encourage an ecosystem. If the raw stats can be analysed using other tools so much the better. UI if any should be good - but its the stats that matter. So don't spend time on that, get the core profiling good. Support profiling of apps that are not straight exe's like services and web applications simply. would likes: Consider cross app support - big apps often need to understand apps performance behavior across many executables. If your profiler allows easy correlation of this data then so much the better
