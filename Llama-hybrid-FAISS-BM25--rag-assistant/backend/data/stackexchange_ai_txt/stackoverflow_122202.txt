One of the more "cool" applications of logarithms I've found is Spiral Storage . It's a hash table that allows you to split one bucket at a time as the table grows, relocating less than half of the records in that bucket to the same, new bucket. Unlike linear hashing, where the performance varies cyclically and all of the buckets tend to be split at around the same time, spiral hashing allows nice, smooth growth of the table. It was published about 30 years ago by G. N. N. Martin, about whom I haven't been able to learn much besides the fact that he also invented Range Encoding . Seems like a smart guy! I haven't been able to get a copy of his original paper, but Per-Ã…ke Larson's paper "Dynamic hash tables" has a very clear description.
