hibernate change database dynamically for maintenance

I have a java webapp using hibernate over MYSQL db. I need at least an hour of data maintenance daily, hence I need to bring down the db and switch to the backup db. I don't see an elegant way to switch to another db from my app using hibernate. Is there? Other totally different ways for database maintenance is welcome.
