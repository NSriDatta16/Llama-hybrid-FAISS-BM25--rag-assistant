Alberto Savoia says that " if all your tests pass, chances are that your test are not good enough ". I think that it is a good way to think about tests: ask if you are doing edge cases, pass some unexpected parameter and so on. A good way to improve the quality of your tests is work with a pair - specially a tester - and get help about more test cases. Pair with testers is good because they have a different point of view. Of course, you could use some tool to do mutation tests and get more confidence from your tests. I have used Jester and it improve both my tests and the way that I wrote them. Consider to use something like it. Kind Regards
