OK guys. I was really pissed off. Was googling for 4 hours yesterday, and 3 hours today. Went to Troubleshooting page on android developers site, where I found these points: Quit the emulator if it is running Check that any emulator processes are killed (sometimes they can hang, use ps on unix or mac, or task manager in the process view on windows). Quit Eclipse From the command line, type: adb kill-server Start Eclipse and try again This isn't quite accurate, so here is what helped me: As it was obvious that Eclipse is not comunicating with the emulator after it starts, I tried just the point 4 from previous troubleshoot - run "adb kill-server" while both Eclipse and emulator were running . After I got back to the Eclipse I could see new logs in console comming up infomring me of installing the .apk and running some intent. After switching back to the emulator, what a surprise, the application was there and running!!! A small hint how to run a command on Windows when Yoou don't have adb.exe in Your system PATH: Open up cmd.exe, find and open a folder where Your Android SDK is installed and browse to the folder platform-tools. Then drag the file adb.exe to the cmd, write the parameter kill-server after the path to the adb.exe and hit Enter. command now should be as my example (could vary depending on where did You install Your SDK): "C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk-windows\platform-tools\adb.exe" kill-server And voila - it should be done!!! Hope You appreciate this and that it will help many other users facing the same problem as I was... Note: If there is nothing going on after killing of adb server (eventually You can see unsuccessful attempts to connect to adb [emulator]) just run the project again (without closing the emulator!). As I always have this problem when running a project for the first time after emulator was closed this always helps me!
