Storage algorithm question - verify sequential data with little memory

I found this on an "interview questions" site and have been pondering it for a couple of days. I will keep churning, but am interested what you guys think "10 Gbytes of 32-bit numbers on a magnetic tape, all there from 0 to 10G in random order. You have 64 32 bit words of memory available: design an algorithm to check that each number from 0 to 10G occurs once and only once on the tape, with minimum passes of the tape by a read head connected to your algorithm."
