Machine learning algorithm to classify blog posts

So I have a large collection of blog posts containing title , content , category , tags and geo-location fields and I'm looking to achieve three things: Assign a category (or multiple categories) to all the posts and any new ones. I have a strict vocabulary of categories. Add new tags to the posts that might be relevant to the post. Mark the post if it contains information about a place. For example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet San Francisco, consectetur adipiscing elit . I've been looking into different machine learning algorithms, most recently decision trees, but I don't feel that is the best algorithm to work out the problems above (or that I haven't understood them enough). Many of these posts already contain categories , tags and geo-location data. Some do not contain any information and some have only a few details. What would be the best machine learning algorithm to look into to solve each of the three areas?
