jQuery: how can I add helpful information to my page elements?

I am tempted to make some custom attributes for some page elements to make selection easier, via the .attr(); function in jQuery. I figure that this is probably discouraged, as there is a lot of flexibility in jQuery and javaScript that, as a novice, I have not learned to employ yet to its full potential. Other than making cryptic IDs or adding lots of classes, what are some ways to add more information to my divs and other page elements for easy selecting via the selector $() ? I'm mostly curious as to pros/cons, and what memory issues or speed issues result based on different approaches.
