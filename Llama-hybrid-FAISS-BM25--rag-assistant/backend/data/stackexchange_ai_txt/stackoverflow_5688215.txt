Adding Characters one by one to TMemo

Could any one tell me how can I add characters one by one from a text file to a Memo? The text file contains different paragraphs of texts. I want to add the characters of each paragraph one by one till the end of the paragraph. Then after 10 seconds delay the next paragraph to be shown in the Memo. Thanks, Sei
