Ok, this is a bit late, but two points which will hopefully be of help for someone in the future. The labels that you are looking for should be returned by clf.predict (see also in the tutorial that you posted) As can be seen in this quesion Why won't my SVM learn a sequence of repeated elements your testset actually must contain outliers. This contradicts the statement in scikit-learn that they are doing novelty detection. To me, the given link proves that the method does not (not that this would be a problem, it is just important to know).
