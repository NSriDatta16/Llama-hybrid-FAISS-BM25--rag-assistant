One unit-test should test one thing, and you should avoid logic in your unit test in order to avoid having to writing code that tests your unit tests. Having said that, if most of those 200 lines are setup code to ensure a particular state of your data in order to reproduce a hard-to-test edge case bug, then that might be the only way to do it. But you should, if possible, try to minimize the number of lines in unit tests. They quickly become very fragile (breaks easily upon modifications) when they are long.
