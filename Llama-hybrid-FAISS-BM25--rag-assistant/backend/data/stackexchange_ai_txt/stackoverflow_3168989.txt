Replace/Add several DOM Elements: Efficient and robust Method?

I am in search for an efficient method to replace a couple of DOM Elements - if possible in one action only. It is needed for augmenting TextNodes. If a certain word is present, it shall be wrapped in span-Tags, to which an event handler needs to be assigned later. so if a text Node contains the word it needs to turn from -#textNode to - #textNode - span - #textNode - #textNode While leaving the rest of the document untouched. Known/assumed issues: - innerHTML would be fast, but the Elements would need to have a generated ID and be later retrieved later again via getElementByID; not the cleanest/fastest way. - Cloning the node, putting it into an documentFragment, doing all operations and replacing it back again would be good â€“ but cloning does discard event handlers as far as I know. Since this code is to be used in an Bookmarklet/Add-On this is not an option than.
