Data Mining / ML applications in hydrodynamics?

I have a question about Scientific Data Mining. Do you know successful case studies of applying Data Mining / Machine Learning techniques in hydrodynamics? In general, does it make actually sense to try to apply DM/ML techniques to such deterministic systems as gas/fluid flows which are described by Navier-Stokes equations? I guess that answer is 'no' in the case of very simple flows. But maybe it makes sense if we have a deal with complex data from turbulent/multiphase/... flows? What could be the problem formulation in this area? I will appreciate to your opinion, links to the papers and web-pages.
