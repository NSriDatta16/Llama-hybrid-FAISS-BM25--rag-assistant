Improper Likelihood

I just learned about improper priors in the Bayesian framework and was wondering if there could be any use in working with ''improper'' likelihoods. That is, if we believe there is something like overdispersion in the observed data relative to the models under considerations, could we propagate this uncertainty through the likelihood? If so, what might this look like, and is there any relation to quasi-likelihood in GLMs?
