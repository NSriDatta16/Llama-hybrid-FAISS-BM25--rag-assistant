Simplest solution for high availability of SQL server 2008?

I have a bunch of SQL servers which I periodically performs maintainance on (Windows Update patches etc.). Now I want to the database online 24/7 and need to implement one of the high-availability solutions for SQL server. The solutions needs to be cheap and simple to use. I have no problems tweaking the connection strings for the clients of the database, so currently I'm looking into database mirroring with manual failovers when taking down a partner instance for patching etc. Is this the best thing to do or are there other options which doesn't involve setting up a failover cluster? The servers are virtualized with a fully redundant storage solution. Any tips are appreciated, thanks in advance!
