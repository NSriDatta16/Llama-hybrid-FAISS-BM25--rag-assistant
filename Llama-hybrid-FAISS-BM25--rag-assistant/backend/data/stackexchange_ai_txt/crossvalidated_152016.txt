Isn't Bayesian networks directed, with information flowing in only on direction and asymmetrical? Thus: if node i have a directed link to j, and j have a directed link to i then it ain't a Bayesian network, If the network ain't directed then it ain't a Bayesian network If you can start at a node and follow a path that loops you back to the node you started on then it ain't a Bayesian network. I can only see test to falsify whether a graph qualifies as a Bayesian network or not. I don't think it I s possible to say for sure since any graph can have the same structure as a Bayesian network without being a Bayesian network. Whether a graph actually is a Bayesian network depends on the interpretation and the context (I.e. The code the network is processed by). But if you have graph A and B. You know one of them is a Bayesian graph and the other not, then you can run the three tests above. If A fails, then B is the one and vice versa. If both A and B passes the test, then you have a problem.
