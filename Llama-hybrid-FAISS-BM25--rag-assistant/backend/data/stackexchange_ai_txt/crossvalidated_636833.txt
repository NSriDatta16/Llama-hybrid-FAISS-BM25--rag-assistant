Is It okay to ignore Breusch Pagan Test?

My data han N=90 observation, I plot my data and I don't see any peculiar plot indicating heteroscedaticity, so I run BP and other test like Goldfeld-Quandt and Harrison-McCabe, but BP return significantly and other test is not with enourmous gap of P-Value (BP=0.040 while other 0.9). Can any one help what should I do with this result?
