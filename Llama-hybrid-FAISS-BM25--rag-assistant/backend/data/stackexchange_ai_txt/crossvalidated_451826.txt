How to do ensembling in machine learning and deep learning

I am trying to do text classification. I have 3 logistic regression models, 2 recurrent neural net model, and 2 convolution neural network models. I want to take ensemble of all these. What I have done is averaged the prediction of all these 7 models. Is this a correct approach? or should I first set a threshold and then take mod of all these 7 models
