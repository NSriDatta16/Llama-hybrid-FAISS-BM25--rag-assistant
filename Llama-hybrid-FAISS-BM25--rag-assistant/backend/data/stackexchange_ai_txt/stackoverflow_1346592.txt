I have to display a list of tracks GROUPED BY Album in WPF

Now I am aware that I probably need to use a ListBox and can use the GroupStyle stuff which completely 100% fits my needs. Only thing is that I've been told that: "Whenever a "GroupStyle" is set on the control, the panel that layouts the items changes from VirtualizingStackPanel to StackPanel (this is a hack in MS code)..." I will need to display up to 2000 tracks using this mecahnism: 1) Does this bug still exist? 2) Is this something to worry about for up to 2000 tracks? (More like an average of 50-100) Also, the group by will not be changed by the user. The tracks will be grouped the same way throughout the duration of the control.
