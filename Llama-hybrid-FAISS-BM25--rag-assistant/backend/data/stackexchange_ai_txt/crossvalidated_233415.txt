These type of exercises are clearly understood when you have established very precisely the base category . Once you have done that, all goes smooth, as least squares is simply describing the mean of the dependent variable for each subgroup . In your case, the base category (implicit in $\beta_{0}$) are males with zero GPA and zero IQ (unless the variables GPA and IQ are centered - a reasonably thing to do- in which case the levels of GPA and IQ would be the mean of the sample). You can find the base category by replacing all regressors with zero. Having established that, now the marginal change in the base category should be clear (or, the ceteris paribus change) GPA is the average change on wages of one more unit of GPA on males with originally zero GPA and zero IQ. GPA*G is the average change on wages of one more unit of GPA on females with originally zero GPA and zero IQ. IQ is the average change on wages of one more unit of IQ on males with originally zero GPA and zero IQ. Notice this does not depend on gender, so it also applies to female. This is because there is no IQ*G in the model. G is the average change on wages of being a female with zero GPA and zero IQ (compared with males with zero GPA and zero IQ). GPA*IQ is the average change on wages for an extra unit of IQ, given a certain level of GPA, and vice-versa. Notice this does not depend on gender. To answer the question, it is clear from the sign of $\beta_{3}$ that on average women earn more than men if both have zero GPA and zero IQ . However, as GPA increases, average wages become relatively higher for men ($\beta_{5} Hence, the answer is (iii).
