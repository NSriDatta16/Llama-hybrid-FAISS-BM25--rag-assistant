Connecting an input stream to an outputstream

update in java9: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#transferTo-java.io.OutputStream- I saw some similar, but not-quite-what-i-need threads. I have a server, which will basically take input from a client, client A, and forward it, byte for byte, to another client, client B. I'd like to connect my inputstream of client A with my output stream of client B. Is that possible? What are ways to do that? Also, these clients are sending each other messages, which are somewhat time sensitive, so buffering won't do. I do not want a buffer of say 500 and a client sends 499 bytes and then my server holds off on forwarding the 500 bytes because it hasn't received the last byte to fill the buffer. Right now, I am parsing each message to find its length, then reading length bytes, then forwarding them. I figured (and tested) this would be better than reading a byte and forwarding a byte over and over because that would be very slow. I also did not want to use a buffer or a timer for the reason I stated in my last paragraph â€” I do not want messages waiting a really long time to get through simply because the buffer isn't full. What's a good way to do this?
