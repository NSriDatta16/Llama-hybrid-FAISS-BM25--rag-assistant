Magento google checkout integration issue 404

I'm trying to integrate google checkout with a magento site and get the following error in the Integration Console: We encountered an error trying to access your server at https://www.domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api/ -- the error we got is Sending failed with HTTP response code: 404. Response body was: 404 - File or directory not found. Server Error 404 - File or directory not found. The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. As far as I can tell, it's not actually a 404 error as I can do the following: wget --post-data=blah https://www.domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api/ --10:58:43-- https://www.domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api/ => `index.html' Resolving www.domain.co.uk... 192.168.1.117 Connecting to www.domain.co.uk|192.168.1.117|:443... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 503 Service Unavailable 10:58:43 ERROR 503: Service Unavailable. Now the 503 error there actually relates to me not sending any HTTP_AUTHORIZATION with wget, so it dies on this line strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'], " ") + 1))); in googleresponse.php . This isn't the problem. I have tried both https://www.domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api/ and https://www.domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api in both wget and Google Checkout settings callback URL with the same results. I've made sure that always_populate_raw_post_data = On is set, and it's showing up correctly in phpinfo() . I've tried debug mode On and Off in Google API settings within Magento. The checkout process was working correctly on a dev domain using the sandbox mode. I've tried all of the things that I could find with google searches. Any other options would be greatly appreciated. Edit It looks like that response is from an IIS server. The server that this site is now running on is Apache. Could Google still be accessing the old server? DNS was updated over 15 hours ago.
