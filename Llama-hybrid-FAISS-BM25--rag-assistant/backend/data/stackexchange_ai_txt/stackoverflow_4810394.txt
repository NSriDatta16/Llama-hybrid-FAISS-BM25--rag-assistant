Detecting simple lines on a grayscale image is a well known problem. A Hough transform would be suffice for the job. See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/imgproc_feature_detection.html?highlight=hough%20line#cv-houghlines for a function that implement finding lines using Hough Transform. Can you try the above function and see if it works? If it doesn't, please update your question with a sample image.
