Proof that the Markov Blanket in a Bayesian Network is parents, children, and children's parents

I'm looking for a proof of this fact from wikipedia: The Markov boundary of a node $A$ in a Bayesian network is the set of nodes composed of $A$ 's parents, $A$ 's children, and $A$ 's children's other parents. I haven't yet seen a really convincing argument for why it's exactly this set and nothing more. Like, why are $A$ 's children's parent's parents not important? Can someone provide a proof of this fact? I think what we want to show is: Let $B$ be the set of nodes composed of $A$ 's parents, $A$ 's children, and parents of $A$ 's children (the Markov Boundary). For any node $X$ not in $B$ , we want to show that $P(X,A|B)=P(X|B)P(A|B)$ . We want to say something about every path from $X$ to $A$ being 'blocked off' by the Markov blanket, but I'm not sure how to formalize this.
