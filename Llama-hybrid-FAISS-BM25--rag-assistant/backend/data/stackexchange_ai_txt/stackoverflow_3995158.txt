Before you can determine the average time someone waited, you must know when they began waiting (the time when you give them the token) and the time they stopped waiting (the time you served them). You cannot determine the average wait time by only knowing when you can give hand out tokens (baring having flow data and the like, but if you have that, you certainly will also record service time). Until you have the data you need, the answer is there's no way to calculate what you are looking for.
