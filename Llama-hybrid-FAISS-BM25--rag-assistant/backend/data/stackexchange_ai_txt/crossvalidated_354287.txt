There's no need to shuffle training data - the model only cares about aggregate statistics of the data at each node, and these statistics are not sensitive to ordering. However, it sounds like you have multiple observations from the same patients. If this is the case, we can suspect that the observations are dependent and this is not something that XGBoost is designed to model. Perhaps you would be better served by using a model that can account for dependent data structures.
