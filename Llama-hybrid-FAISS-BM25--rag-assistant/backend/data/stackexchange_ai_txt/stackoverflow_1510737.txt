You probably want to convert it to a Reader , not an InputStream . Use StringReader to do this. StreamSource has a constructor that takes a Reader, and you can pass that StreamSource to Transformer.transform(). I say you probably want a Reader rather than an InputStream because a String holds characters, not bytes, and an InputStream is a stream of bytes while a Reader is a stream of characters.
