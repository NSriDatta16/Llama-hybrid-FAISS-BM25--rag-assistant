You can fit multilevel GLMM with a Poisson distribution (with over-dispersion) using R in multiple ways. Few R packages are: lme4 , MCMCglmm , arm , etc. A good reference to see is Gelman and Hill (2007) I will give an example of doing this using rjags package in R . It is an interface between R and JAGS (like OpenBUGS or WinBUGS ). $$n_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\theta_{ij})$$ $$\log \theta_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mbox{ } \mathtt{Treatment}_{i} + \delta_{ij}$$ $$\delta_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})$$ $$i=1 \ldots I, \quad j = 1\ldots J$$ $\mathtt{Treatment}_i = 0 \mbox{ or } 1, \ldots, J-1 \mbox{ if the } i^{th} \mbox{ observation belongs to treatment group } 1 \mbox{, or, } 2, \ldots, J$ The $\delta_{ij}$ part in the code above models overdispersion. But there is no one stopping you from modeling correlation between individuals (you don't believe that individuals are really independent) and within individuals (repeated measures). Also, the rate parameter may be scaled by some other constant as in rate models . Please see Gelman and Hill (2007) for more reference. Here is the JAGS code for the simple model: data{ for (i in 1:I){ ncount[i,1] Here is the R code to implement use it (say it is named: overdisp.bug ) dataFixedEffect You can play around with your parameters' posteriors and you can introduce more parameters to make you modeling more precise ( we like to think this ). Basically, you get the idea. For more details on using rjags and JAGS , please see John Myles White's page
