Using &&'s short-circuiting as an if statement?

I saw this line in the jQuery.form.js source code: g && $.event.trigger("ajaxComplete", [xhr, s]); My first thought was wtf?? My next thought was, I can't decide if that's ugly or elegant. I'm not a Javascript guru by any means so my question is 2-fold. First I want to confirm I understand it properly. Is the above line equivalent to: if (g) { $.event.trigger("ajaxComplete", [xhr, s]); } And secondly is this common / accepted practice in Javascript? On the one hand it's succinct, but on the other it can be a bit cryptic if you haven't seen it before.
