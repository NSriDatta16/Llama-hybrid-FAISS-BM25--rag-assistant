Because nobody has yet answered the final question--namely, to quantify the differences between the two formulas--let's take care of that. For many reasons, it is appropriate to compare standard deviations in terms of their ratios rather than their differences. The ratio is $$s_n / s = \sqrt{\frac{N-1}{N}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{N}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2N}.$$ The approximation can be viewed as truncating the (alternating) Taylor series for the square root, indicating the error cannot exceed $|\binom{1/2}{2}N^{-2}|$ = $1 / (8 N^2)$. This establishes that the approximation is more than good enough (for our purposes) once $N$ is $2$ or larger. It is immediate that the two SD estimates are within (about) 10% of each other once $N$ exceeds $5$, within 5% once $N$ exceeds $10$, and so on. Clearly, for many purposes these discrepancies are so small that it does not matter which formula is used, especially when the SD is intended for describing the spread of data or for making semi-quantitative assessments or predictions (such as in employing the 68-95-99.7 rule of thumb). The discrepancies are even less important when comparing SDs, such as when comparing the spreads of two datasets. (When the datasets are equinumerous, the discrepancies effectively vanish altogether and both formulas lead to identical conclusions.) Arguably, these are the forms of reasoning we are trying to teach beginning students, so if the students are becoming concerned about which formula to use, that could be taken as a sign that the text or the class is failing to emphasize what is really important. We might want to pay some attention to the case of very small $N$. Here, people may be using $t$ tests instead of $z$ tests, for instance. In that case, it is essential to employ whichever formula for the standard deviation is used by one's table or software. (This is not a matter of one formula being wrong or right; it's just a consistency requirement.) Most tables use $s$, not $s_n$: this is the one place in the elementary syllabus where the text and teacher need to be clear about which formula to use.
