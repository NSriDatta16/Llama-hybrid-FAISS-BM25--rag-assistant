Numbers 1-100, calculating how many I must pick to get x% of reliability

I would like to know the formula or method of calculating this. For example, I want to know how many numbers I must pick in order to have 95% confidence that I will be within 2% of the average. I'm also interested in doing a similiar analysis for the median as well. Update: Numbers are not put back in the pool. I think this has to do with combinations rather than trials? For example, if I pick 1 number or 99 numbers there are 100 combinations, if I pick 100 numbers there is 1 combination etc. I think you could figure out all of the combinations when you pick 1 ball, 2 balls, 3 balls etc and see how many are within 2% of the median. Im interested in seeing just how reliable the average price statistic is for the housing market. For example, in a single month 5% of the houses may sell, or maybe 20% will. Housing prices are all over the map but I wanted to do something simplistic like this. And now I have thought of something else...let's say I have 1-500 instead of 1-100. If I pick from 1-100 and pick 10 balls(10% of them), Im guessing that the answer would differ from taking 50 balls out of 1-500(10% of them as well)?
