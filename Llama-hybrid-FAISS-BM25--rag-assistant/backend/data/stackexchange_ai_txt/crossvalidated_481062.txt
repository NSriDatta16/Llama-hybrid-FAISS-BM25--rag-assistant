Differences between Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests for if two-samples come from same distribution

In a textbook, it introduces the chi-square goodness of fit test to test independence between two variables (organized in a contingency table), which can also be used to test if m samples are likely to come from the same distribution by using one dimension as samples and the other as values/bins. Then in another chapter, it introduces the Mann-Whitney test, which seems to do the same thing. Both are nonparametric and chisquare can be applied to continuous distribution by discretizing the bins. I am confused that they seem to do the same thing, so for the purpose of testing if two populations are the same (distribution and parameters), what're their differences?
