Depends on the model you plan on using, i.e multiplicative or additive error. Please see table given below, which from Forecasting:Principles and Practice The table is for multiplicative error, now for additive trend and multiplicative seasonality (set of equations in 3rd column and 2nd row) you can find the error equation by working backwards for the equation of $y_t$ $\epsilon_t$ = ( $y_t$ / (( $l_{t-1}$ + $b_{t-1}$ )* $s_{t-m}$ ) ) - 1 where $t$ is the current period and ${t-1}$ is the previous period. $y_t$ represents actual demand in the current period. $l_{t-1}$ and $b_{t-1}$ are the level and trend values respectively for the previous period. $m$ is the seasonal period of the data. This way you can recursively calculate error values for all the periods of the time series you have. Working in a similar fashion you find error terms for any model you plan to use viz., MAM, AAM, etc. I implement the above formula in excel sheet and the values I got matched the ones I saw in R. I use the ets model within the forecast package in R
