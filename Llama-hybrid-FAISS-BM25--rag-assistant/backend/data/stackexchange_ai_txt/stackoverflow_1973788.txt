Tracking Lua tables in C

I have C++ objects and I have Lua objects/tables. (Also have SWIG C++ bindings.) What I need to be able to do is associate the two objects so that if I do say CObject* o1 = getObject(); o1->Update(); it will do the equivalent Lua: myluatable1.Update(); So far I can imagine that CObject::Update would have the following code: void CObject::Update(){ // Acquire table. // ??? // Do the following operations on the table. lua_getfield(L, -1, "Update"); lua_pcall(L, 0, 0, 0); } How would I store/set the Lua table to be used, and what would go in the // ??? above to make the Update call work?
