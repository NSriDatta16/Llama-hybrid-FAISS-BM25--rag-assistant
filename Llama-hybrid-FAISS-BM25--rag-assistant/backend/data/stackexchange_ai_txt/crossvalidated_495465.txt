One approach to dealing with this type of problem is to group the predictors to reduce the extent of correlations among them. Ideally this should be done with expert knowledge, or it might be obvious to non-experts that certain predictors should be grouped together, such as systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. If there is no knowldege that can help to identifty the groups then a clustering algorithm, or an exploratory factor analysis, could be used. The general idea is that all of the variables in a group are measuring the same thing - in the case of sbp and dbv, they are measuring blood pressure. From there you can take a number of approaches. A very simple one is just to take the average of the group (if doing this then it would be a good idea to scale the variabls first, if they are not already on the same scale). Then you use the average as a predictor in place of the individual variables. Perhaps a better approach that recognises the idea that the observed variables are measuring another, unobserved (latent) variable, is to adpopt a latent variable approach and use the factor loadings, as weights to create a new variable that you then use as a predictor in your regression with random effects. You could combine both steps by using a mixed effects latent variable model.
