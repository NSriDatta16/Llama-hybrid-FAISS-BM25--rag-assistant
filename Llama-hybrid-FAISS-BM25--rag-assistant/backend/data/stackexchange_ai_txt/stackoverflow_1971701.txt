What you are looking for is generally called a stop word list. Here's a blog post with a list of them (even in PHP array format for you) and another text file version. A bit more googling should find you some other examples. A few more potential ideas for improving the algorithm in general: Weight the word usage by recency. You already do this by recalculating every 2 hours, but you could also factor in the exact time since the word was used as well. So, rather than having each mention of a word be worth 1 "point", it's point value would be determined by the time in minutes since the message containing it was posted. Create a database table of words and their average frequency in messages on your site. When you examine the messages created in the last X hours, compare the word frequency to the average frequency in your database. Those words that have a frequency significantly higher than the average would be considered "hot". Make sure you re-calculate the average frequency for words on a semi-regular basis (once a day maybe?)
