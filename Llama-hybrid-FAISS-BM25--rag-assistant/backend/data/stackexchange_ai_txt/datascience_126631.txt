How to use two independent datasets in machine learning phd research work?

In order to develop an academic performance prediction model for a local Higher Ed Institution, I have collected the OULAD open dataset and the local Institution's dataset which I structured into the same file structure and feature formats as OULAD dataset. The objective of the research focuses on demographic features and performance-based features only, and I am trying to develop a multi-class classification ensemble model. However, I do not know how to use the two datasets, should I write individual research papers showcasing the performance of the ensemble approach on each of the datasets, or should i write a single comprehensive research paper where both the datasets are used?
