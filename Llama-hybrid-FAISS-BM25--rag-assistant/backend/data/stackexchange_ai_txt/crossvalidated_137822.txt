It is a bit hard to say without more context, but it seems that the editor is looking for a mediating factor or the actual cause of death that would explain higher mortality with certain occupations. For example, unless librarians are dying because bookshelves are falling on them, his or her occupation is not the agent responsible for his or her death. I would suggest 3 possibilities, listed in order of difficulty/expertise: Identify which occupations are the most hazardous, and determine what type of deaths they are more likely to succumb to. Or see what risk factors they tend to have (higher blood pressure?). Perform a mediation analysis (there are many methods, and perhaps some that can be implemented with Cox models). Perform a causality analysis (i.e. certain Bayesian network analyses, Granger causality tests, or structural equation modelling). The first option may suffice, but if this is what the editor has in mind, I would be surprised if he or she called it "more complex statistical modelling." Option 3 is probably much more advanced than the editor was thinking, and would require assistance from an expert in these approaches or at least some serious homework. Option 2 is probably the best, as it would offer some interesting insights and would not be too difficult to incorporate into your analysis. Or you could respond to the editor and ask for clarification.
