How do you interpret outputs of Cox regression based on data type of an independent categorical variable?

I have the following data frame which consists of a grouping variable, as well as time ans status variables for survival analysis: sample_df In its present form, the grouping variable is a character variable. When I run Cox regression using the following code, I will get this output: summary(coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ group, data = sample_df)) So I guess this gives me the hazard ratio and p-values of Groups B and C compared with Group A, respectively. If I change the grouping variable to an unordered factor variable and re-run the Cox regression, I get the same result. So far so good. However, if I change the grouping variable to an ordered factor, I get the following output: sample_df $group_ord group %>% factor(levels = c("Group A", "Group B", "Group C"), ordered = TRUE) summary(coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ group_ord, data = sample_df)) I'm having trouble interpreting these results. What do the "L" and "Q" the the end of the grouping variables stand for? And what do the HR ans p-values refer to?? And finally, I tried using the predictor variable as a numerical variable (changing the categorical variable to a numerical one), like this: sample_df % mutate( group_num = case_when( group == "Group A" ~ 0, group == "Group B" ~ 1, group == "Group C" ~ 2 ) ) Running Cox regression I get: summary(coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ group_num, data = sample_df)) This gives me one HR and one p-value. Am I correct in interpreting this HR as the average HR increase per increase in 1 unit of the independent variable? I'm sorry for this messy post but I hope someone can help me correctly interpret these results.
