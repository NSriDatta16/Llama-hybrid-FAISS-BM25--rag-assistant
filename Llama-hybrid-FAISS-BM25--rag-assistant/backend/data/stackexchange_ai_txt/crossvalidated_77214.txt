Your model fits a linear time trend plus a first order Fourier series approximation for the seasonality. Since you don't define cos.t or sin.t , it is not possible to tell what seasonal period you have used. You can fit a model with correct seasonal period using t However, you may need a higher order Fourier series approximation, and there are facilities in the forecast package in R for doing that. First, make sure the data is a time series object of the correct frequency: NH3cH6 Generate the Fourier terms for the regression (using 3 terms here, but choose the best number by minimizing the AIC of the fitted regression model). library(forecast) X Fit the regression model fit The tslm command will understand what trend means, and will make sure the residuals and fitted values are ts objects with time series characteristics. To see the result: plot(NH3cH6) lines(fitted(fit), col="red")
