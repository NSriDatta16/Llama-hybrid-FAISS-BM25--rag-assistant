Calculating how much time you can save by estimating the code you write in a year

I'm looking for real figures and experiences, please don't take this too subjectively: While looking for something else, I happened on an interesting statement , which partially reads as follows: [...]the national average is 9,000 lines of code per year per person.[...] I write a lot of code, but not full-time. When I look back at my projects of the past year and I do a (very) rough count (counting only code lines, no comments or white lines) I come to about 19.000 for a year that make it into a project. If I can automate parts of that, I could deduct the profit in time and money. For estimating time-saving for larger projects, I need averages. How many code lines does man write in a year, on average, in C# (or other language of choice)? And, looking at your own situation, would you consider your hand-written code could (partially) be automated and by what gain?
