Your convergence problem can with near certainty be solved by simply running the MCMC longer - if the posterior is integrable and the MCMC is set up properly, it must eventually converge. In a Bayesian analysis with proper (integrable) priors, there is no real limit to the number of parameters you can estimate - if you have too little data, you simply end up with something close to your priors. I'm not even sure if it's true that your model is unidentifiable with MLE - do you posit that, or have you tried it out? In a multilevel model, parameters are not entirely free, so you cannot count a full degree of freedom for each data point.
