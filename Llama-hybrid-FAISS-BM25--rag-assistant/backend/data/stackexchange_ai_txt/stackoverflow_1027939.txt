I think what you did is great. If I were doing this project, I'd start with what you have and add a setTimeout() event to increment the minutes/seconds display every second. The users would perceive the display to be real-time, and they'd probably never hit the page refresh. The danger with updating only every 30 seconds is some people will reflexively hit refresh for "the latest" every time they turn their attention toward it. Also consider specially marking anything with a time less than five minutes. And color coding logged in versus logged out. It'll be easier for people to "scan" because they'll be able to pick out changes without reading all the text.
