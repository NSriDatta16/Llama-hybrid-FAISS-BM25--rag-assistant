I also sometimes combine similar class files into one branch in VS. For example - if you have 3 files : Message.xaml, Message.xaml.cs, MessageButton.cs, MessageImage.cs, MessageResult.cs. Message.xaml.cs already will be shown inside the first file's hierarchy. You can also add others, simply by editing project's file using notepad. You only need to add tags where it's needed. I don't know if there is any extension for VS to do that in a lot easier way. And here is one thing. Although that will help you to organize your files in a project, you won't be able to rename your class simply by clicking twice on the filename in VS.
