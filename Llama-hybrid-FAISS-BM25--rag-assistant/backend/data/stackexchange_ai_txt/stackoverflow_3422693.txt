class_getClassMethod often returns nil (seems to work only with class level Methods)

Im currently trying to use some generated code from http://sudzc.com/ This code is not perfectly adapted to my web services, so I tried to add Categories to some of the generated classes and to exchange their implementations with the original ones using method_exchangeImplementations from "objc/runtime.h". (I could modify the generated code directly but I want to avoid it). Here is the code I execute in MyAppAppDelegate - applicationDidFinishLaunching method Class theClass = [CBMayaIPhoneUser class]; Method originalMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(initWithNode:)); Method categoryMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(initWithAllStringNode:)); method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, categoryMethod); theClass = [Soap class]; originalMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(getNodeValue:withName:)); categoryMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(getHrefNodeValue:withName:)); method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, categoryMethod); theClass = [SoapRequest class]; originalMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(send)); categoryMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(sendIgnoringCertificate)); method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, categoryMethod); originalMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(connectionDidFinishLoading:)); categoryMethod = class_getClassMethod(theClass, @selector(connectionDidFinishLoadingAndSentBody:)); method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, categoryMethod); As stated in my question, nearly all of those class_getClassMethod are returning nil... I used the debugger so I know 'theClass' is rightly set. The only method being found are those of the Soap class, which are both class level (+) methods. But from various examples on the net I concluded that it should work for the others as well... Here are my includes for MyAppAppDelegate.m : #import "MyAppAppDelegate.h" #import "RootViewController.h" #import "MyGlobalVariables.h" #import "MyWebServiceExample.h" #import "Soap+Href.h" #import "SoapRequest+Certificate.h" #import "CBMayaIPhoneUser+AllString.h" #import "objc/runtime.h" I tested my categories too and they work, I can call the category methods from a 'originalClass' object. I suppose I'm doing something wrong, but I can't see what... Or maybe class_getClassMethod is indeed supposed to work only for class level methods ? Ho and last thing, Im developing on the simulator, not the device :) Any thought is welcome ! Thanks P.B
