asp.net and HTTP compression - shared hosting

What are my options when it comes to implementing page compression is asp.net.Right now I have a custom home grown httpmodule and its not very mature. Google links me to MbCompression . The project has few views and downloads which discourages me a bit. Edit: I am under shared hosting, which limits my access to IIS settings
