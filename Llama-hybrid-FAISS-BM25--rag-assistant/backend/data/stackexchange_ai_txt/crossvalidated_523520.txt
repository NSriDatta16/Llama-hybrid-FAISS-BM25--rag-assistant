Best models to relate a frequent point process and a rare point process

I want to relate two processes and understand their cause-and-effect relationship. The first process is a point process with frequent occurrences (more than 90%) and has support [0,1] and truncated Exponential distribution, the second process is a point process with rare occurrences (less than 0.01%) and support [0, $\infty$ ] and Exponential distribution. A) If both processes were such as the first process I would discard the non-occurrences or put them to zero and estimate a VAR model (results would be biased but the bias would be limited), but I can't do this with the second process because I would remain with too few observations or too many zeros (it already has occurrences where the value of the observation is zero and they are not the same thing as a non-occurrence, I would bias the results too much). B) If both processes were such as the second process I would estimate a Hawkes model, but it is not appropriate for the first process because Hawkes models are not suitable for frequent processes. I tried, and indeed the outcome is an unstable process (spectral radius of the branching matrix not smaller than one) and I think this is due to the too many occurrences of the continuous process. Actually I have one frequent process and two rare processes but I tried to make the question simple. The estimated branching matrix is: 0.35 0.25 0.0001 0.20 0.34 0.0002 -0.25 -4.64 1.01 and the resulting spectral radius is 1.01. C) I estimated a logistic regression linking the probability of the occurrences of the first process to the occurrences of the second process, but in this way I can't consider the effect of the values of the second process. D) I estimated a logistic regression linking the probability of the occurrences of the first process to the values of the second process, putting to zero the non-occurrences of the second process, but the results are obviously biased as I explained above. E) I estimated a logistic regression linking the probability of the occurrences of the second process to the occurrences of the first process, but in this way I can't consider the effect of the values of the first process. F) I estimated a logistic regression linking the probability of the occurrences of the second process to the values of the first process, putting to zero the non-occurrences of the first process, the results should be biased but not too much. So far, it seems to me that, perhaps except for point F), all ways I considered are too problematic. I would appreciate suggestions on how to proceed.
