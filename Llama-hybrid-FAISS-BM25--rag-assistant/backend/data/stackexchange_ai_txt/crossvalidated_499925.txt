Does state-Action Value function depends on environment's dynamics?

Reading the book by Sutton & Barto on Reinforcement Learning, I found the following: The optimal action- value function allows optimal actions to be selected without having to know anything about possible successor states and their values, that is, without having to know anything about the environmentâ€™s dynamics. Page 65 Why is the case that the state-action value function does not depend on the dynamics of the system?
