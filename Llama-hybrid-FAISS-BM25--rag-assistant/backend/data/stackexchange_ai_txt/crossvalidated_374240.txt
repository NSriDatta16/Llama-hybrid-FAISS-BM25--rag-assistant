Calculating variance and standard deviation of continuous time series

I am trying to calculate the variance and standard deviation of an unevenly spaced continuous time series. Example data: Time Value 0 0 1000 1 2000 2 3000 3 5000 4 Where Time is the duration since the start of the time series. Duration between points is not guaranteed to be uniform. Value s are continuous, e.g. the temperature measured throughout a day. The arithmetic mean is weighted by Time , resulting in a mean for this example data being 2.3 How do I calculate the variance and standard deviation of Value in a continuous unevenly spaced time series?
