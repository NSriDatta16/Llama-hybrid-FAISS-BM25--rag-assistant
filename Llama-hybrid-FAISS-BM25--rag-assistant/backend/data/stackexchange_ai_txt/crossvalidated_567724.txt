Can I transform a parameter's posterior to a different parametrization?

I have a model with several parameters. I apply Bayesian inference with a uniform prior for all of the parameters. After the process is finished, I realize that I need one of those parameters $x$ parametrized as its logarithm: $$y = log(x/a)$$ where $a$ is a constant. As far as I understand, a uniform prior in $x$ is a very much non-uniform prior in $y$ . Can I transform the posterior I got using a uniform prior in $x$ into a posterior with a uniform prior in $y$ ?
