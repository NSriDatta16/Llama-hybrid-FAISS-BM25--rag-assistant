The regex approach seems efficient and elegant enough. Of course, you'll have to watch out for unescaped characters when building the expression, or a failure to compile it because of complexity or size limitations. Another way to do this would be to construct a trie data structure to represent all the acronyms (this may somewhat duplicate what the regex matcher is doing). As you step through each character in the string, you would create a new pointer to the root of the trie, and advance existing pointers to the appropriate child (if any). You get a match when any pointer reaches a leaf.
