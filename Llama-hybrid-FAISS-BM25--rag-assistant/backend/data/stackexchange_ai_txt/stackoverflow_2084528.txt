Unless this is a homework assignment and you're forced to go through all the loopy madness, there's surely an easier way with jQuery to accomplish whatever you're trying to do... jQuery has a pretty robust set of selectors that will allow you to just select and return a collection of all of a specified type of element within a page or element (ex. all of the paragraph tags in a given div tag). They'll be returned to you in the order they appear in the DOM (which is pretty much what you get with the above). Alternatively, you can use a filter like suggested above. If you need to do this in some specific order, then I would suggest using selectors or filters to grab the element you want to start at and then loop through its children recursively. jQuery has a built in function to return the children of a given element. http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/filter#expr http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/children#expr
