Variation partitioning in vegan. Do variables need to be centered?

I would like to carry out variation partitioning to see how landscape variables and local variables contribute to variation in species richness. Do I need to centre my data prior to analysis? Furthermore, my local variables are largely dummy coded factors (0|1) how do I approach this?
