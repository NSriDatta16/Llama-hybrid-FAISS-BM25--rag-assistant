If what you want to do is click on an image, lift it above the others and then drag it, consider placing them in ImageIcons and these in JLabels, and displaying them in a JLayeredPane, or a JPanel that is held in a JLayeredPane. You can then lift the clicked label onto the JLayeredPane.DRAG_LAYER while dragging, and then drop it down into the DEFAULT_LAYER (or on a JPanel that's on the DEFAULT_LAYER) when done. For an example of this, please see my code in a related question: dragging a jlabel around the screen If I'm totally off base, sorry, but please correct my incorrect assumptions.
