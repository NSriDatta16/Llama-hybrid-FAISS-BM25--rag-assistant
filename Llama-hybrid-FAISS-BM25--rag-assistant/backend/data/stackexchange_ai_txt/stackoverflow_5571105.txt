Only Agent user type has rights to create and download App ID, certificate, and provisioning profiles . Edited: due to comments from peers:- The Admin user type can only create developer provisioning profile but cannot create distribution ( Adhoc or App Store ) provisioning profile. However Member user type can only see or download these things. They can't see any option to create or add new. So, you need to assign Admin role to the new user in order to allow him to create developer provisioning profile .
