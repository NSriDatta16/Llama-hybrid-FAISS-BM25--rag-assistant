Rails action caching question

I'm not quite sure how to ensure my caching is working, but I'm pretty sure it's not. I have a users controller with an index action that I'm action caching until a new user is created. Here's the code: UsersController Now, in my logs when I access the index action, I see: Cached fragment hit: views/localhost:3000/users (0.0ms) Filter chain halted as [# # , :if=>nil, :unless=>nil}, @method=# >] did_not_yield. I'm not sure what the filter chain halted ... did_not_yield is all about and I also see that that select * from users ... is getting called each time, which is not what I expected. Can someone enlighten me as to what's going on here and why this isn't behaving as I would expect? ie. why the User.all would be running when that whole action's output should have been cached ?
