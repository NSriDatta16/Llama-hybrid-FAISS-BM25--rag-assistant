Bias-variance trade-off in case of biased estimators: is the bias zero?

Consider a data generating process (DGP) that is AR(1): $y_t=\varphi_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$ with $\varepsilon_t\sim i.i.D(0,\sigma^2)$ for some distribution $D$ with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ . Consider a model that coincides with the DGP up to parameter values that are unknown and need to be estimated from a sample time series. The parameters will be estimated by conditional least squares (CLS), a fairly standard estimator of autoregressive models. Consider the decomposition of the expected squared prediction error at a point $y_{t-1}=c$ for some $c\in R$ into squared bias, variance and irreducible error? Is the bias zero?
