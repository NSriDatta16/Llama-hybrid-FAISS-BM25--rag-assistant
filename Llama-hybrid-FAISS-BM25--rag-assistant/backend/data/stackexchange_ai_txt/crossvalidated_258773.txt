How to solve this Q-Learning Algorithm question?

What I have so far, is this: State 0 : A, A, B, B, C, C, Direction : left, right, left, right, left, right State 1 : A, B, A, C, B, C Initial value : 0 0 0 0 0 0 So, as you can see, I have made a list before I get into the states. My next step is to do t1, which tells me to go from state A to the right... When I put that in the formula, my teacher said to do: t1:Q(a,r) t1:Q(a,r) Question: what max is he talking about? The max of what? After step 1, he does step 2. This tells us: t2, from state B, move right. (reset) So now, what he does, is: t2:Q(b,r) This is what I get, but I still don't know what the max is about... And after he is finished, he gets this state: State 0 : A, A, B, B, C, C, Direction : left, right, left, right, left, right State 1 : A, B, A, C, B, C Values : 0 0.9 0 1 0 0 I don't understand why he changes A,R to 0.9 And B,R to 1 Can someone please explain me how I should do this? I couldn't find anything relevant on the net to solve this, that's why I am asking it here.
