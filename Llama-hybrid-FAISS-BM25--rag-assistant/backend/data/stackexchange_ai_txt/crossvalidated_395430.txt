I think that the existing answers, which are very good, might be enhanced by an example with discrete random variables. We have $$ p(x_{new} \mid x_1, \ldots x_n) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x_{new},\mu \mid x_1, \ldots x_n)d\mu = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x_{new}\mid \mu) \ p(\mu \mid x_1, \ldots x_n)d\mu $$ To simplify, consider a $\mu$ that is binary: $p(\mu = 1 \mid x_1 \dots x_n) = p$ and $p(\mu = 0 \mid x_1 \dots x_n) = 1-p$ . Suppose further that $x_{new}$ is binary with $p(X=1)=\mu-1$ and $p(X=0)=\mu$ . I won't use these probabilities going forward, but you can see that $x_{new}$ depends on $\mu$ . Say we then draw 14 samples using $\mu \sim p(\mu \mid x_1,\dots, x_n)$ and $x_{new} \sim p(x_{new} \mid \mu )$ . We get the following. As mentioned by @jbowman, we are actually sampling from $p(x_{new}, \mu \mid x_1 \dots x_n)$ . mu x_new 1. 1 0 2. 1 1 3. 0 0 4. 1 1 5. 0 0 6. 0 0 7. 0 0 8. 1 1 9. 1 1 10. 0 1 11. 1 0 12. 1 1 13. 0 1 14. 1 1 We can illustrate the fact that we are sampling from the joint $p(x_{new}, \mu \mid x_1,\dots, x_n)$ more explicitly by first constructing a table of counts. x_new 0 1 ----------- 0 6 1 mu 1 2 5 Dividing each entry by the total (6 + 1 + 2 +5 = 14) gives x_new 0 1 ----------- 0 0.43 0.07 mu 1 0.14 0.36 Which is the empirical joint distribution. Eg, our estimate of $p(x_{new}=0, \mu=0)=.43$ . Hence our sampling procedure has given us the joint. Finally, we will see why it is actually necessary to "evaluate" the integral (although not to average out the integral). This is implicit in @jbowman's answer when they said It's not altogether intuitive, but, by ignoring the sampled values of , you are integrating over it. To obtain $p(x_{new} \mid x_1 \dots x_n)$ , we simply sum over rows. x_new 0 1 ----------- .57 .43 This is what's implied by "ignoring the sampled values of $\mu$ " and this is the marginalization step. Another way this is commonly done is by constructing a histogram (by summing over rows, we have kind of constructed a histogram here). So, the sampling procedure does not give us the marginal - in other words, it doesn't "work" according to your definition in the question. Rather, it gives us the joint, and we commonly (by ignoring $\mu$ , by constructing a histogram, or by getting quantiles) marginalize over $\mu$ .
