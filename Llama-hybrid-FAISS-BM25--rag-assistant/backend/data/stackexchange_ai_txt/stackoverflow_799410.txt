Updated Fixed type. Thanks j_radom_hacker for bringing this to my attention! [EDIT: Actually the type here was not correct -- see Robert S. Barnes' answer for the correct type to use.] Figure out the type of shape1 and shape2 first: typedef int (*shape_array_t)[5]; Now use this: shape_array_t sat[] = { shape1, shape2 };
