Which ML algorithm suits best for discrete input data

Let suppose I have discrete inputs like below and I have to predict which insurance package(among 12 packages) suits best. age occupation(one in 30 categories) credit rating(0 to 20) number of accidents I have been thinking to use NN, but as I have very diverse set of inputs does really $f(wx + b)$ at a neuron can trace proper prediction? If Yes then which activation function I have to choose? And I also had thought about SVM but one of my colleague said that SVM's may not do best at multi-class labeling, is this correct?
