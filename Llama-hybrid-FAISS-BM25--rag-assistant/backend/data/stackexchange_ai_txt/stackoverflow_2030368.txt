Drupal automatic glossary for specific terms

Greetings all helpers! I have been reading and testing Drupal features recently and I find this CMS very scalable and interesting. I began working with themes, views, content types and ect... but I am looking for something I cannot find on the internet. Context : I am creating a new website for one non-profit organization of mine for the 10th anniversary. Mainly, this site is for a game that has different abilities within it's rules. I would like to create a glossary for the different abilities. That is not a great challenge. This is what I want to archive : With this glossary, I would like to like to the ability description each time it is encountered in a content. Ability glossary (list) : http://conflitseternels.net/index.php?id=habiletes Each time one ability is encountered in the content, it links to it's description. If you can guide me through the accomplishment of this ask, I would be greatly happy ! Thank you, Will
