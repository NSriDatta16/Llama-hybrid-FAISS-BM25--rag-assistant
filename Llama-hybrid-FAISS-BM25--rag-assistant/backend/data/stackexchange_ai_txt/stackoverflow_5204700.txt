UI data is managed best with Classes like TransferObjects are ModelObjects which represent the page data binding requirements. If we do that we can move the concern to the controller to extract out the spring (persistent) objects from the UI object. If the object is called PassportForm then the method passportForm.person() and passportForm.Passport() should give you the persistent object. In this way we can also eliminate the need for transformer/validator classes and push the behavior into the objects.
