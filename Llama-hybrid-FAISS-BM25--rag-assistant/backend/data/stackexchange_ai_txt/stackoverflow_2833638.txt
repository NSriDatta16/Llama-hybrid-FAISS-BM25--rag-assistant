You need to add all columns referenced in the SELECT list or in the ORDER BY into a GROUP BY clause. SELECT count(distinct req.requirementid), req.requirementid, org.organizationid, req.locationofposting, org.registereddate FROM OrganizationRegisteredDetails AS org, RequirementsDetailsforOrganization AS req WHERE org.organizationid = req.requirementid GROUP BY req.requirementid, org.organizationid, req.locationofposting, org.registereddate ORDER BY org.RegisteredDate desc Although in this case, you'll only get the value 1 in the first column in all rows since you're grouping on req.requirementid!
