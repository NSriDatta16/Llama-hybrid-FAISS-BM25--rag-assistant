FYI the best way with prototype to assign a unique ID to an element without an ID is to use: $('element').identify(); In the context of what you're doing, personally i would make use of Prototype's Template functionality which would convert the code to something like this: var myTemplate = new Template(' '+ ' '+ 'Ingredient '+ ' '+ ' '+ ' '); function addIngredient(){ ingredientCount ++; var vals = {num: ingredientCount}; var htmlstr = myTemplate.evaluate(vals); $('ingredients_list').insert(htmlstr) } Nothing at all wrong with Justin's code, just to show that theres always many ways to achieve the same thing. In your case there is only one variable to manipulate but because templates allow for multiple replacements they can be a much more elegant solution that multiple regexp replacements.
