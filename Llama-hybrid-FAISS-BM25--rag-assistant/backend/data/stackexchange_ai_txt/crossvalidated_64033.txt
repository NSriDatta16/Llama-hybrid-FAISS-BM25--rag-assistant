How do I estimate the $e_t$ from a moving average model?

I have an ARIMA(0,2,1) model. How do i estimate the $\hat{e}_t$ component of the model. I have read a whole lot of theories that confuses me the more. Is there any practical way of estimating this $\hat{e}_t$? Does R offer any help to that too? I know that my ARIMA(0,2,1) model can be written as $Y_{t} = 2Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2} + e_{t} + \theta e_{t-1}$. I want to forecast 1-time ahead into the future. In that case, my forecast equation is given as $\hat Y_{t}(1) = 2Y_{t} -Y_{t-1} + \theta \hat e_{t}$. I know my value for $ Y_{t} =7.8$ and $ Y_{t-1} =7.8 $. I know my value of \theta as -0.6816, which i obtained from my R output. My problem now is, how do i determine the value for my $\hat e_{t} $ so i could find $ \hat Y_{t}(1)$? I have an R code that gives me all these forecasts though, but i want to know how R generated my first forecast and how it found the estimate for $\hat e_{t} $. Thanks for looking!
