The NOAA site has the Moana Loa observatory atmospheric CO2 data directly downloadable as text at ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt - no scraping needed. After removing a few "-99.99" values for "average CO2" that are stated to represent missing data I was easily able to perform an equation search on just over 350 known, named equations with three or less fitted parameters. The search purpose was to find an equation that both fit well and should also extrapolate well due to simplicity. My equation search turned up the Standard Vapor Pressure equation "CO2 = exp(a + (b/year) + c*log(year))" as an excellent candidate, with parameters a = -1.9342529555687474E+03, b = 4.3355326963670307E+05 and c = 2.2673459584210687E+02 yielding RMSE = 2.216 and R-squared = 0.993, here is error plot of this fit with extrapolation of this equation to the year 2040.
