McDowell gave the "standard" answer of using Ant to insert the version number into a Java file and/or classpath resource. However, I've never liked that approach. An alternative, one that leverages Java's "it's ready to run as soon as it's compiled" behavior, is to give your Version class a main() : public class Version { public final static int MAJOR = 1; public final static int MINOR = 0; public final static int PATCH = 0; public final static String VERSION_STRING = MAJOR + "." + MINOR + "." + PATCH; public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception { System.out.println(VERSION_STRING); } } You would then invoke this with Ant's task, saving the output in a property.
