ASP.NET MVC - Is it even possible to have multiple MVC projects on the same server?

I'm having so many problems getting more than 1 MVC project up and running on the same server... I'm using a Windows XP system running the default IIS (5.1 I believe). At this moment I'm even building WebSetup projects for every project I create to make sure everything goes well, while these projects could very easily be deployed using XCopy. Bottom line, I can get a MVC project (e.g. ContactManager example) running at: http://servername , OR http://servername/ContactManager . But as soon as I have a project at both locations the horror starts "title is not a member of ViewPage" -> yeah, right... Section or group name 'system.web.extensions' is already defined. -> sure let me or that one, oh that's not valid... Is it even possible to have more than 1 ASP.NET MVC project (application) running on the same Windows XP machine? http://server/ Root project (MVC) http://server/app1 Application 1 (MVC) http://server/app2 Application 2 (MVC) http://server/appX Application X (MVC) Can somebody name some points of attention or something?
