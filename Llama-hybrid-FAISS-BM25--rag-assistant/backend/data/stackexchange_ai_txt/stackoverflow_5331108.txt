Depending on what you inner item is, there are various approaches. If it's a block-level element (a paragraph, a div, etc.), it will automatically adjust itself to fill 100% of the container's width. If it's an inline element, too bad for you, it won't accept width:100% until you convert it to a block-level element: display:block . Floated elements are a special case: they will only span to the width of their inner content, even if they're block level elements. They require width:100% . Absolutely positioned elements are even tougher: they need width:100% , but the container also needs a positioning context, eg. position:relative . Examples of all four cases: http://jsfiddle.net/dD7E4/
