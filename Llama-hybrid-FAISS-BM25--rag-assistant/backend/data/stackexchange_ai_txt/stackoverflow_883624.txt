See the "Defaults routes and default parameters" section of the ActionController::Routing documentation. You can program into your routes arbitrary extra parameters you would like sent to your controller. Looking at the request URI will force you to keep routes and controllers in sync, which will make your code more fragile and less easily re-used. Avoid if you possibly can.
