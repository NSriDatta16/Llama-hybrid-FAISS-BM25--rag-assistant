How to implement an application-wide strategy to force text to upper case?

I am using .Net (C#, WinForms, Linq to SQL, SQL Server 2008) to develop a new line-of-business application that will replace a crufty old Foxpro application. I did not write the old app, but do provide support for it, and I am the in-house developer for the new app. One of the design decisions that was made years ago with the Foxpro app was to force all entered text to be uppercase. This was to ensure that all text has a uniform format for sales reports, mailing lists, etc. A current topic of conversation between me and some of the users, is whether this should be continued in the new app. It looks likely that it will be continued. My question is, what is the best strategy to make this happen, involving the least amount of my time as possible? It feels like a real drag to always have to remember to set the CharacterCasing property of every. single. textbox. that I drop onto a form. And it appears that DataGridViews don't even have a simple property to set; you have manually handle CellChanged events, etc. How would you do it?
