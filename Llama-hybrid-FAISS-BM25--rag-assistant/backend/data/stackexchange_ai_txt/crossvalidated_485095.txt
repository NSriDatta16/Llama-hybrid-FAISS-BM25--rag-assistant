It seems you are looking for a way to summarize opinions (expressed on answers to several questions) of each person into a single score. The first instinct might be to take each subject's average score, but that would treat ordinal categorical Likert data as numerical, which is at best controversial. My first suggestion would be to use each subject's median score is the subjects summary response. Your proposed manipulation of each subject's responses results in one of three categories L/M/H for each subject's summary response. Any method of summarizing data for each individual will result in loss of some information. Not knowing the number of questions each subject answers or knowing how you would treat occasional unanswered questions in determining subjects' summary scores, it is hard to say which method is better (median or L/M/H). My guess is that 'median' loses less information. For example, a profoundly dissatisfied employee might give you five never s, which I suppose you would code as L , thus somewhat diluting the strength of the subject's dissatisfaction. Not sure from your description which L/M/H category would result from two never s and three rarely s. I am sure the median of that is rarely . In the end it is clear that L/M/H gives you only three ordinal satisfaction categories, whereas medians could potentially give you more detail (spanning values from 1 through 5 , with some possible npn-integer summaries depending on the number of questions each subject answers). I can't say how much truly relevant information your L/M/H system would lose. It's your project and so you get to say how to summarize. (With whatever disclosure you want to provide in your report/paper.) But at the very least I'd like to urge you to look at several dozen subject-- enough to get good intuition whether the L/M/H summaries are doing what you expected/desired of them. Finally, I am not sure what kind of tests you will use in your final analysis of your data. In my experience, what kind of summary score is used for individuals can make a difference whether significant effects are found. I suspect that the controversial (and I believe often indefensible) use of averages for ordinal data persists precisely because it is thought more likely to yield "significant" results than medians. I have no basis for judging the results from your L/M/H summary scores. The point is that the method of summarizing sometimes does matter in the final interpretation of Likert data.
