GCC: Compile to assembly with clarified correspondence to code?

When you break into the debugger in VS and open the disassembly window, each assembly fragment is displayed below it's corresponding code section (more or less). GCC with -S outputs only the stripped down assembly. Is there an option in GCC to show some correspondence to the original code? Source code is C++.
