You could perhaps do with specifying what you're using? What are your "pages" in for a start? What is your data storage method? It sounds like you are muddling displaying your data with storing your data? There is no obligation to show data just because it exists. Your object domain should almost certainly just have products. The data storage would be set up such that the properties are nullable, and check for nulls to get the data back. If you're using something like Linq, you can simply do something like var productsWithoutRating = Context.Products.Where(p => p.Rating == nothing); The dictionary idea, inheritance, and composition all seem a bit wierd. Storing a separate boolean telling you whether a property exists is messy, and would be a nightmare to maintain - just check whether it exists on the fly.
