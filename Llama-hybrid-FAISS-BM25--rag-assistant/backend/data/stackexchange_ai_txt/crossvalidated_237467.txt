This answer is set in the context of economic time series. Many economic time series exhibit a relatively stable seasonal pattern that is caused by recurrent events such as weather, holidays, etc. As we are often interested in longer patterns (trend and business cycle), the seasonal pattern is considered some noise to be removed from the data. For example, in August, we expect a decay in the Industrial Production Index because in this month most companies are workers are on holidays. The relevant question is not why the IPI has decreased but how much of the decrease (if any) is due to the overall economic situation, i.e., the business cycle. Seasonally adjusted data are provided in order to make this kind of analysis easier. Unless we want to study the seasonal component itself, seasonality is a nuisance element that masks the cycles we are interested in and makes the selection and estimation of a model more complex . Edit: I will stick to the first part of the previous paragraph; the second one is not necessarily true. For example, Gómez and Maravall (2001) [1] show a case where the autocorrelation function of the seasonally adjusted series is more complex (contain non-zero values at large lags) than that for the original series. They advise against modelling seasonally adjusted data. Therefore, rather than being a kind of auxiliary data to simplify the statistical analysis, it is safer to use seasonally adjusted data when they are the variable of interest (e.g., for interpretation of the economic situation, etc., as mentioned before and in the answer by @PeterEllis).

Disclaimer: Seasonal adjustment methods may not always be ideally suited to the data. In particular, as far as I know, the official seasonal adjustment methods assume that the trend-cycle and the seasonal components are independent of each other. This assumption may not always be correct. There is some literature showing that the seasonal pattern is not as stable as it is often assumed; and it changes precisely due to the fact that the business cycle affects the seasonal pattern. Canova and Ghysels (1994) [1] and Franses (1996, Chapter 6) [2]. An illuminating example is given in Franses (1996), who finds significant seasonality in the Consumer Confidence Index. The CCI is a survey where consumers are asked about their financial situation end expectations over the last 12 and the next 12 months. As the questions are related to the general economic situation, we wouldn't expect that the answer will be affected by the month where the consumer was interviewed. However, in this analysis a seasonal pattern was detected. Maybe people tend to be more positive in summer. Whatever the reason, this suggests that the economic agents may have difficulties in removing seasonality when making their decisions; this may in turn create a link or relationship between the trend-cycle and the seasonal components.
