Pass a value between views

I have a list of items of the same type (let's say guests) and i display them in a listview. By clicking on the line I would be able to edit the single element. All the elements have the same editing mask, so i would like to call the same page and pass a parameter. The only solution that i found it's: Element 32 But actually I update the edit view on beforepageshow so in this case I have 2 different methods that run independently to archive this goal. I was wondering if there is an elegant solution. Thanks, Cesare
