in the vimrc: " pressing F5 adds two spaces at beginning of line and goes to next line inoremap :s/\(.*\)/ \1/e :set nohlsearch ji " also works when not in edit mode map i " F6 removes two spaces from the end of whitespace at the beginning of line inoremap :s/\(^\s*\)/\1/e :set nohlsearch ji map i To remove 2 spaces from the beginning of every line of a paragraph just press F5 through all its lines. This is modeled after my keybindings for commenting and uncommenting C code (the difference is in the regex of course) only drawback is it needs to disable search highlight since the regex matches damn near the entire document all the time.
