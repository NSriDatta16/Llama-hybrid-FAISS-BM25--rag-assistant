Spring MVC offers a very easy way to change "Themes" on the fly based on the HttpServletRequest - so you could conceivably have a standard Theme and then another "handheld" Theme which is activated based on the user-agent. The Spring MVC library then allows you to use different CSS files, different whatever, in your view layer based on the current request's theme. However if you aren't currently using Spring MVC it may not be worth the hassle to migrate your application to it. On the other hand, you could simply have your JSP render a different tag based on the user-agent to use different CSS files based on conditional logic. If your application is architected well and you have the logic about setting HTML headers and the CSS includes in a single place, it should be easy enough to add this logic in just one place and have it apply everywhere.
