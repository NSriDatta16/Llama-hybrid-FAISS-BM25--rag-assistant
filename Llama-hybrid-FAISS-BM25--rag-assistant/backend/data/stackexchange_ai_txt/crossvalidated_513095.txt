How can I use Propensity Scores to adjust for survey non-response bias?

Say I estimate the probability that each member of my target population responds to a survey using propensity scores. I am having a hard time finding a clear explanation of how I can use the propensity scores to adjust a continuous outcome of interest, $y$ . My current understanding is that I can compute a weighted mean of $y$ where the weights are the inverted propensity scores. Is that what is typically done? Or should the propensity scores somehow be leveraged in a regression model to estimate the population $\bar{y}$ ?
