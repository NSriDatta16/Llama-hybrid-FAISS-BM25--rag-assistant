Formal way to test what kind of differencing is necessary?

I'm working on a project that concerns time series data for South-Africa. My series has 34 explanatory variables and only (!) 30 yearly observations. The analysis is meant to be high-dimensional, hence I chose to have p>n. My y-dependent variable is the under-5-mortality-rate and I have collected 34 explanatory variables ranging from HIV infection/immunization data to school enrolment. For my analysis, I was wondering whether there exists a formal way to test whether your time series data needs a dif(log) transformation, or dif() transformation? As I only have 30 observations, I don't really have much changing variance over time. Besides, most of my series seem to show a clear trend (either up- or downwards) as Kenya has developed (?) quite well over the past 30 years. Thanks!
