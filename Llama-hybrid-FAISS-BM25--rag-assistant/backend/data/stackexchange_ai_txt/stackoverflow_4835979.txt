Grouping Logical Operators (Multiple Sets of Conditions) in a do {} while () loop?

I currently have the following loop: do { checkedWord = articleWords.Dequeue().TrimEnd('?', '.', ',', '!'); correct = _spellChecker.CheckWord(checkedWord); } while (correct && articleWords.Count > 0); I am queuing up the words from an array that was split from a textbox with ' ' as the separator. The loop works fine, except for I don't want any blank entries "" or really anything non alpha-numeric to stop the loop. Currently if there's more than one space between the words then the loop ends and it continues on to get word suggestions from the spellchecker. If I do while (correct && articleWords.Count > 0 || checkedWord == ""); then it'll skip any blank queue entries, but it still hangs up on things like new lines - so if the textbox that it loads from contains a couple of paragraphs it screws up at the newline separating the two. I've also tried while (correct && articleWords.Count > 0 || !Char.IsLetterOrDigit(checkedWord, 0)); but that also doesn't work. Question 1 : Can you group conditions like (statement1 == true && count > 0) || (statement1 == false && Char.IsLetterOrDigit(char)) ? - Meaning that all of the conditions in the first grouping must be met OR all of the conditions in the second set must be. Question 2 : I want my loop to continue progressing until an actual spelling error is found, and for it to ignore things like empty queue entries, as well as anything that's not an alpha-numeric character at the beginning of the string. I suspect that I'm close with the Char.IsLetterOrDigit bit, but have to figure out how to do it correctly. Let me know if more info is required. Thanks!
