Simple vs. Composite Hypothesis Question

I am looking at one of the questions in the qualifying exam, where a multiple logistic regression model is being fitted, where the response is about dying. The question says that there are multiple potential risk factors such as age, gender, smoking, etc., and they have to be controlled for simultaneously. One of the questions asked to assess the statistical significance of smoking. Specifically, we have to show the null hypothesis and tell if this is a simple hypothesis. So, I know that for the null hypothesis, the coefficient estimate for smoking is equal to 0 (smoking is not statistically significant). But my answer key says that it is a composite hypothesis. I am confused. I thought this was a simple hypothesis, as it testing if it is equal to zero. Is this because multiple predictors have to be controlled simultaneously? What will make it a simple hypothesis?
