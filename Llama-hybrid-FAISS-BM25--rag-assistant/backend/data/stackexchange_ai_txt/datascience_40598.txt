How to tune parameters for Time Series Analysis, when forecasting is only dominated by one feature and error is not getting reduced?

I am trying to predict time series based on 150 features. When I plot correlation of these features, I am getting 20 features with more or less importance but every model I use, it is completely dominated by only one feature which is competently in sync with predicted output but not actual output . Please refer to the image below. The green line is prediction which is completely in sync with one of the feature.And for every valley in actual output, I am getting 2 valleys in predicted output. No model is able to generalize this. Is it the case of bad data for model?
