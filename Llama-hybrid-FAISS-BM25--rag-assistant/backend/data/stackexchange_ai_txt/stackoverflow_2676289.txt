Could you just do: var newList = List2.Union (List1).ToList(); .. as reversing them will probably give you the ones you need? EDIT: That apparently doesn't work. Sorry, I didn't test it, it was just a first reaction to the problem. How about, using the reversed notation above, but then calling List.Sort() to get them back in the order you want? It assumes that you have a property to order by, but you could even artifically create one if someone doesn't come up with a more elegant solution.
