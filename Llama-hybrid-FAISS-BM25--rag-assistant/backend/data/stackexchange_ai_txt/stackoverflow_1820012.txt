Magento: Display sub-category list

I'm building a Magento store and want to be able to display a list of categories and have each category link to its own page. I have a 'Brands' category with an ID of 42 and I want to display a list of the sub-categories and ensure that each one links to the designated URL key in the CMS. Has anyone had experience of doing this with Magento?
