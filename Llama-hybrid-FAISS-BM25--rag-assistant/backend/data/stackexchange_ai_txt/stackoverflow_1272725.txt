The answer to your question depends on the complexity of the application involved and the knowledge of the developer(s) involved; a developer with extensive knowledge in Java put to work on a Ruby application is going to be much slower and vice versa. One of the selling points of RnR is that development is supposed to be faster, so asking which one is faster while not considering all of the other variables that impact your decision is a loaded question. Java development may have higher development costs but there are reasons why people absorb those costs. The tools you leverage shouldn't be used because development is "faster" or "easier" if it conflicts with what the requirements are asking you to do.
