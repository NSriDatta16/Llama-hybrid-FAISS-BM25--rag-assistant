This is a big question with no right answer. A lot depends on your audience and field. The fact that you are citing Baltagi suggests you might be in the econ area. If so, you are going to have a hard time convincing colleagues/readers that random effects are appropriate unless you want to do something that absolutely cannot be done in a fixed effects model. Estimating the effect of time-invariant or firm-invariant predictors is an example of something that is a no-go in fixed effects models. But many in the econ audience probably would argue that you can't trust those effects anyway because of endogeneity (correlations between level-2 covariates and the random intercepts). Note that you can get around this problem and estimate firm effects if you have an even higher level of nesting. Let's say firms are nested within countries. By including the country-specific means of the firm variables in the random intercepts model, these firm-level predictors become within-firms effects. This is a known way to get around lower-level endogeneity in random effects models, which was elaborated upon by Mundlak (1978). One thing you should be careful about is including firm and year fixed effects in the same model. Recent methodological work shows that models like this ("two-way fixed effects") have some problems. See work by Kropko & Kubinec ( 2020 ) and Imai & Kim ( 2021 ). Note that within a random effects model where firm is the level-2 cluster variable, you could easily include time fixed effects (0/1 indicator variables for each year of data). But in random effects models, time is often treated continuously and included as a random slope, especially if the trend in the outcome is systematic and varies across firms. This is known as a growth curve model. References Mundlak, Y. 1978. On the pooling of time series and cross section data. Econometrica 46: 69â€“85
