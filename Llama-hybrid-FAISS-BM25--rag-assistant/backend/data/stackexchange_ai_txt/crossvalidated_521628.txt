They are unobservable, just like errors in a regression model. You can estimate them, again just like in a regression model. Estimation of ARMA models is done via maximum likelihood, frequently via state-space representation and Kalman filtering. A good description of ARMA estimation is available Hamilton "Time Series Analysis" and other time series textbooks (and probably some threads on Cross Validated; search for estimation and ARIMA ).
