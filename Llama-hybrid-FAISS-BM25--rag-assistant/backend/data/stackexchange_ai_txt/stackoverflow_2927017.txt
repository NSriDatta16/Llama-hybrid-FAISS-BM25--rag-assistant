Slow insert speed in Postgresql memory tablespace

I have a requirement where I need to store the records at rate of 10,000 records/sec into a database (with indexing on a few fields). Number of columns in one record is 25. I am doing a batch insert of 100,000 records in one transaction block. To improve the insertion rate, I changed the tablespace from disk to RAM.With that I am able to achieve only 5,000 inserts per second. I have also done the following tuning in the postgres config: Indexes : no fsync : false logging : disabled Other information: Tablespace : RAM Number of columns in one row : 25 (mostly integers) CPU : 4 core, 2.5 GHz RAM : 48 GB I am wondering why a single insert query is taking around 0.2 msec on average when database is not writing anything on disk (as I am using RAM based tablespace). Is there something I am doing wrong? Help appreciated. Prashant
