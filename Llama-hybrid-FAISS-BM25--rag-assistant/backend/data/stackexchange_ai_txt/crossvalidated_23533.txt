It is the same as with ordinal variables -- the algorithm goes from the minimal to a maximal value present in the attributes as a candidate for a threshold and selects best. This can be elegantly speed-up to linear complexity using presorting. Because of that randomForest simply converts ordered factors to numerical values for predictors and to categorical data in case of decision.
