Updated as you said here , I'll update this question too: I disagree. It is working ;) Tested on Firefox 4.0b6 I can confirm the following code works at least under Firefox 4.0b6 (Taken from my own answer ) Test p::-moz-selection, input::-moz-selection, textarea::-moz-selection { color: red; background-color: grey; } This paragraph is selection-aware. And this textarea, as well It may not be wroking programmatically, if you are not careful with what you are doing. Maybe you are trying to select something with jQuery.select() and you are selecting the textarea object instead of its content.
