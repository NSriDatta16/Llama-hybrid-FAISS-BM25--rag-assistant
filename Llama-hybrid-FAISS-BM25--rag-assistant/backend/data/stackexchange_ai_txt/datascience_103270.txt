How does TensorFlow handle multiple samples?

Say the mini-batch has $N$ samples $(x, y)$ , how will tensorflow utilize this $N$ samples to train the network. Will it do $N$ forward loop for each sample independently? Will it do $N$ backward propagation and $N$ weights update for each sample independently? Or will it average the loss from $N$ samples and then do only 1 weights update?
