Magento started showing PHP language errors since I downloaded the blank theme using Connect

I used the Magento Connect downloader to install the blank theme extension, but I did not switch to it as I was unable to access any-page anymore. Instead, it started showing php errors for front-end and Magento generated security errors for admin. Frontend Error: Fatal error: Call to a member function toHtml() on a non-object in D:\xampp\htdocs\newpinch\app\code\core\Mage\Core\Model\Layout.php on line 529 Admin error on Log-in: There has been an error processing your request Exception printing is disabled by default for security reasons. Error log record number: 1608724822 Link to the theme extension I installed. I didn't even change the theme from the default, can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong. I just installed the theme and then clicked on "Return to admin" in Magento Connect but it was unable to go instead started refreshed the Magento Connect page, only this time without any CSS styling. The only page that still appears correctly is the admin log-in page. Please help me, I have already tried the forums at magentocommerce.com and their community sucks. 0 views & 0 replies. please help...
