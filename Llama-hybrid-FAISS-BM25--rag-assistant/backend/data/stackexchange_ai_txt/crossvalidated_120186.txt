What is the commonly used conjugate distribution for this type of problem

I have in mind a Bayesian Learning model . The idea of the model is described as the following. The probability of an event ( A ) happening is P . P depends on observables X and parameters $\beta$. For instance , $P=\frac{exp(\beta X)}{exp(\beta X)+1}$.Each time when the event A happens , the belief about $\beta$ is updated. My question is : is there a commonly used conjugate distribution for these type of bayesian learnings. Can you give me some references that dealt with similar problems. Update : The event is multinomial. I understand the Dirichlet distribution is used as the prior . But this problem goes one step further. It's not simply updating the probability of each event , but updating the parameter values of the underlying causes. The model is the following : Agents make one decision each period , smoke or not, $d$. Smoking history is summarized using one variable , $A$ . Health is determined by the arrival of several smoking related diseases. Agents have prior about the parameters in the probability function of the arrival of the diseases on the smoking stock. In each period, after seeing diseases arrival, the belief about the parameters are updated.
