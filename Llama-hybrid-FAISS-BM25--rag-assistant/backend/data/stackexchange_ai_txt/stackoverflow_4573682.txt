Threading and pcap issues

I have a GUI program that allows a user a scan a network, the issue is that when the pcap_loop function is called, my GUI program becomes unresponsive.(the pcap_loop blocks the current thread). When i try to use pthreads, i got a SIGSEGV fault at the pcap_loop function.Why?It's as if the thread can't see the procPacket function itself. void procPacket(u_char *arg, const struct pcap_pkthdr *pkthdr, const u_char *packet) { //show packets here } void* pcapLooper(void* param) { pcap_t* handler = (pcap_t*) param; pcap_loop(handler, 900 ,procPacket, NULL ); } //some function that runs when a button is pressed //handler has been opened through pcap_open_live pthread_t scanner; int t = pthread_create(&scanner,NULL,&pcapLooper, &handler ); if(t) { std::cout
