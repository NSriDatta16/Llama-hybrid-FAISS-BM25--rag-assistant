As stated in one of the pages you link to , when using a cluster then you don't need extra configuration to get this to work. If you need load balancing etc. I'd imagine it is easier to set up a cluster up than doing it manually. sun-web.xml goes right next to web.xml in WEB-INF if you deploy it as a web project in .war file. I would think you should be able to get it right using: http://glassfish.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html#cross-appserverremoteref and http://glassfish.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html#mappingRemoteejbdependency I would have thought there must be an easy way to configure a EJB connector or Resource adaptor in glassfish itself using the administration console or editing the server.xml. But I can't find such a thing now.
