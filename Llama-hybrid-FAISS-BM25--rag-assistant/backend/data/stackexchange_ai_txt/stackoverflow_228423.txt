Computers use the additive colour model, which involves adding together RGB to form white, and is the usual way of forming colours when using a light source. Printers use subtractive color, normally using Cyan(C), Magenta(M), and Yellow(Y), and often Black(K). Abbreviated CMYK Cyan is opposite to Red, Magenta is opposite to Green, and Yellow is opposite to Blue. This is a really simple explanation of a complex issue, the guy that came up with additive colour was James Maxwell (yes, that one), so if you dig into the many articles about him, that may explain much better.
