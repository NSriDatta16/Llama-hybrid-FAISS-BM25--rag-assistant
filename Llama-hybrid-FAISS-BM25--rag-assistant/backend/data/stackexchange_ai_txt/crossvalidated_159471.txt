I can't really provide a fitting circle analogy. But to see why $R^2$ can't decrease refer to $$ R^2 = 1 - (\text{SSR}/\text{SST}) $$ where $\text{SSR}$ is the sum of squared residuals and $\text{SST}$ is the total sum of squares. $R^2$ cannot decrease because the sum of squared residuals never increases when additional regressors are added to the model. For example, the last digit of one’s social security number has nothing to do with one’s hourly wage, but adding this digit to a wage equation will increase $R^2$ (by a little, at least). Well the $R^2$ can change, see for instance (in R): x1 = rnorm(100) x2 = rnorm(100) y1 = 1 + x1 - x2 + rnorm(100) r1 = residuals(lm(y1 ~ x2)) r2 = residuals(lm(x1 ~ x2)) # ols coef(lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2)) # fwl ols coef(lm(r1 ~ 0 + r2)) The coefficients are equal, but the $R^2$ is different. The fact that the coefficients are equal is a strange result (but it is always valid in a OLS/GLS setting, and possible more), you have that guarantee from the frisch waugh lovell (FWL) theorem. The implication is clear in time series: should you detrend you variables or simply include the trend in the regression? By FWL it does not matter, you always get the same coefficients. Actually the implication of the FWL is larger, since it applies to every variable, not just trends (also it does not matter how that variables is scaled/measured).
