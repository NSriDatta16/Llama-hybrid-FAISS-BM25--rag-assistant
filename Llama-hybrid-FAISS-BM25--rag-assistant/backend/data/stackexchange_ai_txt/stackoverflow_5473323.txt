XSL transform in Oracle using XMLTYPE.TRANSFORM returns a fragment, document required

This should be an easy one... In Oracle I am using XMLTYPE.TRANSFORM(myxml, myxsl) to perform a transformation. The XMLTYPE returned is a fragment (i.e. there is no XML document declaration). I require the output to be a document (i.e. with the declaration). My trasform works fine using standalone tools. Any help would be appreciated..
