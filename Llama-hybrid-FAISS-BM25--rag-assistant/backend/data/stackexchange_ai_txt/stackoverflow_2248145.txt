I've also experienced this. Internet Explorer 6 has a much slower JavaScript interpreter than other modern browsers, which we can't change. I think your first-load hit is caused by fresh requests for all of the source files as the Dojo parser bootstraps. As Peller stated, a custom build script, containing source for only the objects you need can reduce the number of network requests needed to bootstrap Dojo. This alleviated some of our performance issues, but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed IE6 taking substantially longer than IE7+, FF, Chrome, etc. to render the widget controls. To try to reduce this, you can try to refactor large pages with many widgets into multiple smaller pages with fewer widgets. Can you convert any large monolithic forms into smaller step-by-step wizards? You can try to encourage your users to upgrade to a newer browser.
