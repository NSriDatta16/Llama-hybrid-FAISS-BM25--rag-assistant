Ingo Ruczinski has contributed to promote the use of Logic regression for data set consisting of binary variables, with an emphasis on higher-order interaction terms. The main advantage compared to usual or penalized GLMs is that it is more parcimonious in terms of degrees of freedom. The outcome may be continuous or categorical, and continuous covariates can be added to the model (or the outcome can first be residualized on them if these are the binary predictors that are of interest). The original paper Ruczinski I, Kooperberg C, LeBlanc ML (2003). Logic Regression . Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics , 12(3), 475-511. includes several applications in biomedical studies, and a comparison of LR with CART and MARS . Although it has mainly been applied in large-scale genetic studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies), it should work with any binary variables whose combinations of interest can be expressed with a set of logical operators. The LogicReg R package implements this technique; see also the related packages on CRAN and Bioconductor, esp. LogicForest which shares some ideas with Random Forests.
