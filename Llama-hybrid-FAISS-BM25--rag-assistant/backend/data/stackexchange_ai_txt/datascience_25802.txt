Classifying hand written digits dataset using Probabilistic neural network (PNN)?

I am trying to apply Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) on MNIST dataset using MATLAB on 28000 samples. I tried to build the model but it gave an error saying matrix dimension exceeds memory showing it will require 5.08 GB (28000x28000) matrix. I want to know should I decrease the number of samples as input for training from 28000 to 200 samples as I read in research paper . Should I reduce the sample size or is there something else wrong? is pnn only applicable on small data sets?
