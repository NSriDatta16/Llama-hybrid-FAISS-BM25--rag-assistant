Resource recommendation for extreme value theory

I'm look to learn about extreme value theory, starting from univariate case and then moving onto the multivariate case. I have tried the textbook by de Haan, but I'm constantly lost trying to read the proof of Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem in the first chapter. I have also tried Statistics of Extremes: Theory and Applications but I cannot get through the first few chapter either. I have read EXTREMES AND RELATED PROPERTIES OF RANDOM SEQUENCES AND PROCESSES and found the section on on Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem understandable, but the book does not contain any section on multivariate analysis, and I'm not much interested in time series. I have also tried D-Norms & Multivariate Extremes but found it hard to follow as it got to multivariate extreme part. I'm looking for a comprehensive resource that covers multivariate extreme value theory. If anyone has any recommendation, I'd be grateful.
