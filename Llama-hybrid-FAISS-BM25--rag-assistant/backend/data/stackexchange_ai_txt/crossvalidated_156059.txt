Excellent answer by @David Marx. I have been wondering, what is the difference between Classification/Regression tree and Bayesian network.One builds on entropy to classify an outcome into classes based on different predictors and the other builds a graphical network using conditional independence and probabilistic parameter estimates. I feel that the methodology of building the Bayesian network is different compared to the Regression/Decision tree. The algorithm for structural learning, objectives for using the models as well as inferential ability of the models are different. The score-based and constrained based approach can be understood with some parallels drawn with the information gain criteria in the decision tree families.
