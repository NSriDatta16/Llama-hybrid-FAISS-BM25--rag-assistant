Without any knowledge of what you're actually trying to accomplish, a couple stabs at accomplishing this would be: Monitor (poll) each pending task's 'Terminated attribute. Implement a "Shutdown" entry in your task(s) that is the last thing each task performs. Have your "controller" rendezvous with each task's Shutdown entry and once all tasks have accepted and completed the rendezvous, for all intents and purposes you can conclude that the tasks have all terminated. For the pedantic among us, we might execute a short delay ( delay 0.0; ) and then verify via the 'Terminated attribute that all tasks are terminated, or at least pragma Assert() so.
