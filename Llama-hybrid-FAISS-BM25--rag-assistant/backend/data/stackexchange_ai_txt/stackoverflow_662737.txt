You can try using the UIImageView class which just wraps a UIImage inside a UIView container. It supports the touchesBegan/Cancelled events which would be suitable I think. You might also consider not using with a true radio button setup as you've described and instead going with a more iPhone-like approach--for instance, using a UITableView with cells corresponding to your radio selections and that toggle checked/unchecked on a touch. See the TouchCells example at the Apple iPhone dev site for an example.
