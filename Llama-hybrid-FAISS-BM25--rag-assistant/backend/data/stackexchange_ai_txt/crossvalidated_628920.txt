I would avoid the term "missing data" here. You are using number of medications as a proxy for disease complexity. For some patients, you can't directly know the number of medications, but you can have a clinician (or better, several clinicians working independently) assess the complexity of the clinical situation and use that information to estimate the number of medications. I suspect this latter approach would be better than imputation -- provided the clinician(s) estimating the number of medicines are blind to the purpose of the study and the hypothesis you are testing. And much better to average the estimate of several clinicians than just one. You could test the accuracy of their estimates. Also give those clinicians access to most of the medical records (but not the pharmacy records) of patients for whom you do know the number of medications. Compare the estimates with the real numbers, and report that with the rest of the findings.
