What about using some kind of recurent neural network like LSTM for the tables that can have unlimited nr of rows. This way I can embedd the variable length list of vectors (eg. previous_health_issues ) to a vector of fixed size (internal state of RNN) which then can be used for the main classifier to predict claim approval. The question is how to train the LSTMs. I am not so experienced with them but I guess it can be trained straight from main classifier with back propagation. Or it could be trained separately.
