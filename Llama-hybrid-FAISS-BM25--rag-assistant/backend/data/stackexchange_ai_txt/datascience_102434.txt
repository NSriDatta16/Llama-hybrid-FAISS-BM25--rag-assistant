100% accuracy with a 0.000 loss function is usually a bag sign in image classification. This usually means that your model is overfitting . Overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably, You've also that the images are very similar to each other which also proves that the results produced are because of overfitting. Refer to " How to Avoid Overfitting in Deep Learning Neural Networks " to fix this issue.
