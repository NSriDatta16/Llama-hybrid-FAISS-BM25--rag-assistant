Should work localStorage.right = localStorage.right++; Or a bit nicer: // 'right' is a bit conflict prone. localStorage.correctAwnsers = localStorage.correctAwnsers + 1; Note: localStorage is only supported in the latest browsers. Note: When testing from file:// protocol, localStorage goes wonky in some browsers.
