comparison of covariance matrices with unit that allows interpretation

I have fitted Gaussian distributions (3 dimensions) and need to compare their "variance". I found that there are multiple approaches, such as The $\text{trace}(\Sigma)$ (which does not take into account the covariance between dimensions) $|\Sigma|$ (determinant) However, I feel that neither $\sqrt{\text{trace}(\Sigma)}$ nor $\sqrt{|\Sigma|}$ ) even has the unit of my data. So my question is: Is there a single-number that allows comparisons of the covariance matrices that are open to interpretation? For example "The average distances between two points of distribution A are 10 meters"?
