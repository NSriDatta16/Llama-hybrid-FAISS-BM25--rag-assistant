Is an SLA pulled by just the calls answered by a certain group and not for the whole Queue valid?

I am trying to determine if the following is a valid SLA, I was presented with this as a fix for us not being able to differentiate the SLA between multiple groups answering calls: 1 Queue Two Groups handling that queue ( Group A & Group B ) SLA is met for a call when it is answered within 40 seconds (40s wait time) Queue had 100 calls for the day, with an average SLA of 70%. Group A answered 40 calls, Group B answered 60 calls from the same queue. To determine the SLA for the groups individually, the method that was presented was to look at the wait time only for the calls answered by that group. So the SLA for Group A would be determined by looking at the wait time for the 40 calls they answered, and for Group B for the 60 calls they answered. To me this seems skewed, as you are only looking at what was answered, for all intents and purposes wouldn't this be like picking random calls from those 100 for the day and calculating a service level? Expand this out to 1,000,000 calls and I would assume Group A and Group B should have a similar service level as the Queue average (All other factors being equal)? Is this flawed, if not, why is it accurate? If so, why is it flawed? Note: I am not sure what to tag this, please edit this as needed.
