Yes, it is possible . By using a GAN to generate additional samples with a class prompt, you can increase the amount of training data available for your image classification model, which can help improve its robustness, calibration, and overall precision/recall. This is particularly useful when you have limited training data available, as it allows you to generate synthetic data that can help improve the performance of your model. However, it's important to note that the quality of the generated samples will have an impact on the effectiveness of this approach , so you'll need to ensure that your GAN is generating high-quality images that are representative of the target distribution. There are other ways you may want to consider for improving the performance of a discriminator in your image classification model; One way is to increase the size and complexity of the model, allowing it to learn more nuanced features and better distinguish between classes. Another approach is to use transfer learning , where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the specific dataset, resulting in faster and more accurate training. Additionally, adjusting the learning rate , using different activation functions , or adding regularization techniques like dropout can also improve the model's performance. It is important to experiment with different approaches and monitor the model's performance to determine the best strategy.
