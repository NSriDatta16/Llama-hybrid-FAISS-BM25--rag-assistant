Neural network for imbalanced data

I have an imbalanced data (n = 600, about 97% majority and 3% minority) with 20 features and a binary outcome. The data has been split into a training set and a test set (80%/20%). I used H2o autoML to train a multilayer perceptron on the training set and make predictions on the test set. To try to improve the predictive performance, the minority group in the training set has been oversampled before training the MLP. The predictive performance on the test set did not improve even after oversampling the minority group up to 40%. Any idea why the predictive performance is not improving even after balancing the sizes of the minority and majority groups?
