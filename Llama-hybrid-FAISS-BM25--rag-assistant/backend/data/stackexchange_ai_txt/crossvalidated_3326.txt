I believe that your use of the word "tracking" may be leading your web queries off topic. Are you interested in time-series? Could you provide a simple example of "tracks clusters of datapoints"? Using the word "tracks" do you mean over time, through space, or perhaps in reference to a chemical or physical process? Further, with "clusters of datapoints", are you talking about objects (image recognition), are you talking about survey data & searching for trends, or something more akin to tracking the correlated movements of stock prices? Answer: You might consider googling "Spatial Temporal Cluster Algorithms" or perhaps "Agent based modeling" or "Spatio-temporal point processes". But again, the suggestions can be refined with a bit of insight on your desired application or context.
