I hate when sites complicate download so much and use hacks instead of a good old link . Dead simple version: Start automatic download! It works! In every browser! If you want to download a file that is usually displayed inline (such as an image) then HTML5 has a download attribute that forces download of the file. It also allows you to override filename ( although there is a better way to do it ): Download Version with a "thanks" page: If you want to display "thanks" after download, then use: Start automatic download! Function in that setTimeout might be more advanced and e.g. download full page via AJAX (but don't navigate away from the page â€” don't touch window.location or activate other links). The point is that link to download is real, can be copied, dragged, intercepted by download accelerators, gets :visited color, doesn't re-download if page is left open after browser restart, etc. That's what I use for ImageOptim
