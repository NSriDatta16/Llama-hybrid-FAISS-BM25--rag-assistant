Do you want high availability or disaster recoverability? For HA there aren't that many options since Express does not support any HA feature (ie. failover of any kind). For DR you can set up Log Shipping manually. Although you're missing the log shipping agents, is not rocket science to set up a couple of service jobs to backup the log, copy the files and the apply the logs on your DR site. The original Log Shipping was nothing more than a few .bat scripts put together by MS customer support.
