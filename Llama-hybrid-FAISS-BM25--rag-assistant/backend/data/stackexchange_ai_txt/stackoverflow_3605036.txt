modifying background

I am a beginner in HTML and am taking a Multimedia class for school. I noticed for many websites such as ESPN, CNN, Google, etc. that there was no direct image source for the entire background. How might I be able to incorporate an image for an entire background of a website? Thanks I appreciate it! OH ok I see the problem, I was in HTML, not CSS. So where do I find the source file? I know in HTML if there is a image placed it will usually be followed by something like img src etc., and the image I want to use I usually copy the image location and paste, is this the same for this? Also I see in the CSS script the words body { margin:0;
