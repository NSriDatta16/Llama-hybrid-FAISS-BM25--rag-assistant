Generic interfaces are really useful when you want to parameterize the types of one of the members in the interface. Consider the IEnumerable and IEnumerable interfaces. The first iterates Objects whereas the second iterates instances of the type argument supplied for T . Since interfaces can be generic it allows you to leverage their flexibility while still taking advantage of generics in the same way that you would for a concrete type.
