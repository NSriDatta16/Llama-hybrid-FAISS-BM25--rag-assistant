I don't think you outlined what should happen in all possible cases (e.g. what is the status when the sequence is "Indeterminate, Indeterminate"?) but here is an idea: treat the "indeterminate" cases as missing and "impute" them using the na.locf from package zoo to carry forward the values. (Or better, reimplement it to address your case.) library(plyr) at Not sure this qualifies as elegant, though!
