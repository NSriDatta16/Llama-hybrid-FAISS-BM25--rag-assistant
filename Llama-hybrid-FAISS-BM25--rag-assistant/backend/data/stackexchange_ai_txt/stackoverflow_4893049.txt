That was my post you found. So far this is the best I've been able to do: Pull the OS-agnostic code out into separate libraries. Create a second solution, with its own project files, to compile those libraries as vanilla .NET 3.5. Unit-test the libraries. On the bright side, this encourages separating your concerns and (in theory) should it easier to port the app to, say, MonoDroid. But keeping the two solutions in sync is a pain, and it's easy to drift away from actually writing tests when they're out of sight.
