JSF 2 provides Request, View, Session, and Application scopes. CDI introduces the Conversation scope, but more importantly, it introduces a standard by which new scopes can be added to the platform. The Scope you are describing is probably better suited by a custom scope like a window scope. Two projects implementing this scope are: Apache MyFaces CODI IceFaces has a JSF (non-CDI) Window scope implementation . Nevertheless, I would encourage you to rethink your bean structure. I've become quite fond of the View scope myself, coupled with the JSF 2 view parameters to propagate information from one page to another (and from one View scope instance to another). MyFaces "View Access" scope seems like another neat approach, where a bean stays in scope so long as the pages you navigate through maintain a reference to that scope.
