What is a good way to transform Cyclic Ordinal attributes?

I am having 'hour' field as my attribute, but it takes a cyclic values. How could I transform the feature to preserve the information like '23' and '0' hour are close not far. One way I could think is to do transformation: min(h, 23-h) Input: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23] Output: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1] Is there any standard to handle such attributes? Update: I will be using superviseed learning, to train random forest classifier!
