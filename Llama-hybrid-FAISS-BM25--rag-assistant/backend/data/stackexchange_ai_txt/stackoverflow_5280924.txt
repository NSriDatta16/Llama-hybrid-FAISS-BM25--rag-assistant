When I set up my app.yaml I just poured through this page: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig.html You have to think like a regular expression parser. Anything that fails to match the preceding expressions will fall through to your wildcard handler and cause weirdness. One thing I notice is that you should add login: admin to your task queue handler. This will prevent external requests from hitting that URL accidentally. Also, when you are submitting tasks to your handler, if you don't include the trailing slash ( /task?blah=something instead of /task/?blah=something ) the request would fall through to your wildcard handler and get sent to Home.py. That could also happen for /image/ , /browse/ and /api/ . You should put logging calls into those handlers to make sure they are getting called when expected. Nothing jumps out at me as obviously wrong in your app.yaml though. But since there are GETs showing up in your log, that indicates that something is requesting that URL, and it's not just the get method getting called twice internally. Edit: Hold on a sec, just noticed that you have this in your app.yaml twice. You shouldn't need to do that. - url: /movie/(.*)/rating-review-video/ script: /wianga/site/MoviePage.py - url: /movie/(.*)/rating-review-video script: /wianga/site/MoviePage.py` Try replacing with: - url: /movie/(.*)/rating-review-video.* script: /wianga/site/MoviePage.py` Edit2: Try adding this to the top of your get method: logging.info('environ: ' + str(self.request._environ)) Pop the output into a beautifier ( http://jsbeautifier.org/ ) to make it more readable, and take a look at the REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY_STRING, HTTP_USER_AGENT, HTTP_COOKIE, PATH_INFO, and HTTP_REFERER params to see where the requests are actually coming from. If they are all coming from your browser then there is something weird in your html, like hidden iframes (are you using Channel API?). Also, try going to http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin/queues and making sure there aren't any old tasks hanging around.
