Git multiple sub projects from sub folders?

I have multiple projects that I'd like to put up onto GitHub.com. All of these projects are in my local Git repository. I have just one repository, but for each project, I'd like to have 1 GitHub project. That way, bugs can be organized by the project. How can I set this up so that it isn't that difficult to manage? Do I need to redo my repository layout and create new git repositories locally for each project? That would be really time involved and I might be losing the Git history. Walter
