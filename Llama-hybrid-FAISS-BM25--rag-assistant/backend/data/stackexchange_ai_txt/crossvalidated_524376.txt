Testing glmer model assumptions (optionally in R)

I have collected binary data within subjects (multiple trials per subject) and have fit a generalized mixed effect regression to these data. My model has the following structure: fit I would like to check for possible violations to the model assumptions, but I am unsure concerning (a) the actual assumptions that need to be tested for within a mixed effect logistic regression, and (b) how these can be tested in R. Checking for model assumptions appears to be much more complex than in the simple regression setting and I would really appreciate if someone could refer me to useful documents, books, or R-packages. I assume I would need to check for a linear relationship between my independent variables and the log of the odds, for example, but I cannot find a comprehensive overview or a systematic approach to the diagnostics. Thank you in advance!
