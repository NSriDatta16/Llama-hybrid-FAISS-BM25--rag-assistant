Multimodality is often a cause of poor convergence or lack thereof for MCMC algorithms. Without any detail available about the posterior you aim at approximating, it is hard to tell whether or not you are facing such a case, because the multimodality on the first (density) figure is most likely an artefact reflecting the very slow move of the (sub) Markov chain in the $\alpha$ space. What is more worrying is the trace plot you produce for $\alpha$ when the scale of the proposal density moves to $0.5$ as it seems the sequence does not change at all. The density you obtain is again an artefact I believe, namely a single Normal density produced by the kernel density estimator of R. I would suggest using a sequence of scales in the Metropolis proposal, from the lowest 5e-5 to the largest 5e-1 (or higher), chosen at random at each iteration, meaning the use of a mixture proposal in the Metropolis acceptance ration. This means using the sum of the five Normal proposals in this ratio, rather than the Normal with the scale that has been chosen for that iteration.
