Best way to manage code snippets in Linux?

How you manage/organize your collection of code snippets on Linux? Is there a specialized tool to do that (both in GUI and CLI environment)? Is there any convention about code snippet management in Linux? Also, I often do some work via ssh so it would be really helpful if I can access my snippet easily from command line. I just moved to Linux for several months and still got to learn a lot about software development in Linux. Any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks!
