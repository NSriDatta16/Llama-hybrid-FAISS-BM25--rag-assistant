some lectures/examples on Q-learning using feature/linear approximation

Most of the resources that I find in the internet deal with Q-learning or SARSA in the discrete sense, when state spaces and actions are finite. There are variety of examples and tutorials for this case. I am looking for the case when state space is infinite. In this case, it is impossible to list all the states. Hence, an important technique would be to make a features-based representation. However, the resources are few and far in between. If you know of resources, websites, examples, lectures, even video lectures, especially on the Q-learning/SARSA with features-based representation, it be great to have a look.
