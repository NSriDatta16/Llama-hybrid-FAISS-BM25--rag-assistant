Why is detecting touches getting slower and slower?

In my game if I play a particular game for several times, my touches need more time to be detected. It stores all touches and then applies those touches all at the same time. Can anybody tell me what's the problem? In touchesBegan I wrote: if (CGRectContainsPoint([tapView frame], [touch locationInView:self]) && tapView.alpha == 1) { [self callTapCode]; } This is the code of touchesEnded . If I tapped and release the tapped it shows one tapping event. - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (checkTap == TRUE && tapView.alpha == 1 ) tap_effect_view.alpha = 0; } - (void)callTapCode { // Move player code by 6 pixels // not possible to write all code } In tapView I continuously tap. callTapCode moves the player by six pixels. But after some time my touches detected very slowly, so that the player looks like he's jumping around. I played the game continuously 15 to 16 times.
