lmer model doesn't return t-value

I'm currently running a time series analysis which requires me to fit lmer models to each of my data points. Here is my code : # import data dt In this model, cond is a 2 levels fixed effect factor and sub is a 14 levels random effect factor. For some reason, the model doesn't yield a t-value in its ouput : > fitted[1] $`0` Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: size ~ cond + (1 + cond | sub) Data: x REML criterion at convergence: -7694.797 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev. Corr sub (Intercept) 1.388e-02 cond1 1.169e-05 -1.00 Residual 7.922e-02 Number of obs: 3467, groups: sub, 14 Fixed Effects: (Intercept) cond1 0.023743 -0.001154 Is it the output I should have expected? It seems that R doesn't take the difference between both levels of cond into account.
