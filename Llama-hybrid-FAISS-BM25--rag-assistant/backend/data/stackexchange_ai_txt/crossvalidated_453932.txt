Which multivariate statistical method to use for qualitative AND quantitative data?

I'm just starting to learn about different types of multivariate statistics, but I'm having trouble figuring out which method is appropriate for my data. My data is a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. I'm making up an example dataset as below, as my real data includes many more rows and columns. Sample ID age height weight gender smoking history of cancer 1 30 180 70 M Y N 2 25 175 80 M N N 3 50 180 60 M Y Y 4 35 170 NA M N N 5 40 NA 65 M N Y 6 40 160 50 F N Y 7 20 165 70 F Y Y 8 35 150 50 F NA N 9 NA 170 65 F Y N ... So each row is an individual patient, and I have columns that have quantitative data (age, height, weight) and qualitative/binary data (gender, whether they smoke or not, history of cancer). My research question is to see what factors influence history of cancer. I'd like to know if any of my variables are more important to cancer than others, or if I can eliminate considering some variables that are unrelated to cancer. I initially thought about doing a PCA, but I'm not sure if PCA can be done with binary variables, and I've also heard that PCA doesn't produce good results if the data has too many zeros (or NA in this case). Anyone has any suggestions about which statistical methods I should look into?
