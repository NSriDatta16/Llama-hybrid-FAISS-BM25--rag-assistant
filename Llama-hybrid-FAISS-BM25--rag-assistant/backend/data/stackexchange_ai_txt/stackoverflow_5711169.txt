Jquery source obfuscator

Possible Duplicate: Javascript library: to obfuscate or not to obfuscate - that is the question Hi, I'm creating a very simple footer zone with a jquery animated drawer and a simple carouseel with a modal to show some products of my store. Any decent jquery programmer will easily top this, i'm a noob, the problem is that I know my competition very well, the moment they lay eyes on this they will implement the same, I just don't want them to outragely rip off my hard earned code. I found this javascript obfuscator online: http://www.javascriptobfuscator.com/default.aspx is it any good? My question is, although it "obfuscates" the code, its still pretty easy to just donwload the .js file with my code and implement it. Is there a way to make the javascript file not load/work if its not in my domain? This + the code obfuscation would work really well don't you think? Can you point me out something like this or a simple alternative? Thanks Best Regards Joricam
