There is no access from Javascript hosted in an ordinary web page to the accelerometer on the iPad as of today -- which is the first piece of functionality that you want to access. If you want to use Sencha (I work for Sencha), you must wrap Sencha code with Phonegap's native shell in order to get access to this functionality. Phonegap takes native Objective C API's and creates new Javascript objects that correspond to these API's. But the result will be a native app, not a web page. Drag and Drop, the second piece of functionality that you want, is an activity entirely within the browser, and Sencha handles drag and drop just fine.
