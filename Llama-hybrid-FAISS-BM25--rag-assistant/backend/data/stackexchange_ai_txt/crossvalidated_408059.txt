Calculate odds ratios and P-value for interaction across multiple separate subgroups

I'm trying to understand/replicate an adjusted logistic regression analysis where a treatment effect is estimated separately in a number (>2) of subgroups and estimating an overall P-value for interaction. I want to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in each subgroup (i.e., without keeping any subgroup as the reference group with OR 1.00) while adjusting for two additional variables and present a P-value for the overall interaction effect. The results I want to produce are essentially similar to those of presented in Fig S3 here for the first set of subgroups (age) (page 10 in https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1808561/suppl_file/nejmoa1808561_appendix.pdf ; full paper at https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808561 ). I have read several posts here and elsewhere, but have not found one that I am able to understand enough to correctly perform the analysis. Here's code to generate an example dataset in R and perform parts of the analyses: # Create example dataset with 2000 patients set.seed(800) dta $y[dta$ trt == FALSE] $y[dta$ trt == TRUE & dta$subgrp == LETTERS[i]] I am uncertain about how to calculate the ORs with CIs in each subgroup, and uncertain which approach is correct for calculating the overall P-value for interaction. Help in explaining how to modify the above code to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated. Edit: minor re-phrasing for clarity.
