MUGAN's close. The Point you'll get from MouseEventArgs is the "screen" point of the mouse, where 0,0 is the top left of the entire monitor or desktop (however you want to think of it). To convert that to a "client" point within the PictureBox control, where 0,0 is the top left of that PictureBox, you'll need to use the Control.PointToClient() method: private void pb_MouseDown(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e) { Point mouseDownLocation = (Control)sender.PointToClient(new Point(e.X, e.Y)); //here goes your if condition ... }
