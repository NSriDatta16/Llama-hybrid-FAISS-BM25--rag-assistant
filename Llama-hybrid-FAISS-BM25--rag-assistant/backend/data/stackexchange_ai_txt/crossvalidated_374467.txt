PCA- creating a model with values obtained

Hoping somebody can help me. I cannot find an example that 'finishes' a problem. I run a proc princomp in SAS. I have hundreds of variables but used four for the purpose of an example. I understand the idea of an eigenvalue and proportion as it relates to variability explained of the dependent variable. lets assume that the first two eigenvalues explain 85% of the dependent variable. here are the resulting eigenvectors. prin1 prin2 prin3 prin 4 w -0.55 0.18 0.63 0.51 x 0.52 0.25 0.71 -0.41 y 0.65 0.03 -0.05 0.76 z -0.05 0.95 -0.3 -0.02 now, assume I want to run a regression. do the prin's become components that are in essence variables? i.e new_indep_var1=-.55*w+.52*x+.65*y-.05*z, etc etc. in essence having 4 variables to run in a regression model with whatever dependent variable I want, call it v? thanks
