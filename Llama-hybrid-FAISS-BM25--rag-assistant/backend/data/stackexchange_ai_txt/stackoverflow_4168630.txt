1: the more difficult bit: is there any way to bypass this "not allowed" an still open that page inside our iframe? No, not really. The site you are embedding is probably checking with JavaScript to see if it is being embedded, and redirecting the top-level window to their site if so. If a site doesn't want to let you embed it, don't embed it. Open it in a new window.
