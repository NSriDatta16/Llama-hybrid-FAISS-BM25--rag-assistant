Using gives people the ability to add extensions to their XML instance documents without changing the original schema . This is the critical benefit it gives you. Yes. tools than manipulate the instances don't care what the schema looks like, it's the instance documents they look at. To them, it doesn't really matter if you use or not. Binding tools generally don't handle very elegantly. This is understandable, since they have no information about what it could contain, so they'll usually give you an untyped placeholder. It's up the the application code to handle that at runtime. JAXB is particular (the RI, at least) makes a bit of a fist of it, but it's workable. Yes. It's perfectly good XML Schema practice, and all valid XML Schema are supported by WS-I makes life a bit harder on the programmer, due to the untyped nature of the bindings, but if you need to support arbitrary extension points, this is the way to do it. However, if your extensions are well-defined, and do not change, then it may not be worth the irritation factor.
