This is an InnoDB table, right? InnoDB is transactional storage engine. Setting autocommit to true will probably fix this behavior for you. conn.autocommit(True) Alternatively, you could change the transaction isolation level. You can read more about this here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/set-transaction.html The reason for this behavior is that inside a single transaction the reads need to be consistent. All consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read. Even if you script only reads the table this is considered a transaction too. This is the default behavior in InnoDB and you need to change that or run conn.commit() after each read. This page explains this in more details: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html
