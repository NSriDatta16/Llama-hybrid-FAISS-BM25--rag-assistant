I'm not surprised that this doesn't work, and I can't see a natural semantic interpretation for instance active patterns. How do you know which instance to use when you see the Foo pattern? Could you have different instances for the Foo and Bar cases (and therefore an incomplete pattern match)? There doesn't seem to be an elegant resolution to the issues here. To be honest, I'm suprised that even the static case works, and I don't see anything in the spec addressing the definition of active patterns as members of any kind.
