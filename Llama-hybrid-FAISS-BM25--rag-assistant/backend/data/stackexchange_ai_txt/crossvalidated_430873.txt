Statistical independence/dependence does not make reference or concern itself with whether or not the data comes from the same experiment but about the data generating process. Independence in statistics is whether or not the data points influence each other, not whether or not they come from the same experiment. So your concern of "What troubles me here is that, these additional data points are not "independent" in the sense that, coming from the same experiment, we can expect them to be dependent on the previous data point." is not a concern in general but likely because of your specific experimental setup. That is it's a different concern to say "my data are all from one experiment and so I might have a problem" than to say "my data are not independent". In your case you have both problems. However, the only way to address the limitation of "my data is just from one experiment" is to run more experiments. However then you get into the issue of "all my data is just from one experimental apparatus" so you need to find another experimental apparatus... so on and so forth. Another way to address this is to say that the all from one experiment concern addresses "systematic" error and the "data are not independent" concern reflects the concern that your uncertainties are miscalculated from that experiment (i.e., you are misestimating the "random" error. Furthermore, for these models and this setup that you are doing I would argue that "degrees of freedom" is an ill defined concept and so you just shouldn't worry about it. The trickiness with defining it for your particular experiment is that it isn't clear in how many ways you can vary/change your system independently. I guess my answer is: you're asking a good question and the answer is unfortunately that the concept just doesn't really apply. You are doing diffusion experiments and I have some familiarity with them though likely in a very different context and it sounds to me like you are measuring how quickly oxygen diffuses into a material (if this is wrong then your model will need to be more complicated). Let's go with measuring oxygen uptake in a material to measure the diffusion coefficient. So there are some possible parameters that your model is interested in fitting: the diffusion coefficient and the measurement error. Instead of fitting a curve to your data as you have done now which leads you to all sorts of nasty considerations such as what happens when the data are not statistically independent (that is the data depends on other data points; in your case points depend on the value before them). I would propose you setup a physical model of your system and then fit the parameters using a bayesian model. The basic idea I am proposing is as follows: 1) write a physical model that generates the data from a diffusion coefficient 2) use a MCMC sampler to fit the diffusion coefficient and measurement error that best fits your data along with the uncertainties For the MCMC sampler you will need to use a likelihood function and for that I propose weighted square deviations: $$L = \sum_i {(y_i-s_i) \over \sigma^2}$$ where $$s_i$$ are the simulated data that correspond to each $$y_i$$ and $$\sigma^2$$ is the measurement error that you are fitting from your data. Assuming that the MCMC sampler does it's job and finishes you should get both the parameter values and uncertainties without having to explicitly worry about degrees of freedom. Here is some example code for a similar situation: https://github.com/bblais/pyndamics
