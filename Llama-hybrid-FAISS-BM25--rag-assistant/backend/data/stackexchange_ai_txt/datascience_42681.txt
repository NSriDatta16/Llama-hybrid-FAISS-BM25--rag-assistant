How is the min_rank used with the flights database

I'm exploring the https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#add-new-variables-with-mutate r for data science handbook and don't really understand the min_rank() operator. Doing the exercises it asks to Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank(). here is the code that I performed that doesn't work. Please explain: min_rank(flights, dep_delay)
