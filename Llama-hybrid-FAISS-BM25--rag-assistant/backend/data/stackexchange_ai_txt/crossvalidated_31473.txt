Forecasting hierarchical time series R package

I have to forecast a large set of (hierarchical) time series and since the R package hts allows for confidence intervals for their ensemble, I'd like to use it. I haven't found an example of how to use it, yet. How should I forecast the following series with it: The time series have a simple form. The sum of $n_3$ level-$3$-series make up a level-$2$-series and the sum of $n_2$ level-$2$-series make up a level-$1$-series and the sum of $n_1$ level-$1$-series make up the top-most level-$0$-series (where sums are taken over series in one point in time, $n_j$ natural numbers for $j=0,1,2,3$).
