I don't have enough information to give you an answer, but I'll make a wild guess as to a possible cause for the errors you are seeing. Is CP_String declared inside a namespace? If so what is it? I see the macro invocation: CPLAT_Begin_Namespace_CPLAT , which I assume does something like using namespace CPLAT; and maybe some standard setup. Perhaps, due to the reorganization you mentioned in your comments, CP_String is no longer in the CPLAT namespace, and so the compiler cannot find it.
