Calculate one median for data from five experimental repetitions

I have an experiment that produces a few thousand data points which I then have repeated 5 times. Now I wonder how to calculate one single median to summarize all of them. I could combine the data from the five repetitions and calculate a median for that. I could calculate a median for each experiment and then average them. I could calculate a median for each experiment and then take the median of those. Some other procedure I haven't thought of. Which procedure make the most sense as a way to combine the data? How would I then go about producing a confidence interval for the median? I assume some sort of bootstrap procedure makes sense, since the distribution of the data is not normal.
