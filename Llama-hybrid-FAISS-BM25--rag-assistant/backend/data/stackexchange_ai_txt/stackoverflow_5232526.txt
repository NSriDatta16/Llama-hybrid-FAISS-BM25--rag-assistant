Nearly all of Google gears/ the other stuff which makes Chrome different from other browsers is now being implemented in HTML5 (development has stopped on most of the Google Gears streams). If you just want a webkit based browser you can install on on MSWindows platforms you might want to have a look at Konqueror and the KHTML engine - although getting it to run on MSWindows independently of KDE is a bit tricky. But if you're not averse to writing some code (which you'll need to if you expect to integrate your own browser) then check out QT for MSWindows. There's a standard component implementing a webkit based browser . This is used in Arora (and possibly other browsers). While there doesn't seem to be much information about customizing the furniture on Chrome, Firefox not only provides an API - they encourage people to develop custom front ends. On Andriod you can launch a browser session with no furniture using webview - but this approach obviously does not work with MacOS/Linux/Microsoft desktop systems (unless you are using the Android emulator).
