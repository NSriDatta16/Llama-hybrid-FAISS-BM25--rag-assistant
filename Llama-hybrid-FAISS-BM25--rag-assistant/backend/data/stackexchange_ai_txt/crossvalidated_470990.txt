The short answer is that your sample has not precisely followed a normal distribution, so suggests perhaps you might need to re-examine your base assumptions, specifically one that you can apply tools designed for working with a normally distributed population. Just turn your question the other way round for enlightenment. If your sample was normally distributed, then one would expect a sample size of ~2000 to yield 6 data-points outside the range 30-48, on average. Yours does not, which signals a question 'What is the significance of this deviation from normal for any predictions you make by assuming that your wider population is following a normal distribution?' So the wider implication of this small anomaly is that, although your sample may not differ far from a normal distribution, some forecasts made assuming that it does represent a bigger normally distributed population could be inherently flawed and may warrant some qualification or further investigation. However estimating the likelihood of this deviation from normal, and the implied error margins and reliability of resulting forecasts is way beyond my level of ability, although fortunately explored in the many other answers here! But you clearly have a good habit to scrutinise your results in full, to question what your results genuinely mean and whether they prove your original hypothesis or not. Look for further abnormalities revealed in the data, like Kurtosis and Skew to see what clues they reveal or perhaps consider other distributions as better representing your population.
