Relative URLs in JSP specification

I have taken below paragraphs from JSP 2.1 specification document. I'm confused and I need some help with this. A page relative path is a path that does not start with a slash (/). It is to be interpreted as relative to the current JSP page, or the current JSP file or tag file, depending on where the path is being used. I'm good till this. Then, For an include directive (see Section JSP.1.10.3) where the path is used in a file attribute, the interpretation is relative to the JSP file or tag file. For a jsp:include action (see Section JSP.5.4, “ ” ) where the path is used in a page attribute, the interpretation is relative to the JSP page. In both cases the current page or file is denoted by some path starting with / that is then modified by the new specification to produce a path starting with /. The above paragraph says that, in both the cases interpretation is relative to JSP page but how come it will start with '/' ? As per the first paragraph page relative paths does not start with slash right ? Is it a typing mistake ? and shd it be like 'in both cases path should be like "../myfile.jsp" ?? The new path is interpreted through the ServletContext object. See Section JSP.1.10.5 for exact details on this interpretation. I agree to this point if the path starts with a slash.
