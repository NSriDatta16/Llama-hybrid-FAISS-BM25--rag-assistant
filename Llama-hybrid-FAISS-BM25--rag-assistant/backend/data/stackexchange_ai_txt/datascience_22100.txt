Answering to @Media's comment about why there are many local minima: Consider, your randomly initialized weights to be belonging to energy level E4 in above image. Clearly, E1, E2, E3 have lesser energy. So all these 3 levels are minima w.r.t. E4. Now, with neural networks, your learning algorithms is such that it is guaranteed [yes, mathematical guarantee] to take you to a lesser energy level. The trouble is you don't know which lower state it will put you into. But, oh, lower, it will be!
