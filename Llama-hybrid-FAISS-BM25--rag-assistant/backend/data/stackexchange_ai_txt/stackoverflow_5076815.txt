I would definitively go for one thread per camera as chances are you'd use less than 20-30 cameras. But it is probably not required as reading a camera (usually) is a non-blocking operation. There are several questions on webcam and video in C# on SO. Try looking at How do I capture video from a webcam? Note that you may want to pre-allocate large chunks of data to avoid disk fragmentation. Storing multiple streaming videos to disk could really fragment stuff, and then watching/copying/modifying the videos would be really slow.
