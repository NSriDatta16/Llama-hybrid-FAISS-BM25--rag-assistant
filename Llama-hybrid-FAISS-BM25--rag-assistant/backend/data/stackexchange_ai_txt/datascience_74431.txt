Could you help me to resolve this exercise of K-NN?

I am just a young learner in Data Science. Could you help me to resolve this exercise of K-NN? Ex.1 The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable: x1 x2 x3 y 0 3 0 Red 2 0 0 Red 0 1 3 Red 0 1 2 Green âˆ’1 0 1 Green 1 1 1 Red Suppose we wish to use this dataset to make a prediction for Y when x1 = x2 = x3 = 0 using K-nearest neighbors. 1) With the euclidean distance, what is the prediction with K = 1 and with K = 3 for the test point (0, 0, 0)? 2) If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for K to be large or small? Why?
