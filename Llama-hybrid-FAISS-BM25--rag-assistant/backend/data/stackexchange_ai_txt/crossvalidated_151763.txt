threshold based on mean and standard deviation

I have a time series of 70000 data points. I want to separate samples of this time series which have very large values as compared to the time series. How can i threshold sample to separate. What i am thinking for threshold: if SD of sample is s1 and mean and SD of time series are M and S then if s1>M+S then the sample has larger values is this correct? is this logical? any suggestions?
