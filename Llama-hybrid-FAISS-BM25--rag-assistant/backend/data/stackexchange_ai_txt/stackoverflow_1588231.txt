You're not running into an array size problem. 8K*8K is merely 64M. Even 64M doubles (sizeof==8) are not an issue; that would require a mere 512 MB. Now, a 32 bit application (no matter where it's running) should be able to allocate a few of them. Not 8, because the OS typically needs to reserve some space for itself (often slightly over 2GB) and sometimes not even 3 when memory is fragmented. The behavior of "malloc failed but didn't return NULL" is a Linux configuration bug, fixed by # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
