Model for time series analysis

I'm new to data analysis and ML in general. I'm working with some friends on this problem: We're trying to predict when a component of a machine will stop working properly so the client can change it in time to avoid production slowdowns. We have a dataset in which are registered: Timestamp Event description Event type id Machine id List item There are 2 types of events, each one with an id: ID: 0 -> completed piece event, all ok ( Event description : E_INFO_PIECE_COMPLETATED) ID: 1 -> error event that indicates something went wrong There are a lot of events with the error type, which are described by the Event description column, for example, E_ALARM_CUTTING_DRIVE_ERROR or E_ALARM_LOW_AIR_PRESSURE. We tried to understand if there is a correlation between all these error events and if they repeat over time by following a specific pattern but ended with very poor results. Some arguments we discussed are: ARIMA PCA Time series anomaly detection But we don't know if these models can be applied to our case or, if yes, how. So the question is: Is there a model that we can adopt using the current data (Event description and timestamp)? If not, do we need more data, like sensor values?
