Outlier detection in out-sample data for the purpose of classification

This is the most widely used method for outlier detection in econometrics and statistical problems. X is our data that we're searching for outliers in it (in MATLAB) : abs(X-mean(X)) >= n*std(X) So if this inequality was true, that sample is an outlier; otherwise we will keep the sample. I'm using neural network and SVM for my classification problem. Before normalization of data, I find outlier for each feature in input database. After creating my MLP or SVM model now I want use it for out-sample data ( new data from this year - model trained by data of last year ). Should I use outlier detection in this new database? If answer to that question is yes, Should I use mean and std of previous year that was used for outlier detection of main data, or use new mean and std of out-sample data?
