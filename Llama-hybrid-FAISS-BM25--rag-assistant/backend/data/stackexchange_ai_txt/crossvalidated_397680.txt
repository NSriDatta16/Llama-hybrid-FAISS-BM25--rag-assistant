Defining the cases where Neural Networks outperform tree-based methods

It is well-known that neural networks are currently superior to most of the alternatives to do prediction from images (with CNNs) and sequential data (RNN, transformers...). However for other problems one can wonder in which cases it is worth to spend time tuning a neural network vs going for boosted-tree methods (think gradient boosting and variants). Is there some other problems or configurations where NNs have shown to be competitive or superior to these methods?
