Code folding on consecutive collect/select/reject/each

I play around with arrays and hashes quite a lot in ruby and end up with some code that looks like this: sum = two_dimensional_array.select{|i| i.collect{|j| j.to_i }.sum > 5 }.collect{|i| i.collect{|j| j ** 2 }.average }.sum (Let's all pretend that the above code sample makes sense now...) The problem is that even though TextMate (my editor of choice) picks up simple {...} or do...end blocks quite easily, it can't figure out (which is understandable since even I can't find a "correct" way to fold the above) where the above blocks start and end to fold them. How would you fold the above code sample? PS: considering that it could have 2 levels of folding, I only care about the outer consecutive ones (the blocks with the i)
