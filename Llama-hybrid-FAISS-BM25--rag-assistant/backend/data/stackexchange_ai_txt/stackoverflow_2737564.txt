ToolTip for a User Control Issue

I have a control inherited from usercontrol, I have implemented it such a way that it acts as XY Plane and displays curves. When user clicks and holds the mouse down for 1 sec i trigger SetToolTip to display tooltip indicationg (x,y) coordinates. Tooltip remains even on drag updating x,y positions System.Windows.Forms.ToolTip myToolTip = new System.Windows.Forms.ToolTip(); myToolTip.SetToolTip(myControl,"x= val,y=val"); It is working fine But Tooltip stops showing after (1)I play around for sometime(click,drag repeatedly) and will never show up (2)I move some other window on this control(this happens sporadically) what could be the problem???
