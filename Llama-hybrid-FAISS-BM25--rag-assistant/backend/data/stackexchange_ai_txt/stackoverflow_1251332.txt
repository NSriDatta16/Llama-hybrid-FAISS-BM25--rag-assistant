I don't think that direct "code translating" could be possible, what with invoking API functions? (like, each technology has it's own collections, etc.). Link that you have given, doesn't seem to be code translator, rather - libraries that allows one to connect components, like embedding java GUI inside WPF app etc. Also, on the main page of JNBridge, they are writing: Bridge anything Java to .NET Bridge anything .NET to Java So it might a good idea to check someone's site before asking about possibilities of their platform.
