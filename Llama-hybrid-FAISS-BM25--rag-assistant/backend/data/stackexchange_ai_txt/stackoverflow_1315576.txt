i have a version of this in use (for a Gantt-chart style display). it uses 3 tables: 1 for left column (the rows), 1 for top (columns), and then the data. you need to work hard to get the cells to match sizes with the ones they match up to ( table layout-fixed can help achieve this). The tables then are placed in some divs; the left and top divs have (as suggested above) height & width and overflow-auto in their css. You then hook up some javascript to sync the scrolling of the left / top divs with the inner one... As I recall there was a fair bit of 'curse-and-try-again', but it can be done with minimal js. hth
