"Zero-inflated continuous covariates", Can they cause problems in logistic regression?

I pose a very similar question to this , although I felt the advice given does not apply to my particular situation; I am using logistic regression models for an animal habitat occupancy study, and all the predictor variables I am interested in contain >50% zeros (although they have a decent range of values in the higher percentiles). Can this cause bias or influence how I should interpret the estimated coefficients? A 2-stage analysis, as suggested in the linked question, doesn't seem to make sense because all the predictors share this zero-inflated distribution. Thanks for any insights EDIT Clarifications suggested by Peter Flom; Sample size ~ 500 (300 "0"s, 200 "1"s) There are 5 IV's; a typical five-number summary looks like this; min= 0.000 lower= 0.000 median=0.000 upper= 0.289 max= 16.887 Also, Mean= 0.468, SD= 1.467 correlations between the 5 IV's all absolute r The IV's are hectares of specific habitat types. Every sample has >0 hectare(s) for at least 1 of the IV's.
