How to quantitatively evaluate raw neural network activations?

Below are the activations for 2 different predictions. These predictions are for different labels/classes. They are being run through a dense Keras NN (96.6% accurate) with 2 hidden layers and adam optimizer. What kinds of trends in the numerical values of the activations should I be looking for with regard to a NN that is being trained successfully? Do you want most activations to be either high or zero... not somewhere in the middle? What values would indicate that you need to add/ remove a layer? What maximum activation value is too high? Like if I saw an 8 should I be worried when the rest of my high values are around 4?
