PHP strategies for retrofitting a namespace around 3rd party code

I'm attempting to utilize a 3rd-party PHP library in a semi-developed web project. Unfortunately, as I am beginning to use the 3rd party code, I'm realizing that there is a number of variable and class name collisions. I was curious to know if there existed a strategy to retrofit a namespace around this new code. ...and yes, there's equal blame to be passed onto myself for not utilizing namespaces, as well . Off the top of my head I am considering editing every .php file and adding: namespace facePalm; But I was curious to know if there happened to be a more elegant solution. Especially as additional revisions of the code are released, I would rather not have to touch & edit 30+ files.
