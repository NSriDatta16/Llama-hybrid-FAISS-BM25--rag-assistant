If you've set up your scene graph correctly objects outside your field of view should be culled early on in the display pipeline. It will require a box check in your code to verify that the object is invisible, so there will be some processing overhead (but not much). If you organise your objects into a sensible hierarchy then you could cull large sections of the scene with only one box check.
