Try the DataFormWebPart, it uses Xsl to render the resultset of an spdatasource. Create the webpart using SharePoint Designer (just open the datasources tool in spdsigner, and drag the desired list's fields on a aspx file, which you can delete once the webpart is done), change the SPDataSource's select query to use the ListName instead of the ListId in the html source (so it stays portable / exportable) and then export the webpart. You can even store the xsl in a separate file, maing it reusable for other webparts, allowing you to use a uniform rendering of similar webparts without recreating the styling etc. again everytime.
