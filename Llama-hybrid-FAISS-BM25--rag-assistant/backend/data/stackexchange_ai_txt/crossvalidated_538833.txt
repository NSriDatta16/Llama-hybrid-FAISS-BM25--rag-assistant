Determine a product's rating given a known 3-sigma tolerance

Consider a 100Ω resistor with a 10% tolerance. We can assume this is the 3-sigma value since this is typical in manufacturing. Thus, we can expect ≈99.73% of such resistors to range from 90Ω to 110Ω. Putting aside the fact that the manufacturer will re-bin resistors with a 5% tolerance, I want to figure out the average resistor's Ohms value and express this as a rating. One idea I had was to use rms. Something like this (using ≈1.11 to convert rms to average): $\delta=x±10\%=100±10\%=10$ $r=\frac{\delta}{\sqrt{2}\times1.11}+(x-\delta)=\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}\times1.11}+(100-10)\approx96.37\%$ Remember, I want a rating, hence the percentage. Using this same approach, a 100Ω resistor with a 5% tolerance would have a rating of ≈98.19%. How accurate is this approach mathematically? Alternate approach: Looking at the normal distribution, I realize that integration will answer my question. I know the height of the mode in a normal density is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}$ . What I don't know is the height at 3-sigma, or how to use integration to solve this question. I'm a software engineer, but not a statistician. How do I calculate this?
