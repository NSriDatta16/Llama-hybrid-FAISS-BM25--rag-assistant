Here is a solution (see section 3.3) which uses the Renyi entropy: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03816.pdf According to the paper, assuming that we have the Renyi entropy of the samples from each mode and the $p(x_i)$ for those samples, we can find the weight of each mode and the resulting estimator is asymptotically unbiased. In practice, however, the problem/challenge is how to find the entropy: The authors suggested to use the Information Theoretical Estimators package [1] for estimating the entropy. [1] Szabó, Zoltán.
