Persistent Shadow Copy in XP SP2?

I'm wondering if XP supports persistent shadow copying like Windows Vista/7 do. I read the wikipedia article about Shadow Copy and it had this paragraph (emphasis mine): The creation of persistent snapshots (multiple snapshots which remain available across reboots until specifically deleted from the system) has been added in Windows Server 2003 , allowing up to 512 snapshots to exist simultaneously for the same volume. In Windows Server 2003, VSS is therefore used to create incremental periodic snapshots of data or deltas (differences) of changed files over time. A maximum of 64 snapshots are stored on the server and accessible by clients or on the same server through network shares. This feature is known as Shadow copies for Shared Folders and is designed for a client-server model. The Shadow copies for Shared Folders client is required to be installed on Windows 2000 and Windows XP RTM and SP1. A copy of this client for 32-bit Windows platforms is available on the server or downloadable from Microsoft. It is built into the OS beginning with Windows XP SP2 . I interpreted this as XP having the ability to create persistent Shadow Copies, or partial copies of a file that exist even when the network connection is broken. If you can shed some light on the supported functionality I would appreciate it.
