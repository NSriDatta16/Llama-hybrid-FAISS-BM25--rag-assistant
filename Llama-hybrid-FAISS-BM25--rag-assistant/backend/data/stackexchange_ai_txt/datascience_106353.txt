I think I figured out a nice way on how to rank the datasets: The rank r(D) of dataset D is calculated by subtracting from the total number of datasets N_D the sum of the number of wins W_i of each observation i in D averaged over the total number of observations |D| in respect to the complete set of observations without |D|, which is N - |D|, multiplied the number of remaining datasets N_D - 1. So if all observations in D have N-|D| wins, the rank of the dataset |D| is 1. If all observations have no wins (they are 0), the rank of the dataset |D| is simply N_D.
