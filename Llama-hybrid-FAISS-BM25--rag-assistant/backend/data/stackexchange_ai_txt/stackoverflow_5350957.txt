"if a query in oracle takes the first time it is executed 11 minutes, and the next time, the same query 25 seconds, with the buffer being flushed, what is the possible cause?" The thing is, flushing the DB Buffers, like this ... alter system flush shared_pool / ... wipes the Oracle data store but there are other places where data gets cached. For instance the chances are your OS caches its file reads. EXPLAIN PLAN is good as a general guide to how the database thinks it will execute a query, but it is only a prediction. It can be thrown out by poor statistics or ambient conditions. It is not good at explaining why a specific instance of a query took as much time as it did. So, if you really want to understand what occurs when the database executes a specific query you need to get down and dirty, and learn how to use the Wait Interface. This is a very powerful tracing mechanism, which allows us to see the individual events that happen over the course of a single query execution. Each version of Oracle has extended the utility and richness of the Wait Interface, but it has been essential to proper tuning since Oracle 9i (if not earlier). Find out more by reading Roger Schrag's very good overview . In your case you'll want to run the trace multiple times. In order to make it easier to compare results you should use a separate session for each execution, setting the 10046 event each time.
