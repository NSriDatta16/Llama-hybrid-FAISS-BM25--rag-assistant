Pay attention to what the other posters said, it is highly recommended to stay away from regex when parsing markup languages. However, a pure perl way of accomplishing what you want without any modules and assuming the aforementioned tags do exist is: my $reg_subclass = '\ '; my $reg_city = '\ '; open my $in, "input file"; open my $out, '>' ,"output file"; while ( my $line = ) { if ( $line =~ /$reg_subclass|$reg_city/ ) { print $out $line; } } close $in; close $out;
