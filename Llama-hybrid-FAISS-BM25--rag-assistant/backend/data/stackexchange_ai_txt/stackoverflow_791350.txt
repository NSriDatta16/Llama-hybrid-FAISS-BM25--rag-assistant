If application is primarily for Windows - use .NET. If you're serious about porting later - avoid use of P/Invoke, .NET above 2.0 features and 3rd party toolkits with rich GUI (which aren't running on Mono) There are present nice and commercial .NET cross-platform apps including nice http://www.codicesoftware.com/xpfront.aspx plastic scm UI http://www.plasticscm.com/screenshots/gui27/visual/brexplorer04.png and many others - http://www.mono-project.com/Companies_Using_Mono Also many developers prefer VS IDE over Eclipse and C# over Java. But if your application primarily Windows - I bet it's better to use .NET. ESPECIALLY if GUI integration is main concern, because making Java applications look like native Windows still painful. Under .NET there are LOTS of controls for Ribbon interface (inluding native one). Try to find same for Java with proper look and you'll understand what I mean With Mono (if you will keep the main rules) most of the time you won't have a problem of porting and embedding Mono itself inside your application.
