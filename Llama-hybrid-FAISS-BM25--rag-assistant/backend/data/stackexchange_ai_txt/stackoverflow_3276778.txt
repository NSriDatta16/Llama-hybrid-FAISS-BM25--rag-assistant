Mapping class to instance

I'm trying to build a simple entity/component system in c++ base on the second answer to this question : Best way to organize entities in a game? Now, I would like to have a static std::map that returns (and even automatically create, if possible). What I am thinking is something along the lines of: PositionComponent *pos = systems[PositionComponent].instances[myEntityID]; What would be the best way to achieve that?
