SQL Server Reporting Services ReportViewer authentication

I'm working on a project involving the .NET ReportViewer, and I'm having issues connecting to the Report Server. I'm a .NET newbie so bear with me. I can't put up the code but hopefully someone will be able to give me a little guidance here. I dragged the ReportViewer control from the toolbox onto a newly created page. Eleventy billion issues later, I got to the point where it looks like it's connecting to the appropriate server. Now, I don't have any C# code in here. It's all in these fustrating tags. So, I have a tag. Nested within, a tag. The ServerReport tag has 2 attributes, ReportPath and ReportServerUrl. I added a second, ReportServerCredentials, but do not know how to format it. Every example I've seen has been using C# code to create the object, but I'd like to do this without going down that route. Is there a way to pass a user and password using the ReportServerCredentials="" attribute?
