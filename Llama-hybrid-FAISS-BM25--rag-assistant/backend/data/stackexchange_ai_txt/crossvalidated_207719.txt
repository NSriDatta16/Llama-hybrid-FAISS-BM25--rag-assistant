For a simplified analysis, suppose that the data $Y$ come from this model. To define notation, $X_S = 1$ for Swedish, 0 for Norwegian $X_M = 1$ for Method 1, 0 for Method 2 $X_1 = 1$ if measurement was taken first, 0 if second and $\beta_0$ is the average score for Method 2, Norwegian, second. Suppose average outcomes for the other conditions conform to $$E[Y(X=x)] = \beta_0 + \beta_M x_M + \beta_S x_S + \beta_1 x_1.$$ If we use four types of people as in the question (one of each) then $X = [\ 1\ |\ x_M\ |\ x_S\ |\ x_1\ ]$ has rank 4, with 8 rows (2 per person) and 4 columns. Swedish Method 1 followed by Norwegian Method 2: 1111 and 1000 Swedish Method 2 followed by Norwegian Method 1: 1011 and 1100 Norwegian Method 1 followed by Swedish Method 2: 1101 and 1010 Norwegian Method 2 followed by Swedish Method 1: 1001 and 1110 We have 8 measurements and 4 coefficients to estimate (not counting variance parameters). If we use only two types of people, language is aliased with time of measurement, so $X$ has rank 3. (The last two columns sum to the first column.) Norwegian Method 1 followed by Swedish Method 2: 1101 and 1010 Norwegian Method 2 followed by Swedish Method 1: 1001 and 1110 We can recover the quantity of interest $\beta_M$ by estimating the model $$E[Y(X=x)] = \beta_0 + \beta_M x_M + \beta_{N \& 1} x_{N \& 1}$$. This has one more degree of freedom left over for the error, so all else being equal, it's a tiny bit more efficient. All else may not be equal. Suppose the true data-generating mechanism takes the form $$E[Y(X=x)] = \beta_0 + \beta_M x_M + \beta_S x_S + \beta_1 x_1 + \gamma x_M x_S x_1,$$ so that people do slightly better when they learn Swedish first by method one. In an analysis neglecting interactions, this should hopefully show up as a slight increase in $\beta_M$; the improvement is proportional to $\gamma Pr(x_S x_1 = 1\ | \ x_M)$. The four-types-of-people design has this property, but the two-types doesn't: if Swedish is always second, we never even see this particular interaction.
