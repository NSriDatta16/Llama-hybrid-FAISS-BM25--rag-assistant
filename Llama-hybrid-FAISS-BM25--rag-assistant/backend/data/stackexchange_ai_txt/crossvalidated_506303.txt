How to choose a model? Residual deviance or AIC

I have two models of logistic regression with the same variables in the first model I got: Residual deviance: 61.097 on 73 degrees of freedom AIC: 79.097 in the second model, I added interaction between some of the variables from the first model and got: Residual deviance: 63.542 on 75 degrees of freedom AIC: 77.542 so based on the AIC, the second model is better, but how can I explain the Residual deviance?
