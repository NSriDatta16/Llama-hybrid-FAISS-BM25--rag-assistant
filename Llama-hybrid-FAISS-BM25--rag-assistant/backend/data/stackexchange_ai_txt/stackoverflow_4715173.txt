Find an OR Mapper you like and don't devote any more attention to the data layer. That is mostly a solved problem, and most of the attention you devote to that will be reinventing the wheel. Very people write applications whose CRUD needs are so unique that they obviate ORM use these days. Some of the same advice for the UI - find tools and frameworks rather than spending too much time on all of that, there's a lot of good development wealth in place there. So, concentrate on the service layer, where the unique nature of your application is really expressed. But we can't really validate or critique your service layer because we don't know anything about the problem you're trying to solve. All of the things you've listed are certainly good approaches for certain problems, certain sets of trade-offs, etc. Without knowing more about what matters (performance / development time / configurability / robustness / clarity), nobody can tell you what the right set of choices is. On your "output" item - other devices can support communication with your app as long as everything serializes down to a common format, usually XML. Then you just send it over the wire, and rehydrate it on the other end. Software development, when it is non-trivial is a Wicked Problem . It is likely that much advice that you get would need to be thrown out halfway through your project. I don't generally believe in grand architectures - focus on solving particular problems as well as you can, and if you're lucky, a pattern will emerge that you can take advantage. Anything more is generally hubris.
