How can I set distance between elements ordered vertically?

I have code like that: JPanel myPanel = new JPanel(); myPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(myPanel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS)); JButton button = new JButton("My Button"); JLabel label = new JLabel("My label!!!!!!!!!!!"); myPanel.add(button); myPanel.add(label); In this way I get elements with no distance between them. I mean, the "top" elements always touches the "bottom" element. How can I change it? I would like to have some separation between my elements? I think about adding some "intermediate" JPanel (with some size) between my elements. But I do not think it is an elegant way to get the desired effect. Can somebody, please, help me with that?
