How does convolution operation perform in CNN?

I know that convolution operation has the property, associative law. if I need to use multiple filters in succession and to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time for a computational benefit. But, I wonder if the convolution layer in CNN is really computed by convolving the multiple filters into a single filter ahead. To be honest, I just know the reason why the convolution filter is used instead of the correlation filter.
