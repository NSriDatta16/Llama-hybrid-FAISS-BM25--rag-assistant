What preprocessing techniques work well for autoencoding audio?

I am wondering what preprocessing techniques work well for autoencoding audio data? Specifically I have a dataset of ~0.5 second audio samples of people pronouncing digits 0-9 (think an audio version of MNIST). I would like to encoding them using an autoencoder and then use those encodings for classification using something similar to k-NN.
