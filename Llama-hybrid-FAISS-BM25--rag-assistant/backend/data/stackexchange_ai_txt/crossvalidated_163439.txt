You might try using NMDS instead. If you think about it, you are looking at abundance, diversity, and rarity of habitats. NMDS is traditionally used for abundance, diversity, and rarity of species , but I have a feeling it might work for your current issue. To do this, you'll need to create a matrix of presence/absence values. For instance, you might have rows representing the sites, with the column names representing the different habitat types and other site descriptors. For each habitat type you can enter the number of times it appears. By doing this, you will get similar results as a PCA. Even for rare habitats, you will get an arrow pointing in the direction of where the most commonly occur. If you include some other descriptors of the sites, you can investigate even more relationships.
