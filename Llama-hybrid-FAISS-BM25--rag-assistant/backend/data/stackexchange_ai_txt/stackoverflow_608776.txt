I've used XML_RPC (PEAR) successfully. I'm not personally a fan of the xml-rpc "way" but the library was simple to use and we have a few dozen clients using it daily and pulling a fair amount of data over the wire and we've never had any problems. We aren't pushing the envelope with this at all, in any way, but i'm very happy with the library since I don't even think about it anymore. The library isn't elegant or anything but neither is php or rpc, right?
