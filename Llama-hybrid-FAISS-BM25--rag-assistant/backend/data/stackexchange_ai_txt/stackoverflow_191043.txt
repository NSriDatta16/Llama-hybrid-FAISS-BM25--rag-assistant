How to get started creating CSS for given (dynamically generated) HTML?

The Separat ion of Layout and Content is the domain of CSS and HTML - so far well understood. Now about separat ing ... I'm looking for hints and Best Practices to get started with the task of providing a "skin" or "theme" for a content management system. Background: We are starting to embrace a Portal Server/Content Management System and are starting to change the look and feel to match our needs. Our designer has so far mainly worked with full control over HTML and CSS, tweaking either one in order to get pixelperfect layout. With adoption of the cms there's a lot precreated HTML (very semantic, almost no tables :) that needs to be skinned with CSS and Images. Though it is possible to change the HTML fragments, I'd prefer to do so only as a last resort. As this provides the challenge of "how to get started" my question is about any tipps how to proceed or articles that can help managing or organizing this task - e.g. best practices in designing, how to slice this task or what tool to use. It seems bad practice to just save a dynamically generated page to disk and make changes locally. This would be somewhat ok for the CSS files but changes to HTML elements must be retrofitted to the fragments that they are generated from. I'd like to keep this out of the designer's realm if possible. Also, the thought of Dreamweaver (or any similar tool) making implicit tweaks to the HTML structure is frightening for me. For the curious: The mentioned CMS/Portalserver is Liferay , but the question is really language- and tool-agnostic. Edit: FireBug (as Josh suggested) is awesome for trying on-the-fly changes to css. Is there more - either in the area of tools or in-process and self-organization?
