but it doesn't work for pages with non-default language(provided I created a language-specific version of a dictionary item) Vitaliy, Leveraging dictionary for this purpose is a proper way of doing it. The Text method of Sitecore.Globalization.Translate class is supposed to respect the context language, so that should work. public static string Text(string key) { Assert.ArgumentNotNull(key, "key"); return TextByLanguage(key, Context.Language); } Please file a ticket with tech support if that does not work for you.
