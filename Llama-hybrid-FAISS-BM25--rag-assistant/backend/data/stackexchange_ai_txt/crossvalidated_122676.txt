If I understand your question correctly, the "most even" distribution for you would be one where the random variable takes every observed value onceâ€”uniform in a sense. If there are "clusters" of observations at the same value, that would be uneven. Assuming we are talking discrete observations, perhaps you could look at both the average difference between the probability mass points, the maximum difference or maybe how many observations have a difference from the "average" over a certain threshold. If it were truly uniform in the observations, all PM points should have equal value, and the difference between max and min is 0. The closer the average difference is to 0, the more "even" the bulk of the observations are, the lower the maximum difference and the fewer "peaks" there are also goes to show how "even" the empirical observations are. Update Of course, you can use a chi-square test for uniformity or compare the empirical distribution function with a uniform, but in those cases, you will be penalized by any large "gaps" in observations, even though the distributions of observations are still "even".
