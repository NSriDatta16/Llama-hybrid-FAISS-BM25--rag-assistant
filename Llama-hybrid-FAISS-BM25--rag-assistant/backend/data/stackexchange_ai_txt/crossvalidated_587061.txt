My bias is that there is no silver bullet here and the results apparently depend on the particular models or tools chosen. Both EnvCpt and mcp are great tools. Here are some additional perspectives from another changepoint and trend analysis package Rbeas in R ( https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ): df On average, there is 1 changepoint detected; its most likely location is 1967 with a posterior probability of 0.1317 (not too strong evidence). The prob subplot below shows the probability of changepoint occurrence over time. The sgnSlp subplot shows the tim-varying probabilities of slope being positive (red part), zero(green part), and negative (blue part). The three parts sum up to 1.0. The green part is the largest, that is, the slope is most likely to be zero. In addition, the read part is larger than the blue part, that is, if there is a non-zero slope/trend, it is more likely to be increasing than decreasing.
