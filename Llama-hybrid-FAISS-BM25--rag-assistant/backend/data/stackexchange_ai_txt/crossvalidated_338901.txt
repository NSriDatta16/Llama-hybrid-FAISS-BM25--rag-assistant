An efficacy trial is more likely to determine the relative benefit of A vs B, but only in a setting so artificially constructed that its applicability to the real world is questionable. For example, patients in an efficacy trial may have repeated clinic visits and adverse event capture tools not present in the real world. However, because of the visits we can be assured that A and B were given throughout the trial and outcomes are more likely to be accurately measured. An efficacy trial attempts to determine the true, cosmic difference between A and B. A pragmatic or effectiveness trial obtains external validity by treating a broad group of patients with realistic regimens, but may suffer in its ability to isolate the A/B difference due to the inherent heterogeneity of the real world. For example, an effectiveness trial may compare A to B in patients using usual clinical follow-up as recorded in unstructured visits or using administrative data to gather outcome status. Because patients had the follow-up they would in the real world, we may believe the treatment regimen is more repeatable outside the research setting. However, important events may be missed due to the lack of structure. An effectiveness trial asks whether providers should write a prescription for A or B here on Earth.
