What you're currently doing is iterating the file character-by-character; you do not want to do that. Instead, you can iterate a file line by line this way: for line in open('myfile.txt'): ... and then you can check whether a line contains a certain string by doing: if 'organic' in line: ... and write those lines that you need: outfile.write(line)
