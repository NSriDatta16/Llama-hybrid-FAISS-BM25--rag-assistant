If I understand you correctly query_posts('p='.$number); should work. If you need a single quote ' in the string you'd escape the ' query_posts('p=\''.$number.'\''); or using double quotes (more elegant, and you can put the variable straight in. Dominik already suggested this in his answer) query_posts("p='$number'");
