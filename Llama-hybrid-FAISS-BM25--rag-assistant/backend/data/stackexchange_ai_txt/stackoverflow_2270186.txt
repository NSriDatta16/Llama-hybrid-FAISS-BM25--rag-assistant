Setting Jersey to allow caching?

I have the following returned from a Jersey @GET method. It works, fine but always includes the No-cache header. I'd like to allow the client to cache this data since it rarely changes. ResponseBuilder rb = Response.ok(c); CacheControl cc = new CacheControl(); cc.setMaxAge(60); cc.setNoCache(false); return rb.cacheControl(cc).build(); The response is always: Server Apache-Coyote/1.1 Pragma No-cache Cache-Control no-cache, no-transform, max-age=60 Expires Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00 EST Content-Type application/xml Content-Length 291 Date Tue, 16 Feb 2010 01:54:02 GMT That am I doing wrong here?
