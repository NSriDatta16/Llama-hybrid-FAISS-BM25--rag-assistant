It's possible for the correlation to change sign from $X$ and $Y$ to $\log Y$ and $X$ . One easy class of examples is when a transformation dampens an outlier that was exerting major leverage. Another class of examples is whenever an outlier is created by a transformation. The Stata code used to produce this example should be fairly transparent. clear input y x 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 10 1 end gen log_y = log(y) corr y log_y x Correlations: | y log_y x -------------+--------------------------- y | 1.0000 log_y | 0.9352 1.0000 x | -0.0516 0.2424 1.0000 The example is not especially blatant, but that is much of the point. You don't need extraordinary or outrageously pathological datasets to see this effect. The question is unclear, as is that on Statalist, on precisely what kind of model is being considered, but talk of covariance to me implies plain correlation and regression, so there is no obvious need to invoke any wider framework.
