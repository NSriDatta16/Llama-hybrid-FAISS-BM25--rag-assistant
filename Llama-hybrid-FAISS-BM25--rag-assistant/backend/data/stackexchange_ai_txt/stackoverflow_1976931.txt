You need to add a column for an insertion date or an incrementing key. You can't rely on the physical storage pattern to give you a correct ordering. According to the MySQL documentation, there is no guarantee that rows returned will be in any particular order. "...the result rows are displayed in no particular order. It is often easier to examine query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way. To sort a result, use an ORDER BY clause." http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/sorting-rows.html
