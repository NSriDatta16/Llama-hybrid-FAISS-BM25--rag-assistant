Confusion related to Kalman filters density view

I was reading this book related to Kalman filters and I didn't understand a couple of things. I have also attached the screenshot of the pages from the book where I had confusion. The book is Shumway, R.H. and Stoffer, D.S. Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples From the first page, I didn't understand how this was derived I mean how come we have $p(x_t|x_{t-1}) = f_w(x_t-\phi_{x_{t-1}})$ and has mean 0 and covariance Q. I mean it should be for the $w_t$ which has mean 0 and covariance Q not $p(x_t|x_{t-1})$ From the second page, I didn't understand the following I mean obviously $p(\mu_t|Y_{t-1} => N(\mu_t^{t-1},P_t^{t-1}))$. But I didn't get how we get that from the integral From the third page, I didn't get how this was derived I know I might be asking a lot, but I have spent several days to exactly grasp the derivation of the equations in Kalman filters. I would really appreciate if someone could help me. Thanks in advance
