I'd use an anonymous class constant and put it with the class it operates on: public class Cat{ public static final Predicate BLACK_PREDICATE = new Predicate (){ public boolean evaluate( Cat c ) { return c.isBlack(); } }; // Rest of the Cat class goes here } If the predicate has parameters, you can use a static factory method. Edit: As was pointed out in the comments, depending on the usage patterns, it may result in clearer code to collect the predicate constants (and/or factory methods) in a separate class, either only those for Cat, or all of them. It depends mainly on their number, how much additional organization is helpful.
