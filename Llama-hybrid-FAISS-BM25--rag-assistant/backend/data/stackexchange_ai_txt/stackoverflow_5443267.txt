Hah. There is no such thing as a " >" operator. What's going on there is basically equivalent to this: "" =~ '' =~ is, of course, the normal pattern-binding operator you normally use with m// or s/// . The '' is using the q{} syntax for literal strings, with > as a delimiter, and is interpreted as a pattern at run-time. The "" is a here-doc with q as the terminating string. I certainly wouldn't call this a comment though. Consider the output of this program fragment: "copacetic" =~ q/(c[a-z]+)/; print "$1\n"; >; This is crap, not a comment! q print "$1\n";
