I really enjoy working with RooFit for easy proper fitting of signal and background distributions and TMVA for quick principal component analyses and modelling of multivariate problems with some standard tools (like genetic algorithms and neural networks, also does BDTs). They are both part of the ROOT C++ libraries which have a pretty heavy bias towards particle physics problems though.
