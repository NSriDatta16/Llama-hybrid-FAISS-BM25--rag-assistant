Use the slider code from http://www.walterzorn.com/dragdrop/dragdrop_e.htm#addons . It's a single handle but the underlying drag-drop.js is very flexible. You just need to add your own second slider and programmatically lock each bars' min-max range based on the position of the other. You're looking at 1 12kb (lgpl'ed) script include and about 10-20 lines of code to implement this.
