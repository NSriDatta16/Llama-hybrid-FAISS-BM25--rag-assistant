The original question is miscast and many of the answers are problematic. The fact that a maximum likelihood estimate is $\infty$ when there is perfect separation is only a problem because we continue to use Wald statistics (i.e., we use the information matrix and standard errors) for inference. An $\infty$ $\beta$ gives rise to a predicted probability of 1.0. There is nothing wrong with this, although Bayesian models or shrinkage in a frequentist model is likely to result in a better calibrated model. Just use likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ test and profile likelihood confidence intervals and you'll get valid inference without changing the model. See for example this R package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ProfileLikelihood/ProfileLikelihood.pdf . I think we should be routinely be using Bayesian models but let's recognize that $\infty$ is a valid MLE.
