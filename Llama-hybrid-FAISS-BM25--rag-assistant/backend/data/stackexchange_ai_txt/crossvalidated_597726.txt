Causal Inference from incomplete observation data

A hypothetical pharmaceutical company organizes a poorly designed study as follows : It simply gives out its experimental drug to a pool of people with traits $X$ . Only some of them are actually sick and the chance of them being sick depends on $X$ . They only take the drug if they are sick, but doesn't necessarily do so (this is a mild disease and usually gets cured on its own). The company then get observational data (on all of them) about whether they have taken the drug or not and if they felt unsick afterwards, but doesn't get to observe if they were (or were not) sick to begin with. People who were unsick before, all report that they are unsick 'afterwards' too. How do I use this data to estimate $$P[Cured |X,D=1,T=1] - P[Cured |X,D=1,T=0]$$ where random variable $D$ and $T$ indicates whether they had the disease or not and whether they took the drug or not respectively? This probably is an impossible problem to solve without any additional assumptions. If so, what (reasonable) assumptions can I set, to make this problem tractable?
