How good will a neural network perform on an unusual data?

I want to make a simulation based on neural network that will estimate the situation label(not a discrete value) based on state values. Suppose I have data with 40 features/columns and one feature is limited in the range of 25-50, now the goal is the following, when simulating that environment I need to test some states where the value of that limited feature is out of that specified range. I need to know how such a simulation would behave, compared to reality. My initial thought was that the network finds the patterns between features and label, and if I give it an unusual feature value it can still estimate the label pretty accurately.
