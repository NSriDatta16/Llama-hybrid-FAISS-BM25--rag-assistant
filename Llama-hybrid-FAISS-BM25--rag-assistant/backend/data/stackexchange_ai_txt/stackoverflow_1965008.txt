How can I set a border around a control during runtime in WPF?

I have an Image control on my WPF Form. How can I create a border around it during runtime? Here's my XAML code: Also, I want to know how to remove the border. Maybe if I state my problem better there is an even better solution available. I have many Images, and when a user says: "Hey, just show me the woman out of all the picture." I want a way to sort of highlight or draw the users attention to whatever images I need them to see. I was thinking about adding a border, but maybe that's too much work for something that can be solved easier. Any help?
