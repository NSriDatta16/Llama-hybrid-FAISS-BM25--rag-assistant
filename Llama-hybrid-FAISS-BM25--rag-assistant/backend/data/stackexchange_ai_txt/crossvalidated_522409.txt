How to modify a logloss scoring rule for forecasted probabilities being a Beta distribution?

I've been reading up on scoring rules and posts such as this one Why is LogLoss preferred over other proper scoring rules? It's clear to me that if I have a set of biased coin and after examining each one I predict that heads is p_i for coin i then after flipping each one I can estimate my performance by taking the average of log(p_outcome) over many flips. So if I my p_heads forecast is: 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3 and I observe HHTH then my score will be: $ \dfrac{1}{4} \left[\log(0.3) + \log(0.4) + \log(0.3) + \log(0.3)\right] $ However what if my predictions were: Beta(3,7), Beta(4,6), Beta(7,3), Beta(3,7) What would my score be then?
