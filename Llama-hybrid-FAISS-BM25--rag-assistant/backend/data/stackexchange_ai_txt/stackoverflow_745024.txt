Windows pointer bitmap not being correctly updated

So, I'm writing a text editor, using MDI. I have a frame window, child windows and each child window has a text-area window. Now, my problem is the pointer. It's not setting itself to the correct bitmap. So for example, if I move the pointer to the border, it correctly turns into the left-right drag icon. That's all good and well - but when I then move it into the text-window area, it doesn't change back to a normal pointer . Which is wroooooooong. Any ideas why the pointer bitmap isn't being updated?
