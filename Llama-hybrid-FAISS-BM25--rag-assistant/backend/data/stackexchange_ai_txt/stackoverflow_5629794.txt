Similar question: Linq to Sql: Multiple left outer joins Microsoft Documentation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb918093.aspx#Y916 LINQ Examples from: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/bb737909 Left Outer Join A so-called outer join can be expressed with a group join. A left outer joinis like a cross join, except that all the left hand side elements get included at least once, even if they don't match any right hand side elements. Note how Vegetables shows up in the output even though it has no matching products. Public Sub Linq105() Dim categories() = {"Beverages", "Condiments", "Vegetables", "Dairy Products", "Seafood"} Dim productList = GetProductList() Dim query = From c In categories _ Group Join p In productList On c Equals p.Category Into Group _ From p In Group.DefaultIfEmpty() _ Select Category = c, ProductName = If(p Is Nothing, "(No products)", p.ProductName) For Each v In query Console.WriteLine(v.ProductName + ": " + v.Category) Next End Sub
