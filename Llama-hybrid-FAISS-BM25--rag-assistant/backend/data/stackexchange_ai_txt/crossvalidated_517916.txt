Unlabelled spectral data: use PCA to find distint spectra

I have many (Raman) spectra which are unlabelled. I would like to use PCA to distinguish them, i.e. say all these spectra are of type A, these other spectra are of type B... etc... Does this make sense? Do I have to do some preprocessing like normalizing the data, if yes how?
