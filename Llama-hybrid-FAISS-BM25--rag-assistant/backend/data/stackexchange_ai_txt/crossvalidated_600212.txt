Logistic regression works perfectly well with probabilities as target variable , that's the way to go. You can also use beta regression . Notice however that if the target variable is predictions from another model, training on it means that your model is going to learn how to imitate the other model, rather than would be similar to training on the raw data. Converting the probabilities to binary classes would lead to a loss of information. Moreover, to do this you would need to decide on a cutoff threshold and this gives you no guarantees whatsoever that the binary classes would be similar to the raw labels. I have no idea how you could turn this into a multinomial regression problem, so can't comment on that, but likely the above comment applies as well.
