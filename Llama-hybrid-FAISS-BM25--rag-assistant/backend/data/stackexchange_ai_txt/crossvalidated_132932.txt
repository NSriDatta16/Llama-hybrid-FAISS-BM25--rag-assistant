Nonparametric analyses typically use ranks . If you just want to know if >50% are greater than zero, then you could use a sign test, or the Wilcoxon signed rank test (which is an augmented sign test). Such tests don't tell you about the mean , though, they tell you about the median . If you want to know about the mean and your data are not sufficiently normal to trust the $t$-test, you may be able to use a bootstrapping approach. (Note that Peter's point regarding time series still applies here. These suggestions are inappropriate if you have serial correlation.)
