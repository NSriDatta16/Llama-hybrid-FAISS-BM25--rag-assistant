PCA does not assume your data can be written as a linear combination. It simply finds an orthogonal basis for your data, oriented by decreasing variation. Because of orthogonality you have also a linear combination associated. If your data have low dimensionality you need less dimensions to describe it, or at least to approximate it. I suppose this is what you mean by “it works”. Often data from audio and video have lower dimensions compared to raw data. This is the reason why often works.
