Flex 4 skins & binding

I love skins in Flex 4 - they offer a really nice separation between logic and styling. I was wondering how people use binding in skins. The easiest way is to just bind in the skin: label="{ hostComponent.model.buttonLabel }" you can also use 2 way bindings: selectedItem="@{ hostComponent.model.selectedItem }" but you could argue that this is logic so it should really be handled in the component. You don't really want to re-create all the bindings each time you create a new skin. That seems fragile and prone to creating bugs. So what are the alternatives? Creating a bucket load of event listeners I suppose. The adobe observe and observeValues tags could be useful as well I suppose. How do others handle this?
