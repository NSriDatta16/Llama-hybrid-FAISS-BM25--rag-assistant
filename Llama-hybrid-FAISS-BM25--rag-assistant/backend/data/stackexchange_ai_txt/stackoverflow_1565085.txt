It depends on what you are doing with it, if you are worried of SQL injections , then you can trust ActiveRecord, like doing: Examples.find_by_name params[:example] or Examples.find(:conditions=> ["name = ?", params[:example]]) On the other side, the common strategy of filtering is on display side, so you save the input as is, and you filter on display(views) by using h() . If you still want to save some HTML input from the user like when doing in rich editors, then you have to pay extra attention to XSS attacks , and so you have to filter the input. One great gem for filtering HTML is Sanitize , use it to save a modified filtered version of user input to use it in views.
