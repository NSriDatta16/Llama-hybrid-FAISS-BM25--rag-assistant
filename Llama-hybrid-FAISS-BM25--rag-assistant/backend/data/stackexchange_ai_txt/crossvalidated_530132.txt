Maybe the confusion comes from the short hand $p(\theta|y)$ which actually means $p(\theta|Y=y)$ , the random variable $Y$ interpreted as generating the data takes the fixed value $y$ , fixed after actually having observed the data? So the data are random in the sense of having a distribution as long as they're uncertain, i.e., not fully observed, and then they become fixed by observation. (Nothing particularly Bayesian about this, though.) Reading a comment on the original question, "To a subjective Bayesian, nothing is random" - nothing is really/objectively random (to a subjective Bayesian at least), however it can be random in the sense of being modelled by a random variable. So another source of confusion may be mixing up the use of the term "random" in a "philosophical" manner (referring to something that is "truly random", in the sense of having randomness as intrinsic property), and in a mathematical/technical manner, referring to something that appears as random variable in a probability model.
