I'd just use the find command to recur the subdirectories and mv to do the renaming, but still leverage Perl to get the renaming right. find /foo/foo/documents -type f \ -execdir bash -c 'mv "$0" \ "$(echo "$0" \ | perl -pe "s/\b([[:lower:]])/\u\$1/g; \ s/\.(\w+)$/.\l\$1/;")"' \ {} \; Cryptic, but it works.
