How to organize information about program solution?

Неllо. I develop system that works with stock exchange(system, below). And there is a lot of information my program need to interact with this system. This system has formal declared interface, but different details beside this declaration and requirements to my system is often changed. So how can I organize available information about this system and requirements to my program that it could be both easy to understand and easy to change.
