Instead of selecting the first 5 pages of 10 results select 1 page of 50 results! Make sure you use a typical user-agent so you don't look like a bot. To make yourself look less suspicious also follow some of the result links occasionally using Google's redirect URL, like a real user would. You can also rent proxies, but the above techniques should be sufficient for most cases.
