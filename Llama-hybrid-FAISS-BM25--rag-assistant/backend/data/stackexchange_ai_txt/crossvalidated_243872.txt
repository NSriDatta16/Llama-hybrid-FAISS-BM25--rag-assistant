When you say "optimise the clustering", I take this to mean that you wish to divide your clusters in an efficient manner. Before running k-means or bisecting k-means, it is advisable to run a principal component analysis (PCA) on your data. The PCA generates a scree plot of the Number of Clusters and the Within Groups Sum of Squares, and the point at which the Within Groups SSE levels off indicates the ideal number of clusters. The following link could also be of use to you: https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.1/mllib-dimensionality-reduction.html#principal-component-analysis-pca Run this test and see if you still get such a high concentration of observations in one cluster. It could be that an estimate of 150-200 clusters is in fact significantly different from the more realistic estimate.
