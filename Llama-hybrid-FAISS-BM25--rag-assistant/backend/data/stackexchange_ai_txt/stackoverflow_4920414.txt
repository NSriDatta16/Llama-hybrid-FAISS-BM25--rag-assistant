XHR requests are generally limited to same-domain requests; e.g, if you're on bertsbees.com, you can't use an Ajax method to pull data from twitter.com. That said, Twitter's API supports a popular data transport method known as JSON-P, which is really just a glorified injection technique. You simply pass it a callback method, and the data returned will be wrapped in your desired function, so it gets eval'd and passed in.
