If you don't like a ton of symlinks, another option is using the Aliased Multi-Site Support patch: http://drupal.org/node/231298#comment-1420180 This will allow you to specify in configuration that any requests for client1.domain.com should actually use /sites/client1.com/ instead of /sites/client1.domain.com/. Then when you move to production, you can just remove the configuration setting (though it doesn't hurt anything if you don't). This feature is part of Drupal 7, but as a new feature won't be added to Drupal 6. More good news is that you won't even need to use it in D7 just for file paths, since instead of storing the full path to files in the database, they use a schema such as public:// or private:// which Drupal then maps to the correct file system path, allowing multiple storage types/locations with much better portability.
