Machine learning self-learning book?

Possible Duplicate: Machine learning cookbook / reference card / cheatsheet? I wonder if there is a good self-learning textbook for machine learning? I am particularly looking for those in application-level, not so much theoretical. I wouldn't mind a math-heavy book, as long as you guys think it is suitable for self-learning. Thanks!
