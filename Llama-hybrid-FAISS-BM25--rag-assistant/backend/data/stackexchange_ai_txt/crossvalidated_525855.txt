Analytical expression of the log-likelihood of the Binomial model with unknown $n$ and known $y$ and $p$ and its conjugate prior

I'm trying to derive the MLE and Bayesian posterior for $n$ in the Binomial model, $\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$ with known $y$ and $p$ . The following questions arise How to derive analytically the negative log-likelihood (and its first-order conditions)? What is an uninformative prior for $n$ in this case (e.g., for $p$ one can use a $\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1)$ )? Is there a conjugate prior for $n$ ? What if the prior on $n$ is improper, i.e. discrete prior on $\{y_{max}, \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ ? Is there a proper solution? I tried to look around to found references but I was able to find rather technical papers that do not directly address this (simpler) case. References found so far: [1] paper1 , [2] paper2 . [3] paper3 : the most informative so far [4] paper4 addresses the case I'm interested in but does not show a direct log-likelihood maximization
