A table with a single column TimeOfChangeBetweenOpeningAndClosing? More seriously though, I would probably not worry too much about coming up with a single database structure for representing everything, eventually you'll probably want want a system involving recurrences, planned closures etc. Persist objects representing those, and then evaluate them to find out the closing/opening times.
