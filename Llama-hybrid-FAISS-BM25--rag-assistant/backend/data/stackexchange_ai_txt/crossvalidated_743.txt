Use of Bayesian Search Theory in geological interpretation

I was having a look round a few things yesturday and came across Bayesian Search Theory . Thinking about this theory led me to think about a problem I was working on a few years ago regarding geological interpretation. We were looking at the geology at one specific site and it was essentially made up from two different types of rocks. Boreholes had been drilled at different locations and showed differing amounts of the two different types of rocks at different levels in the ground along with different amounts of weathering of the rock. A number of geologists looked at the available data and all came up with different interpretations. It seems to me that Bayesian Search Theory could have been used in this case, particualrly where extra data was gathered with time, to give some indication of how likely the different interpretations were. Has anyone encountered a case where Bayesian Search Theory has been used in this case. Is there a standard frameowrk for doing this? I would have thought this may be something that the oil industry may have a lot of research on because it would be applicable to the search for oil.
