padding bug on Safari mobile?

(This is similar to the (also unanswered) question #3430506 , but applies to input tags instead of HTML5 elements.) On buttons, the iPhone/mobile Safari browser adds padding to the left and right. This doesn't happen on the desktop version, nor any other mobile/desktop Webkit browsers I've tried. It appears to add the font-size in px to each side (i.e. 14px font means total width is 14px + width of text + 14px). Currently I'm trying the following to remove it: /* webkit user-agent stylesheet uses input[type="submit"] */ form input[type="submit"] { /* more specific to override webkit */ -webkit-appearance:none; -webkit-border-radius:0px; margin:0; padding:0; border:0; display:block; } I've seen lots of responses about using -webkit-appearance:none... this makes no difference. Neither does removing rounded corners. I made a page to demo how the desktop version renders various -webkit-appearance objects; all have -webkit-border-radius:0 and the above code applied. Try viewing these on desktop Safari then iPhone: http://deleri.com/test.html (Safari Mobile screenshot for those without an iPhone:) deleri.com/safari.png While I'd love to know why this bug occurs, right now I'm more concerned about fixing it. I've tried every type of display/overflow/box-sizing/-webkit-anything-/width:auto/text-indent option imaginable, and can't fix it by manually setting the width (final width needs to be percentage-based, and the strange padding still applies). I'm starting to wonder if it's some obscure property, or if the user agent stylesheet isn't being overwritten. Any thoughts?
