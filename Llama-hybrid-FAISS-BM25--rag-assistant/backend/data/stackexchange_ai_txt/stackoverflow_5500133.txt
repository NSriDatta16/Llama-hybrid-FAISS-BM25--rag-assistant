Deploying a project remotely using Java Web Start

I am trying to deploy a project remotely using Java web start. Here it is working for a single jar file. Can anyone tell me how to deploy this for multiple jar files and as I am using SQLite DB which uses sqlite-jni.dll for its execution on windows? I need to include this file to in the JNLP. Any kind of help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
