Parametric v Non-Parametric?

I've recently began doing some data analysis for a sample of around 5800 respondents who are categorised into four different groups in relation to different levels of psychological connection in a community-based sport. When testing for normality, all of my tests are returning as significant (p-values; Kolmogorov and Shapiro-Wilk) and have shown a moderate to strong deviation from the normal range of skewness and kurtosis. I've also identified a number of outliers which are not faulty - e.g., are not incorrectly measured or affected by human response error. My first understanding was that as normality was not assumed, then non-parametric tests should be conducted to further examine the results - and in my case it seems as though it would most likely be a Kruskal-Wallis test. However, as a result of the large sample size, I have received advice to use parametric tests as although the assumptions of normality have not been assumed, the sample size should counteract that issue and should not undermine the validity of parametric tests? I've also received advice to simply do the initial normality tests and present the results without conducting any additional parametric or non-parametric testing ( for example; normality tests were conducted, the p-value was significant (p-value score) with the skewness and kurtosis indicating moderate deviations from normality, however, as a result of the large sample size, no further testing is required (as supported by....) ), again, due to the size of the sample with citations to support this approach provided when advice has been provided. If anyone has any constructive feedback / advice, that would be great :)
