You are right to question this. Indeed if we are only interested in the trend component it makes more sense to focus on that. The reason is that random variation due to noise, seasonal trends, etc. will make the alignment task of the DTW more demanding and potentially result in misleading results. That is because the alignment of localised features might take precedence over the overall trends; the potential misalignment of peaks due to noise or external factors would induce substantial error accumulation. A standard time-series decomposition technique like STL by Cleveland et al. (1990) STL: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (available in forecast::stl ) is fine to start with but do consider other algorithms too like Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) from Wu and Huang Empirical Mode Decomposition: a Noise-Assisted Data Analysis Method (available in Rlibeemd::eemd ) or (X-13) Seasonal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series (SEATS) from Dagum and Bianconcini's (2016) "Seasonal Adjustment Based on ARIMA Model Decomposition: TRAMO-SEATS" ) (available in seasonal::seas ).
