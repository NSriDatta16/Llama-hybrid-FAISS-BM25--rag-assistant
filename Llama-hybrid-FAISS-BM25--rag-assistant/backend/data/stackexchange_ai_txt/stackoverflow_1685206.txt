#pragma comment(lib, "xxx.lib") equivalent under Linux?

I have a static library file called libunp.a , I do know I could use gcc -lunp xx to link to the library. I could use #pragma comment(lib,"xxx.lib") to tell the Microsoft C/C++ compiler to include the library; how could I do it under Linux/GCC?
