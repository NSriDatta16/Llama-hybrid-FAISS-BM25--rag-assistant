LeNet is a family (LeNet-1, LeNet-4, LeNet-5) of convolutional neural network designed by Yann LeCun et al. The name is a play on his name and the French language, where "le" means "the", hence LeNet means "the network". I believe it was originally devised to recognize handwritten numbers on checks (cheques). LeNet is only one early instance of a convolutional neural network; many others exist today.
