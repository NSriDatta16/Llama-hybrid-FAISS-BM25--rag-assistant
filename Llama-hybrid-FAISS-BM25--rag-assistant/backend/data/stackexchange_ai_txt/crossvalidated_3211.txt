Ultimately this may not be solely a statistical exercise. PCA is a very powerful quantitative method that will allow you to generate a score or weights on its first few principal components that you can use for ranking. However, explaining what the principal components are is very challenging. They are quantitative constructs. They are not dialectic ones. Thus, to explain what they truly mean is sometimes not possible. This is especially true if you have an audience that is not quantitative. They will have no idea what you are talking about. And, will think of your PCA as some cryptic black box. Instead, I would simply line up all the relevant variables and use a weighting system based on what one thinks the weighting should be. I think if you develop this for outsiders, customers, users, it would be great if you could embed the flexibility of deciding on the weighting to the users. Some users may value years of experience much more than certification and vice verse. If you can leave that decision to them. This way your algorithm is not a black box they don't understand and they are not comfortable with. You keep it totally transparent and up to them based on their own relative valuation of what matters.
