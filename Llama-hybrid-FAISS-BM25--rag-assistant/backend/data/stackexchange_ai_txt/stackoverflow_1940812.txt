Best way for creating reports in ASP.NET MVC

What would be the easiest way to create HTML reports which are built of data crossing several tables? (Once the fields are picked they'll be static, meanning a single view is required) I though their ought to be something in the lines of a wizard letting you drag fields from your tables to a form and generates the logic behind...
