qTip doesn't work well with .live() events... I tried something like this: $('#shopcarousel a[rel]').live('mouseover', function(){... }) but it didn't work well because at times you would have to move off of the element then back for the tooltip to show. A better alternative would be to use a tooltip that binds with .live() events. I couldn't find many, and they are still relatively basic: Simple Tooltip (tutorial to make your own) Tipsy (I'm not sure if this is set up to load content using Ajax) monnaTip (from this SO answer )
