There's really not enough information provided to offer a suggestion. Was PCA run on the applicants (objects) or the features? Recall, a lot of principal components will be meaningless if their associated eigenvalues are low (less than one is a common default if the correlation matrix was used). Also, what are you trying to do with the data obtained from PCA? If PCA was run on the features, then there are no "features" if you only have the PCA-based data. Reason is because information from highly correlated (original) features will be collapsed together in the major PCs (1st, 2nd, 3rd,....), and you now only have PCs. So the answer is yes, you can run feature selection on the PCs for predictive analytics. If you also know the eigenvalues for the 28 features, then you can pre-filter the PCs to use for feature selection by using those PCs whose eigenvlaues are >1.
