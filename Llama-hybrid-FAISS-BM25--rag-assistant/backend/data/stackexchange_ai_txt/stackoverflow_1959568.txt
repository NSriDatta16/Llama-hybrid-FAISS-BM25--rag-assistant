If your system has run-parts then that will take care of it for you. You can name your scripts like "10script", "20anotherscript" and they will be run in order in a manner similar to the rc*.d hierarchy (which is run via init or Upstart, however). On some systems it's a script. On mine it's a binary executable. It is likely that your system is using it to run hourly, daily, etc., cron jobs just by dropping scripts into directories such as /etc/cron.hourly/ Pay particular attention, though, to how you name your scripts . (Don't use dots, for example.) Check the man page specific to your system, since file naming restrictions may vary.
