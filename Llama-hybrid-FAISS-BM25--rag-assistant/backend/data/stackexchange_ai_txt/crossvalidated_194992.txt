There are multiples measures. You need to understand the nature of your data/regression you are using. For example: MAPE is a pretty good measure for time series data, but will not work if has zero in the data or in the regression. The most used RMSE and MSE are used to minimize the error, not necessarily the accuracy. The most close to zero better the measure. For next step: It's good to use measures that will automatically compare you model with other models, so you will be able to tell if your model is better than guessing or random walk models. For instance: Theil’s U Theil’s U statistic is a relative accuracy measure that compares the forecasted results with the results of forecasting with minimal historical data. It also squares the deviations to give more weight to large errors and to exaggerate errors, which can help eliminate methods with large errors.
