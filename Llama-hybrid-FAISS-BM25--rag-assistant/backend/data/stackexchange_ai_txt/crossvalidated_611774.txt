What method of numerical integration do you have in mind? Many numerical integration methods rely on the smoothness of the integrand. Random forests are not smooth. Furthermore, in most cases, numerical integration does not work well beyond 2 dimensions. Safer is Monte-Carlo integration, which works no matter what smoothness and dimension. But trees consist of locally constant functions on axis aligned rectangles, and random forests are linear combinations of those trees. This means you can integrate analytically, you do not need approximations. The only problem is practical. Depending on the program you use to fit the model, you may not have (easy?) access to the data of the underlying trees, which you need to calculate the individual integrals.
