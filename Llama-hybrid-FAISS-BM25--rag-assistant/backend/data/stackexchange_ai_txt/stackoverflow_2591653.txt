Check if a Mail folder exists using Zend Mail

How can I check if an email folder exists using Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap, theres a createFOlder, renameFOlder and removeFolder and also a getFOlders but not exactly any fixed method to query if a certain mail folder exists? The GetFOlders returns a humonogous tree of folders to start with.
