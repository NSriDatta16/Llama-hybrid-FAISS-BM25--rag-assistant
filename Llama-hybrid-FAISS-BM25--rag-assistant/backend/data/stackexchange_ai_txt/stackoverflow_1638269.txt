I agree with Peter, this sounds like you do not have CLOB enabled. By default, ColdFusion creates DSNs with this setting disabled which limits text retrieval to 64K. To expand on Peters directions, do the following: Login to ColdFusion Administrator Under Data & Services, select Data Sources Click on your Data Source Name in question Click the Show Advanced Settings button 11 fields below the button, find CLOB and click the checkbox to "Enable long text retrieval (CLOB)" Go back up and click the Submit button to save.
