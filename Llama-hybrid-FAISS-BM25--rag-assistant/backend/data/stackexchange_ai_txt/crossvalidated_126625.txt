Just one additional remark for @amoebas's long (and really great) answer on the character of the $\Psi$-estimate. In your initial statements you have three $\Psi$: for PCA is $ \Psi = 0$, for PPCA is $ \Psi=\sigma ^2 I $ and for FA you left $\Psi$ indeterminate. But it should be mentioned, that there is an infinite number of various possible $\Psi$ (surely restricted) but exactly a single one which minimizes the rank of the factor matrix. Let's call this $\Psi_{opt}$ The standard (automatical) estimate for $\Psi_{std}$ is the diagonalmatrix based on the SMC's, so let's write this as $\Psi_{std}= \alpha^2 D_{smc}$ (and even some software (seem to) do not attempt to optimize $\alpha$ down from $1$ while $ \alpha \lt 1$ is (generally) required to prevent Heywood-cases/negative-definiteness). And moreover, even such optimized $\alpha^2$ would not guarantee minimal rank of the remaining covariances, thus usually we have this not equal: in general $\Psi_{std} \ne \Psi_{opt}$. To really find $\Psi_{opt}$ is a very difficult game, and as far as I know (but that's no more so "far" as, say, 20 years ago when I was more involved and nearer to the books) this is still an unsolved problem. Well this reflects the ideal, mathematical side of the problem, and my distinction between $\Psi_{std} $ and $\Psi_{opt}$ also might be actually small. A more general caveat is however, that it discusses the whole factorization machinery from the view that I study only my sample or have data of the whole population ; in the model of inferential statistics, where I infer from an imperfect sample on the population, my empirical covariance- and thus also the factormatrix is only an estimate, it's only a shadow of the "true" covariance-/factormatrix. Thus in such a framework/model we should even consider that our "errors" are not ideal , and thus might be spuriously correlated. So in fact in such models we should/would leave the somehow idealistic assumption of uncorrelated error, and thus of a strictly diagonal form of $\Psi$, behind us.
