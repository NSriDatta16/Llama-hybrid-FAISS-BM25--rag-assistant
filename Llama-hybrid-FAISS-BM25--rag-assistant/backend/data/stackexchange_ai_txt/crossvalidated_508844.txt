Regression With Uncertainty/Range In Target Variable

I have a question relating to what methods/machine learning techniques exist for modelling when you have uncertainty within your target variable (in regression problems). For example, suppose you have the following dataset (contrived example): you are modelling house sale price and you have recorded historical feature data and house price sale data for each house. Your feature dataset is: Feature Space: \begin{bmatrix} Square Foot & Number OfBedrooms & Number Of Bathrooms \\ 1000 & 3 & 2 \\ 1500 & 2 & 1 \\ ... & ... & ... \\ \end{bmatrix} With the corresponding house sale price for each house (feature row), however you are only able to obtain a range on the target variable (contains uncertainty) - perhaps law in this particular country dictates that the seller may only disclose a range and the exact value cannot be known: Target Variable: \begin{bmatrix} Sale Price (Target Variable) \\ 1000 - 1500 \\ 2000-2200 \\ ... \\ \end{bmatrix} My question is, what techniques exist to model such situations where you have a lower and upper bound on a target variable but the value itself is not known? Note that the width of the window on the target may vary
