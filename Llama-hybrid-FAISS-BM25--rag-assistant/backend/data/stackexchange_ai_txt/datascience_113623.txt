I don't think this has anything to do with NLP, your approach to treat this code as text is unlikely to work imho. The first thing to do is to properly define the task. You said that you want the system to return "only the relevant tokens such as animation, Animation.linear, duration etc.". So what should be defined as a "relevant token"? This is a programming language, so normally the language is finite. Maybe you can prepare a list of all the possible relevant tokens? In this case the task becomes simply about searching the subset of "relevant tokens" contained in the code. Note that you could also have a list of "non-relevant tokens", if more convenient. If "relevant" is based on the semantics of the code, the task is much more difficult. Basically you need to design the task similarly to what a human would do: what would be the clues you would use to decide if a token is relevant or not? How to represent these clues as features?
