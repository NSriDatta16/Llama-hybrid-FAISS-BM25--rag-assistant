What you propose looks OK. Since there is no estimated parameters, the number of degrees of freedom should be $10000 - 1$ . Then you can find p-values from the $\chi^2_{9999}$ distribution. But your last paragraph indicated the setting is different: I can get alerts when a drive is above a threshold number of fragments relative to the number of fragments parsed. So your situation is online, with information arriving continuously. That is often treated by control-chart s, but I don't know how you would compute control limits for such a chart. Alternatively, see it as a problem of sequential testing. Here is a paper discussing a sequential version of the chi-square test.
