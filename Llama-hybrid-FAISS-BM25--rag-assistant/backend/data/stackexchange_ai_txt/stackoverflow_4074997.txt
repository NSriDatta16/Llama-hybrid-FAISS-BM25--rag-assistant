Matching nth html paragraph not containing an image with PHP regex

I'm trying trying to use to insert content after the nth html paragraph that doesn't contain an image. So far I haven't been able to properly exclude paragraphs containing images. What am I missing or is this outside the effective use of regex? My code so far: $content = ' Some paragraph text s --> First paragraph to count. Second paragraph to count. Blah blah link blah Third paragraph to count. Fourth paragraph to count. '; $insert = "\n\n".' INSERT ME '."\n\n"; $pattern = '/((?:.*? (?! Thanks!
