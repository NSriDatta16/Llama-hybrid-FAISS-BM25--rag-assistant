Three books I consider essential for beginning OO programmers. "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code". Although modern IDEs often support automatic refactor, this book is still useful. By knowing the reason (or code smell) behind a particular refacoring, you can strive to write the correct code the first time. "Pragmatic Programmer" A wealth of best practices. "Design Pattern" Most advanced book, but still useful.
