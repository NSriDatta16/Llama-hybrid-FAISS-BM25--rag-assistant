How does WSAStartup function initiates use of the Winsock DLL?

How does WSAStartup function initiates use of the Winsock DLL? According to the documentation The WSAStartup function must be the first Windows Sockets function called by an application or DLL. It allows an application or DLL to specify the version of Windows Sockets required and retrieve details of the specific Windows Sockets implementation. The application or DLL can only issue further Windows Sockets functions after successfully calling WSAStartup. This function initializes WSADATA data structure, but in socket programming we don't pass WSDATA to any function so how does the program comes to know about the Windows Sockets version and other details? For example in this code #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32") void Run(int argc, char* argv[]) { char* host = argc h_addr; printf("IP Address: %s\n", inet_ntoa(*addr)); } else printf("ERROR: Resolution failure.\n"); } int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { WSADATA wsaData; if(WSAStartup(0x202, &wsaData) == 0) { Run(argc, argv); WSACleanup(); } else printf("ERROR: Initialization failure.\n"); } In this example I am initializing WSADATA data structure using WSAStartup() function and after wards I'm not passing wsaData anywhere. So how does my program comes to know about wsaData details? Thanks.
