What is the State of the art method for full body gesture recognition in images

I am working on gesture recognition in images and the best way that I am aware of, is whether using end to end approaches with deep neural networks or extracting body joint positions in an image and then doing some pre-processing on these joints positions and finally, feeding them to a classifier. I wanted to now what is the state of the art method for full body gesture recognition in images and if there are some good papers or a blog post reviewing different methods, as I have problem finding one.
