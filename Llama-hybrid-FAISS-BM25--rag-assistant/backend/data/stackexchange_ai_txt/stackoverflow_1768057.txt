How should one provide links in RESTful service using a non-XML data representation?

I've been doing a lot of reading lately about how to implement truly RESTful WS's. A lot of people have linked to the article here which details several constraints that implementers should bare in mind if the want to end up with services that conform to the REST concept. Whilst the post is clearly important, it is unfortunately fairly hard for us mere mortals to understand and various people have tried to decipher it . Perhaps the best explanation I have come across can be found here , where the author gives a concrete example of why many "RESTful" API's out there today really are not RESTful at all and shows how the situation can be rectified. His proposal leans heavily on the use of embedding links within the representations of the exposed resources and makes a lot of sense: I can clearly follow the logic and would like to employ such techniques myself in a set of services I am designing however I have an issue which I'm not sure how I should resolve: namely how should one provide such links if the data representations used are not XML but something like JSON instead? Everything the author says makes perfect sense in the XML world but I cannot clearly see how this can be reapplied to other content representations? Very interested to hear other peoples opinions and see how people may have tackled this problem in their own, non-XML based REST API's. [edit]: since I wrote this question I've found the following useful links . The go a long way to answering my question but I'm still interested in other people's opinions.
