The business value may relate to some monetary value of wrong/bad decisions. You can introduce the prices of: false positive false negative true positive true negative Then you can quantify the expected/average value of the classifier for any threshold. As a result, you can get the optimal threshold. From the business perspective, it makes sense to evaluate also the quality of the existing decision-making mechanism and compare it with your classifier.
