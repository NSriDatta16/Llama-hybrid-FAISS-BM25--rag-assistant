An exponentially decaying moving average can be calculated "by hand" with only the trend if you use the proper values. See http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/ for an idea on how to do this quickly with a pen and paper if you are looking for “exponentially smoothed moving average with 10% smoothing”. But since you have a computer, you probably want to be doing binary shifting as opposed to decimal shifting ;) This way, all you need is a variable for your current value and one for the average. The next average can then be calculated from that.
