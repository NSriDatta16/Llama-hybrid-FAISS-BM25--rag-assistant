Should i remove french special characters and apostrophes

I am working on a french text preprocessing task, in order to prepare the data to train an NLP model. But I do not know if it is better to remove french special characters and apostrophes or keep them. Example: Malgré que j'ai tellement aimé ce boulot je veut démissionner Becomes Malgre que jai tellement aime ce boulot je veut demissionner I have also noticed that most lemmatization libraries for french text are not at all efficient so i was wondering if I could skip this step, and also skip the stopwords removal step. In general the preprocessing steps will be : Remove URLs and Emails Demojize Emojis Transform number into text (6->six) Removal of all special characters including french special characters
