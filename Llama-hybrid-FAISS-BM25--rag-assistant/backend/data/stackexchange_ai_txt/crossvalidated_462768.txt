Small addendum to the @slow-loris's answer: for situations like @g-spea's describes, namely to assess the correlation between two matrices of pair-wise distances/differences, a Mantel test is commonly used. You can perform it with function mantel() in the R package vegan or in ecodist . By skimming Lichstein's paper it looks like MRM builds on the partial Mantel test and improves on it, but for two matrices MRM should be equivalent to a standard Mantel test. Indeed, in the following example: library(ecodist) data(graze) MRM(dist(LOAR10) ~ dist(sitelocation), data=graze, nperm=10) # compared to: mantel(dist(LOAR10) ~ dist(sitelocation), data=graze) The value or R^2 provided by MRM() is the square of Mantel's correlation coefficient r provided by mantel() . While mantel() only provides the Mantel's r and the p values associated to it, MRM() also seems to provide regression coefficients (intercept and slope).
