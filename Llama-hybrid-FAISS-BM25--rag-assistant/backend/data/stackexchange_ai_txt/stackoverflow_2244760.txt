Regex: Match thingies within paragraph

I want to match the values for A and C, but only if they are within the same paragraph. A:one C:foo A:two B:rofl, some rubbish ::: A:three B:lol C:bar Right now I'm using /A:([a-z]*).*?C:([a-z]*)/s But that gives me "two" and "bar", which don't belong together. How do I exlude the empty line in my /.*?/ ?
