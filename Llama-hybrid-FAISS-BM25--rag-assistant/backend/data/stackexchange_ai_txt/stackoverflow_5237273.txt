Beautiful Soup - identify tag based on position next to comment

I'm using Beautiful Soup. Is there any way that I can get hold of a tag based on its position next to a comment (something not included in the parse tree)? For example, let's say I have... paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 In this example, how might I identify paragraph 2 given that I'm searching for the comment " " ? Thanks for any help.
