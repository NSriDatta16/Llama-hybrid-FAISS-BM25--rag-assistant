I think you're using the wrong method on JdbcTemplate . The only one of the update methods that would seem to match your code fragment is int update(String sql, Object... args) If so, you're passing params and key as a two-element vargs array, and JdbcTemplate is treating key as a normal bind parameters, and mis-interpreting it. The only public update method on JdbcTemplate that takes a KeyHolder is int update(PreparedStatementCreator psc, KeyHolder generatedKeyHolder) So you'll need to rephrase your code to use that.
