No, I do not believe there's any formal test that you can apply. (By the way, the usual term for such samples is pooled .) You are right that repeating the blot will not tell you more about the biological variance in population. You could try to look up the variance obtained by others in similar, but non-pooled experiments (if there is any), and use it to make a very rough and informal test. But I would suggest you to stick to non-statistical comparisons, because to achieve significance with $n=6$ the differences would need to be obvious anyway. EDIT - would like to clarify my reasoning, in response to good points by @whuber below: I agree that any comparison, or any logical reasoning at all, should follow basic rules of statistics and probability. Probably a better way to express what I (and @Joshua?) meant is that at small $n$, conclusions are very dependent on the priors . In the given situation, using my experience, I could make some guess of the variance in protein expression between healthy animals, but if $n=1$, I have only my guess to plug in a test. With $n=3$, I might still want to check whether the estimated variance corresponds to my expectations, and with $n=100$ I throw the guess out the window, because the estimate by now is likely more reliable than my expertise. While the Bayesian framework can incorporate all that, converting expertise to actual numeric values is very complicated, and we end up with a conclusion "groups look kinda different" . That is what I meant by a non-statistical comparison. It is certainly crude, but I believe that the discussion section of any study is just such eyeballed conclusions combining data with prior knowledge.
