It's possible that if your table is large, you'd benefit from indexes on F1 and BATCHID in the tbl_TempCatalogue table. It's not clear what DBMS you're using, but most have decent tools to show you an execution plan. If you're doing full table scans on a large table, that may take a long time to run. Also, you say that the "insert into" is slow, but you include just the code for the select. Is the select slow by itself?
