If a time series is second order stationary, does this imply it is strictly stationary?

A process $X_t$ is strictly stationary if the joint distribution of $X_{t_1},X_{t_2},...,X_{t_m}$is the same as the joint distribution of $X_{t_1+k},X_{t_2+k},...,X_{t_m+k}$ for all $m$, for all $k$ and for all $t_1,t_2,...,t_m$. A process is second order stationary if its mean is constant and its autocovariance function depends only on the lag. Therefore does second order stationary imply strict stationary? Also under second order stationary it says that no assumptions are made about higher moments than those of first and second order. First moment corresponds to the mean, does the second moment correspond to the autocovariance?
