Learning the Structure of a Hierarchical Reinforcement Task

I've been studying hierachial reinforcement learning problems, and while a lot of papers propose interesting ways for learning a policy, they all seem to assume they know in advance a graph structure describing the actions in the domain. For example, The MAXQ Method for Hierarchial Reinforcement Learning by Dietterich describes a complex graph of actions and sub-tasks for a simple Taxi domain, but not how this graph was discovered. How would you learn the hierarchy of this graph, and not just the policy?
