Vista & C# - Drag & Drop problem (not related to elevation)

Application in question is .Net 2.0 Framework WinForms. It is supposed to work on large user base (installation from CD). Installation done using InnoSetup. On two machines, application does not accept Drag & Drop (both application and source of D&D have same elevation level). By adding Read & Read&Execute rights to INTERACTIVE SID for application shortcut, this problem appears to be solved. Question: how adding those rights and D&D are related and how to check / set those rights in Installation process?
