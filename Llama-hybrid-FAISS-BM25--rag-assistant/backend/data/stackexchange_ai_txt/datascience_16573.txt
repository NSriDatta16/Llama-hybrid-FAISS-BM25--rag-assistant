Clustering is the process by which you create groups of similar items so that the difference between the items within groups is minimised and the difference between the items in different groups is maximised. Therefore, you are on the right track, as the previous answer already stated. You could start by something simple, like k-means, and then keep improving your model depending on the results (another simple option is hierarchical clustering). However, there are several things that you should take into account. For instance, it may be advisable to normalise/standardise the data before clustering, so that the relative importance of all the features is the same. Additionally, some methods (like for instance k-means) require a priori knowledge of the number of groups in your data. Therefore, if you don't have such knowledge, you will have to decide how to test your clustering results for several numbers of clusters and how will you choose the best model. PCA is not a clustering algorithm, but a dimensionality reduction algorithm. If your data has only three features, I don't really think that you would need PCA beforehand. Clustering methods based on distance metrics do not perform well in case of higher dimensional data (however, some tricks can still be used), but three features is not bad in that regard. However, applying PCA may be useful if you want to visualise the groups and your data. Once again, since you only have three features, just making a 3D plot may be enough. Just start applying some methods, explore your data, and let the results help you decide what the next step is.
