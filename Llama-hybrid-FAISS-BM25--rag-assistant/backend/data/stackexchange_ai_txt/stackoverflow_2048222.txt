how to transform XML files before processing xinclude

I have numerous XML files that are organized into different directories. I need to combine them and transform the result using XSLT. So far, I have already done this except for one problem: some XML files need to be transformed first before it can be included into the result. xinclude seems to ignore the xml-stylesheet declaration. How can i transform XML files before they are xincluded? Regards, [ simon.cpu ]
