BackgroundWorker slow

i am developing a project (WPF) and i have a Datagrid the load more than 5000 records from the database so i used a BackgroundWorker to advice the user the data is loading but it is so slow , i need to wait almost 2 minutes to load the data from the database,instead if i don't use the BackgroundWorker i need to wait just 3 second to load the data in the Datagrid. Here i write down the code snippet that i use for the BackgroundWorker : private void RunWorker() { worker = new BackgroundWorker(); worker.WorkerReportsProgress = true; worker.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true; worker.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(worker_DoWork); worker.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(worker_RunWorkerCompleted); worker.ProgressChanged += new ProgressChangedEventHandler(worker_ProgressChanged); worker.RunWorkerAsync(); } private void worker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) { BackgroundWorker senderWorker = sender as BackgroundWorker; dc = new DataClasses1DataContext(); var query = from c in dc.Contact_DDBB_Xavis select new { c.ContactID, c.Continent, c.Country, c.City, c.PostalCode, c.CompanyName, c.UserCreated, c.DateCreated, c.UserModified, c.DateModified }; if (query.Count() > 0) { for (int i = 0; i now i don't know if there is something wrong in my code so i ask you some advice to how load faster the data from database without wait so long time. Thanks for your attention. Have a good time. Cheers
