Outliers for classification; imbalanced data for regression?

When I hear of the terms "outliers" and "imbalanced data" it's usually in the context of regression and classification respectively. With "outliers" meaning the continuous response falling substantially outside of the rest of the data and "imbalanced data" meaning the discrete response is primarily of one class. Is there a such thing as outliers in classification (I'm not talking about leverage here, I'm strictly talking about outliers in the response)? Is there a such thing as imbalanced data in regression?
