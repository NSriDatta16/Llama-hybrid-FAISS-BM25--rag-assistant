Your question is reading, but title implies writing? When reading, consider (bit don't blindly use) temporary tables to cache data if you're going to do some processing. However, by simple calculations I assume aggregates live AVG, MAX etc? It would generally be inane to drag data around, cache it in the client and aggregate it there. If batch uploads: SQLBulkCopy or similar to a staging table Single write from staging to final table with If single upload, just insert it A million rows a day is a rounding error for what SQL Server ('Orable, MySQL, DB2 etc) is capable of Example: 35k transaction (not rows) per second
