Recommendation for finding trends in variable data

I have about 40 variables for each subject in a human population. For each time period, people join and exit the study. As a made up example, I want to see whether there are increases in average spending on movies as time progresses. The problem is that my population is very volatile, there could be 15% male in one time period and 99% male in another. Given that this is the case, how can I figure you whether the increase I observe is due to actual increase, population change or just variance? What I'm looking for is what subject I should be learning to address this problem. A particular textbook on clustering, regression? Or something like that. I cannot change or resample the data I'm given and I'm looking for something that's masters or bachelors level.
