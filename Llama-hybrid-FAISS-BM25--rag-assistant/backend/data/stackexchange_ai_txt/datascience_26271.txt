Simple logistic regression wrong predictions

In the following example, the prediction obtained for $x=[0,0]$ after fitting the model is $1$, but expected is $0$. X = np.array([ [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1] ]) Y = np.array([0,1,1]) model = LogisticRegression() model.fit(X,Y) x = [0,0] y = model.predict([x])[0] It only works if I duplicate the training row of ($x=[0,0], y=[0]$) But why?
