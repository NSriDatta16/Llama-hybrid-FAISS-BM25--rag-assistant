Can you try if the following works: -U"Albert Last" I can vaguely remember that I have done it this way a long time ago. The error you see in your comment has something to do with your format file ( c:\RFID.xml ), not with your username. Possibly you do not have write access to c:\ ? Can you try it with a relative path, just RFID.xml ? And make sure you then run the bcp command from a location where you have write access.
