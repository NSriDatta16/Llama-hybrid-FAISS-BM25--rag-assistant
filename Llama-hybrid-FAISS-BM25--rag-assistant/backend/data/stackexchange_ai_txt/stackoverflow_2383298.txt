It appears that I was wrong about the simultaneous transfer speeds. The 250KB/s speeds up and down were miscalculated by the transfer program (seemed to have been showing a high average speed). Apparently the Business Ethernet (in this case it is an XO circuit provisioned by Speakeasy) only supports 3Mb total, not up AND down (for 6Mbit total). So if I am transferring up and down at the same time in theory I should only have 1.5Mbit up and down or 187.5KB/s at the maximum (if there was zero overhead).
