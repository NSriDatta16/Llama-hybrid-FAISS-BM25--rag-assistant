How to apply a mask to a String?

Hi I have a credit card number as a String. I need to apply a mask to hide the CC number: I have "123-123-123" and I need to get something like "123-XXX-123" Is there any elegant way to do this? I'm trying to avoid using severals substring() functions... Thanks in advance
