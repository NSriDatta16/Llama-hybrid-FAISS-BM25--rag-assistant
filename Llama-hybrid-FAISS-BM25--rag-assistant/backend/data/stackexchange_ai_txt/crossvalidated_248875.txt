Distribution (or transformation) for data with heavy lower tail and light upper tail?

The data is maximum yield in pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry $Y(\text{II})$ or $\phi_{\text{II}}$ , so the support is $x\in[0,1]$ . Below are some qqnorm plots for the data and some ML distributions fit with fitdistrplus . I choose Beta and Gamma distributions based on the output of descdist . Gamma seems interesting given the tail behavior is similar (low tail lighter than normal , upper tail heavier), but still far from being compatible. After reading about Lambert W transformation and the LambertW package, I was able to 'gaussianize' this data using MLE_LambertW with type = 's' . My question is whether there are any other distributions/transformations better suited for this data? The maximum yield is one variable in a multivariate GLMM using the MCMCglmm package. While this transformation seems sound (and reduces my analysis to simple MANOVA if I end up disregarding random effects), I'm curious if there is anyway to model this distribution directly? EDIT: Better is arbitrary of course, but for the case of most model fitting I know , a transformation is either to induce better compatibility with a normality assumption or to stabilize mean-variance relationship. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems inappropriate to use data that is clearly not normal (and not even trivially so) for a classical MANOVA. A generalized linear model would allow for the specification of the residual distribution for each response. So my question is how might you model such a distribution?
