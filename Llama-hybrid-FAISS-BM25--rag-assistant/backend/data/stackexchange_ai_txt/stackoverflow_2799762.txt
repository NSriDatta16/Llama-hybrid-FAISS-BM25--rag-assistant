Stop doxygen (in some directories) for recursive input

I've used this tuto ( http://www.duckrowing.com/2010/03/18/documenting-objective-c-with-doxygen-part-ii/ ) to create my documentation... I would like to run doxygen in some directories and not in others! The problem is that I don't want to reorganize all the directories! Is it possible to put a file in the directories I don't want doxygen to run into? Thanks in advance!
