For most of the things I've worked on, the MVC framework seems too bloated. I prefer to use a templating engine, like smarty ( www.smarty.net ) You still get the same separation of code and presentation. I find it's creates neater organization of code, where you're managing all the files and directory structure. Code can be grouped logically, rather than by pages.
