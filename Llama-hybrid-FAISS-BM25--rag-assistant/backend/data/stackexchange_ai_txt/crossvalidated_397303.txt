Machine learning to estimate p(y>N | X) where N is a duration

To illustrate, let's say I have a mobile game and I want to predict the duration of each session $y$ when they start. Say I have a training set with multiple useful features $X$ from previous sessions and their corresponding $y$ . If I want to use those features to directly predict future sessions duration, I have a regression problem. How can I, however, predict the probability that a session will take longer than $N$ , for any value of $N$ ?
