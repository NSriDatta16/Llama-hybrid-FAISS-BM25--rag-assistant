You say that you want to serialize the form in its partially completed state. From your question and various comments it sounds like you are trying to use serialization as a way to avoid using separate storage. However, that's not what serialization is about. Serializing is turning some object, usually in memory, into a known format (for example, an XML file) so that it can be transmitted across a network or persisted in a database. Serialization implies nothing about what you do with an object in its serialized form, only that it is in a serialized form. Sorry if this is cookie-cutter, but I think it's made pretty clear: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization Edit: maybe you understand what I said above already - are you looking to, for example, put the serialized form into the session? Edit 2: Okay, I think I get it. You're okay with saving a serialized form to a database but you'd rather not save individual form inputs to a DB - in the same way you would save a completed form. So, you're looking for a way to persist incomplete forms differently from completed ones. To this end, I would create a new table in your database for this exact thing. It could have a single data column (which stores the serialized data) or the same columns as your normal (completed form) table, just without the constraints you mentioned. Does this make sense?
