Grouping several groups in XSLT 2

I'm trying to add hierarchy to some grotty extruded typesetting XML. I can't seem to manage grouping several kinds of groups in the same parent element at once. What I have (simplified, obviously): A section title here A paragraph. Another paragraph. Bulleted list item. Another bulleted list item. Another section title Yet another paragraph. What I want: A section title here A paragraph. Another paragraph. Bulleted list item. Another bulleted list item. Another section title Yet another paragraph. This almost works for the list items: but it only handles the very first list in an article; and as soon as I try to add another xsl:for-each-group to cover the sections, the list-item one stops working. Ideas? Many thanks in advance!
