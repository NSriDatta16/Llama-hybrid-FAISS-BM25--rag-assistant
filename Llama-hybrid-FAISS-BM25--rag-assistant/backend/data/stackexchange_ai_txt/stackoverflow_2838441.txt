"Better" sounds intimidating, since it's hard to tell how your learning style works and what's better for you. (I guess I like the ABC approach.) So, instead of listing things that will be hit or miss, I'll try one resource that has both quantity and quality. The PowerBuilder Developer's Journal has a large online archive of old and fairly recent articles online. (The current issue gets online pretty quickly, but I wouldn't venture to guess how quickly.) Like any technical journal, the quality of the articles can vary, but IMHO stays pretty high on average. They'll range in topic from navel-gazing speculations to detailed instructions on how to accomplish very specific goals. I'm not sure it's necessarily great for starting off, but it's a good place to go once you've dragged your way through the ABC tutorial in the PowerBuilder manuals. Good luck, Terry.
