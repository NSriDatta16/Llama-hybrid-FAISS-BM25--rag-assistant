I recommend you read Amy Fowler's recent blog post (especially point 6): Any Swing component can be embedded in a JavaFX scene graph using the SwingComponent wrap() function. This conveniently allows you to directly leverage those Swing components which you've already configured, customized, and hooked to your application data; all that Java code can remain happily unmodified. Once you've created the structure of your scene's layout, you can pull your Swing components into the appropriate locations. http://weblogs.java.net/blog/aim/archive/2009/06/insiders_guide.html
