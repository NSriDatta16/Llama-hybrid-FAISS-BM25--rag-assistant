I believe that the best result will come from building 3 binary logit models separately and using them together with the logistic regression formula. Model 1: Y=1 for the 2's, Y=0 for the 1's, drop all others Model 2: Y=1 for the 3's, Y=0 for the 1's, drop all others Model 3: Y=1 for the 4's, Y=0 for the 1's, drop all others Now that each model produces estimates to build a logit the estimated probability is calculated like: P(Y=2)=e^logit1 / (1+e^logit1+e^logit2+e^logit3) After the others are calculated, P(Y=1) = 1-P(Y=2)-P(Y=2)-P(Y=3) I believe this will yield the best result, especially if some independent variables are strong versus 1 response but not the others.
