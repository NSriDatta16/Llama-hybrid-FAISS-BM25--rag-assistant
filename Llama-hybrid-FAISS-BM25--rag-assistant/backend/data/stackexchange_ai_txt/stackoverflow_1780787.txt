I know this question already has an accepted answer, but there's much more you can do than just caching. For example: Use BGP to establish a network of geographically distributed servers, reachable via Anycast. This can reduce the average number of hops that a DNS query packet has to traverse. Eliminate latency-containing infrastructure. For example, host your DNS servers with your ISP or at a large Internet peering point instead of at the slow end of a WAN. Avoid CNAME records; prefer A records instead. CNAMEs often require multiple queries to resolve. Use a robust, high-performance commercial service, such as UltraDNS.
