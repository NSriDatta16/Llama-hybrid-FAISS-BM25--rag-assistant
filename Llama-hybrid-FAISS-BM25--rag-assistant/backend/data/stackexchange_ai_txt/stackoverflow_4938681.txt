Just had to address this in one of my projects and came across this question while searching for a better resolution. My hack looks like this: $orders = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->getCollection(); $orders->getSelect() ->where('total_paid=grand_total'); It annoys me that such a basic functionality of databases is overlooked by Magento's ORM.
