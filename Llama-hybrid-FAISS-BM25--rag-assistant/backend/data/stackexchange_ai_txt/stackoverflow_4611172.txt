To quote http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes : "How can I indicate that my distribution only works on a particular operating system?" While it isn't a very elegant solution, the recommend approach is to either die in the Makefile.PL or Build.PL (or BAIL_OUT in a test file) with one of the following messages: No support for OS OS unsupported CPAN Testers tools will look for one of those phrases and will send an NA (Not Available) report for that platform. "How can I stop getting FAIL reports for missing libraries or other non-Perl dependencies?" If you have some special dependencies and don't want to get CPAN Testers reports if a dependency is not available, just exit from the Makefile.PL or Build.PL normally (with an exit code of 0) before the Makefile or Build file is created. exit 0 unless some_dependency_is_met();
