One approach is to treat each house as a time series, and then cluster the time series. Some approaches have adapted k-means to times series data, see the R package kml . I also like using mixture models though for similar problems, as the underlying time series can be quite flexible. Here I have an example using pytorch , and the R package flexmix is quite good as well. flexmix also extends to data if it has unequal time stamps. You pass the data in long format and give it a grouping factor. See here for an example. A final example I have see is estimate various time series characteristics for each individual series (e.g. ARIMA), and then cluster those characteristics. So each house is turned into a single row in that scenario.
