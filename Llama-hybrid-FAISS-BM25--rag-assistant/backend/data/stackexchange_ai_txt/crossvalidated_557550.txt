Performance Metrics for Classification Models with an Ordinal Response Variable

Suppose a hospital wants to use a statistical classification model to predict what kind of surgery will be required based on some measured covariates (e.g. height, weight, age, blood pressure, etc.). Suppose there are 5 types of surgeries, in order of increasing severity (i.e. "ordinal") : Local Anesthesia (same day release) Full Anesthesia (same day release) Overnight Stay 48 Hours Monitoring Long Term Monitoring Suppose the researches have access to historical data and decide to fit a multi-class classification model (e.g. random forest) to this data - however, now they are interested in studying the misclassification rates of this model. In particular, they want to know "how wrong the model was when it makes a mistake?". For example: Case 1: If the patient actually required a Local Anesthesia Surgery and the model predicted Overnight Stay vs. Case 2: If the patient actually required a Local Anesthesia Surgery and the model predicted Long Term Monitoring Even though in both cases the model prediction was incorrect, the prediction in Case 1 was closer to the truth compared to Case 2 : In Case 1, the model was off by 2 levels whereas in Case 2, the modal was off by 4 levels. My Question: Although it would be relatively straightforward to build a variant of a confusion matrix that showed how severe the misclassification rates are, provided the model prediction - are there any common metrics that can be used to study this? Is this a common modelling practice? Thanks!
