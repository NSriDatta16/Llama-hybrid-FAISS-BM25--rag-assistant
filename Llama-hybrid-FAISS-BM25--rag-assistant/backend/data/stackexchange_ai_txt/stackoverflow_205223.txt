The best way is to use gacutil -i Library.dll . The only problem with gacutil is that it is not in the default PATH of the system. It is however in a fixed location relative to the windows directory, for a given .Net Framework version. So you can use the following command line to execute it from anywhere: %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v1.1.4322\gacutil -i PS: just copying your assembly into c:\windows\assembly won't work. Explorer only shows a simplified view of the folder, which contains in fact lots of different folders for different kinds of assemblies. Doing a copy in it from an installer won't trigger all the operations done by explorer on a drag-and-drop. (written here because I don't have enough reputation yet to comment on other posts).
