How to report results of a polynomial regression with a discrete independent variable

I have been recently trying to fit a linear model to my data. The dependent variable is continuous and the independent variable is numeric and discrete. When I first test the assumptions concerning the data structure in order to run a linear regression I observe violations of the assumptions of linearity and normality. The relationship between my independent variable and my dependent variable is nonlinear, and residuals are not normally distributed: Here a plot of the relationship between y and x (plus a line of predicted values using a linear regression): Here some plots to test linearity and normality assumptions: After that, I tried unsuccessfully to linearize the relationship between the variables by transforming the data (by doing log(y); log(x); sqrt(y). etc...), but I did not find any transformation that satisfactorily increased the linearity. Thus, I decided not to run a prototypical linear regression but a polynomial regression, using a quadratic polynomial. The model that I have run is as follows: model By running the polynomial regression I obtain the next residuals and coefficients: Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.30465 -0.65161 0.01504 0.60506 1.95826 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.3617770 0.0036701 643.52 Here a plot of the polynomial fitting the data: Some questions: 1) By running a linear regression (y~x) I get R2=0.1747. When running the quadratic regression I get R2=0.1781. Giving this R2 and giving that there is a violation of the linearity assumption: should I keep the quadratic regression as a better fit of my data? 2) In a prototypical linear regression (y = b0 + b1*x) the way to read the output of x (our predictor effect or effect size) is quite straightforward: "for every increase of x by 1, the effect of x on y is b1". However, for the quadratic regression, the interpretation of the effect of x on y seems to be a bit more complicated. How could I report (read, explain) the effect of my independent variable (in the current case) in an elegant way? I really appreciate suggestions.
