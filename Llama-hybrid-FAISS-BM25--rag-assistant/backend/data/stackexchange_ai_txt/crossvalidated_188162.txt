Selection of Loss Function for Weather Insurance

I am using machine learning to predict agricultural yields using weather variables as inputs. I have been thinking about what loss function to optimize. I have been using RMSE thus far. The insurance payouts will only be triggered if yields drop below a threshold below the mean. However, the value of the payouts will be tied to the predicted loss so the payouts are not simply a binary outcome. Thus, the payouts are effectively max(0, f(inputs)). For optimization, I was wondering if there was a best criteria for this kind of situation. Should the loss function merely be that max(0, negative deviation from mean)?
