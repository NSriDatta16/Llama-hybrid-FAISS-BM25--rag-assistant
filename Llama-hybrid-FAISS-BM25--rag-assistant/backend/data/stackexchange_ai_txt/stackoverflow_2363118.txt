jQuery modal plus drag and drop

I am using jQuery to build a magentic refrigerator game where you create sentences from the word bank. I have a list of 90+ words. I would like for the user to be able to open the word bank in a draggable modal and then drag each word from the modal to the main content div. The issue I am having is that I can only keep the words inside the modal. When I go past the modal border the draggable is constrained to the modal. Any help would be appreciated. I tried $("#draggable").draggable({ containment: '#demo' }); With demo being the main content div and the modal div id is "dialog"
