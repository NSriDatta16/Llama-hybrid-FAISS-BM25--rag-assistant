Chapter 11 (Inside Expression Trees) and chapter 12 (Extending Linq) of Programming Microsoft Linq (ISBN 13: 978-0-7356-2400-9 or ISBN 10: 0-7356-2400-3) has been invaluable for me. I haven't read Jons book, but he is a quality guy and explains things well, so I assume that his coverage would also be good. Another great resource is Bart De Smet's blog Also, keep your eye on MSDN, the sample code for building a Simple Linq to Database (by Pedram Rezaei) is about to get about 40 pages of Doco explaining it. A really, really useful resource for Expression Tree's in fact I would regard it as a must have is the Expression Tree Visualiser debugging tool. You should also learn as much as you can about Expression Tree Visitors, there is a pretty good base class inplementation here . Here is some sample code derived from that Visitor class to do some debugging (I based this on some sample code in the book I mentioned) the prependIndent method call is just an extension method on a string to put a "--" at each indent level. internal class DebugDisplayTree : ExpressionVisitor { private int indentLevel = 0; protected override System.Linq.Expressions.Expression Visit(Expression exp) { if (exp != null) { Trace.WriteLine(string.Format("{0} : {1} ", exp.NodeType, exp.GetType().ToString()).PrependIndent(indentLevel)); } indentLevel++; Expression result = base.Visit(exp); indentLevel--; return result; } ...
