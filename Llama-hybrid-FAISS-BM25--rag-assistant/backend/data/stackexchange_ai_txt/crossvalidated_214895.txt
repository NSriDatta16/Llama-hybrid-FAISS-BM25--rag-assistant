That is not a sample from a beta(3,6) distribution. It is a graph of a uniform variable vs the beta PDF. For this to be a sample of the beta(3,6) the histogram or density plot of your putative sample (not a scatter plot) should converge to the beta(3,6) PDF. You sampled, $U$, a uniform random variable, and then applied a transformation (the beta PDF function) to it. Here's what the density of of this transformed random variable looks like in black ( D(beta_pdf(U)) ). In red, I am showing the the beta(3, 6) function . Right away, you can tell something is amiss, because betapdf(U) is as large as 2.5, while we know that a beta random variable lies on the interval [0,1]. Generally, you do have the algebraic form of the PDF, up to a constant. But not knowing the normalizing constant of your density means you are stuck! For the beta distribution, the normalizing constant has a well-characterized (though non-algebraic!) expression. In general, MCMC is the way to avoid evaluating a complicated, high-dimensional integral, which is how you would generally calculate a normalizing constant. Even if you do have the normalizing constant, you still need a way to sample, ie, rejection sampling or as another answer points out, the probability integral transform.
