I think you will find the discussion on SARGability, on Rob Farley's Blog to be very interesting reading in relation to your post topic. http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/2010/01/22/sargable-functions-in-sql-server/ An interesting alternative approach that does not require you to modify the existing column data type would be to leverage computed columns. alter table REPORTS add castAsDate as CAST(ReportDate as date) create index rf_so2 on REPORTS(castAsDate) include (ReportDate)
