Here is a stab in the dark: If you can determine at what address the process stack began, then you can possibly find the parameters which were provided to __start . You might then access the parameters via pointers of the appropriate type set to the corresponding offsets from the initial stack pointer. According to the article How main() is executed on Linux , by Hyouck "Hawk" Kim , the first few instructions of __start will write the initial arguments in a deterministic way before calling __libc_start_main . Obviously any approach like this is platform-specific and subject to instability if the implementation of __start were changed.
