First off, consider the merits of jldupont's comment! :) Second, I think 'period' is the accurate description of the second element of the tuple, e.g. {Name, Period[icity]}. That said, look to networking algorithms. Some variant of weighted queuing is probably applicable here. For example, given N tasks, create N queues corresponding to tasks T0...Tn , and in each cycle ("tick") based on the period of the task, queue an item to the corresponding queue. The scheduler algorithm would then aim for minimizing (on average) the total number of waiters in the queues. Simple starting off point would be to simply dequeue from the quene Qx which has the highest number of items. (A parameter on queued item to indicate 'age' would assist in prioritization.)
