Bzip2 compresses in large blocks (900 KiB by default, I believe). One method that would speed up the scanning of the tar file dramatically, but would reduce compression performance, would be to compress each file individually and then tar the results together. This is essentially what Zip-format files are (though using zlib compression rather than bzip2). But you could then easily grab the tar index and only have to decompress the specific file(s) you are looking for. I don't think most tar programs offer much ability to organize files in any meaningful way, though you could write a program to do this for your special case (I know Python has tar-writing libraries though I've only used them once or twice). However, you'd still have the problem of having to decompress most of the data before you found what you were looking for.
