All MLE is minimax but not all minimax is MLE. Some examples of minimax estimators that do not maximize a likelihood are ROC regression, conditional logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, nearest neighbor, quasilikelihood, the list goes on and on. Hodge's "superefficient" estimator beats maximum likelihood as a more efficient UMVUE (unbiased minimum variance) estimator of the mean in a normal sample but it is NOT minimax
