What is a good transformation for data that looks like an S on the Q-Q plot? Or a good nonparametric alternative for correlations?

I am trying to do a study to determine if average annual temperature is related to number of cases of a particular disease. I have data for 15 different states over ten years. I have done multiple transformations and cannot get the average annual temperature to be approximately normally distributed. Does any one have any suggestions to get temperature normally distributed? The histogram doesn't look awful, there are just dips in the middle where there should be peaks. Is a correlation robust to deviations from normal if the sample size is 150? If not, can you suggest a good nonparametric alternative? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
