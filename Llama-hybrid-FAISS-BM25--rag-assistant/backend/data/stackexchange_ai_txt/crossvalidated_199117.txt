The general idea of the "supervised principal component analysis" is described on page 5 of the paper you are reading: Supervised principal components Compute (univariate) standard regression coefficients for each feature Form a reduced data matrix consisting of only those features whose univariate coefficient exceeds a threshold $\theta$ in absolute value ($\theta$ is estimated by cross-validation) Compute the first (or first few) principal components of the reduced data matrix Use these principal component(s) in a regression model to predict the outcome I selected with bold font the answer to your question. The threshold value is not "calculated"; it is selected using cross-validation, i.e. one selects the value of $\theta$ that gives the best performance. (It is not clear from your question if you have a dependent variable in addition to your $152\times 27578$ data matrix. SPCA can only be applied if you have one.)
