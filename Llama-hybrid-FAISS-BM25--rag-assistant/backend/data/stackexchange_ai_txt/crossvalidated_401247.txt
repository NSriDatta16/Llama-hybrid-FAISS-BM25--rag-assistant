Survival analysis with external non-competing events

I'm new to survival analysis and struggling to find the best approach to my problem: Assume that we want to model the time to the death event $X$ given some prior subject data. I'm aware that survival analysis can be used for this, but what if there are other events ${Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, ...}$ that might influence the distribution for $X$ ? These events are not competing with $X$ , i.e. the process will continue even if one of them occurs, it solely increases or decreases the hazard. Supposedly, the easiest way to solve this is by using a Bayesian framework. If possible, implementation tips for Python would be particularly helpful.
