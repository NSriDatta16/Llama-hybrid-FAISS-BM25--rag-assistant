It seems like you have already concluded that the error was done intentionally, but a statistician would not jump to such conclusions (even though the evidence seems to support this). One could set this up as an hypothesis test: H0: The dealer is honest but quite sloppy H1: The dealer is fraudulent, and the shortfall is intentional. Let´s assume H0, then each deviation is a random event with mean = 0 and equal chance of being positive or negative. Let´s further assume that the deviations are normally distributed. The standard deviation for the normal distribution based on the deviations in the 6 data points is sd=1.722 If the statistician did not remember his theory very well, but had R nearby (not an unlikely scenario) then he/she could write the following code to check the likelihood of receiving no positive deviations (no packages of more then 100) if H0 is true. numpackages=c(97,98,96,100,95,97) error The result of the simulation is: The probability the H0 is correct is: 5.3471 % The probability of the dealer being Honest is only 5.35% , and it´s therefore quite likely that you have been a victim of fraud. Since you say that this is not a homework question, but a real situation for your company, then this ceases to be an exercise in calculation the correct expected number labels, but instead it´s a tricky case of how to handle an dishonest supplier. What you do from here, really cant be answered by statistics alone. It very much depends on your leverage and relationship with the dealer. Best of luck ! Morten Bunes Gustavsen
