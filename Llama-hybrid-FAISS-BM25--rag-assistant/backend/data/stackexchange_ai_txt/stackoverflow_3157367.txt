Infragistics - Ultragrid - Group rows into categories

I would like to group rows in categories like that: I know how to do this with OutlookGroupBy but its not possible to put the same row into severals categories So is there a way to group rows while beeing possible to put the same row into several categories at the same time? My ultragrid is bound to a dataset
