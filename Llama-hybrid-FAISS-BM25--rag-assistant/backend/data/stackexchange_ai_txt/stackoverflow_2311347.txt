Instruction-Level-Parallelism Exploration

I am just wondering if there are any usefuls tools out there that allow me to exploit the Instruction-Level-Parallelism in some algorithms. More specifically, I have a subset of algorithms from the multimedia domain and I wonder what is the best way to exploit ILP in this algorithms. All this algorithms are implemented in C, so ideally I give these algorithms as input to some tool and it tells me which instructions could be executed in parallel. Many thanks for any points!
