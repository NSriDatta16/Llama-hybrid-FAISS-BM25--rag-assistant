Is it valid to use samples drawn from posterior using MCMC as prior distribution in sequational updating?

Let's say there are two sets of parameters $x$ and $y$ , and two sets of data $a$ and $b$ . $x$ only depends on $a$ , but $y$ depends on both $a$ and $b$ . I first sample from the posterior $$P(x \mid a) \propto P(a \mid x) P(x)$$ using MCMC. Now, I need to sample from the posterior $$P(x, y \mid a, b) \propto P(b \mid x, y, a) P(x \mid a) P(y).$$ The computation is broken into two steps because it is expensive to compute $P(a \mid x)$ , but easy to compute $P(b \mid x, y, a)$ . In this way the first posterior $P (x \mid a)$ becomes the prior for the second step. Is it valid to sample from $P(b \mid x,y,a)P(y)$ using a 2nd MCMC for each sample of $P(x \mid a)$ , so that the final combined sample reflects the final posterior $P(x,y \mid a, b)$ ? If not, what is a valid way to achieve this?
