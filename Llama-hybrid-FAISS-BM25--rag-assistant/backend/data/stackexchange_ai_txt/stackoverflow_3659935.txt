How do you test default sort in a grails unit test with mocked domains

Is it possible to test the sort propertyName which is defined in the staticMappingBlock ? This works during the integration phase but not during the unit phase where my domain has: static mapping = { sort 'lastName' } void testDefaultSortOrder(){ def agent1 = new CommissionAgent(firstName: 'fred', lastName: 'b', active:true).save() def agent2 = new CommissionAgent(firstName: 'fred2', lastName:'a', active:false).save() def agents = CommissionAgent.list() assertEquals 'sort order is wrong', agents[0].lastName, agent2.lastName assertEquals 'sort order is wrong', agents[1].lastName, agent1.lastName } Grails version is 1.3.1
