Is it suitable to change a feature by itself to generate an another feature?

Hi all I would love to hear your answers on this. Lets say I have two variables, voltage and current, in my data set. I could add another feature by squaring current (so as to calculate power). Is this an example of feature engineering? Recently I tried to predict on a diameter prediction on asteroids and I took the natural log of some features which worked well. Can someone provide some insight as to why this may have improved the model's performance?
