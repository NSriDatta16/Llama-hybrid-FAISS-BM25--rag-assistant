new account so I can't comment- but your acf and pacf plots show no significant lag correlation, the shape doesn't seem to suggest an D or Q value, and (since the plots are before differencing) they are already likely stationary. So how did you land on an ARIMA(1,1,1) specification? My understanding is that those two plots show there is no correlation with historical values, so using historical values is inappropriate. This could be due to a lack of data, and it could be due to the aggregation. Specifically, the average speed last hour may not correlate with the average speed the next hour - but average speed at the same hour yesterday does. Increasing your scope of data and introducing larger aggregation-trends may improve the quality of your forecast. Also, consider that you're only observing a given hour once - if you had multiple days then the relationship between hours may be more apparent. Given your acf and pact plots, ignoring the lack of significance, and referencing the box-jenkins method of determining p and q (seen here ) I would consider re-estimating as just AR(1) model and definitely include more data.
