Determining the number of trees in a random forest model a priori fitting

The answer to "Do we have to tune the number of trees in a random forest?" suggests using as large a number of trees in a forest as possible. Is there a rule-of-thumb for choosing this "large enough number of trees" a priori? Perhaps as a function of the number of observations and number of explanatory variables?
