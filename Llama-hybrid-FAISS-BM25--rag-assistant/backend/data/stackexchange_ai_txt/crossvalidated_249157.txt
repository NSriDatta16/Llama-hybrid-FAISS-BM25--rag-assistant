I think that @amoeba's answer is the best resource on the subject. I'll only say one thing that may help you understand it. Mechanically PCA is just a matrix multiplication: $$Y=XW,$$ where $Y$ is your principal components, $X$ is input data, and $W$ is a matrix of coefficients. The only trick here is that your matrix of coefficients is quite special: you can use it to recover the original matrix. $$X=YW',$$ where $W'$ is the coefficients transposed. You can get all the details in the above mentioned answer.
