How to interpret independent dummy variables in logistic regression?

I have both quantitative and dummy independent variables in my logistic regression. Dependent variable is binary. I have 2 questions. How to interpret a quantitative variable that is negative? How to interpret dummy variable with more than 2 categories? I have n-1 variables, so there is a base category to compare each dummy variable against.
