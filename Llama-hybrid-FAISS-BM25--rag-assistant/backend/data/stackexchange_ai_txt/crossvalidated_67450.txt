Typically in credit scoring one would choose a baseline score e.g. 600. We assign a certain meaning to 600 for example, 600 means the good bad odd is 30:1 (where bad typically means a default, the default definition is typically 90 days past payment due on the loan, however the bad definition can vary). Typically they also define that a 20 point jump means doubling of odds, for example 620 means the good bad odd if 60:1 and 640 is 120:1 etc. This definition comes from logistic regression. If we fit a logistic regression model the model being fitted is this $$\log(p/(1-p)) = a + b_1d_1 + \cdots + b_n d_n$$ where $a$ and $b_i$ are parameter estimates and $p$ is the probability of good $d_i$ are your raw data (explanatory variables). The LHS is the log good bad odds. To conform to the above mentioned standard (i.e. 600 is 30:1 and 620 is 60:1) we scale the RHS using $c$ and $d$ found by solving these simultaneous equations $$600 = c\log(30/1) + d = c + d(a + b_1d_1 + \cdots + b_n d_n)$$ $$620 = c\log(60/1) + d = c + d(a + b_1d_1 + \cdots + b_n d_n)$$ you will get $c = 20/\log(2)$. Hence scaling the RHS by $c$ and $d$ will give you the scores you want. Hence we see that $20/\log(2)$ is just to achieve the 20 points to double odds mantra.
