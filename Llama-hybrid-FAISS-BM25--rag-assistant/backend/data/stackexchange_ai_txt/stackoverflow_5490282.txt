The only real magic is signals/slots There are a few other differences, Qt generally uses more modern C++ constructs than wx which is a bit more MFC era. But like most guis it's just a matter of learning the control->widget->window hierarchy. It is worth getting the Qt4 book or at least reading the free Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt 4 Depends on what platform you are using but check out Qt Creator or if you are using MSVC the qt-addin . The drag-drop dialog layout still isn't as nice as wxDesigner (IMHO) I usually endup coding most of the window, toolbar etc layout in c++
