DBCC SHRINKDATABASE works for me, but this is its full syntax: DBCC SHRINKDATABASE ( database_name, [target_percent], [truncate] ) where target_percent is the desired percentage of free space left in the database file after the database has been shrunk. And truncate parameter can be: NOTRUNCATE Causes the freed file space to be retained in the database files. If not specified, the freed file space is released to the operating system. TRUNCATEONLY Causes any unused space in the data files to be released to the operating system and shrinks the file to the last allocated extent, reducing the file size without moving any data. No attempt is made to relocate rows to unallocated pages. target_percent is ignored when TRUNCATEONLY is used. ...and yes no_one is right, shrinking datbase is not very good practice becasue for example : shrink on data files are excellent ways to introduce significant logical fragmentation, becasue it moves pages from the end of the allocated range of a database file to somewhere at the front of the file... shrink database can have a lot of consequence on database, server.... think a lot about it before you do it! on the web there are a lot of blogs and articles about it.
