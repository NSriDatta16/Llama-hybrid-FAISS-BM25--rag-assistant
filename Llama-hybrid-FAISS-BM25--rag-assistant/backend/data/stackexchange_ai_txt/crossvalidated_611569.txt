I had a chat with some of the authors of Spatial Mapping with Gaussian Processes and Nonstationary Fourier Features , and I got to the bottom of the first part of my question. The authors did not mean that all $f$ 's may necessarily be written as this sum of four terms in $g$ . They chose to place themselves in the settings where $f$ may be written this way (in so-called "symmetrised" form) because in that case the imaginary part disappears automatically when deriving the RFF scheme. In the stationary case, we do not need to "symmetrise" : in fact what is typically done when deriving the RFF scheme is to use the fact that as the kernel is real-valued, $k(x, y) = \text{Re}\left[k(x, y)\right]$ (i.e. its real part). This is what was done in the original 2007 paper on RFFs by A. Rahimi and B. Recht , by the way. In the nonstationary case, this "trick" can be used but you end up with a form of $k$ from which you cannot write the kernel Gram matrix in factorised form...which is a problem since what makes RFFs work is that the kernel Gram matrix can be written in factorised form $\text{K}_{\text{X}} = \Psi \Psi^{\text{T}}$ . On the second part of my question, the problem is mostly a matter of notations : what is meant by $g(\omega_1, \omega_1)$ is $g(\omega_1, \omega_2) \mathbb{1}\{\omega_1 = \omega_2\}$ . Likewise for $g(\omega_2, \omega_2)$ . Further : in a 2015 paper by Samo and Roberts , section 2.3 specifically, it is shown how to derive a RFF scheme for some nonstationary kernels without having to assume $f$ can be written as the sum of the four terms in $g$ . What the results in this Samo & Roberts paper imply is that not all nonstationary kernels lend themselves to RFFs. This is a clear difference with the stationary case : all stationary kernels may be approximated by RFFs.
