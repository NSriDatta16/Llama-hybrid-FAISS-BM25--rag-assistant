My answer is not for the original question, but comments on your approach. First apply PCA, then run generalized linear model is not recommended. The reason is PCA will select variable importance by "variable variance" but not "how variable is correlated with the prediction target". In other words, the "variable select" can be totally misleading, that select not important variables. Here is an example: left future shows x1 is the important to classify two types of points. But PCA shows opposite. Details can be found in my answer here. How to decide between PCA and logistic regression?
