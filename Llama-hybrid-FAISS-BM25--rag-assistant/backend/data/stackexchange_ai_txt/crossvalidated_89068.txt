Computing multiple correlation coefficient between first three PCA components and an additional variable

This is follow-up from a previous question: How to separate groups using PCA? . I have $25$ normals and $12$ patients. For each of them I have a vector representing a spectrogram (length $2000$). So I have a matrix $Z$ of size $[25\times2000;12\times 2000]$. I calculate: [coeffZ, score, latent, tsquared, explained, mu]=pca(Z); and bar(explained) shows me that the first $3$ PCs explain most of the variance. I also have a behavioral score (from testing) for each of the subjects ($[37\times 1]$). It was suggested that I see if the first 3 PCs can predict the behavioral score using multiple correlation coefficient. Specifically this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_correlation Does this make sense? Does anybody have an idea of how I can implement this in Matlab?
