I don't believe it's possible to accomplish exactly the behavior you want using Swing's built in drag and drop. A potential workaround is to set your drop mode to ON_OR_INSERT as follows: tree.setDropMode(DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT); ON_OR_INSERT supports dropping either ON a node directly or between nodes. The INSERT part supports dropping between "A" and "B". You can then allow users to add a new grandchild of "A" after "A3" in one of two ways(or both): Interpret a drop directly on "A" as adding the item as the last child of "A" Interpret a drop on a node as adding an element after the node(this is problematic if the node is not a leaf as the expected behavior is to add the element as a child) If you need exactly the behavior you describe, you'd probably need to write a custom DropTarget for the table and draw the effects you want(line showing where the drop will happen) yourself. I'd recommend avoiding this if at all possible.
