Best image format for uncompressed textures?

I am in the process of selecting an image format that will be used as the storage format for all in-house textures. The format will be used as a source format from which compressed textures for different platforms and configurations will be generated, and so needs to cover all possible texture types (2D, cube, volymetric, varying number of mip-maps, floating point pixel formats, etc.) and be completely lossless. In addition the format has to be able to keep a bit of metadata. Currently a custom format is used for this, but a commonly available format will be easier to work with for the artists since its viewable in most image editors. I have thought of using DDS, but this format does not support metadata as far as I can see. All suggestions appreciated!
