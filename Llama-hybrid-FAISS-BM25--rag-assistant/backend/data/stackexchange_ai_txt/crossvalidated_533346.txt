How would I create a machine learning based text parser?

I have many documents that have the same sections, but have different formatting. How could I make a model to segment the document into given sections? I have tried making classifiers for specific sections (one classifier to determine the opening of a section and another classifier to determine when that section closes). In a given document, perhaps I make a classifier to determine the formatting between sections and effectively use that as a delimiter. What do you think of these approaches? Is there a better way to do something like this?
