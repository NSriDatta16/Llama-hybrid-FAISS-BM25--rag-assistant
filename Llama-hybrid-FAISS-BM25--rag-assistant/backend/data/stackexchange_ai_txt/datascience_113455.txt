In case of multiplication, loss of each point will interact with other. For eg: if loss of point 1 is 0 and point 2 is 3. Then total loss is 0. However, this is not the case. In case you want to magnify the loss you can take exponential of each loss. Still loss minimum will be at the same point as you will get without exponential Loss function objective is to find minima of total loss . Total loss can be sum average over all instances .it should be representative of all the instances
