Linear regression returning negative values for house price prediction

I am trying to do a prediction of real estate (prices are in millions). The mean price for the dataset is 4 million. I do not have any negative values in my dataset, but there are predicted values which are negative like -10 million. Xgboost is also predicting negative values: Xgboost: RMSE is 1.24 and R $^2$ is 0.81 Linear regression: RMSE is 1.54 and R $^2$ 0.74 What am I doing wrong? I tried to use $\log(\text{price})$ but the RMSE is bigger. What solutions can be found for this type of problem?
