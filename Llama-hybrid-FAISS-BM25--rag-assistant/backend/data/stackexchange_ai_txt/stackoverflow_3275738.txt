Magento images not displaying in front end

I can see images in the back end. On the front end of the catalog, no images appear for products, just the default "Image Not Found" icon. Images definitely exist, e.g. media/catalog/product/f/o/foo.jpg They also appear to be correct in MySQL: | 4 | 77 | 248 | /f/o/foo.jpg | I've cleared all MAgento's caches several times, even restarted the web server. It is not caused by the web server cache; I've disabled that. I even got a little desperate, ran the web server as root and chowned everything to 777, and uploaded new images, still nothing in the front end. I've followed everything I could find on Google and still nothing. My web server is running php 5.3.2 with GD, it meets all Magento's requirements AFAICT.
