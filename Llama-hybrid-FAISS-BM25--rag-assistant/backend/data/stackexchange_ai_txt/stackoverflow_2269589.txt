Generally speaking, if you are loading large amounts of content into your app through AJAX calls, it's not a good thing. The reason for this is that if it is public, then you kill the searchability of your site by sites like Google, Bing, etc, etc. If you are still on an internal network, then searchability isn't an issue, but it also is sloppy from a URL structure point of view, as it prevents people from bookmarking content that is relevant to them, and doesn't allow you to hone in on specific parts of the site when you want to. ASP.NET MVC doesn't encourage or discourage this, but what I would recommend if you insist on going this route is to take a look at some of the templating packages available for javascript (you can use jQuery to develop your own if you wish), and return JSON content from your controllers which you would then act on when you call it using jQuery from the client side.
