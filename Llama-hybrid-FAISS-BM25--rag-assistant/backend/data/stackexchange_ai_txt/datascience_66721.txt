It is very hard to beat gradient boosted trees with native support for categorical features such as this on a tabular data set. Assuming you data has not temporal/spatial/order structure (like in speech/image/text) I am very doubtful you will get a better results with deep learning. Having said that, the no-free-lunch theorem states that there is no algorithm which is the best for all data. It is n emperical science.
