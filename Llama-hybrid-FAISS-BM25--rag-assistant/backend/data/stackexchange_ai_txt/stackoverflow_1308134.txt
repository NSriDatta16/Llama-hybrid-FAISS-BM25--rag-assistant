Basic index columns are sorted, but included columns are not sorted. This saves resources in maintaining the index, while still making it possible to provide the data in the included columns to cover a query. So, if you want to cover queries, you can put the search criteria to locate rows into the sorted columns of the index, but then "include" additional, unsorted columns with non-search data. It definitely helps with reducing the amount of sorting and fragmentation in index maintenance.
