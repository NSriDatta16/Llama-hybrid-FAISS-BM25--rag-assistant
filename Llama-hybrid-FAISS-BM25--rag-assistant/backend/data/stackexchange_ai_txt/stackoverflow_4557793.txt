EntityFramework: To Slice or Not To Slice?

So I'm just getting started with Entity Framework. I'm working with a very large, existing database. I find myself wanting to use EF to create models that are "slices" of the whole database. These slices corresponde to 1 aspect of the application. Is that the right way to look at it, or should I try to model the whole database in 1 EDMX? Let me give you a fictional example: Suppose that 1 of the many things that this database contains is customer billing information. I feel like I want to create an EF model that just focuses on the tables that the Customer Billing module needs to interact with. (so then that model would NOT be used for other modules in the app, rather, those same tables might appear in other small EF models). This would allow me to leverage EF's conceptual model features (inheritance, etc) to build a view that is correct for Customer Billing, without worrying about that model's effects, on say Customer Support (even though the 2 modules share some tables) Does that sound right?
