Yes , your forecast is most likely almost flat because of the low ar1 and ar2 parameter estimates. But is that a reason for concern? There are many threads on Cross Validated asking about flat forecasts. The answers in these threads explain why they are not a problem . In one of them , Stephan Kolassa writes: If you are concerned that the forecast does not reproduce the variability in your historical data: don't be. Forecasting models attempt to disentangle the signal from the noise and only extrapolate the signal, because the noise is - by definition - not forecastable. Therefore, any forecast will look smoother than the original time series.
