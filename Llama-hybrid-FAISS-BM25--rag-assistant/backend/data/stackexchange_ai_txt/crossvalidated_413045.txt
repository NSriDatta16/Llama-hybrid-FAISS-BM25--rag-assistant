The original paper (cited in the link you provided) tells us that the data were collected using a "repeated-measures ANOVA" experimental design (see page 492, last paragraph). To learn how to calculate the ANOVA table for data from such a study, read a textbook on ANOVA. Probably a first or second course textbook would tell you how to do that. (BTW, the column headings in your ANOVA table do not line up perfectly, making the table a bit confusing. See the table in the original article.)
