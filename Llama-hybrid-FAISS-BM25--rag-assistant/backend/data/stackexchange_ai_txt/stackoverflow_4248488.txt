Magento Custom Module How to store variable in config.xml

I have a custom module that is working just fine but I would like to be able to store variables in the config so I can use them in my code. (For example a default error message) I think I can access them by using Mage::getStoreConfig('/some/path/here'); but I don't know how to add them to the modules config.xml (myname/mymodule/etc/config.xml) so that I can use them in my code? Anyone have a clue? Thanks!
