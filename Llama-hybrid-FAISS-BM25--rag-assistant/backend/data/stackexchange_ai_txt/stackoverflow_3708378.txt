Looking at Delan's decoded source, it appears to be a full-fledged backdoor providing a web interface that can be used to control the server in various ways. Telling fragments from the source: echo ' Are you sure you want to install an IP:Port proxy on this website/server? or Mass Code Injection: Use this to add PHP to the end of every .php page in the directory specified. or echo " UDP Flood Completed with $pakits (" . round(($pakits*65)/1024, 2) . " MB) packets averaging ". round($pakits/$exec_time, 2) . " packets per second \n"; or if (!$fp) {echo "Can't get /etc/passwd for password-list.";} I'd advise you to scrub that server and reinstall everything from scratch.
