Incorrect reasoning in obtaining average family income

This is a relatively easy question but I am new to statistics so I hope I could get a better idea. Me and my friend were discussing the following: My friend said that if someone wants to find the average monthly family income of a country and goes about finding this by saying: if the average family size is 4, I just multiply this by the average monthly income per person. However, I think think reasoning is incorrect but I can't really explain why.
