Silverlight crashes FireFox 3.5, IE7, & IE8

One of my users has an HP Pavilion DV4-1430us laptop running Windows Vista Professional 64-bit. She is using the latest version of the Silverlight Plug-In, downloaded on 24 July from microsoft.com/silverlight. While typing in a text box in a silverlight web application my company developed, all three browsers will occasionally crash. Nine times out of ten, she can go back to the page where the crash occurred and pick up from where she left off, only to have it crash again several minutes later. This only occurs while she is typing in a text box, and it only occurs on her laptop. I have watched her to confirm there is no user error. Any thoughts? Edit 1: I replicated the error. In Firefox 3.5, the window in which I was working closed with no warning, and the Mozilla Crash Reporter popped up. I'm pasting the crash report code: Add-ons: {20a82645-c095-46ed-80e3-08825760534b}:1.1,{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}:3.5.1 BuildID: 20090715094852 CrashTime: 1248713784 InstallTime: 1248455260 ProductName: Firefox SecondsSinceLastCrash: 245055 StartupTime: 1248713511 Theme: classic/1.0 Throttleable: 1 URL: [redacted] Vendor: Mozilla Version: 3.5.1 Edit 2: I replicated the error in IE8. I highlighted the text in a text box and began to type. Instantly, Internet Explorer has stopped working A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.
