While your question reads more like a programming question (since you use Python, scikit-learn is the obvious eco-system to use, which has lots of support for defining cross-validation etc. including things for splitting time series ), but has a statistics component so I'll answer that. Simple cross-validation is usually inappropriate for time series, if your task is to predict the future from the past. In such a case you want a past-vs-future split. You can (and probably should to stabilize the validation score) still use several such splits. Here's a good discussion of validation sets (esp. this bit ) and Kaggle competitions with time series data will usually have a lot of good code/example/discussions of how to do validaiton there.
