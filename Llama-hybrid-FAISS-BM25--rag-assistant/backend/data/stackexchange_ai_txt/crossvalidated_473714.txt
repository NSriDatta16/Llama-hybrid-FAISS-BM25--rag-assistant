What are examples of generator and discriminator functions for GANs?

Please excuse this simple question, I am currently learning about GANs. I understand the role of generators and discriminators and the loss function that optimizes them. However, from the Pytorch documentation, G(z) represents the generator function which maps the latent vector z to data-space. D(x) can also be thought of as a traditional binary classifier. My questions are: Is D(x) just a simple sigmoid function then? I heard G(z) is a CNN. So we somehow tune the parameters of the CNN, and that reflects changes in the parameters for the model distribution? And then z represents a draw from this distribution?
