Iterative Machine Learning

I was wondering what percentage of Machine Learning Algorithms are iterative in nature; i.e. I can run them sequentially, on different set of data and the model refines itself. Are there any algorithms which support this mathematically, moreover, is there some tradeoff in runtime or accuracy of these models. Iteration here not to be confused with : What does iteration in Machine Learning mean?
