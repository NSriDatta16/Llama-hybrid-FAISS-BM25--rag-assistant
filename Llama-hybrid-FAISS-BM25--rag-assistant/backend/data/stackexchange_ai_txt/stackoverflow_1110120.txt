How to programmatically tell if the terminal server service is running

How can I programmatically tell if the terminal services service is running and is healthy? I'm creating a .net console application that will check if terminal services are running on a list of computers. I can check the remote registry entry to see if it's enabled, but that doesn't mean it's running. I was thinking of making a socket connection to port 3389, but it doesn't have to be listening on that port either. Is there an elegant way to check for this? Regards,
