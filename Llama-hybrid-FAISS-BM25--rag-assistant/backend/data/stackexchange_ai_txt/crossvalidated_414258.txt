It is not clear what kind of 'admission criterion' you want. If the original paper used the interval $\bar X \pm S/\sqrt{n},$ then that is something like a 68% confidence interval. If you are happy using confidence intervals, then a reasonable approach might be to use the nonparametric CI available in R from the one-sample Wilcoxon procedure. Suppose you have Laplace data which shows more outliers than does normal. Then to get a 95% CI that is reasonably robust to outliers you could use R as shown below. (You can choose any confidence level you like.) Nonparametric CIs for Laplace data. I used a Laplace distribution with centered at $\mu = \eta = 15.$ The Wilcoxon interval includes this value. (And so does the t interval, which assumes normal data and has a length slightly inflated by the outliers.) set.seed(2019) x = rexp(100, .1) - rexp(100, .1) + 15 boxplot(x, horizontal=T, col="skyblue2", pch=19, notch=T) wilcox.test(x, conf.int=T, conf.lev=.95)$conf.int [1] 13.41728 17.74237 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 t.test(x)$conf.int [1] 13.85243 19.03257 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 The notches in the sides of the box show a nonparametric confidence interval, the level of which is calibrated for a comparison of two such boxplots (see R documentation). Robust statistics. If you want to use median and MAD, you could use R to get the intervals below, as you suggest in your Question: median(x) + c(-1,1)*mad(x) [1] 6.361976 23.546726 median(x) + c(-1,1)*mad(x, const=1) [1] 9.158873 20.749829 If you use mad in R, you should read its documentation page to understand the role of the default built-in constant multiplier, which you can override as in my second interval above. Then I suppose you would want to do simulations based on several possibly relevant long-tailed distributions in order to understand the coverage properties of whatever type of interval you choose to use.
