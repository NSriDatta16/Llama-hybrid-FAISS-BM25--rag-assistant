For the machine learning classifiers that I know of (i.e. logistic regression, neural networks, bayesian classifiers, etc.), I am only familiar with these giving simple 1 or 0 classifications of some input falling into a particular class. This is not true. Most machine learning algorithms make predictions in some kind of score, that can be used for making hard classifications (0 or 1). The score is usually bounded between zero and one and can be interpreted as a probability. The algorithms you mentioned are examples of such models that predict probabilities. One thing you may take into consideration, is that some algorithms may return probabilities that are not well calibrated, so may need additional calibration of the probabilities. For a start, you could try logistic regression, simple, but probably the most popular algorithm for such purpose.
