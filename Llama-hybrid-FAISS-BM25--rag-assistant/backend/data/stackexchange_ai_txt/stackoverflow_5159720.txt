Disabling drag-to-scroll in ListView in WPF

I'm working in WPF to create a ListView component. The items in the list are based on another user control that reacts to MouseLeftDown events. The List also reacts to SelectionChanged events. Right now, if I mouse down on any item on the list and move the cursor, the other items I pass along react to the SelectionChanged event (which is expected since the selection is changing as per the Mouse Down event in List view). I need to be able to disable this reaction when its down through a drag-to-scroll behavior, but to keep it active when the user selects an item on the list. Does anyone have any ideas how this can be achieved? Thanks everyone, RK
