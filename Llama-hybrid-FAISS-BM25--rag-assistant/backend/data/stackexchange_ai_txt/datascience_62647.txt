The first I'd ask would be "What is positive/negative ratios?". Just because I had a similar issue multiple times when classes were very imbalanced. If it's your case you can try to balance dataset or try to play with scale_pos_weight parameter of XGboost. In the case of 50/50 classes ratios, probablities might be more or less normalised. Also, it's very likely you have overfitting at the same time. Try to tune learning rate, sampling parameters and regularization parameters (reg_alpha, reg_lambda).
