Missing data paired samples t-test

I have a list of insurance policies that filed claims in pre/post periods. I am trying to test whether the average cost of insurance claims per policy varied. Some of my policies don't have any claims in pre, but have some claims in post. Should I make the average claim cost of these policies zero or should I ignore the whole policy? Or something else?
