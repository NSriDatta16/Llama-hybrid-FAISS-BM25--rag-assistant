Download big files from android, with a recovery on error

I developed an app that have to download very large files, 100 MB average. Everything works, but some times for normal reason like Mobile connection that go down to 0 for some seconds or wireless standby, the download that run in a service (like the update of the market) can be broken or interrupted. There is a way for recovery on error, maybe with an http range? If someone already had the problem will be nice to have an example of working code. :-) Thanks
