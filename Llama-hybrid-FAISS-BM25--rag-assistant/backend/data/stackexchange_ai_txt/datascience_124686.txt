Data Transformation Pipeline Issue on Flight Fare Prediction End-to-End Machine Learning Project

I am following the process shown on Wine Quality Prediction End-to-End ML Project on Krish Naik's YouTube channel to do a Flight Fare Prediction Project. I am facing an issue with Data Transformation Pipeline. I run this cell of data transformation pipeline on 03_data_transformation.ipynb : try: config = ConfigurationManager() data_transformation_config = config.get_data_transformation_config() data_transformation = DataTransformation(config=data_transformation_config) # data_transformation.train_test_spliting() # New Line data_transformation.initiate_data_transformation() except Exception as e: raise e I get this error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa1 in position 14: invalid start byte I have been stuck here for days. But can't fix the issue. In the data transformation process, I am not getting any error. I am getting error in only the code of data transformation pipeline. Would you please help me to fix this issue?
