SQL Management Studio Express opening SQL scripts in Notepad

When I go to File > Open > File and select a .sql script, or even when I drag a .sql file into the SQL Management Studio Express window, it opens the script in Notepad which is totally useless when I want to run the script. Since this is on an external server (Windows 2003 Server), I end up having to disconnect from RDP, disable the local clipboard, re-connect and then copy-paste the script's contents from Textpad in order to run it. I've checked the options menus but can't see anything relating to Notepad, not even in the "external tools" section. Any ideas why it would be doing this? Please note: I have checked the file association for SQL scripts and it is set to SQL Management Studio Express.
