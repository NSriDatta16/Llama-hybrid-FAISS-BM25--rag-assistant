There is no easy answer. You need to represent it as a regular Java String literal with backslash escaping for tabs, newlines, double quotes, backslashes and so on. Your IDE may offer you some support in adding the escaping. Otherwise, you may need to do it by hand. My advice is that if you have a lot of XML you'd be better off reading it from a file instead of embedding it in your Java code, or (as @Thilo reminds me) putting it in a resource that you can access using Class.getResourceAsStream(path)
