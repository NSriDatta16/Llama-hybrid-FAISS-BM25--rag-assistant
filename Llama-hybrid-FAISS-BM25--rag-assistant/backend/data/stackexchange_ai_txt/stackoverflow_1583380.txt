Private methods are internal implementation details. They should not be tested directly, as they will be tested indirectly via testing your public interface. If for some reason a private method is not covered when your public interface is fully tested, then the private method is not required, and it should be removed. Generally, it is a bad idea to bind test code to private implementation details. That couples your test to those private details, reducing your freedom to change those details at will, even if they don't affect the publicly facing interface and behavior. That increases the amount of effort required to write and maintain your unit tests, which is a negative thing. You should strive for as much coverage as possible, while only binding to the public interface.
