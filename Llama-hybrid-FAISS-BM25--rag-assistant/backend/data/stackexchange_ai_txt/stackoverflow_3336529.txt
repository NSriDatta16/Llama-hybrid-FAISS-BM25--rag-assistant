Elegantly generating a datetime from a URL in Django?

I'm working on a web app that will allow the user to do a lookup by date, so that, for example: results = Something.objects.filter(end = date) I'm planning on passing in the date information via the URL, like this: example.com/invoicer?2/9/1984 I'll then grab the date via request.GET, break off the first part and store it as the month, delete the slash, break off the second part as the date, etc. etc. I'm not too worried about error/input checking, since only trusted administrators will have access to this, but it seems like a crappy way of going about generating the datetime. Any better ideas?
