I think your problem of 'predicting' the matrix in the future can be rephrased as a recommendation problem: you are trying to recommend (predict) products for users, i.e. you are trying to tell what will they click on. People usually don't use Bayesian methods in recommendation (because other methods are better suited for this kind of problem) but maybe you can check out this article: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pazzani/Publications/IPSJ.pdf The authors here use a Bayes classifier to do collaborative filtering (which is a form of recommendation).
