Performance issue on Android's MapView Navigation-App

I've got a question on making an navigation app more faster and more stable. The basic layer of my app is a simple mapview, covered with several overlays (2 markers for start and destination and one for the route). My idea is to implement a thread to display the route, so that the app won't hang up during the calculation of a more complex route (like it does right now). After implementing the thread there are no updates shows any more, maybe you can help me with a short glance at an excerpt of my code below: private class MyLocationListener implements LocationListener { @Override public void onLocationChanged(Location loc) { posUser = new GeoPoint((int) (loc.getLatitude() * 1E6), (int) (loc .getLongitude() * 1E6)); new Thread(){ public void run(){ mapView.invalidate(); // Erase old overlays mapView.getOverlays().clear(); // Draw updated overlay elements and adjust basic map settings updateText(); if(firstRefresh){ adjustMap(); firstRefresh = false; } getAndPaintRoute(); drawMarkers(); } }; } Some features have been summarized to a method like "drawMarkers()" or "updateText()"...(they don't need any more attention ;-))
