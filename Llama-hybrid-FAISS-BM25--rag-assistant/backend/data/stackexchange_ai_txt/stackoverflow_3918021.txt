c# reorganize controls in a FlowLayoutPanel

Is it possible to allow the controls inside a FlowLayoutPanel to be user draggable so that they can be reorganized. If I have a list of labels, I would like to drag and move them around, much like the icons on your desktop. I would like to grab label A and put it in between label B and C. Another option, is that if there is another container control that allows this out-of-the-box, I would probably prefer it to coding a drag and drop handler for the FLP. EDIT: I'm using WinForms.
