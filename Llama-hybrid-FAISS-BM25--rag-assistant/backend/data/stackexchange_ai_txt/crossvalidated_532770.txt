As discussed in the comments, the data you have are probabilities, not binary events. Why would you build a model of data you donâ€™t have (binary) instead of building a model for the data you have (probabilities)? If your data are probabilities, a more appropriate model would be to use beta distribution as a likelihood function. Bete distribution is of the exponential family, but the conjugate prior is "complicated" . People would usually use optimization, Bayesian quadrature, or MCMC instead of using conjugacy instead. For a non-Bayesian approach, you could use the method of moments to estimate the parameters of the beta distribution $$\begin{align} \alpha &= \bar{x}\, \Big( \frac{\bar{x}(1- \bar{x})}{s^2} - 1 \Big) \\ \beta &= (1 - \bar{x})\, \Big( \frac{\bar{x}(1- \bar{x})}{s^2} - 1 \Big) \end{align}$$ or, for the more complicated model, logistic regression with probabilities as the dependent variable. When you estimate the distribution for the probabilities, you can use it to deduce what would be the expected counts of successes from a binomial distribution with such probabilities, or the distribution of the counts. You just need to plug in the probabilities to the binomial distribution and you can plot them, integrate over them, or do Monte Carlo sampling by first sampling $p \sim \mathsf{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ and then $y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(p, N)$ .
