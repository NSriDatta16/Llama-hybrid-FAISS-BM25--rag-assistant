Neural network library for Python?

Can anyone (preferably with actual experience of the recommended library), suggest a good ANN library for Python? [Edit] ideally, the library/framework supports more than the basic FF paradigm. I would like one that has (or allows you to build) other network types e.g. a SO network for example
