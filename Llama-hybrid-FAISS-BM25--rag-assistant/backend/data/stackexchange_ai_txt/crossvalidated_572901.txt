Not a full answer, I just wanted to point out that your response variable, intention , is ordinal in that it is bound between 1 and 7 with discrete levels. If you use ordinary regression, with or without random effects, then you allow the fitted model to "overshoot" and predict below 1 or above 7. You could use ordinal regression but with random effects may be tricky, see How to use ordinal logistic regression with random effects? for inspiration. As a side note: what to watch out for with mixed models isn't the normality of the dependent variable, but whether the residuals of the model are normally distributed. That applies also to ordinary linear models without random effects.
