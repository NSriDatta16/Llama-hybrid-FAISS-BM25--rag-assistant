$D(f_n\|\phi)\rightarrow 0$ assures that there's no "distance" between the distribution of the sum of random variables and the gaussian density as $n\rightarrow\infty$ just because of the definition of K-L divergence, so it's the proof itself. Perhaps I misunderstood your question. About the second point as you appointed, it's responded in your paragraph.
