You might want to keep something like a sequence number in the data associated with the container. Increment the sequence number each time the load is called, then check in the callback whether the sequence number is less than or equal to the expected sequence number before actually loading data. In this scenario, you would use get instead of load as you're separating the retrieval of the data from the injection of the content. $('#content').empty().each( function() { var $this = $(this); var seq = $this.data('seq') || 0; $this.data('seq',++seq); $.get( event.value, function(data) { var newSeq = $this.data('seq'); if (seq >= newSeq) { // ignore if a later request has been made $this.html(data); } }); });
