There are actually plenty of freely available open-source natural language processing packages out there. Here's a brief list, organized by what language the toolkit is implemented in: Python : Natural Language Toolkit NLTK Java : OpenNLP , Gate , and Stanford's JavaNLP .NET : Sharp NLP If you're uncertain which one to go with, I would recommend starting with NLTK . The package is reasonably easy to use and has great documentation online, including a free book . You should be able to use NLTK to easily accomplish the NLP tasks you've listed, e.g. named entity recognition (NER) , extracting tags for documents , and document categorization . What the Alchemy people call structured data extraction looks like it's just HTML scrapping that is robust against changes to the underlying HTML as long as the page still visually renders the same way. So, it's not really a NLP task. For the extraction of text from HTML, just use boilerpipe . It's fast, good, and free.
