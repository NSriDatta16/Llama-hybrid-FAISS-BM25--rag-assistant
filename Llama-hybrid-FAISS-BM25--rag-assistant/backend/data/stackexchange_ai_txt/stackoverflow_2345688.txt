IN your case, you do not want to work with an HTML document, but with an HTML fragment -- a portion of HTML code ;; which means DOMDocument is not quite what you need. Instead, I would rather use something like HTMLPurifier (quoting) : HTML Purifier is a standards-compliant HTML filter library written in PHP. HTML Purifier will not only remove all malicious code (better known as XSS) with a thoroughly audited, secure yet permissive whitelist, it will also make sure your documents are standards compliant , something only achievable with a comprehensive knowledge of W3C's specifications. And, if you try your portion of code : Hello World Using the demo page of HTMLPurifier , you get this clean HTML as an output : Hello World Much better, isn't it ? ;-) (Note that HTMLPurfier suppots a wide range of options, and that taking a look at its documentation might not hurt)
