I found the rendering issue to be in my GalleryImageAdapter. The problem was that the scaling method I chose for each individual image view created by the getView() method. I was using the ImageView.ScaleType.FIT_START scaling type which scales the image into the top-left corner of the scaled view. I should have used ImageView.ScaleType.FIT_CENTER which centeres the scaled image in the scaled view. Apologies for mis-directing your attention. -- Sandile
