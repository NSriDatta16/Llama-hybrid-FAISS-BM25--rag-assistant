BufferedImage's getSubimage performance

I'm working on a Java 2D rendering program (running on 1.6.0_11), which uses external images for its UI rendering. These large images contain several UI graphics parts at the same time, which I extract now with the BufferedImage.getSubimage(). Assuming an average desktop system (with our without enabling DirectX/OpenGL acceleration), my questions are: The getSubimage() is a memory efficient call, as it shares the underlying image data, but does this affect the rendering speed of these sub images with the Graphics2D.drawImage()? If the images use 8 bit per pixel color palette mode, what would be the gain/loss of using RGBA mode (e.g. 4x memory) or relying on the palette color model (e.g conversion time)?
