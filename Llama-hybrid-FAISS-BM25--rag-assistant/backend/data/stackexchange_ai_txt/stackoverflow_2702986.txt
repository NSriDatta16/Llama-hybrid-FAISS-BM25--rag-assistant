I think your problem may be that the value you have is greater than the 5 allowed in that example. What you want to do is weight the items such that the total for $average is less than or equal to 5. $average = ( ( $val['services'] / $maxServices ) + ( $val['serviceCli'] / $maxServiceCli ) + ( $val['interface'] / $maxInterface ) + ( $val['qualite'] / $maxQualite ) + ( $val['rapport'] / $maxRapport ) ); The weighting could be even, so each of the values will be less than or equal to 1, or they could have different weights so services is worth more than qualite (and so on).
