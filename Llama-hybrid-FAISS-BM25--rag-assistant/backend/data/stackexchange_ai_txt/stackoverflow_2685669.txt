Using (multi lexeme) grails targets in gant scripts

I have a gant script in my grails project. I would like to do something just like this: includeTargets But for the deploy target in the script provided by the tomcat plugin. Specifically, I would like to invoke this target: grails prod tomcat deploy how would that happen?
