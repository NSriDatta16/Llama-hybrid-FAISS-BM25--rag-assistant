How does one approach a bayesian inference problem given data?

Lets say that wa have data on x-values for successful and unsuccessful products that a company tries to develop and that we want to make bayesian inference on some parameters $\mu$ and $\gamma$ , with flat priors. The probability that a product is successful is given by the equation: $p(x)=\frac{exp((x-\mu)e^-{\gamma})}{1+exp((x-\mu)e^-{\gamma})}$ The data on the successful x-values are: [1] 16.52 20.39 16.61 30.72 19.54 23.31 12.97 17.51 15.27 10.31 30.35 20.07 13.92 19.78 11.68 19.91 9.56 19.73 12.49 [20] 18.30 15.72 16.11 16.14 16.99 10.90 23.68 20.24 14.69 12.98 13.82 5.50 15.45 13.23 and the data on the unsuccessful x-values are: [1] 6.71 3.20 5.24 7.31 10.29 8.52 2.71 4.49 12.42 5.16 3.79 7.43 6.75 18.99 7.74 18.83 13.16 6.65 5.07 [20] 9.16 7.24 6.25 20.71 15.34 10.24 1.51 9.17 5.21 5.23 12.87 14.30 7.72 9.06 6.36 4.89 10.97 7.60 15.10 [39] 9.18 4.49 6.98 13.55 10.26 10.84 4.47 10.54 12.88 11.18 17.83 10.65 6.65 8.50 11.38 1.33 9.30 9.60 7.25 [58] 11.65 11.47 2.80 14.48 6.30 5.84 15.18 5.78 Task: Plot the data together with curves given by $p(x)$ for various values of $\mu$ and $\gamma$ . Make a conclusion about what kind of range of values for the parameters $\mu$ and $\gamma$ might be reasonable in this model. I have no idea were to start when approaching this problem. How does one reason or implement a strategy to make bayesian inference for the parameters $\mu$ and $\gamma$ ?
