Test difference in proportions between values of same polytomous variable

What is the right test to compare sample proportions between two values of the same polytomous variable? Basically I'm searching for the right search term. E.g. consider a survey question, Q1 . What is your favorite season? Select exactly one of the following: a) Winter b) Spring c) Summer d) Fall Further, let's say that in a sample of 100 people the following results were obtained: Q1 | n | p --------|-----|----- winter | 10 | 10% spring | 20 | 20% summer | 30 | 30% fall | 40 | 40% Is the 40% for fall "significantly higher" than the 30% for summer ? Here we're not comparing proportions from different samples, it's comparing proportions for the same variable from the same sample, with the structural constraint that a respondent can choose one or neither but not both. I imagine it would be testing the null hypothesis that the log odds ratio, e.g. log( (0.3 / (1 - 0.3)) / (0.4 / (1- 0.4))) is 1.0, but I don't know which the test statistic to use. The goal here is a simple test of "are these two significantly different at p 0.05 is arbitrary, significance testing in exploratory analysis is trolling for false positives, one should correct for multiple comparisons, small samples skew approximations, Bayesian priors exist, etc. )
