I purchased a DROID a week back and was having the same problem. To uninstall an application from the DROID do the following. Uninstalling an application from Android OS v2.1 Go to settings. Go to Applications Go to Manage applications. Touch the application you wish to uninstall. Touch uninstall. Enjoy the fact that the application is gone. The confusion I'm guessing your commenter's are having is when you hold your finger on an application you can drag it to a trash bin. This makes you think you are deleting the application when really you are removing it from your favorite applications list. Its very misleading.
