How can I embed a SQLite Database in a .NET DLL and then use it from C#?

I'm currently working on some evaluation work for a project that I'm planning. I recently looked at solutions for a data storage mechanism for my application and while researching stumbled upon SQLite. I currently use SQLite with the System.Data.SQLite wrapper. I really like the way it works but I have one problem with it that I couldn't get fixed and I also found no help concerning my problem on the internet. I would like my SQLite Database to be embedded into one of my applications DLLs (ie. Title.Storage.dll) to be used within this DLL. Is this possible? How can I access the database then? It would be great if I could use something like: SQLiteConnection con = new SQLiteConnection(); con.ConnectionString="DataSource=Title.Storage.storage.db3"; con.Open(); Thanks in advance and best regards, 3Fox
