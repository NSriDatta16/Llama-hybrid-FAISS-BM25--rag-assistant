How to remove or add an item from a WrapPanel?

I am trying to create a prototype where the user can show or display items by selecting the menu items. I need the item to be removed/Collapsed because I need the empty space to be taken by other items in WrapPanel. The content in the wrapPanel is generated dynamically with XMLDataProvider. I tried to assign commands for the menu items but was not able to make it work. XAML: I hope someone will be able to help. The whole solution is available from here: http://cid-0c29483cf3a6a14d.office.live.com/self.aspx/WPF%5E_Tests/DragDropWrapPanel%5E_3.rar Please take a look. You will find Menu on top left corner that should be used to hide/show items inside the wrapPanel. Thank you in advance.
