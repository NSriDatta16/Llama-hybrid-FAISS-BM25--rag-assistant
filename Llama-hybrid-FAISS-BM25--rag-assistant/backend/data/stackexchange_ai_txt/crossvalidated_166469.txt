How can I get output data of a trained neural network?

My neural network, which uses the back-propagation technique and the sigmoid activation function, should 'learn' the sine function. This is the networks structure: The following code should train the network with 1000 datasets: After that, I try to draw a sine with this piece of code: The output is quite disappointing, compared to a real sine wave: I hope, someone could give me a hint. Thank you. Edit: The problem was solved (see answer by Richard Hardy). I made this interactive website for testing the network: http://norizon.li/repo/neural-net/
