The way I read it. Its a flat file record parser. In this case its a csv with quotes. And it makes you a dictionary of the fields. So that you can work with the csv record easier. Instead of having to know that the 4th field is address in the code after this, you simply reference, groups["address"] and get the 4th field. There are more straight forward and generic ways to do this. This regex is going to be very fragile over time, if hte file is poorly delimited or if a quote is missing at the end of hte file.
