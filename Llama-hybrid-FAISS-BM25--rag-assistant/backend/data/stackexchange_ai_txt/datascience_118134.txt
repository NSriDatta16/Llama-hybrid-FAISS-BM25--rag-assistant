Why don't you split your data into train, validation and test sets and then train a model to predict the category? The model could be an LSTM or a transformer encoder. It would receive the words and, for each word, predict its category; it's what in NLP is called "sequence labeling". Then, you could evaluate the results of your model in your test set and, with the confusion matrix, you could try to identify problems in your category coding. If you want to also incorporate the values of [Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4], you could concatenate them to the word embedding of their associated word.
