I have a web application to be hosted on android device. Why? It won't be usable, except maybe on a WiFi LAN. It won't be able to run terribly long, because services cannot run forever. Etc. Whatever technical problem you think you're solving by using a Web server on Android can be better solved by other means. I wanted to ask what will be a better option to be used. 1. Jetty webserver with stripped off code. 2. I-Jetty. Arguably "neither", not only due to the technical issues, but that Greg Wilkins (creator of Jetty) does not like Android much . Of the two, though, i-jetty is at least regularly tested on Android. Memory and CPU usage under a maximum load of 30 requests/sec. These are short bursts which occur very few times in app-life cycle. The average load would be approximately 5 requests/sec. While running, battery life will suck, because you are going to keep the CPU and WiFi running all of the time to support the Web server, let alone the load.
