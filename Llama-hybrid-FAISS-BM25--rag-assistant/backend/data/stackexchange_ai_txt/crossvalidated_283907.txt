Which Machine Learning algorithm should I use for gender tagging of words in NLP?

I have a dataset of about 26,000 words along with their gender tags [m, f or any]. Which ML algorithm should I use for Gender Tagging/Classification purpose. How should I go about it? What should be the input features? Given a word , it's POS tags and in some cases the singularity I am trying to predict the gender of the word.
