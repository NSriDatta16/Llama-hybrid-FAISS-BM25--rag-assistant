What is a logworth statistic, and how useful is it?

My teacher mentioned it today, and there is nearly zero good search results for it, other than one mention each in the SAS and JMP documentation. It says it is -log10(p-value) , but there is almost no explanations of this online. Also it seems like this statistic is widely ignored. It isn't mentioned in any tutorials or in any of the data science papers I have read in the past two years. Question So, what is this statistic, and where does it come from? How useful is it in data science?
