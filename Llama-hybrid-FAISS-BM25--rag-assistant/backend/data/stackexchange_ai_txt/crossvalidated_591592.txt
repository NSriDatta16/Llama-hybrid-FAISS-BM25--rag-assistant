Anytime you would use data that you wouldn't have at forecast time while testing then you introduce data leakage. This occurs when you use the lags and you want to forecast more than 1 period for t-1 lag. At that point you will probably use forecasted values whereas if you do standard CV then you will be using actuals. So use lagged variables, but your CV strategy should be using the predictions. In other words, do time series cross validation.
