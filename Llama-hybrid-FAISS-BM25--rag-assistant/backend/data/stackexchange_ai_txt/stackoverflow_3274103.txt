RegEx not working with look-aheads!

Hey guys, I am trying to match "address" in this page - http://www.bbb.org/norfolk/business-reviews/tax-return-preparation/liberty-tax-service-in-virginia-beach-va-48000604 The source of address part has this HTML Address: 1 S Main St Ste 1430 Dayton, OH 45402 So, I tried the following RegEx in PHP. "%Address: (.*?)(?! ) %s" where "s" is the modifier for "." to match new lines too. But it is not working. It doesnt matches the "Dayton, OH 45402" part. Can anyone tell me why?
