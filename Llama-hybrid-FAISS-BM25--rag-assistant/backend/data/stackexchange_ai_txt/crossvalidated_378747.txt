How to use Poisson Lambda

I am writing a piece of software that requires Poisson distribution with an average, or lambda, of 5 events per seconds. I am passing the lambda in a loop that "sleeps" a number of milliseconds to generate those events at random intervals, but I am unclear of whether I need to pass to the Poisson function the value of 5, or the value of 200, which is 1000 / 5, where 1000 is the number of milliseconds in a second. Which value should I pass as lambda to the Poisson function? This is the code of the function: static double poissonRandomNumber(int lambda) { double L = Math.exp(-lambda); int k = 0; double p = 1; do { k = k + 1; double u = Math.random(); p = p * u; } while (p > L); return k - 1; }
