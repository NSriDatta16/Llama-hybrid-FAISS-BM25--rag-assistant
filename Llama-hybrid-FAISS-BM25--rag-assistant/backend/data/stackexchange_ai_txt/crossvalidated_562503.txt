Why output shape of Conv2D is (None, 30, 30, 32) instead of (None, 30, 30, 32, 3) when input image of (32*32*3) is passed?

I am new to CNN deep learning. I was checking the summary of the model which i have built (as shown below). The input shape of our data is 32, 32, 3. Why output shape of Conv2D is (None, 30, 30, 32) instead of (None, 30, 30, 32, 3) when image of (32 32 3) is passed?
