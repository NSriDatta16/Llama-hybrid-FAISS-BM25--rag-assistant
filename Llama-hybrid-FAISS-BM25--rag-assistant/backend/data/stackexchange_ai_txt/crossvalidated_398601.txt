I would tackle this a couple of ways. First, I would convert your categorical variables to numerical variables by creating dummy variables. Your "feature 2" would turn into the following new variables: ID | Feature2 | Cat | Dog | Hrs 01 | cat | 1 | 0 | 0 02 | Dog | 0 | 1 | 0 03 | Hrs | 0 | 0 | 1 Now you can run a all sorts of regression packages without handling categorical variables each time. Prior to building regression models, you need to explore your data using whatever statistical method you would like. Create visuals like correlation matrix, ect. At this point, you can run ordinal logistic regression on the whole data set or build individual stepwise regressions on each group by sub-setting your data. Variables would show significant on the population and for each group. This should get you started. Here is a good resource for this type of analysis in R: Ordinal Logistic Regression
