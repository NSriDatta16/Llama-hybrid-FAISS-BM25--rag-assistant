Selecting and ordering data from another table

I have two tables topsites, and tophits. tophits has id, account, useragent, ip referral, time topsites has id, name, email, url, return, active Everytime someone clicks a link, it is stored in the tophits table with account being ID from topsites. Basically I want to echo out the top hits for the day, so I figure I need to count how many hits there were for account=4 on time=today order by top Here is what I have so far $this->db->select('name, url'); $this->db->from('topsites'); $this->db->where('active' '1'); $this->db->join('tophits', 'tophits.id = topsites.account'); (This is for codeigniter) I'm stuck. Any help?
