How to interpret the results of mean and variance to determine the stationarity of time series

After breaking the series into 3 parts and then compute mean and variance for each part. I need to understand what is the acceptable difference between the 3 parts to say this series is stationary? This is the output for 2 series: Series1: mean1= 19.079044 mean2= 21.812044 mean3= 18.575845 variance1= 1.437688 variance2= 1.151551 variance3= 0.547118 Series2: mean1= 0.207178 mean2= 0.146585 mean3= -0.333707 variance1= 0.999076 variance2= 0.950360 variance3= 0.974912 I think that the first series is stationary because the difference between the mean is very little, but what about the second series? This is my code: data = pd.read_csv("C://r3800.txt") values = data.values # getting the count to split the dataset into 3 parts = int(len(values)/3) # splitting the data into three parts part_1, part_2, part_3 = values[0:parts], values[parts:( parts*2)], values[(parts*2):(parts*3)] # calculating the mean of the separated three # parts of data individually. mean_1, mean_2, mean_3 = part_1.mean(), part_2.mean(), part_3.mean() # calculating the variance of the separated # three parts of data individually. var_1, var_2, var_3 = part_1.var(), part_2.var(), part_3.var() # printing the mean of three groups print('mean1= %f\t mean2= %f\t mean3= %f \t' % (mean_1, mean_2, mean_3)) # printing the variance of three groups print('variance1= %f\t variance2= %f \t variance3= %f' % (var_1, var_2, var_3))
