I coincidentally read your arXiv paper prior to coming to this question and already wrote a blog entry on it ( scheduled to appear on October, 08 ). To sum up, I find your construction of theoretical interest, but also think it is too contrived to be recommended, esp. as it does not seem to solve the point-null hypothesis Bayesian testing problem, which traditionally requires to put some prior mass on the point-null parameter value. To wit, the solution you propose above (in the October update) and as Theorem 2 in your arXiv paper is not a valid test procedure in that $\varphi$ takes three values, rather than the two values that correspond to accept/reject. Similarly, the loss function you use in Theorem 3 (not reproduced here) amounts to testing a one-sided hypothesis, $H_0: \theta\le\theta_0$, rather than a point-null hypothesis $H_0: \theta= \theta_0$. My major issue however is that it seems to me that both Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 in your arXiv paper are not valid when $H_0$ is a point-null hypothesis, i.e. when $\Theta_0=\{\theta_0\}$, with no prior mass.
