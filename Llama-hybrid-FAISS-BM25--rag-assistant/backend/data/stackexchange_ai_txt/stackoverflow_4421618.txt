Programming GUI elements for time series data

I am building an GUI application to label time series data. With one track displays the time series data, the other track for the user to interactively label the intervals. I immediately recognize that the GUI of my applicatioin would be very similiar to an audio editing software. So I opened Audacity and started to think about how to program its GUI . My GUI programming abality is limited in using frames, buttons, labels, etc in the toolbox. But I don't know how to program these controls my self. For instance, a label track (see the above link), contains labels in it. The user can also drag the label to other time stamp. If I want to program similiar GUI elements in .Net, what kind of techniques should I learn? Thanks a lot!
