Yes. It can be, but unless your needs are more specialized than they appear, a general purpose database manager is probably a better way to go. For something like this, I'd think of using one of the (many) embeddable database managers that are available. Given that you're (apparently) doing this primarily for self-education, not real use, it might make sense to write the code without a database manager to handle the storage. Writing all the code on your own will (with a bit of care) typically result in slightly higher speed, at the expense of quite a bit of extra work and usually some loss of flexibility. The biggest problem from a learning viewpoint is that quite a bit of what you learn doing this will only apply under fairly narrow circumstances (i.e., for most typical applications, you will want to use a database manager, so learning to do without rarely gains much). A bit also depends on your intended use/audience. If you want to support more than one user at a time, things get much more difficult almost immediately (at least doing so efficiently). If you're only interested in one user being able to access the database at a time, that keeps things a lot simpler.
