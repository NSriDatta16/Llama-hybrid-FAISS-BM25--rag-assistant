Well not quite anyone had the answer. csgero was on the right track though initialize was the problem. But just calling that directly was not a solution. This works: public class MemberTest { public static void CreateAdminMemberIfNotExists() { MembershipCreateStatus status; MembershipUser member = Membership.CreateUser("Admin", "password", "email@somewhere.co.uk", "Question", "Answer", true, out status); } } I believe instantiating my membership provider directly requires setting the config properties typically stored in the app.config or web.config and then calling initialize. Calling the static CreateUser method on the Mebership class however causes the config to be read, then the type specified in the config is parsed, loaded and initialised.
