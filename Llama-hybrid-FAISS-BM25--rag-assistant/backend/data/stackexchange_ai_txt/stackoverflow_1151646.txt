If this is something like a checkout procedure where you want to copy the value of shipping address to be the same as mailing address, it's quite simple to do. In form B, you basically load the other address (from form A or from storage if you persist it) in a hidden form field and then detect the checkbox is changed in javacsript. If it is ticked, then copy the hidden form value to the new textbox. 3 pieces that you need (all in form b asp page): " /> function checkCopyAddress() { 'Get me the checkbox 'This is just for example, in reality I won't do it this way. var checkBox = document.getElementById("chckUseAddressA"); document.getElementById("txtAddress").value = (checkBox.checked) ? document.getElementById("hidAddress").value : ""; }
