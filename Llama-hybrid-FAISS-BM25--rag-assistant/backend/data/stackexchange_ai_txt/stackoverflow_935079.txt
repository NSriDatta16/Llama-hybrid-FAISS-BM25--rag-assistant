Eclipse Workspace Does Not Save (Vista)

I've recently upgraded to Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede), but I'm experiencing some intermittent issues with my workspace saving and loading on shutdown/startup. The problems seems to be intermittent but occurs more frequently than not. When I start Eclipse, the workspace does not load with the previously opened files and settings (no files are open and windows return to default locations). I suspect that this may have something to do with UAC in Vista. I am running Eclipse on Windows Vista Business 32-bit. Any ideas? At the minimum, it may be helpful to see if Eclipse is periodically saving the workspace, as it should - which files might I be looking for?
