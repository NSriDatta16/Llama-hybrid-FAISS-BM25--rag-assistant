When there are many more failures than successes should I let classes be equal in SVM?

I have about 5544 runs where I am trying to classify it as failure or success. Here the number of runs that lead to failure is only 64 and rest is sucess. In that case when I try to use SVM should I make the number of classes equal? Will this affect the results?
