Non-local blocks are a generalization of transformer blocks. The reason why they are slow is the matrix multiplication $A^TA$ . The speed can be increased by decreasing the matrix size. Other possibilities are: applying the multiplication only on patches of images ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf ), sparse attention ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14794.pdf ), perform some kind of channel attention ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507 ). Non-local blocks do not depend on the data size because the matrix multiplication is not performed on the batch size.
