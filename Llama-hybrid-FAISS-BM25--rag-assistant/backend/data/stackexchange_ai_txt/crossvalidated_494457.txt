Modelling of two time series data which seem to move together?

I have two time series data, these two data when looked at graphically seem to move roughly together i.e. on a higher level the shape of the two is similar. I want to apply some kind of modeling to see if I can predict the direction of one time series using the other, but I think I don't have the necessary skill now. I am aware of univariate time series modeling, I guess it comes under bivariate time series modeling. What topics should I study, to be able to gather some insights from these two time series data?
