Border and padding do the same. Hence, you can also use the following to prevent a top-margin collapse: .parent { padding-top: 1px; margin-top: -1px; } 2021 update: if you're willing to drop IE11 support you can also use the new CSS construct display: flow-root .

For example: h1, h2, p, ul { margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; outline: 1px dashed blue; } div { outline: 1px solid red; } Title! Title! Paragraph Title! Paragraph list item Because the browser collapses margins, the text would appear as you'd expect, and the wrapper tags don't influence the margins. Each element ensures it has spacing around it, but spacing won't be doubled. The margins of the and won't add up, but slide into each other (they collapse). The same happens for the and element.
