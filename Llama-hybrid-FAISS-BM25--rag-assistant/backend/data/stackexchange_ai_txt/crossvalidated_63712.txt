Machine learning for dynamic pricing

I haven't been able to find a good answer for this (though I know that there are a few related questions): How does Amazon determine how to price a product? How does it figure out when to downprice, and by how much? I'm sure that there's some machine learning involved here, but what does it involve? Doesn't have to be Amazon. I have metadata and data on past demand, but a regression model and random forest neither showed that anything other than overall sales are significant. I also have a natural experiment, but I don't want to base my whole case on one limited time period.
