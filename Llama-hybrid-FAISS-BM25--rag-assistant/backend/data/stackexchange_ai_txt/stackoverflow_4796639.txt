The msdn docs are here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380252.aspx This is the main include file: #include The cryptography bits are included as part of the Windows SDK , which is typically installed in %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\SDKVERSION (e.g., C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A ). The headers are typically in %WINDOWSSDK%\Include , and the related libraries are in %WINDOWSSDK%\Lib . You must link to the cryptography libraries explicitly. Assuming you're in Visual Studio, you can add the reference by right clicking on the C++ project, choosing properties, and selecting Configuration Properties -> Linker on the treeview at left. You can then specify crypt32.lib in the input field on the right. Alternately, (assuming you're using msvc++) add #pragma comment(lib, "crypt32.lib") to your source.
