I assuming the you mean on the front end and not in the admin. I believe that you can do this using a form set. (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/). You would create a form for the through table to use in the formset. Also, you may have simplified your models for posting, but if the language model is really just one choice field, why not just combine language and userprofile_language into one? You can replace the ForeignKey with the choice field and get the same behavior. That would make your display easier. (ignore this is language actually has more fields)
