Currently YARD only supports embedding documentation from other object docstrings in the form: class Foo # Docstring here def method; end # Here is some more docs and {include:Foo#method} def bar; end end File inclusion was vaguely planned but it was never really requested before, so it wasn't high priority. If you want to open an issue on http://github.com/lsegal/yard/issues -- we can make sure it gets tracked and added for the upcoming 0.7.0 release.
