You're asking whether unit tests encourage you to rely on them as a method of TODO list? Yes, but I don't think that's sloppy coding. You are, afterall, to start with unit tests failing and code to the test; if you refactor some code and then once again code to the test, that isn't sloppy coding -- it's doing what you're supposed to. I think the problem with unit tests is simply that you can't cover every corner case in a unit test, and sometimes people assume that a working test means a working app, which isn't true.
