How could I check if the value for A is on average higher/lower than B across all pairs containing A and B?

I have a dataset with prices from big stores and small stores for the same product for different cities. My dataset has around 70 products and both big stores and small store prices are available for each product in most cities, but all cities (sometimes product A in City XYZ is only available in big stores). What type of analysis could I run to examine whether big or small store prices are systematically (or on average) lower or higher across all products? EDIT I forgot to add that price collecting is attempted for the same pairs of stores in each city. So price collection is attempted in big store 1 and small store 1 across all cities, then for big store 2 and small store 2 across all cities, big store 3 and small store 3 across all cities and so forth Of course, sometimes prices are only available in, say, big store 5 in city XZY, while in city ZZZ they're available for both big store 5 and small store 5.
