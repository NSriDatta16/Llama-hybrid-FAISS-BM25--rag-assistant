A very simple attempt would be to correlate the recording with the live data. Provided that you properly normalise the result, you can get a similarity measure. Using correlation you would also circumvent the problem of small offsets that disturb other measures like the L2-norm. Maybe you can take a look: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation Here is another StackExchange question (with useful advice) on the problem of similarity measures for time series: https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/848/time-series-similarity-measures
