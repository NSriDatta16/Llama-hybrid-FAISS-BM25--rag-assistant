Binary logistic regression with multiple independent variables

I have a group of 196 patients. I want to know if infection (the outcome, or dependent variable) depends on other variables. I am running a binary logistic regression with 8 independent variables (age, gender, type of surgeryâ€”6 different types, type of fixation, type of antibiotics). The categorical variables are automatically put into dummies by SPSS. Some of my categorical variables have low frequencies ( Can I run a binary logistic regression? Are the results reliable? Update: I have no categories with 0 patients, only some with only 1 or 2 patients. So I ran the regression and SPSS gives me the output above. Can I say that TRTCD2 and QSORRES are statistically significant? And that the p value or 1 or almost 1 are due to the small frequencies in this group?
