Forecasting a complex time series by splitting into subseries

I have finance data that I need to forecast out for 7 years. My data is generally debits and credits, and those are split into a number of sub-series which share common traits (e.g. similar seasonality and/or trend). My question is, is it appropriate to split the total series into component parts; forecast each part in the most appropriate manner; re-aggregate the parts into a complete projection? For example, I'd like to treat the following sub-series/parts differently: Expenditures Wages/Pension (annual percent increase, based upon contracts) Insurance (annual percent increase based upon prior increases) Supplies (annual percent increase based upon different prior increases) Then, add the individual sub-series back into a single forecast. Obviously, there would be similar but different sub-series/parts for revenue, which would eventually be combined for a total forecast.
