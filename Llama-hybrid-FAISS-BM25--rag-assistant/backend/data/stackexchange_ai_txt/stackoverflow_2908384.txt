Thanks again Mark. I tried the approaches that you have suggested. I have put reduction(+:iCount) and also tried wrapping iCount++ around pragma critical, and yes it is a performance hit (also I could see no speedup). Also, I have let one thread handle iCount, but the approaches I made results in no speedup. I expected that if I put a pragma for around the inner loop, and declare iCount as a reduction variable, I would notice at least some speedup. My aim is the parallel execution of these statements for an Index1, Index2 pair: fDist =(*this)[iIndex1].distance( (*this)[iIndex2] ); m_oPDF.addPairDistance( fDist ); which could noticeably impact the program run time.
