The nnet:multinom function is a special case of a log-linear model. My favorite reference for these models is Alan Agresti's "Categorical Data Analysis" 2nd ed (or higher) which should be fairly easy to find. The most important finding is that the log-linear model is a special case of logistic regression. That is exactly how nnet works. The model coefficients are just odds ratios for that specific response. Their values are constrained so that the fitted probabilities add to 1 across the possible multinomial response levels. The odds ratio compares the odds of a particular response level (versus any other response level) for a positive exposure group to a negative exposure group. You must exponentiate the column of "estimate" and its 95% CI to convert to the odds ratio scale.
