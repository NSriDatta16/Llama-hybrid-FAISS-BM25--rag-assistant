PHP DOMDocument - get html source of BODY

I'm using PHP's DOMDocument to parse and normalize user-submitted HTML using the loadHTML method to parse the content then getting a well-formed result via saveHTML : $dom= new DOMDocument(); $dom->loadHTML(' Hello World'); $well_formed= $dom->saveHTML(); echo($well_formed); This does a beautiful job of parsing the fragment and adding the appropriate closing tags. The problem is that I'm also getting a bunch of tags I don't want such as , , and . I understand that every well-formed HTML document needs these tags, but the HTML fragment I'm normalizing is going to be inserted into an existing valid document.
