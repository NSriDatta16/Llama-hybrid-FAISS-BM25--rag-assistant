Getting a specific number of JSON items with jQuery from tumblr feed

I'm trying to populate a page with X entries from my tumblr feed, and I'm wondering how I can only pull that X number from the JSON object it returns. Here's my code, pulled from another Stack Overflow post and modified: //Tumblr retrieval $.getJSON("http://tumblr-address/api/read/json?callback=?", function(data) { $.each(data.posts, function(i,posts){ var title = this["regular-title"]; var type = this.type; var date = this.date; var url = this["url-with-slug"]; $('#sideRail ol').prepend(' ' + title + ' ' + date + ' '); }); }); I've tried using a while loop with a counter, but it just repeats everything X times before moving on to the next item in the list. Thanks for any help.
