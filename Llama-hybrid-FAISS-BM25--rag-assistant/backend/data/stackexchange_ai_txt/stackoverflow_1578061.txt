Project to isolate entities in Seam

Is it possible to have a Seam project just for entities (src/main) and other projects access them ? I have a situation that a organization has 6 projects accessing the same entities and i don't want to replicate them in each project. If it is possible, how can i do that ? where can i found documentation about it ? thanks, Cateno Viglio
