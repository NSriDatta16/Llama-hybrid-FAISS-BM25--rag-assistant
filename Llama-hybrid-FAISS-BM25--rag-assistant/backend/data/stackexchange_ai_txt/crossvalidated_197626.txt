Bertin graphs can be used to visualize the information ( figure from a book as shown in an answer on gis.stackexchange ): . Each row would represent a set of options, and each column a particular option (A, B, C, etc...). Each option present for given set of option will be marked in the matrix. Then you can either plot results on the side (e.g., as a bar plot with one bar per row), or as vertically stacked figures if more than one result to display (one such figure per set of options). Reordering the rows and columns of the matrix is something you'll likely want to explore in order to highlight patterns of interest.
