You can put files wherever you want in your project-- Resources is just a default folder that gets created for you. You could create a sibling folder to Resources, or a subfolder inside of it. You can do this in two ways: One by right clicking on the project and creating a new group for the images. This will create the logical folder, but won't actually create a subdirectory on disk. If you want the layout on disk also, create the folder on the command line or with Finder and then drag it into Xcode.
