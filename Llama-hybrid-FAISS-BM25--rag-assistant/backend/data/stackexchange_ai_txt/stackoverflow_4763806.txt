I tried the code and it ran fine. I made only a few changes. First, I didn't know what "user" and "db" are, so I commented out import user, db and database = db.Database() and used my own data for username, password, etc. Second, the PySide module isn't available via my package manager, so I used PyQt4 instead. It didn't like grid.addWidget(self.createList(), 1, 0, 1, 4) so I commented that out, and everything worked as expected. Further thoughts: When there were connection errors, there was some console feedback consisting of stack traces, but nothing more, and self.establishedConnection remained a string, causing self.establishedConnection.disconnect() to fail. So perhaps there's a connection problem? EDIT: Aaaahhhhh, I just saw this: "No errors are shown at any time." Are you running this from a terminal or double-clicking an executable? If you start it from a terminal, I bet you'll see stacktraces in the terminal. The gui doesn't close when the code hits an exception. EDIT2: If joining the files fixes the problem, then I am certain the problem cannot have anything to do with python itself. This has to be a problem with eclipse. You say that connection.py began as a terminal app, so you must be able to run python apps from the command line. Try the following: put main.py, connect.py, etc. in a directory of their own, open a terminal, and run python main.py . If it works as expected, then the problem has something to do with eclipse.
