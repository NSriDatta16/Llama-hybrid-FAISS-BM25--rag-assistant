Finally received some attention from Adobe and got an answer on this. The problem with long HTTP Authentication headers is that, by default, the Base64Encoder class will inject newline characters every 72 characters. Obviously that causes a chunk of the base-64 encoded string to be interpreted as a new header attribute, which causes the error. You can fix this by setting (in the above example) encoder.insertNewLines = false; The default setting is true. I've fixed the above code to work for arbitrarily long Authentication strings.
