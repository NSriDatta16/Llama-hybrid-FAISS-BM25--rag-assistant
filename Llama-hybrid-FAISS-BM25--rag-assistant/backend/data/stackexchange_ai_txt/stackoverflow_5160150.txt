Writing a R lint program

When I program in python, I find using pylint very useful. However, when I program in R, there is nothing comparable. As a small side project, I thought it would be fun to try and write a small lint program. Nothing too fancy, something along the lines of: Making sure function names are camel case Average function length Detecting unused variables Spacing. For example, function(x=1, y=2) instead of function(x=1,y=2) However, I'm unsure of how to get started (I have started to look through the pylint soure code). How should I get started? Are there standard programming techniques for this type of project? Any good resources that I should consider? I would like to write the entire project in R.
