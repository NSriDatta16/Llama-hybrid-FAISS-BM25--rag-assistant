Input of Recurrent cells (LSTM but also GRU and basic RNN cells) follows this pattern: ( number of observations , lenght of input sequence , number of variables ) Assuming your lenght of input sequence is 3, and only one variable, you can go with: LSTM(32, input_shape=(3, 1)) As you can see, when you declare an LSTM() layer you don't need to specify the number of observations , Keras is taking care of that automatically . Before that, you have to reshape your matrix to (53394, 3, 1) . You can use np.expand_dims() or the .reshape() command.
