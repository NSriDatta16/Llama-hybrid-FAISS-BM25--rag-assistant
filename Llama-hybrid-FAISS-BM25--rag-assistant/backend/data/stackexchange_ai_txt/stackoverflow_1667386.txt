UBLAS Matrix Finding Surrounding Values of a Cell?

I am looking for an elegant way to implement this. Basically i have a m x n matrix. Where each cell represents the pixel value, and the rows and columns represent the pixel rows and pixel columns of the image. Since i basically mapped points from a HDF file, along with their corresponding pixel values. We basically have alot of empty pixels. Which are filled with 0. Now what i need to do is take the average of the surrounding cell's, to average out of a pixel value for the missing cell. Now i can brute force this but it becomes ugly fast. Is there any sort of elegant solution for this?
