Personally, I don't think there are big performance gap between asp.net mvc and web form. Because they actually employ the same underlying engine. In most cases, what makes performance a problem is how developers write their code, and the structure of the application. Usually, people tend to compare mvc and web form on the elegance, maintainability. http://weblogs.asp.net/shijuvarghese/archive/2008/07/09/asp-net-mvc-vs-asp-net-web-form.aspx
