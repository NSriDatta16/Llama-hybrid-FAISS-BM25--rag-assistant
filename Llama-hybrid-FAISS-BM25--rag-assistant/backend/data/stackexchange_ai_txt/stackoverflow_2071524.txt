how to get a window to receive drag and drop files in Xcode

i am trying to get drag and drop working in xcode 3.1.4 on osx/leopard. any pointers or hints or maybe even example code? i cannot find anything out there and it is really disappointing. i want to have the interface respond if files are dragged on the main window.
