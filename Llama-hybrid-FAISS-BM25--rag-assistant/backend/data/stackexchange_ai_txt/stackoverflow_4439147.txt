Simple email forwarding server

I need to forward emails for a several domains to other email addresses. Previously I have used hMailServer on my Windows server to perform this forwarding function, but I am looking for something simpler that I can interface with from a .NET application. Is there a simple email forwarding server I can easily manage from .NET? Spam filtering or email storage is not required.
