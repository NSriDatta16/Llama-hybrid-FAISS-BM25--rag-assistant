Obviously, this isn't exactly what you want but in the absence of anything better you could wrap the offending includes in a #pragma error_messages block. E.g. #pragma error_messages (on , tag .. tag) #include // etc #pragma error_messages (default , tag .. tag) as described here . I don't currently have access to Solaris so I haven't tried this.
