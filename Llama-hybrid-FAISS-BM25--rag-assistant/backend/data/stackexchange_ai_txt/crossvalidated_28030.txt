Your two methods answer two different questions. Method 1: On average, how big is the difference between the wages of women and men? Method 2: On average, how big is the difference between the wages of women and men within occupations? The usual fairness analysis uses method 2 since various occupations may have different pay scales (some higher and some lower) and since there may be different proportions of women in various occupations. If you are looking simply at the income of women vs men, then method 1 is appropriate. You did not ask about the use of median versus mean, but you might spend some time thinking about which you really want to use. You might also think about whether you want to consider percent difference within occupation rather than difference in dollars, at least in some of your analyses.
