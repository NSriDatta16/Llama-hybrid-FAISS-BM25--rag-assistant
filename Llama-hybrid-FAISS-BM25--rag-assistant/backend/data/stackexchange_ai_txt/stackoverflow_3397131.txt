Have you tried setting the value to ID;#Username? ID is the SPUser.ID and Username is really just the display name or account name. Ex: 42;#Raghu. Keep in mind, that a particular user's ID changes depending on what Site Collection you're working in (the same user in Site Collection A may have a different ID in Site Collection B). You may have to use SPWeb.EnsureUser to make sure the user exists on the web you are trying to update.
