Windows Azure Platform Ready Testing Tool

I am running the platform ready test tool to try and qualify for the Powered By Windows Azure Logo Program. My application is in production and has been running in azure for 5 months now. The application consists of a windows forms and WPF Client application which connects to a set of WCF Services running in azure which in turn connects to SQL Azure. The application also uses blob storage in Azure and I have getting on for 1TB of documents up there. The application uses basic http binding and is configured Like this I successfully passed the test for SQL Azure but failed the test for windows azure with the following message ====================================================================== Test case/Verification: TC 1 - Application must be a valid Azure application designed to connect with or work in the Windows Azure Environment ====================================================================== Status is ProtocolError Fail The only thing I can think of this is causing this is that the application connects over https and the test tool does not allow me to specify a https endpoint. However I donâ€™t think I can easily expose a plain http endpoint just to pass the test as WCF wont allow me to do that when TransportWithMessageCredential is used. Does anyone have any ideas?
