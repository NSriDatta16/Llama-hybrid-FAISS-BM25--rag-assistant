An additional thought - generally, engineers don't have a thorough concept of what a peice of code is doing until they've added to it and/or tested it. Yes, it's possible through observation to get the gist of the code's purpose. But the goal of documentation should be to cover nuances and concerns that are not obvious. I don't think any developer - junior or not - is going to just look at code and write useful documentation. Giving junior developers encouragement to enhance documentation while they are doing some other task, is a good plan, since they will inevitably catch something that seemed "obvious" to the original developer. But those reasons to document don't become obvious until you are trying to fix a bug or enhance a feature and you don't get why the code isn't working as planned.
