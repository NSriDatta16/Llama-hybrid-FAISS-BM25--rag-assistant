Aside from the indexes that should exist on your lookup tables as pointed out in anser by John, I would ensure you have an index on COMM_TYPE_ID in your consumer_action_log table too. Then, add one keyword to your clause... I've always seen great results when a query is well organized instead of relying on the query engine to optimze... see another sample here SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN cr.COMMUNICATIONS_ID AS ANSWER_ID, cr.CONSUMER_ID as VIEWER_ID, etc... rest of your query... It might be the optimizer is trying to look at other tables to figure out what to get. See comments in other StackOverflow answer I've provided link to.
