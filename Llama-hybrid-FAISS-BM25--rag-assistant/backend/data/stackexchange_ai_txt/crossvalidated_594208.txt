High correlation between residuals and fitted values in a linear mixed effect model

I am doing behavioural research on dragonfly larvae and I am trying to answer the question "Is there a behavioural difference between males and females and between species? + Do the difference between males and females change according to the species?" The behavioural data I have is the total distance moved by each individual in 15 minutes. I tested some of the individuals twice. I asked my question to the model as: lmer(Distance.moved~Sex*Species+StartTime+(1|Pond)+(1|ID), data) The residuals are normally distributed, but when I plot the residuals vs fitted scatter.smooth(fitted(mod1), resid(mod1)) they are correlated. And here is the summary of my model: REML criterion at convergence: 2705.3 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.91074 -0.42168 0.00311 0.43850 1.91074 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

How would you ask my research question with a model? Can I use this model with unequal sample sizes and if not, why not? Am I violating the assumption of homogeneity by using unequal sample sizes? Can I trust the results the model is giving when I am violating one of the model's assumptions? Thank you for reading my question I am new to modelling and I would really appreciate any help :)
