The general rule is $\sqrt N$. So from daily data, annual volatility would be estimated as sd(v)* sqrt(255) . Hence for your example, multiply the estimated error by the square root of twelve. Edit: In response to the follow-up comment, here is a complete worked example with real data. The annual volatility comes out to be around 16% which seems about right. You could modify this for rolling volatilities, or weekly data, or ....
