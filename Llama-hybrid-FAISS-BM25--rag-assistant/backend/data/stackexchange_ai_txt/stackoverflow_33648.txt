Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming Initially I thought you were talking about normal defensive programming , wherein the idea is to defend the program (or your subset of it, or your single function) from invalid data input. That's a great thing, and I encourage everyone to go read that article. However it seems you are actually talking about "defending your code from other programmers." In my opinion, this is a completely pointless goal, as no matter what you do, a malicious programmer can always run your program under a debugger, or use dll injection or any number of other techniques. If you are merely seeking to protect your code from incompetent co-workers, this is ridiculous. Educate your co-workers, or get better co-workers. At any rate, if such things are of great concern to you, ruby is not the programming language for you. Monkeypatching is in there by design, and to disallow it goes against the whole point of the feature.
