No, or at least I would say not necessarily explicitly. If you have an image formation model (e.g. derived from the physics of the imaging process), you can pose recognition, reconstruction or detection as an inverse problem using parametric or implicit representations of your "pattern" or object of interest without making any probabilistic modeling explicit. For a more practical example, backprojection is a computationally efficient algorithm that solves the inverse radon transform and is often used to obtain tomographic pixel reconstructions (~ recognition of an image representing the object scanned). This is a situation where you have a well-posed inverse problem for a known forward model. That said, many inverse problems can be understood as bayesian MAP or ML inference problems, where the forward model is re-written as a probabilistic model. For example, if the inverse problem is ill-posed, it is common to use regularization methods (e.g. TV or TR ) to make the numerical treatment easier. However, many regularizers can be understood in a bayesian sense as priors acting on the parameters that the inverse problem aims to recover.
