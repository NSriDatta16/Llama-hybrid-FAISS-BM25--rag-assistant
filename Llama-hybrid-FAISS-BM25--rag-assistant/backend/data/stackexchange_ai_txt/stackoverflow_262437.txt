Have you considered network mapped drives? They can be very slow to respond for certain things. Have you tried getting the list of drives, and then checking each drive in parallel rather than in serial? Cancel any pending requests when a result is found and return true. Since the real dvd drive will probably return right away, this would prevent any slow volumes from dragging the rest of the processes.
