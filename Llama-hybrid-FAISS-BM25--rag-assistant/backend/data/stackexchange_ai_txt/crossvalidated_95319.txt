I think it depends on the specific form of the time series model. de Boef and Keele (2008) give a nice overview of dynamic time-series models and how they relate to one another. I tend to prefer the single-equation generalized error correction model (1; Banerjee, 1993) because it is agnostic as to the stationarity of predictors, and seems to have decent estimation properties for near-integrated data as per de Boef (2001). $\Delta y_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{c}(y_{t-1} - \Sigma \mathbf{X}_{t-1}) + \mathbf{B}_{\Delta}\Delta \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{BX}$ References Banerjee, A., Dolado, J.
