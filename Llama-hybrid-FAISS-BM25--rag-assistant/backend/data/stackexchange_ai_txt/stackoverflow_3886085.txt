Implementing Timeout Javascript in a PeopleSoft iScript

Regular PeopleSoft components automatically generate a timeout popup window when a user is about to be logged out. iScripts, however, do not. I was about to reverse-engineer the javascript that PeopleSoft automatically generates for components in order to leverage existing code. Before I do, I thought I'd check if anyone else has done this, and if there are any gotchas, tips or tricks. Or maybe there's a better way?
