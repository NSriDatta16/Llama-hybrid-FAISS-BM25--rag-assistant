This is a bug. The workaround is simple - you just need to manually set the width and height after you have called the constructor. I do this by creating my own Video class which inherits from the one in flash.media, like so: package com.ganzogo.media { import flash.media.Video; public class Video extends flash.media.Video { public function Video(width:int=320, height:int=240) { super(width, height); this.width = width; this.height = height; } } } Then just import this class and your code should work. Notice that I am setting defaults for the dimensions; this is to match the defaults in the parent class.
