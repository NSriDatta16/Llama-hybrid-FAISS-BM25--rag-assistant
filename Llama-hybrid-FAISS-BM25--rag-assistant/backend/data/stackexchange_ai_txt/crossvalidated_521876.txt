The first should penalize non-participation. It would rank highly those who participate in many events and who score decently in each of them. That is, all-rounders would be highly ranked Couldn't you just take the scores from each event, and then convert them into z-scores? You could do this using: $$ {\displaystyle z={x-{\bar {x}} \over S}} $$ where: ${\bar {x}}$ is the mean of score of all the participants within that event. $S$ is the standard deviation of the scores within that event. For "golf" scores (lower is better) just invert the signs on the z-score. Then shift the z-scores by a certain amount so that they are all positive. Finally, for non-participators, just choose an arbitrary z-score lower than the most negative z-score for participators! The second should not penalize non-participation that much. If you always out->perform all competitors by a large margin, but only participate in a few events, >then you would score highly. Here, just use the z-scores WITHOUT shifting them to a positive value. This means you get negatively scored for being WORSE than average.
