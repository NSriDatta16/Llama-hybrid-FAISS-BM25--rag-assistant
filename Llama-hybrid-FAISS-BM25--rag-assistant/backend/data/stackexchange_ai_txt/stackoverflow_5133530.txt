How to crawl a wordpress blog?

I write a c program to crawl blogs. It works well until it meets this blog: www.ipujia.com. I send the HTTP request: GET http://www.ipujia.com/ HTTP/1.0 to the website and get the response as below: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 13:15:26 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.16 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.16 OpenSSL/0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.8.8 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.14 Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0 Pragma: no-cache Last-Modified: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 13:15:27 GMT Location: http://http/www.ipujia.com/ Content-Length: 0 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 This is strange because I cannot get the index page following the Location. Does anyone have any ideas?
