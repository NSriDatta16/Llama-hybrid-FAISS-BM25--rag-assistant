There are several things you can do: 1) Research English syllable structure, and generate syllables following those rules 2) Employ Markov chains to get a statistical model of English phonology. There are plenty of resources on Markov chains, but the main idea is to record the probability of there being any particular letter after a certain sequence. For instance, after "q", "u" is very very likely; after "k", "q" is very very unlikely (this employs 1-length Markov chains); or, after "th", "e" is very likely (this employs 2-length Markov chains). If you go the syllable model route, you can use resources like this to help you elucidate your intuitions about your language. UPDATE : 3) You can make it much simpler by not simulating full English, but, say, Japanese, or Italian, where rules are much easier, and if it's a nonsense word it is as easy to remember as a nonsense English word. For instance, Japanese only has about 94 valid syllables (47 short, 47 long), and you can list all of them easily and pick at random.
