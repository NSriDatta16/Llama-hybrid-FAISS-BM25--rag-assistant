It looks like you have some multicolinearity issues. Have you looked at the correlation between X1 and X2, as well as between X3 and X4 ? X3 and X4 are borderline identity. I would reduce the dimensionality using PCA(loosing inference about predictors) or switch to a GAM; a GEE may be useful if the issue is a result of improper or unknown covariance structure. However, your plots look like shotgun blasts, you have likely picked poor predictors.
