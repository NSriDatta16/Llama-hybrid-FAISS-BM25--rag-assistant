significance test for average distances?

I have many measurements of distances between places. Say, distances between a school and selected houses in different cities. I want to compare the distribution of distances across cities. I want to answer the question "Are the distances distributed roughly the same?". Which test would be the most appropriate? Is the fact that we're dealing with distances make it any different from a "normal" statistical significance test?
