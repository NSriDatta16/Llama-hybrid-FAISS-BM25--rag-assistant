Transformations are like drugs ... Some are good for you and some aren't. Transforming data by scaling is almost always a good idea . Transforming time series data like taking differences can be a bad idea as an unwarranted difference can actually inject structure into the data. Transforming data by replacing anomalous values by cleansed values enabling a clearer picture robust to the anomalies is also a good idea just as long as you get motivated to find out why the data was anomalous AND enable confidence limits that include the possibility of anomalous values . See @Aksakal's very wise words on this How to fit a model for a time series that contains outliers Power Transforms like logs or any other assumed transformation can be a bad idea . See When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? for a discussion of when and why you should transform. One caveat there are certain model objectives i.e. specific models which require transformations but these are usually special purpose and rare.
