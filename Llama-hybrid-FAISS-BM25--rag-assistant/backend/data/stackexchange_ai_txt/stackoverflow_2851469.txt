It's not PHP, but see if you can get a copy of Tate's Bitter Java. It will discuss the organizational side of things (how and why the organizational code improves stuff). I'm a bit hesitant to recommend one of the great Java books for PHP programming, but this book is one of the few that starts with code written without an organizational plan and improves it into a MVC like structure without the use of 3rd party libraries. This way it teaches you what the organization is about from a practical point of view. Hopefully once you understand the pattern, it won't be too difficult to translate the ideas into PHP. Another alternative is to grab one of the dozens of PHP frameworks and recode to the framework. Doing so will get your results much faster, but the drawback is that you'll likely understand those results in greater detail, and there is a small chance your code will not behave the same after you rewrite it from scratch. We all like to think the new stuff will do everything the old stuff did, but often we forget something (or it behaves differently).
