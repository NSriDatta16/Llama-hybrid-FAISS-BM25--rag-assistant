Logistic regression perfect fit but non-significant coefficients

I have a data set for customers with some columns like sign-up-date, address-added-date, credit-card-added-date and order-placed-date. Only a portion of signup customers added address, a portion of them added credit card information, and at the end most of them do not place orders. So most of the cells in this data set is NA. The goal is to predict whether a sign-up customer will place an order. I convert all the dates,except the sign-up-date into binary variable, to indicate whether a sign-up customer will add address or add credit card. I then use these two binary variable to fit the binary outcome of whether a customer has placed order. I use logistic regression, and have perfect fit. However, I have very high p-values. How do I interpret this result?
