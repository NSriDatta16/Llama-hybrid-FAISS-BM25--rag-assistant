What is the term for a time series regression having more than one predictor?

It's pretty tough to search the Web for info on something when you don't know what words are commonly used to describe it. In this case, I'm wondering what it's called when you include another predictor in a time series. As an example, say I'm modeling a variable $X$ using AR(3): $ X_t = \varphi_1 X_{t-1} + \varphi_2 X_{t-2} + \varphi_3 X_{t-3} + \varepsilon_t $ I want my model to include the effects of another variable—say, $Y$—so my model is now described as: $ X_t = \varphi_1 X_{t-1} + \varphi_2 X_{t-2} + \varphi_3 X_{t-3} + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_2 Y_{t-2} + \beta_3 Y_{t-3} + \varepsilon_t $ What would the term (or terms) be that distinguishes the former model from the latter?
