Your class c1 was never predicted by your classifier. This happens if the classifier cannot discriminate between the classes and a lower train error is achieved by not classifying this class and by instead classifying the class c3. The performance metrics seem fine if you used micro-averaging over your classes, because the classification problem is binarized by your classifier by not classifying c1. In the binary case tp in c2 is tn in c3 and so on. This will result in all metrics being the same. f1 score: 0.63=2*0.63*0.63/(0.63+0.63)
