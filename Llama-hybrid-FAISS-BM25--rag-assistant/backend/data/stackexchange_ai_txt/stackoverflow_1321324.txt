It is unlikely that substituting a different database engine will provide a huge increase in performance. The slow down you mention is more likely to be related to your schema design and data access patterns. Maybe you could provide some more information about that? For example, is the data stored as a time series? Are records written once sequentially or inserted / updated / deleted arbitrarily?
