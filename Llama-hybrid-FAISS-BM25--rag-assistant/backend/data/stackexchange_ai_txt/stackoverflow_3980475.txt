You can always drag a window by any control that has a mousedown event by using the "Magic" $F012 number with a WM_SYSCOMMAND message. It's something I picked up from Ray Kanopka (author of the excellent raize components), but I no longer remember how this was imparted to me. It is also a neat and simple way of allowing users to move borderless forms by giving them a label of panel that looks like a caption. For example, I use it to allow users to move a borderless about dialog: procedure TAbout_Dlg.LblTitleMouseDown(Sender: TObject; Button: TMouseButton; Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer); const sc_DragMove = $F012; begin ReleaseCapture; Perform( wm_SysCommand, sc_DragMove, 0 ); end;
