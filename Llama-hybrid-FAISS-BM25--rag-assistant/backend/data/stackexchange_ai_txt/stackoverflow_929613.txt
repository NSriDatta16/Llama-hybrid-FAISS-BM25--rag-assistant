No, I don't think they should be (or at least we don't do it, and we're pretty big :-). There's enough effort involved in localizing all the stuff that users see without having to worry about developers as well. There are no mainstream languages that support foreign language keywords and standard libraries so a rudimentary command of the English language is already a pre-requisite for developers. Of course, if developers develop their own libraries (or language), they're quite at liberty to localize or choose a non-English language.
