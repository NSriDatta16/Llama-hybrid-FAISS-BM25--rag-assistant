Adding to the existing vim answer, you can use d along with any cursor movement command to delete from the cursor's current position to the new position. For example, to delete... ...to end-of-paragraph (usually meaning "to the next blank line"): d} ...the line containing the cursor and the next 5 lines: d5j ...a set of parentheses, braces, etc. and its contents: d% (with the cursor on the opening or closing paren/brace/etc.) ...to the third appearance of the word "foo": d3/foo It's quite flexible.
