(This question was also cross-posted on the Visual Studio Extensibility Forum on MSDN . Repeating the answer here.) I presume you're talking about the Updates tab in the Extension Manager dialog (and the bubble you may see if the Pro Power Tools extension is installed). If this is an extension you've developed that will remain internal to your organization, users will not be informed of updates. In Visual Studio 2010, the Extension Manager will only query the Visual Studio Gallery for available updates.
