Neural networks have been around for a while, and originally were developed to model as close an understanding as we had at the time to the way neurons work in the brain. They represent a network of neurons, hence "neural network." Since computers and brains are very different hardware-wise, implementing anything like a brain with a computer is going to be rather clunky. However, as others have stated so far, neural networks can be useful for some things that are vague such as pattern recognition, facial recognition, and other similar uses. They are also still useful as a basic model of how neurons connect and are often used in Cognitive Science and other fields of artificial intelligence to try to understand how small parts of the complex human brain might make simple decisions. Unfortunately, once a neural network "learns" something, it is very difficult to understand how it actually makes its decisions. There are, of course, many misuses of neural networks and in most non-research applications, other algorithms have been developed that are much more accurate. If a piece of business software proudly proclaims it uses a neural network, chances are it probably doesn't need it, and might be using it to inefficiently perform a task that could be performed in a much easier way. Unless the software is actually "learning" on the fly, which is very rare, neural networks are pretty much useless. And even when the software is "learning", sometimes neural networks aren't the best way to go.
