What does the [Note] in undefined behavior paragraph in C++ standard mean?

As user Tony points out there's a [Note] in paragraph 1.3.12 of C++ standard saying permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment... Doesn't this contradict the definition of UB saying that ...this International Standard imposes no requirements ? I mean they say "no requirements" and then say "permissible UB" - right in the same paragraph. How should this note be interpreted? Does it indeed limit UB in any way?
