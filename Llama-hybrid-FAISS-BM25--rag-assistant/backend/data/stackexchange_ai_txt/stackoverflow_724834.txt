Firstly, you should be using semantic markup. If something is a header and content mark it up as such with header and paragraph tags. That will help you move out of the 'table-way' of thinking were you try to emulate your markup and styles like a table, markup should come first, CSS can come after. The following should do what you want: * { margin:0px; padding:0px; } .box { border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; margin:10px; } .box h3 { padding: 4px; border-bottom: solid 1px #BBBBBB; background-color: #DDDDDD; } .box p { padding: 6px; } please help make these divs stop overlapping please help make these divs stop overlapping Thinking about markup and style separately is the path to CSS Zen Mastery :o)
