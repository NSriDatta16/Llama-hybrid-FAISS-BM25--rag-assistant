If you get a "non-object" error when calling a model, there's a problem with Magento's attempt to get your model class, and it is returning null. The reasons for this are not always apparent. If this worked identically on a normal LAMP stack, then the problem is most likely not in your code. My first guess would be that the file does not have the proper permissions. Otherwise, it may have to do with resolving the classname. You could test this temporarily by calling the plugin directly like this: $obj = new Mynamespace_Mymodule_Model_Mymodel(); $obj->batch(); If this works, then the file is readable, and you will want to go spelunking in the resolution of that classname. If it doesn't work, you have a problem with either autoloading or the declaration of your class. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
