What do positive and negative gradient values mean for Convolutional Neural Network?

As we have the typicall pass of the neural network we make a forawrd pass to predict classes and then we have cost function and based on that we calculate gradients. I'm wondering what are the meaning of the positive and negatives values of gradient. The specific question that i want to know answer about is why the positive values of gradient maps mean that object was detected there? Or posting this question with example. Why here the highlighted gradients maps have parts of dog/bird/spider highlighted? If I m confusing something correct me.
