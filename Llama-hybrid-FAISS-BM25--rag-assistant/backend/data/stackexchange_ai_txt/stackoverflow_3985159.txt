Own Delegate Method

Good Morning Users, i have implemented the follwing deleagate Method: - (void)openFlowView:(AFOpenFlowView *)openFlowView doubleTapOnIndex:(int)index itemView:(AFItemView *)itemView{ NSLog(@"Der Touch geht!!!!!"); } And there the method should be prompted and called: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([touch tapCount] == 2) { if ([self.viewDelegate respondsToSelector:@selector(openFlowView:doubleTapOnIndex:itemView:)]) [self.viewDelegate openFlowView:self doubleTapOnIndex:selectedCoverView.number itemView:selectedCoverView]; } else { But it never goes into the second if, does anybody know why that is so?? Greetings and thank you all for helping beforehand
