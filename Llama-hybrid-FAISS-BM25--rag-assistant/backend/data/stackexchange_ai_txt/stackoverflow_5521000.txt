Is something like this what you're looking for? For[i = 1, i {Heads, Tails}, 2i+1]]] Which would give a sample output of: {Heads, Tails, Tails} {Tails, Tails, Heads, Heads, Tails} {Tails, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads, Tails} {Heads, Heads, Tails, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Tails} This also does the same thing: Do[Print[RandomChoice[{.5, .5} -> {Heads, Tails}, 2i+1]], {i, 4}] I don't know if there is a more elegant/efficient way of doing this, since I'm new to Mathematica - but I'm sure someone will comment if there is.
