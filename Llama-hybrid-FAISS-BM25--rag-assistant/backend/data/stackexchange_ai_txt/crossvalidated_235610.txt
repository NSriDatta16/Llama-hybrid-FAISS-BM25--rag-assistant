Reduced rank regression with binary outcome variable

I am trying to find dietary patterns related to a disease outcome. Unfortunately, I only have the binary outcome "disease yes/no" as outcome. I tried to perform PCA on the data, but the dietary patterns are not specific enough for my outcome. Therefore, somebody suggested me reduced rank regression, which is more related to the disease outcome. Is it possible to perform reduced rank regression on a binary response variable? If not, are alternatives available?
