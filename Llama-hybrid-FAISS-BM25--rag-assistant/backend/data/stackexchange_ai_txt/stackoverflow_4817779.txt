Create Regular time series from an irregular (as.Date) time series with frequency=23

I have the following problem in R. I would like to create a ts() object (i.e. a regular time series) from a irregular time series (i.e. a list of dates and data values). You can reproduce the problem with the following data set and R script: # dput(dd) result dd But this does not work, as I obtain a very long regular time series containing daily time steps. I would like to obtain a ts object with a frequency=23 correctly indicating the position for which data is not available as NA. I have been trying everything based on the example listed here for yearly data Convert a irregular time series to a regular time series but it does not work for data with a frequency of 23 (i.e. 23 values a year). I think I could solve it by avoiding to set dd$DATUM as.Date() but as an zoo object that can be ordered as a time series with 23 values a year. Any ideas? Thanks for your help
