Flack gave the correct answer using an XSLT template, I provide a full Nokogiri based example here: xslt = EOS src = Hello world ! This is another line. And a paragraph with a heading. Third line. EOS doc = Nokogiri::XML(src) paragraph = doc.at('p') xslt = Nokogiri::XSLT(xslt) transformed_paragraph = xslt.transform(paragraph) paragraph.replace transformed_paragraph.children puts doc Output: Hello world ! This is another line. And a paragraph with a heading. Third line.
