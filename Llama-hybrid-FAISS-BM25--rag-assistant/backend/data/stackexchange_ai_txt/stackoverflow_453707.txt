Synchronization has its place, but that's not the only difference between Vector and ArrayList . Vector grows its internal storage array by a fixed amount every time it exceeds its capacity, while ArrayList grows it by a fixed factor, which is usually a much better approach (since it gives an amortized cost of O(1) for appending an item). Also note that Collections.synchronizedList() can be used to create a synchronized view on any List implementation, so you don't have to be bound to the characteristics of Vector (you might want a synchronized LinkedList for example).
