How can I increase the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of event using logistic regression?

I will work on climate data to predict if a disease it will happen or not on a crop. During search I found logistic regression is best choice for my research, but it has several problems led to reduce the prediction. I'm new to prediction analysis and I don't know how to increase my prediction accuracy. There are several selection methods used with it. Which one is best to select data to fit the model. Which type of regression help me in this research?
