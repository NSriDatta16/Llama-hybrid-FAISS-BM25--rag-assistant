WPF DialogResult declaratively?

In WinForms we could specify DialogResult for buttons. In WPF we can declare in XAML only Cancel button: For others we need to catch ButtonClick and write code like that: private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { this.DialogResult = true; } I am using MVVM, so I have only XAML code for windows. But for modal windows I need to write such code and I don't like this. Is there a more elegant way to do such things in WPF?
