Any type of autoencoder learns what kind of features are common in the training data, then uses those features for reconstruction. If you want to reconstruct your medical images you are going to have to train your AE on similar images, and LOTS of them if you want a good result. It is possible to reconstruct images of things that were outside the theme of your training data as long as both themes have common features. For example, training on images of human faces and then reconstructing dog faces, however the results shouldn't be nearly as good.
