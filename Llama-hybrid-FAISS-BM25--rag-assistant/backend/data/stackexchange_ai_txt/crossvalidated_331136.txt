How are continuous time MDPs handled?

In its most basic form, given a finite state space, transition probabilities, actions and a reward function, we can use value iteration or policy iteration to find the optimal policy. For continuous state space we can use discretization. How are the cases with continuous time handled ? For eg. in the case of a continuous time random process like a Poisson process.
