The default alignment used by the compiler should be appropriate for the target platform (32- or 64-bit Intel/AMD) for general data. To take advantage of SIMD, you might have to use a more restrictive alignment on those arrays, but that's usually done with a #pragma or special data type that applies just to the data you'll be using in the SIMD instructions.
