Your estimates of coefficient values in circular coordinates seem to be suffering from a common problem with periodic data, aliasing . You model the data with a von Mises distribution : $$ f(x\mid\mu,\kappa)=\frac{e^{\kappa\cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)}$$ where $\mu$ is the measure of location, $\kappa$ is the measure of concentration, and $I_0(\kappa)$ is the modified Bessel function of order 0. You are modeling $\mu$ , in radians, as a further function of species and temperature (covering a range from 0 to 5.5 in these data). You are particularly interested in how the slope of the relationship between $\mu$ and temperature differs among species. Your estimates of these slopes are expressed in radians per unit temperature. Note that these 7 coefficient estimates are all near multiples of $\pi$ : $-2\pi, -\pi, 0,\pi$ . Furthermore, the average of the 7 slope coefficients for the species, the average change of $\mu$ per unit temperature, is close to a change of $-\pi$ radians per unit change in temperature! That doesn't make sense for these biological data. Here's what I suspect is the problem. The cosine function used to model $\mu$ (from the observed values $x$ and the associated species and temperature values) returns to 0 at intervals of $\pi$ . So it's possible that a model with very rapid changes of $\mu$ with temperature could fit the data as well as the much more modest changes that you know, based on the subject matter, are much more likely to be the case. This is similar to aliasing while sampling periodic signals, in which you can't distinguish a low frequency from higher multiples of that frequency. One solution in digital signal processing is to impose a low-pass filter. I see two ways to impose such a filter here. For one, although I don't do much Bayesian modeling, I suspect that your prior on the temperature coefficient was much too wide. Your prior knowledge suggests a very narrow range of possible values for these slopes, I would guess on the order of $\pm 0.5$ radians per unit temperature or less in these data. Set your prior accordingly. As an alternative, pre-center the data for each species at 0 radians, keeping track of the associated offset for each species. Then just do a standard linear mixed model, so there is no periodicity beyond what's in your initial coding of the data. That will model intercepts as differences around the individual species offsets, so to get actual intercept estimates you will have to add back those offsets. But the slopes should be handled just fine, they won't suffer from aliasing, and they should be similar to what a narrow-prior Bayesian model would provide, given the similarity between the von Mises and normal distributions.
