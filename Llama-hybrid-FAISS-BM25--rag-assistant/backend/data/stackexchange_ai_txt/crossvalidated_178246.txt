How can a PhD in Machine Learning and AI help you in a life out of Academia?

I have applied for a PhD in Computer Science. I do not however plan to become an academic afterwards. What I want to achieve is to try to commercialize my research by founding a startup or find a job outside of Academia, using the knowledge I will obtain for enhancing or building products/services for my employer. What I would like ideally, is to achieve Academic as well as Industry expertise in machine learning and AI, through a job or by trying to found a startup with a related thematology. Becoming a professor is completely out of my goals. However I want to be able to study academic literature with ease. Do you think my goal is reasonable, or a PhD is an overkill that would make me overqualified, loosing precious time in case I change my mind in the future ? I already have an MSc that provided a machine learing and image analysis course. My Master's thesis was also heavily focused on these subjects. But the reason I want the PhD is to learn more things and receive more hands on experience about Machine Learning and Complex Event Analysis. I believe that this process will also enhance my critical skills and analytical thinking. I understand this can get difficult and risky but I am willing to try. Does my goal make any sense or do I need a reality check ? I need hard critique.. Is that a healthy reason for attending graduate school ?
