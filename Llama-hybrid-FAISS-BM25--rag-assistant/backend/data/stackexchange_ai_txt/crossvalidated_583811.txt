The best way is maybe to complement yout table of counts with a table with percents (which corresponds to your calculations in the last paragraph). tab mac windows dislike 1590 1925 like 904 1637 Columnpercents are obtained (here in R) by prop.table(tab, 2) mac windows dislike 0.6375301 0.5404267 like 0.3624699 0.4595733 and this is how you could present it.
