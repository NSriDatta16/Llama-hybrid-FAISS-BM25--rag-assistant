Jupyter Notebook - Change HTTP Headers

I am using jupyter notebook to host my machine learning codes and notebooks. Jupyter Notebook server is sending some HTTP headers like Server = TornadoServer/5.1.1 I want to remove this header. Also want to add some HTTP headers like Cache-Control etc. Can someone please tell me : What kind of Http server jupyter notebook runs Which configuration file controls the HTTP headers sent by Jupyter notebook Any link which explains how to change/add/remove the HTTP headers Current jupyter notebook is running on Ubuntu server on https.
