Q: What is a good oob score for random forests with sklearn, three-class classification? A: Depends. In my view, if learning and testing samples are drawn from the same distribution, then -in my view- OOB is equal to approximately 3-fold cross-validation. So if we repeat the same question but with "3-fold cross-validation", the answer would be the same, which is "generally, the highest the accuracy the merrier, unless you fear to overfit your learning set because someone told you that the true testing samples are of a different distribution". Can you give me your dataset? I can have little fun with it and tell you what I manage to do with it for free.
