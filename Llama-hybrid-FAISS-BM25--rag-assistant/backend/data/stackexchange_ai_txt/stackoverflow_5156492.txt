Google leverages a feature of OpenID called "directed identity", which means that the Claimed Identifier that it sends the RP is going to be different for the same Google Account that is logging in for each unique RP. Yahoo and other providers do not leverage this feature so that's why you only see it for Google accounts. The key that Google uses to distinguish each RP is the IAuthenticationRequest.Realm property, which by default DotNetOpenAuth sets to be the root URL of your web site. This is why different hosting URLs such as http://localhost or http://localhost/mvc get different Claimed Identifiers. Janrain Engage has various service levels, some of which (last I checked) use their own domain name, with your RP's name included as a 3rd-level domain name, as the Realm, which can make it difficult or impossible to stop using their service because the claimed identifiers would all change, causing all your Google customers to lose access to their accounts on your site. However, last I heard, Janrain stores some special account details to make migrating off of their service possible. I suggest you contact their support people to ask them what the process is.
