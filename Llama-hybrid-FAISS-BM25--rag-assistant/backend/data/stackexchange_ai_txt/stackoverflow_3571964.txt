UISlider's track images don't stretch right on iOS 3.2+

I have a UISlider subclass that is supposed to implement a custom look. I'm doing this with stretchable images: UIImage* sliderBar = [UIImage imageNamed: @"SliderLeft.png"]; UIImage* sliderLeft = [sliderBar stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth: 7 topCapHeight: 0]; sliderBar = [UIImage imageNamed: @"SliderRight.png"]; UIImage* sliderRight = [sliderBar stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth: 1 topCapHeight: 0]; UIImage* sliderRing = [UIImage imageNamed: @"SliderRing.png"]; UIImage* sliderRingH = [UIImage imageNamed: @"SliderRing-Highlighted.png"]; [self setMinimumTrackImage: sliderLeft forState: UIControlStateNormal]; [self setMaximumTrackImage: sliderRight forState: UIControlStateNormal]; [self setThumbImage: sliderRing forState: UIControlStateNormal]; [self setThumbImage: sliderRingH forState: UIControlStateHighlighted]; This works fine on a device running 3.1.3. However, on an iPad (3.2.x) or iOS 4.x device, it looks like it's stretching the rightmost pixels, and never drawing the endcap. SliderLeft.png is 8 pixels wide (there is no right endcap), SliderRight.png is 11 px. I'm not seeing that anything here changed in UIImage or UISlider. Are there any known gotchas here? Like I said, it was all working when I wrote it, but newer OSes seem to break it.
