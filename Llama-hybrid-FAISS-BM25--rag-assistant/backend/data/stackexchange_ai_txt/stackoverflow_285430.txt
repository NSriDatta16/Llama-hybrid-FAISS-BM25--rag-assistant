I'm not aware of add-ins, but you mentioned regions and I see nothing wrong with doing something like this... foreach (Item i in Items) { #region something big happening here ... #endregion #region something big happening here too ... #endregion #region something big happening here also ... #endregion } EDIT: In response to the question's EDIT: You're right, sticking a bunch of regions everywhere isn't ideal and refactoring is probably the way to go. But it seems that you're looking for something magical that will "organize" the code for you, and I don't think that exists.
