After your clarification, here is a less elegant answer that might give you what you want. Well, you want the inverse of a really complicated function. I'm afraid my math skills aren't up to the task, but it should be doable. A less elegant solution is to find it by trial and error. Essentially, keep longitude the same and vary latitude. Using the right algorithm, you should be able to find one that is very close to the distance you want. This will give you a point on the circle (one of four that is also on the square). Then keep latitude the same and vary longitude. This will give you a second point on the square (on the middle of one of the sides), from there you can find the 4 corners of the square. This will slow, depending on how often you have to do it, that might or might not matter.
