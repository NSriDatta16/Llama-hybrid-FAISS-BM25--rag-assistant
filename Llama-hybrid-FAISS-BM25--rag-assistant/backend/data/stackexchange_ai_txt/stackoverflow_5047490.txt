Too much total live memory use is what will cause your app to crash and/or get rejected. If you leak memory inside a loop or repeating method, the leaks will eventually add up, and your app will crash. But if there is a leak, but not in a loop or repeating process, and the total amount is less than typical memory usage for an app, then it might be impolite and inelegant, but there's really no way to tell, and there's very little operational downside. I often stress test my apps by purposely "leaking" several megabytes during app launch, and making sure the apps still run OK. Some of these apps have gone on to be approved for App store distribution with this leaking test code still accidentally left enabled (mia culpa!). But that shows that even a few MB of leaks is not a problem for app approval (unless that's enough to make your app crash during low memory testing).
