find the point at which the curve significantly shoots up

so this is getting a little complex for me and hope someone can help me out. I do not have a mathematical background. I have a time series of daily rainfall for 50 years for a particular location. That location is marked by a very defined rainy season (normally starting around first week of June every year). Therefore you would expect a sudden surge of rainfall around June which lasts for approx 2-3 months and then subsides down. I was interested to know what sort of statistical or mathematical techniques can be used to mark the dates for each year when the monsoon begins. Basically I want to compute the rough onset dates for each year. Sorry if this question is a little vague. Thanks
