I believe this is the correct response, yes. In fact I think it's the only choice if you do want to handle this as a response (and can't do geo lookups for example) since all of the other 3xx range responses are for determinate results (except the weird 305 proxy). As for the excerpts: ...and agent-driven negotiation information is being provided... The intention here is to express that amongst the choices being made are choices which are based on the characteristics of the user-agent (which are infinitely varied potentially) which are typically conveyed in the accept headers and the user-agent header itself. Negotiation is a bit of a confusing term perhaps, but the concept it's referring to is the determination between the agent and the server of what kind of response is appropriate. Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s)... HEAD requests are designed to return response headers only (so you can do things like cheaply checking for content updates). They therefore specifically don't want a response body so don't need to provide the list of potential choices you would for 300 to a GET or POST request.
