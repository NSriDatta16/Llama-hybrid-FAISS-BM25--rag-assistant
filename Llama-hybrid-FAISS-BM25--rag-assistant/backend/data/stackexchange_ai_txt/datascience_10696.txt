You seem to be trying to do supervised learning without having labeled data. Do you have a general understanding about Machine Learning? Usually the ML problems are divided into 2 categories: Supervised Learning : Where you have data samples and a label for each sample, the goal is then to predict what are the labels of new samples. Unsupervised Learning : You just have the data samples and no labels, you want to find some way to group the data or to find some patterns in it. You should check the scikit-learn tutorials there you can learn the basics about ML and probably learn what you need for your project.
