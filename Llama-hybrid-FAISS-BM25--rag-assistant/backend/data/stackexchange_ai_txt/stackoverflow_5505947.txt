If you must retrieve the data from the database server, and you do that rarely, then the retrieval is bound to be somewhat slower than it could be, because the database server will not keep the table cached, because it's rarely used. This is good, because it frees up cache space for other tables, which result in better overall performance. It may be worthwhile to look into other storage mechanisms for your rarely-refreshed static data. Could you read it in from a local file? Could you keep a serialized structure on-disk and read it in? That may be faster than retrieving it from the database.
