In addition to the answers above I should notice, that really high-performance servers with many incoming connections attempt not to spawn a thread per each connection but use IO Completion Ports, select() and other asynchronous techniques for working with multiple sockets in one thread. And of course special attention must be paid to ensure that problems with one request or one socket won't block other sockets in the same thread. Also thread management consumes CPU time, so threads should not be spawned for each connection or each client request.
