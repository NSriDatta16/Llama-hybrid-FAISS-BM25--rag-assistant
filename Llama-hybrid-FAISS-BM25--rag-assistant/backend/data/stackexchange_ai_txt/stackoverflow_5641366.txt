Complicated HTML tooltips (storage) - architecture suggestion

I'm developing a complicated page containing some widgets, some 'draggable' elements and a interactive timeline. Problem: On mouseover - on elements that can be dragged (entities) -, I have to display a tooltip containing some advanced info (a 'preview' of an entity page) about that particular element. The draggable items (I think they are ~ 100) are represented in this way (some of them are created dinamically): title title title where .tooltip-wrapper is initially set to display:none and opacity:0 A general tooltip is a kinda complicated HTML containing some details i.e. (lot simplified) entity title I'm thinking about 3 possible solutions: On mouseover , (on first one) make an ajax request that returns the particular tooltip HTML, inject it inside the tooltip-wrapper, show it and on mouseout hide it. On mouseover , (on first one) make an ajax request that returns a json, render it by js (mustache), inject it inside the tooltip-wrapper, show it and on mouseout hide it. Render the tooltip directly inside an element, and toggle it on mouseover / mouseout The css/layout/positioning is not a big problem, also because I've already created a tooltip mootools plugin mockup (if u have any suggestion about some great customizable mootools tooltip plugins, please let me know :) ). I just need a tip/suggestion on which way to follow to implement this advanced 'tooltip' system or if you have better solutions to suggest me. :) Thanks everyone p.s. I'm developing the web app using rails3 (and haml, scss, compass) and mootools as js framework (+ mustache as templating system).
