Html.Actionlink only to be enabled conditionally and have dynamic submitting value

I'm working on an ASP MVC website and have encountered a problem. The page I'm working on has a drop down box which returns the value 'location' and one that returns 'name'. The 'location' drop down box filters the names for any in that location from the database. Underneath this is the option to add an additional name. I would like to add a hyperlink to a name edit location but since it's possible there are no names under that current location then it throws an exception when there is a name.id value of null and I doubt it would dynamically change the name value the hyperlink would post even if it ignored the original problem. Anyone have any idea how I could do this elegantly?
