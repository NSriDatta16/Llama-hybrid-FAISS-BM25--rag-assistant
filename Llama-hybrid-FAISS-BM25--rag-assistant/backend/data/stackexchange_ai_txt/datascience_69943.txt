What are machine learning/deep learning models for generating contextually related words and synonyms?

I have a task to work on models for finding synonyms and contextually related words. For example, if I enter: ' car ' it should generate -> ' vehicle ' ' sun ' and ' sea ' could generate ' beach ', or some other related word to the first two. So I used so far word2vec and nltk to generate examples. But since I am not an expert on NLP I really find it difficult to use other algorithms or to build my neural network architecture. I would appreciate it if someone can give me other suggestions and some explanations, that could be useful.
