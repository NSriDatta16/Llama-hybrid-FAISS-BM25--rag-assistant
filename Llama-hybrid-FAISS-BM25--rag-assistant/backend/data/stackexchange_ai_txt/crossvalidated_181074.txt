Neural network to learn a nonlinear function of 2 real variables

I am trying to build a neural network to learn a nonlinear function of 2 real variables. I have a dataset with 13000 of these vectors in 2-space and corresponding function values, and I am currently doing this on Azure ML. How many hidden layers should I use? How many neurons? What activation function? I have tried googling around, but I suspect that there is a particular jargon term from this task that I don't know. Thanks! This is the data: https://plot.ly/~housescraper/27/col1/
