I know what you mean, and I have found a slightly better solution: go to the list view and... drag either the background view or your custom view up to the root hierarchy level (adjacent to File's Owner) double click on your custom view and edit away using drag-box-selection when finished, drag the view back into its original hierarchy position The key here is that the GUI editor only edits one root object at a time, so moving the background vs. 'foreground' views into separate root objects allows you to edit them separately. Woo!
