I've solved the problem in a slightly different way. I didn't know that you could use an SQL expression as an ICriteria-criterion (thx to the NH-Users google-group), so I did it like this: ICriteria crit = session.CreateCriteria (typeof(Prestation), "p"); crit.SetFetchMode ("p.Prices", FetchMode.Eager); crit.Add (Expression.Sql ("{alias}.PrestationId = ( SELECT id FROM sometable WHERE ... ")); crit.SetResultTransformer (Transformers.DistinctRootEntity); var result = crit.List (); Anyway, the question remains if the behaviour that I've got using the ISQLQuery is expected, or a bug ... The NHUsers thread that I've started as well
