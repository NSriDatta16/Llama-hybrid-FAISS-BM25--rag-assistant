Many mathematicians and statisticians are undisciplined in the use of these words, using the word "random variable" to refer to any quantity to which a probability distribution is assigned. The number of spades you get in a poker hand from a well shuffled deck is random. The mass of the dwarf planet Pluto may not be random the way a poker hand is, but it may be uncertain in such a way that it is reasonable to express that uncertainty by assigning a probability distribution to the mass. Suppose you take a random sample of $50$ twenty-one-year-old men from a large population and measure their heights and use the sample average as an estimate of the average height of twenty-one-year-old men in the whole population. After you've sent them home, you draw a new sample of $50$ such men, and do it again. For many purposes in statistics, anything that changes when you get that new sample is "random."
