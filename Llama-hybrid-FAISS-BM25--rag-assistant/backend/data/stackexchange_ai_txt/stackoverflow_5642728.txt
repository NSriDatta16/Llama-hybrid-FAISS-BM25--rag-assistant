Bind an event handler function to the add button click event. http://api.jquery.com/click/ Get the currently selected value from the drop down select box. http://api.jquery.com/val/ Then append it to the list element (div, span, whatever), increment a count variable, if it equals 10, don't append it and show an error message. http://api.jquery.com/append/ Bind an event handler function to the save button click event. Loop through each item in the list element building an array of the list items and values needed for storage. You could also check here that they have at least 10 items selected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ (Alternately, when you are adding it to the display list, you could also stick the values in an array rather than looping over the element later, that would actually be better. Until you add remove functionality to the temporary list anyways, then it gets more complicated.) Post the data to a php backend function which saves the result. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ On success display success message. http://api.jquery.com/html/
