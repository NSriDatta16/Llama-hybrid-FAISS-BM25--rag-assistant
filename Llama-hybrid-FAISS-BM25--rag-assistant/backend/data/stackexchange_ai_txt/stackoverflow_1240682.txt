You can edit files remotely over ftp or sftp or scp or whatnot with vim: vim ftp://user@host/some/file Of course, this also works with tabs. Don't know about minibuf, though. Unfortunately, the NERDTree plugin does not seem to support this. However, the :Explore command plays along just nicely. Of course, you could simply use FTPFS to mount a remote directory and work with that as if it was local storage.
