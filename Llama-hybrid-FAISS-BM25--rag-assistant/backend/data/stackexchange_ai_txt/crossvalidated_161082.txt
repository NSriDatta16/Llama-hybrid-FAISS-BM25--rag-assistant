Bayesian model selection in PyMC3

I am using PyMC3 to run Bayesian models on my data. I am new to Bayesian modeling but according to some blogs posts , Wikipedia and QA from this site, it seems to be a valid approach to use Bayes factor and BIC criterion to be able to choose what model best represent my data (the one which generate my data). To compute the Bayes factor, I need the relative likelihood for models I want to compare. It's maybe a bit confuse to me but I think there is two way to get the likelihood (correct me if I am wrong): the algebraic way when model are simple: see Wikipedia example Bayes factor page the numeric way: this is what does PyMC3 with the MCMC algorithms How can I access to the likelihood and so compare my models in PyMC3? I found model.logp method which according to the doc is the "log probability density function". Can I use that to get the likelihood? Bonus question: when two models are compared the ratio between both likelihood is computed. What happen if you want to compare several models? A concrete PyMC3 example would be very helpful!
