How to make an Entity read-only?

What is the proper way to make an Entity read-only with JPA ? I wish my database table to never be modified at all programmatically. I think I understand that I should lock my objects with LockModeType.READ . Is it possible to use an annotation to make my entities directly locked after retrieval from the database ? Or do I have to mess around and override my generic DAO for that specific entity ?
