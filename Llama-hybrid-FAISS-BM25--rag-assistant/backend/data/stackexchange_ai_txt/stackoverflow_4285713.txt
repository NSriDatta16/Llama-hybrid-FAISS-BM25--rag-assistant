All strings in RoR3 are sanitized by default converting special characters in html entities. If you want to preserve user presentation data (as the formatting on a blog post) you can use a lib like Nokogiri to validate the HTML truncated, something along the lines.= def html_preserving_truncate(data); html = truncate(data, lenght: 100); Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(html).to_s; end
