Your question seems a little ambiguous, saying that you're not having any luck? What is the problem exactly? Are you getting a different response entirely than when you view the page in a browser? If so, then do what @cam says and analyzer the headers, you can do it in Firefox via an extension, or you can do it in Chrome natively. Either way, try to mimic the headers that you see in whatever browser you are doing in you mechanize user agent. Here is a script that I used to mimic the iTunes request headers when I was data-mining the app-store: def mimic_itunes( mech_agent ) mech_agent.pre_connect_hooks Note: the constants in the example are just strings... not really that important what they are, as long as you know you can add any string there Using this approach, you should be able to alter/add any headers that the web application might need. If this is not the problem that you are having, then post more in-depth details of what exactly is happening.
