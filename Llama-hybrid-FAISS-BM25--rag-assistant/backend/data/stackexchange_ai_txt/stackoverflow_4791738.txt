As Lloyd said, in WPF instead of using the arguments in the project startup class as you would in ie WinForms you extract this from the commmand line args. This can b done whenever so in your first window ie you could do something like this: public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); string[] param = Environment.GetCommandLineArgs(); // Your parameter is in the second one since the first contains the executable path or something like that string xmlPath = param[1]; // Open and edit your xmlPath // .... } Then you can simply drag&drop the xml you want ontop of your WPF executable or invoke it on commandline: YourExecutable.exe myXml.xml
