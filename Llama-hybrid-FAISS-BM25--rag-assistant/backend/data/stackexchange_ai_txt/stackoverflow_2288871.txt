paperclip polymorphic association and saving

I changed my photo.rb model to be polymorphic and be usable to all sorts of other models needing to save images and it works fine except I can't figure out how to save new attachments properly through the parent model. Any ideas? Do I have to approach this differently somehow? As, its also not getting the imageable_type...which i'll have to add. I saw the polymorphic paperclip plugin which looks like a beast and uses yet another table? So I'm hoping for a better work around. I'm getting: ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch (Photo(#2189565500) expected, got Array(#2148226700)) Parameters: {"commit"=>"Create", "action"=>"update", "_method"=>"put", "authenticity_token"=>"kp7NeMs7moGwu0AZMXVowUpphp9vzitdZZ6t8YO7RKQ=", "id"=>"2586", "muffin"=>{"photos"=>{"data"=># }}, "controller"=>"muffins"} muffin.rb has_many :photos, :as => :imageable, :dependent => :destroy photo.rb belongs_to :imageable, :polymorphic => true has_attached_file :data, :storage => 's3', :s3_credentials.....
