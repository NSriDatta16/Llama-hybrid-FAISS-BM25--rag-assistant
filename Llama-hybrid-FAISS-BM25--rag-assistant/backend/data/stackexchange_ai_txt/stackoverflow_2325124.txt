A good WCF client design pattern

My application communicates with a large number of wcf services i.e. my application has several assemblies which each consume a different wcf service. I am looking for a good wcf client design pattern so that I can keep my code concise, reusuable and elegant. The wcf services which I consume are all the same - the basically used to check prices and then book things.
