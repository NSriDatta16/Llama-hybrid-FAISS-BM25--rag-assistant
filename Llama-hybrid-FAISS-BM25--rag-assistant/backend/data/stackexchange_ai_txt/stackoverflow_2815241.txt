Is there any Application Server Frameworks for other languages/platforms than JavaEE and .NET?

I'm a CS student and has rare experience from the enterprise software industry. When I'm reading about enterprise software platforms, I mostly read about these two: Java Enterprise Edition, JavaEE .NET and Windows Communication Foundation By "enterprise software platforms" I mean frameworks and application servers with support for the same characteristics as J2EE and WCF has: [ JavaEE ] provide functionality to deploy fault-tolerant, distributed, multi-tier Java software, based largely on modular components running on an application server. WCF is designed in accordance with service oriented architecture principles to support distributed computing where services are consumed by consumers. Clients can consume multiple services and services can be consumed by multiple clients. Services are loosely coupled to each other. Is there any alternatives to these two "enterprise software platforms"? Isn't any other programming languages used in a bigger rate for this problem area? Why isn't there any popular application servers for C++/Qt? Note: By "Application Server" I mean a server mainly for GUI-software and not a Webserver/Web Framework. See what is the difference between web servers and application servers?
