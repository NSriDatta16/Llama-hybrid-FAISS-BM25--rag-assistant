Organizing Extensions Functions in a Lib

In designing a library that is fluent and that relies on extension functions what would be a way to provide an alternative behavior of an extensions function? So for instance a library that does some kind of formatting: (123.456879) .RoundTo(2) // Rounds to 2 places .ToCurrency() // Applies the appropriate currency symbol .ToString() Given that RoundTo , and ToCurrency would be extension functions, what would be a way to change the behavior of RoundTo and/or ToCurrency ? Thanks, L-
