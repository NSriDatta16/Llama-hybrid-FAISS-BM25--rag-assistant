why is the first column of my PCA always the largest?

I have a set of samples, compute the covariance matrix, and calculate the eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the first column. I then re-order my original samples and repeat the process. The largest eigenvalue still corresponds to the first column. What am I doing wrong? I have a simple example to demonstrate: import numpy as np x = list(range(0, 10)) y = list(map(lambda val : 5 * val, x)) z = list(map(lambda val : 2 * val, x)) xyz = np.array([x, y, z]).reshape(10, 3) zxy = np.array([z, x, y]).reshape(10, 3) yzx = np.array([y, z, x]).reshape(10, 3) e1, _ = np.linalg.eig(np.cov(xyz.T)) e2, _ = np.linalg.eig(np.cov(zxy.T)) e3, _ = np.linalg.eig(np.cov(yzx.T)) # after printing e1 and e2: # e1 = [359.20992236 5.39279005 102.79728759] # e2 = [432.00432176 29.85486618 5.54081206] # e3 = [286.51923526 159.85319056 21.02757418] This experiment tells me that the feature importance is dependent on the position of the column in the matrix, which doesn't make sense. If a column was responsible for most of the variance in a data set, then I would expect that column of the covariance matrix to have the largest value, regardless of how the columns in the data set were ordered.
