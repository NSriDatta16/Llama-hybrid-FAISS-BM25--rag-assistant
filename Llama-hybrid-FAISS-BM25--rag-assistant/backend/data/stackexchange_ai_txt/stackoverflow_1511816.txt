In general; Everything is possible. I would suggest to first write down what you want to build, who you want it to maintain, what server architecture you want it to work on and then start to eliminate the options. First, you need to select a backend to store your data. For this, a couple of database systems have a "spatial" extension or module, these extensions support projections, transformation and spatial querying (nearest, within, touches, ...): Commercial: Oracle spatial MS SQLserver spatial Open Source: postgis (for postgres) MySQL spatial MonetDB (work in progress) flat files like ESRI shapefiles Then, you need a server application to host the geospatial datasets as (vector or raster) maps: Commercial: ESRI arcIMS ESRI arcGIS server PB MapInfo MapXtreme ... Open Source: UMN Mapserver Geoserver Mapnik Then finally, if you want to create a web application with interactive maps, you need some Javascript web map framework: Commercial: Google Maps PB MapInfo MapXtreme Map24 ... Open Source: OpenLayers Chameleon MapFish GeoExt You can also use a Flash web map framework like: Flamingo-MC All this, depending on the chosen architecture requires at least a webserver with either cgi or servlet runners. Basically, it all comes down to your organization: What is the architecture your organisation is currently working with? How is the expertise? What architecture matches your companies area of expertise? When going commercial, your licenses range from $500,- to $500.000,- depending on the vendor. When using open source, your licenses of course wil be nill. But you also need to calculate the learning curve and the configuration time needed.
