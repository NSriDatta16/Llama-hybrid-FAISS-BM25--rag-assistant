Depending on how you "step" you may be run through some platform/SDK code while moving between Activities even if your code seems to be running clean. To work around this I set a breakpoint somewhere within the next Activity and step through the current Activity and then once I hit the end of the code I hit resume and it breaks in my next Activity skipping any code that is not mine. Not the most elegant, but it works for me. In Debug you will always be run through the exception handling platform..
