How to compare short (9 points) time-series

I need to compare two time series to assess whether they are really different (eg. don't overlap) between themselves and from 0 (don't overlap zero). The easy way is to simply perform a paired t-test, but being consequent in time the values are not independent so I assume a t-test would give false results. I was wondering, is this also true for very short time series like mine? If still they are worth being considered time-series which test should be used for the two above mentioned cases?
