Leaving aside the algebra (which also works) think about it this way: The standard deviation is square root of the variance. The variance is the average of the squared distances from the mean. If we add a value that is closer to the mean than this, the variance will shrink. If we add a value that is farther from the mean than this, it will grow. This is true of any average of values that are non-negative. If you add a value that is higher than the mean, the mean increases. If you add a value that is less, it decreases.
