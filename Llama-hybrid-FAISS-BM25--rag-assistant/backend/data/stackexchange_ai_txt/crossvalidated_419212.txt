Random forests sample variables at each split. The default is to sample $\sqrt{p}$ variables each time. If you add more noise variables, the chance of the good variables being in the sample decreases. Hence they tend to appear first, on average, at a deeper level than before. With 4+10 variables, there is about a 30% chance of each good variable being picked. With 4+100, the chance is only 10.6%. the chance of at least one good variable being available at height 1 are 1-(1-p)‚Å¥, so 83% resp. 36% that one of the good variables is available and otherwise the first split has to use a noise variable etc.
