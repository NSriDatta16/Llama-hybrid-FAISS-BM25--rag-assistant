How to derive the variance of a weighted moving average?

I have a problem understanding a piece of a paper. Greatly appreciate any hint or help. It says: A sensor records $Z(i)$ at intervals of 1 second and calculates background values $U(i)$ using formula: $U(i)=RU(i-1)+(1-R)Z(i)$, where R is a constant factor and $U(0)$ is computed from pre-measurement data. Now, any idea if this formula is famous? Is it a two-term Gaussian mixture noise? Then, it says exactly like this: The variance $δU(i)$ of these values is computed from the calculated values $U(i)$: $δU(i)=k \sqrt{\frac{U(i)}{T}}$ where k is sigma factor and T is the given measuring time. I have no idea how the variance became something like that. I understand the term T and the sqrt function but the overall formula, no idea.
