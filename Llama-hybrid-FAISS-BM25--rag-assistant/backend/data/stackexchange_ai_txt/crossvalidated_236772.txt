After finding and researching the study/analysis methods involved further, I discovered these aren't probabilities at all, even though discussions in the study refer to them as such. These are actually odds ratios computed from a reference group using logistic regression techniques. From what I understand, though mathematically one can determine the probability of the outcome at the intersection of the various possible treatments applied, it is easier to work with the logs of these (called logit), using various matrix algebraic techniques (dot-products and cross-products as needed) to ultimately derive the intersecting probability sought after. I am reviewing those formulae and techniques now with the specific data presented in the study. Please disregard this problem in light of this new information, using odds ratios rather than probabilities. This is why these numbers exceed the normal range of probability from zero to one.
