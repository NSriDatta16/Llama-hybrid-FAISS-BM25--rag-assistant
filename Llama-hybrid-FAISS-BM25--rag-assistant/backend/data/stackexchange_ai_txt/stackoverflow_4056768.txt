How to declare array of zeros in python (or an array of a certain size)

I am trying to build a histogram of counts... so I create buckets. I know I could just go through and append a bunch of zeros i.e something along these lines: buckets = [] for i in xrange(0,100): buckets.append(0) Is there a more elegant way to do it? I feel like there should be a way to just declare an array of a certain size. I know numpy has numpy.zeros but I want the more general solution
