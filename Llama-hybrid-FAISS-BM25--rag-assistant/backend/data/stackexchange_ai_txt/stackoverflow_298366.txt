I had a similar problem, but it was with a Tomcat 5.5 server. The startup time was quite important, so I got this error. To solve this problem, I did that steps: In Preferences, Server, I changed the property "Server timeout delay" to "Unlimited". Edit: For Eclipse Ganymede, you must do that: In the server view, double-click on your server JBoss. In the overview, you have a "Timeouts" panel (by default, it is collapsed). You can define the timeouts for server start and stop operations.
