I've documented some steps to help clarify things: import csv from collections import defaultdict # a dictionary whose value defaults to a list. data = defaultdict(list) # open the csv file and iterate over its rows. the enumerate() # function gives us an incrementing row number for i, row in enumerate(csv.reader(open('data.csv', 'rb'))): # skip the header line and any empty rows # we take advantage of the first row being indexed at 0 # i=0 which evaluates as false, as does an empty row if not i or not row: continue # unpack the columns into local variables _, zipcode, level = row # for each zipcode, add the level the list data[zipcode].append(float(level)) # loop over each zipcode and its list of levels and calculate the average for zipcode, levels in data.iteritems(): print zipcode, sum(levels) / float(len(levels)) Output: 19102 21.4 19003 29.415 19083 29.65
