You can model this as a hierarchical/mixed model, where the regression slopes are themselves distributed as a latent mixture of Gaussians. This is a complicated, tricky analysis, and will require quite a bit of research, so I'll just give an overview here, and point to to some resources below. For each subject, you have a linear model: $$y = \alpha_s + \beta_s x + \epsilon$$ where $x$ is dose, $y$ is BPM at that dose, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the intercept and slope (and $s$ indicates the subject). In a standard mixed model, individual subjects' slopes are assumed to be normally distributed around the mean slope $\mu_{\beta}$ . $$ \alpha_s \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha})\\ \beta_s \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{\beta}, \sigma_{\beta})\\ $$ Here, instead, you assume that there are two distributions: a positive distribution with mean $\mu_{\beta(+)}$ , and a negative distribution with mean $\mu_{\beta(-)}$ . Each subject is either a $(+)$ or $(-)$ responder. $$ \beta_s \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{\beta(s)}, \sigma_{\beta})\\ \mu_{\beta(s)} = \begin{cases} \mu_{\beta(+)} \text{ if $s$ is $(+)$}\\ \mu_{\beta(-)} \text{ if $s$ is $(-)$}\\ \end{cases} $$ Thus, in the full model, you'll be estimating: $\mu_{\beta(+)}$ , the average slope for positive responders $\mu_{\beta(-)}$ , the average slope for negative responders The probability that each subject is a positive responder The proportion of positive and negative responders in the population. If you have any participant-level predictors, you can investigate how these affect the likelihood of someone being a positive or negative responder.
