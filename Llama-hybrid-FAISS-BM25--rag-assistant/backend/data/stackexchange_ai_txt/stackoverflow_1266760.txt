If this is something that you will just run on your own computer then Access might be an attractive option. Make sure you keep copies of your material in another folder, in case there are problems. If you are going to share the information in the database over a network with even one other person, I would select something else for the storage medium. Just my two cents, having worked with Access for many years. As others have stated, it is a better strategy to store links to documents stored in the file system, rather than storing the documents directly in the database. If you intend to share the database in a client/server arrangement, consider enlisting the help of a Microsoft Access expert, if you are not one already.
