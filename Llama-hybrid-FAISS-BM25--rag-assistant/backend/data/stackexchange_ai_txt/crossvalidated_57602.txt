Predicting high frequency finance time series with HMM

I have a the following time series Price BrokerID 632 Behaviour BrokerID 680 Behaviour ...BrokerID XYZ Behaviour 5.6 IP SP 5.7 BP IP 5.8 SP BP 5.83 IP SP where IP is idle position, BP is buying position, and SP is selling position. I want to use Broker behaviour as the known variable and price as the hidden variable and predict it using HMM. But my question is how to find the emission matrix between a character vector (broker behaviour) and price numeric vector?
