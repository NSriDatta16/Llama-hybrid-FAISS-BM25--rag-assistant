Well to start with, Business Logic should probably be avoided in the storage layer. As this seems to be unavoidable when using a DB such as Sql Server where a lot of the BL can exists in the DB , I think you might rather revert to using string IDs rather than auto IDs . This will be a lot more managebale than auto ids, and can be handled in better ways, even when using the actual application layer. For instance using a .Net approach, a lot of the the unique string IDs can be store anywhere from the config files , to additional lookups using the selected db, XML files.
