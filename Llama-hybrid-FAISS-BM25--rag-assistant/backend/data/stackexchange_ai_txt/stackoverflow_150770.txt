Guessing here that you meant avoid fragmentation and not avoid defragmentation . Also guessing that you are working with a non managed language (c or C++ probably). I would suggest that you allocate large chunks of memory and then serve heap allocations from the allocated memory blocks. This pool of memory because contains large blocks of memory is lessely prone to fragmentation. To sum up you should implement a custom memory allocator. See some general ideas on this here .
