Here's the workflow that most organizations use: When you make a production release, you tag it. In SVN, this is done with svn cp , copying trunk into a named directory under tags . If you need to make bugfixes to a production release, you use svn cp to copy the tagged revision into a branch under branches . You then check out this named revision, make your changes, and check in. If you're going to push the changes out to production, you can tag them from the branch, again using svn cp . Tags are cheap in Subversion. If the fixes you made in the branch need to go back into trunk , you can merge them. This is covered in the docs (this is a link to the chapter on branching and merging, but I recommend you read the introductory material if you're not familiar with SVN).
