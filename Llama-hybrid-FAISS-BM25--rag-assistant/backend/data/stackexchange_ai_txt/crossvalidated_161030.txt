interpolation of noisy data

Kevin Murphy discusses an approach to interpolate 1D data in his book "Machine Learning - a Probabilistic Approach". I have been staring at the page below for a while -- but am struggling to see the link / jump between 4.77 and 4.78. If the error terms are normally distributed with a variance of 1/lambda*I, then why does the Prior have the form as per 4.78? Any intuition / tips much appreciated.
