Decline in the purchase history seems to be a logical data to determine the churn. The approach to this would be simple : Try to calculate the average purchase cycle & average order value of each supplier Now you can define churn rule on following basis: a. Supplier whose purchase cycle lies in +- 10% of average purchase cycle and order value in +- 10% of of averge order value ---- No Risk Customer b. Supplier who purchase cycle has increase but order value have also increase in the same ratio ---- Low Risk / No Risk c. Supplier whose purchase cycle has remained same but order value has decreased over last 2-3 order ---- High Risk d. Supplier whose order value is same but purchase cycle has increased over last 2-3 cycles --- Risk (Needs attention) e. Supplier whose order value has decreased and purchase cycle has increased --Very High Risk Likely to churn
