Maybe I'm missing something, but your question reads to me like you are treating RSS and mRSS like markup languages . And this is a mistake-- they should be consider APIs instead. RSS â‰  HTML. RSS and mRSS (and any RSS extension) with anything other than plain text will, in my experience, be treated dramatically differently by different RSS reader. Even individual browsers will treat them differently. This all begs the question: What software is your feed going to be consumed by? Only a custom, internally developed reader? Then I would suggest changing the reader so that it rendors the with your embedded video so that it formats it to your requirements. Any and all RSS readers? This is going to be a big problem with anything other than plain text. You'll need to accept that your output is going to be hit-and-miss. Not all readers understand all RSS extensions. Embedding your video into the description is probably going to have generally disappointing results, although that may be your only option. Linking to the video is probably your only safe, consistant option. Sorry if I've wildly misunderstood your question!
