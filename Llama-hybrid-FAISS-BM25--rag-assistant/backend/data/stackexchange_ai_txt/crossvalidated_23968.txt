One way to compare models (whether mixed or otherwise) is to plot results. Suppose you havae model A and model B; produce the fitted values from each and graph them against each other in a scatter plot. If the values are very similar (using your judgement as to whether they are) choose the simpler model. Another idea is to find the differences between the fitted values and graph these against the independent values; you can also make a density plot of the differences. In general, I am a proponent of not using statistical tests to compare models (although AIC and its variants certainly have virtues) but rather using judgement. Of course, this has the (dis)advantage of not giving precise answers.
