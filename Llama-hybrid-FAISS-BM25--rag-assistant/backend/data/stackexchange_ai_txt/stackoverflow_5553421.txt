IP Lookup Table in Memory C

I'm currently experimenting with libpcap and various C applications and trying to do accomplish the following. Upon program initialization, I'd like to load IPs from a file and store them in memory. When I receive some packet details for processing, I'd like to compare an IP with the set of IP's loaded into memory. What's the best way/data struct to implement this in C? I need to accommodate a list growth and efficient matching, so I feel like a simple lookup array would be a wrong solution. Help?
