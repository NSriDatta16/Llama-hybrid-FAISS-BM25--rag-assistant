You don't need to have a "significant" overall result to do specific comparisons, if those comparisons were planned initially. See this page . That's the case for continuous or categorical predictors, despite what you might have inferred from prior study. As far as the modeling is concerned, categorical predictors are numerical predictors, just with a very restricted range of values (0/1). A global test has an advantage in discouraging you from excessive data snooping, which is probably why you have been cautioned against further analysis when the interaction isn't "significant." But if the tests were pre-planned that's not an issue. It comes down to what hypothesis you are trying to test and how you will interpret your results. If your initial hypothesis was whether the pub contrasts were significantly different from 0 within each of the tcat levels, then what you did is fine. Don't over-interpret those results, however. The apparent lack of "significance" of the interaction term or of the pub contrast within tcat=4 might just be due to an under-powered study. Compare the pub contrasts within tcat=2 and tcat=4 . The point estimates are very close (0.358 vs. 0.331), but the standard errors are quite different (0.127 vs. 0.281). So by the usual p pub contrast within tcat=4 isn't "significant" even though its estimated value isn't far from that of tcat=2 . On that basis, do you really want to conclude that there is no effect of pub within tcat=4 ? Within tcat=1 , the point estimate of 1.155 for the pub contrast is numerically much higher than those within the other levels, but its standard error of 0.471 is much larger. The standard errors of coefficients are in part determined by the numbers of observations: were there many fewer observations having tcat=1 ? Do you then want to interpret the lack of "significance" of the interaction term (as best evaluated by anova() on the models with and without the interaction; don't rely on the individual interaction coefficients) as a true lack of differences among the tcat levels, or just as a sign that your study wasn't large enough?
