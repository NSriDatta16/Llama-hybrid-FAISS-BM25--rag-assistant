The stack shouldn't be used for large blocks of memory. You simply have to pay the higher price of heap allocation in exchange for the benefit of accessing more memory. Another option is declaring an array with static storage duration, but that has other drawbacks (not re-entrant, not thread-safe). Everything is a tradeoff. In any case, when allocating complex objects, the cost of calling 1000 constructors will dwarf the time spent in the allocator. Just use std::vector unless you have profiler data that shows a performance problem.
