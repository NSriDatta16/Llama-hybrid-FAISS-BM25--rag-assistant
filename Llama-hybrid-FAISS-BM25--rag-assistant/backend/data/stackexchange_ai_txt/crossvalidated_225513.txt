From the scatterplot it looks like the data are independent. (There are many ways to test this: consult information on time series analysis and autocorrelations.) Assuming this is the case, the chance of any value in a set of $n$ values (not just the very last one) being smallest does not depend on when the value occurred. Consequently all values have an equal chance of being smallest. Assuming there are no ties for smallest, that chance must be $1/n$ so that all chances sum to unity, as probabilities must. As an application, you have $11,475$ values. The next one will bring $n$ up to $11475+1 = 11476$. Therefore the chance that it is the smallest is $1/11476$. Incidentally, this rule implies the expected number of new minima among such a sequence is approximately $\log(n)$. The illustrated data appear to have $9$ new minima (plotted as orange points) and indeed $\log(11475)\approx 9.35$. A quick simulation (taking ten seconds or so) gives us a sense of the distribution of numbers of new minima, which might be of some interest (and perhaps help inform the intuition). This is the R code to produce such a simulation. N
