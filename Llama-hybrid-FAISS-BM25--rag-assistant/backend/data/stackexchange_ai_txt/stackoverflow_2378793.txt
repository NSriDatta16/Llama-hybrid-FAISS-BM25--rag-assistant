how to create an "briefing" iframe on top of the page

The purpose is to let people embed my iframe at a certain size say 100*100, but then per user clicks this iframe should resize itself to the page size and back. This should be independent of the structure of the HTML embedding the iframe (if possible). Is it doable? Guy
