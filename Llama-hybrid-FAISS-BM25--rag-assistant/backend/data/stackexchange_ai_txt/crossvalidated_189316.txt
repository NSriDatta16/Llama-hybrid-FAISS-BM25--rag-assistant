Stumbled upon this recently, and to add to the answer from @user495285, as far as I understand it: When the values are normalized and sum to one, then the uniform distribution is the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and what is being calculated by using an $L_p$ norm is the deviation from the unit sphere using a distance measure of a given $p$, i.e. deviation from the uniform distribution in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with geometric distance measure $p$. The $L_2$ norm places higher weight on large deviations from the unit sphere in any given dimension, whereas smaller values of $p$ place less weight on large deviations. When the underlying distribution is the unit sphere, the numerator equals zero in the following equation: $$\frac{n\sqrt{d} - 1}{\sqrt{d} - 1}$$ where $n$ is the $L_2$ norm and $d$ is the vector length. I believe that the usefulness of geometric measures applies when each position (dimension) of the space described is assumed to be measured on equivalent scales, e.g. all counts of potentially equal distribution. The same assumptions underlying change of bases like PCA/SVD probably are similar here. But then again I'm no mathematician, so I'll leave that open to the more informed.
