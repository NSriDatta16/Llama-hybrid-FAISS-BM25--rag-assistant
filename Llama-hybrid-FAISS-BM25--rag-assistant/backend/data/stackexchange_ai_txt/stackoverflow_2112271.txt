Profiling a java Google App Engine app

Anyone know how to profile a Google App Engine for java app? Preferably I'd like to use the build in netbeans profiler, but that has an error on startup when I try to use it. Here is the error when I try to profile with netbeans 6.8: runserver-profile: [java] Error occurred during initialization of VM [java] Could not find agent library in absolute path: C:\Program Anyone know how to get the netbeans profiler working?
