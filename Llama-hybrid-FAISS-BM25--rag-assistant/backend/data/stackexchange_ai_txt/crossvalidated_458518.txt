Which statistical test? ... with your data many tests are possible, it depends on the question(s) you are asking from the data ... and you did not tell us! Nevertheless, with such complex data it is better to think in terms of models, and for that, the first you should do is to transform the data from a table into long form. I did that: library(tidyverse) structure(tab) # A tibble: 32 x 4 hlthpln1 incomex count goodmh 1 Yes 10 5458 FALSE 2 Yes 15 5164 FALSE 3 Yes 20 4992 FALSE 4 Yes 25 5234 FALSE 5 Yes 35 5110 FALSE 6 Yes 50 5953 FALSE 7 Yes 75 5692 FALSE 8 Yes 85 7832 FALSE 9 No 10 2066 FALSE 10 No 15 1461 FALSE # â€¦ with 22 more rows Some examples: If you are interested in how the probability of having a health plan depends on the other variables, maybe a logistic regression mod.log where the ordinal variable incomex is represented via a spline. Or, if you are interested in modeling incomex as a function of the other factors, maybe an ordinal regression: mod.polr There are certainly other possibilities ... To get the data frame tab , use dget on structure(list(hlthpln1 = structure(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Label = c("No", "Yes" ), class = "factor"), incomex = c(10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 85, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 85, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 85, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 85), count = c(5458L, 5164L, 4992L, 5234L, 5110L, 5953L, 5692L, 7832L, 2066L, 1461L, 1694L, 1633L, 1200L, 836L, 441L, 304L, 12638L, 15392L, 21125L, 27425L, 35982L, 49004L, 55541L, 104420L, 4307L, 3961L, 6197L, 6536L, 5729L, 4911L, 2944L, 2437L), goodmh = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("FALSE", "TRUE"), class = "factor")), row.names = c(NA, -32L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))
