Both Jotspot and MediaWiki allow you to do this. The latter has support for a lot of plugins, of which this is one. The format is essentially PageTitle@something. Jotspot is a hosted solution where you get your own email address, MediaWiki is self-hosted and you give it a mailbox to monitor for incoming. Articles are appended to pages if they already exist, or a new page is created if it does not. This does require a degree of discipline for naming conventions, but is great for CC'ing. We use MediaWiki here and I like it a lot. It has the same flaws as many other Wiki packages (e.g difficult to reorganize without orphaning pages) but is as good if not better than other Wiki packages I've used.
