Search and remove item from listbox

Is there a way to remove an item from a listbox based on a string? I have been playing around for a few minutes and here is what i have so far but its not working foreach(string file in LB_upload.Items) { ftp.Upload(file); int x = LB_upload.Items.IndexOf(file); LB_upload.Items.RemoveAt(x); } I could just loop through each item but I wanted to do something a little more elegant
