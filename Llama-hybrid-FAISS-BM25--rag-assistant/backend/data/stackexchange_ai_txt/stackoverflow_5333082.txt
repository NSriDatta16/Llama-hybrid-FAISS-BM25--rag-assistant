Look into easing equations http://www.gizma.com/easing/ when releasing the screen while been dragging the last image, you can use them to smoothly animate the image back to the center of the screen. As for the effect while dragging the last image, use a multiplication factor on the position of the image so the more your finger reaches the side of the screen, the less the image will follow its movement.
