It also has an build automation tool with which you can automate the compilation, testing and code validation of your applications. When you go further it also have great testing capabilities: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182409.aspx To answer your questions: There are a lot of pros, and one big con. The con is that you have to migrate, although there is a migration tool for VSS to TFS: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms253060.aspx Work items, build automation, reporting, sharepoint integration, test manager, lab manager TFS is great: it scales from teams like yours to big organizations up till thousands of users. Yes there is the ability to start visual studio without a TFS connection. It then asks whether you want to work offline. When you are online again, you can go online to TFS and it will checks the changes. There is also the ability to expose TFS to the internet, so you can access TFS inside your organization from home.
