Passenger Inter-arrival times

A number (n) Cruise ship passengers disembark at a port of call. n people will arrive on 5400 second interval prior to the ship's departure. then the average inter-arrival time is 5400/n = 54 seconds. Assume that all passengers are anti-social singles and that they do not return in groups. At most 1 passenger is arriving per second. Questions: Why would the inter-arrival times of passengers be modeled with a Poisson distribution? What are the limitations, issues or assumptions of such a model?
