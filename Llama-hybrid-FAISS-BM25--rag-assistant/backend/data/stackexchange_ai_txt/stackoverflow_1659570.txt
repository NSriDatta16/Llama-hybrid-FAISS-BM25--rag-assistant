Wpf dragdrop, how to visually reject the drop during the drag?

During a drag in Wpf, how can the mouse cursor (or perhaps using an adorner) be changed to indicate that the droptarget will not accept the dragged item? I've tried to set e.Effects = DragDropEffects.None during the DragEnter event but this isn't working and I suspect that I've misunderstood what that feature should be used for. I've tried using the GiveFeedback event but don't see how the droptarget can influence it.
