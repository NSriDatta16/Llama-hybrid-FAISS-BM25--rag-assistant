How to interpret statistical insignificance of explanatory variables that may be indirectly affecting Y?

I have modeled Y (binary variable) on a set of explanatory variables, X, using logistic regression. A number of x's, say 10 of them, are found to be significantly affecting Y (based on LR test). Then I model another binary variable Z, on X and Y. Y is found to be significantly affecting Z, but almost none of the x's are. I thought it should be because of multicollinearity (as Y is already in the model, x's are not needed), so I removed Y and still x's coefficients are not statistically significant. How can I interpret this?
