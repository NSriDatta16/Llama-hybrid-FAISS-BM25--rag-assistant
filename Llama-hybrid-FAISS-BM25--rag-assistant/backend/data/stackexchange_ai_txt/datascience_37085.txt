Support Vector classifier perform well with input features rather than transformed features in contrast to ANN-BP, random forest (other classifiers)

I am working on stock data with 5 raw features (OHLCV). Using few transformations used by technical analysts, have created 20 more features giving different kinds of indications. When trying to predict the direction of the next few days, the behaviour shown by SVM is opposite to other classifiers. (SVM is giving better results when 5 raw inputs are considered while other methods (as expected) give better results when generated features are being used) I completely understand that market data is very random and noisy. This is a theoretical exercise being done to understand the behaviours of different ML methods.
