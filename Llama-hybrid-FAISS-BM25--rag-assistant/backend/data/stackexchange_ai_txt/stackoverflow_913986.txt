The paragraph related to the application bundle refers to: NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"somefile" ofType:@"png"]; This and other methods from NSBundle allow you to refer resources from inside the application bundle without actually knowing where the application bundle is located. Disclaimer: I haven't worked with the iPhone. With the disclaimer in mind, in plain OS X it's considered bad form to write stuff inside the application bundle. You save stuff under the user's Application Support directory -> see NSApplicationSupportDirectory.
