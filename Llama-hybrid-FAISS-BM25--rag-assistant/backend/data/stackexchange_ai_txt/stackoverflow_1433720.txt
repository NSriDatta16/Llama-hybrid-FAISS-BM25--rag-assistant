Does Ruby On Rails support a table for every instance of a model database schema?

I have a legacy database where there are objects called "notes". Each pad has an entry in the notes table with information about the note, such as the UUID, owner and date created. Each version of the note's actual content is stored in its own table in a separate database, where the table's name is the note's UUID. Each record in a particular note's table represents a new version of the content, to facilitate tracking of changes and what not. Do you know of a way to implement this schema in Ruby on Rails while maintaining the encouraged best practices?
