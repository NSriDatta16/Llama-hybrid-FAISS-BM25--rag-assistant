I would say that in principle there is no problem at all. You are simply making a different set of assumptions regarding the functional form. For instance, rather than modeling as: $$y=a_0+ a_1 * x + a_2 *z+e$$ you are modeling: $$y=a_0+ a_1 * x + a_2 *z + a_2 *z * 1(x>0)+e$$ So a different model that is, perhaps more flexible. The problem I would say, is how to estimate marginal effects. Consider a simpler model: $$y=a_0+ a_1 * x + a_2 * 1(x>0)+e$$ So $X $ enters linearly, and as a dummy. So lets assume that this is indeed the Population model. The question is, how do you obtain (and what do you report for the marginal effects of $X$ ? $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = a_1 $$ for any values below or above 0, but $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = a_1 + a_2 $$ For values exactly at 0 (technically just below. So what do you do? what do you report as an average marginal effect? or do you report at specific values? I think this is the biggest problem here. HTH
