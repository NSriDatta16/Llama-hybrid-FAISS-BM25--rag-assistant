Which Windows SVN server should I use?

On the SVN Windows binaries download page, there are a few to choose from: http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#windows Are there pros and cons to the different versions provided by the different organizations? Is there anything I should look out for? Mainly, I just want something free that I will be running off my Vista laptop. Then I will probably do backups of the SVN files from time to time to an external hard drive.
