I suppose one way of looking at it would be to consider HTML + CSS webpages. We had HTML and that was great, except things were all jumbled together. What people realized is that with CSS, you could separate the structure of the document from its presentation . XAML does the same thing, or at least allows and encourages it. As for practical benefits, skim through the MSDN examples. I tend to think WPF is more geared towards so called "rich media", with much more complex elements. Your example of an app that tracks shipping orders isn't a good one, particularly since a number of those systems still run in DOS based interfaces.
