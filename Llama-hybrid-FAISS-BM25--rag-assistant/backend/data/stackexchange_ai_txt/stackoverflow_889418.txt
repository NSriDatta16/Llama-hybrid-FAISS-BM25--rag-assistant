This is a great start for me. I had been beating my head against the wall for days. Let me give a few more details to make this more clear. Unfortunately, the problem is a clique problem, and is NP-complete because all three columns are not unique. Here's the real world application: I'm doing a research project on the efficiency of negative reciprocity, i.e. barter, in lieu of a monetary exchange where it is inappropriate, or illegal. The specific example is organ transplants. Let's say Bob needs a kidney, and his wife is willing to donate a kidney, there is no guarantee that she is a match. However, she may be a match for another user in the database, who in return may be able to provide Bob with a matching kidney. If I have a database with thousands of recipients, and tens of thousands of potential donors, I can potentially broker a multi-way transaction to maximize the benefit for as many recipients as possible. There obviously have to be limitations as to the maximum number of levels required to close the loop. A 5-way transaction is possible, but a 100-way transaction is just not logistically feasible. I had never even heard of Oracle Spatial until today. It looks like that might be exactly the product I need to make this easier.
