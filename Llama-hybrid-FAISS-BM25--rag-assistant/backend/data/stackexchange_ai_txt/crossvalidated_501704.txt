How do I identify common features/similarities of members in a class?

If I need to go over the actual data which I have, I have employee data of our company. Employees are divided into two groups, binary(1,0). Some of them are 1 and the rest are in 0 class. The data set includes a lot of basic data for each employee, such as age, gender, the school they graduated from, time spent in the company or position. I also want to learn and see the common features of those who are in this 1 class, for example, age range, gender, universities, etc. I know this looks like a classification problem, but isn't it possible to find these similarities without using any machine learning algorithms? Do you think it is sufficient to perform frequency analysis and chi-square test, or is there any other analysis method or statistical test you can recommend?
