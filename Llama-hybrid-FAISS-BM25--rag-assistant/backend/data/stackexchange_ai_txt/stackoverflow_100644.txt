I recommend AutoHotKey . Its syntax is not pretty, but most of the times you don't have to concoct your own scripts, because its community is so large and well organized. Even if you do, the documentation is extensive and good and the forums will answer your questions quickly. The developer is active and responsive, which means that bugs get fixed quickly, and new features are being considered and added. Since I began using AHK I don't imagine doing without it - it allows to make life on Windows simpler in so many ways. You can also employ the COM interface from Python and other scripting languages. It is more complex, but you get to use a more powerful language.
