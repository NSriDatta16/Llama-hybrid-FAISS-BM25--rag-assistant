Find a blackberries user agent on 4.5

I'm trying to find the user agent of a blackberry so I can set it when I make a http connection. On blackberries that are version 4.7+ I call System.getProperty("browser.useragent") and I get the correct value. On earlier versions this returns null. Is there another way to get the user agent?
