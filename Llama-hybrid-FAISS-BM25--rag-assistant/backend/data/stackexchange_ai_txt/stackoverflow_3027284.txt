For those running Visual Studio 2010 Highlighterr may fit your needs. It's also in the MSDN Visual Studio Gallery. It leverages the improved C++ IntelliSense in 2010. It makes you set special highlighters in Environment -> Fonts and Colors for the types it detects, but overall it works quite well from what I've seen.
