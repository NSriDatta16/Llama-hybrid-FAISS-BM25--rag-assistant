How do we find weight and b value of SVM classifier for XNOR operation by hand?

Problem statement Show that the Boolean function (x1 ∧ x2) ∨ (¬x1 ∧ ¬x2) is not linearly separable (i.e. there is no linear classifier sign(w1 x1 + w2 x2 + b) that classifies all 4 possible input points correctly). Assume that “true” is represented by 1 and “false” is represented by −1. Show that there is a linear separator for this Boolean function when we use the kernel K(x, y) = (x · y)2 (x.y denotes the ordinary inner product) . Give the weights and the value of b for one such separator I was trying to solve the above problem in SVM by hand. The input dataset is XNOR truth table (here -1 is used as false value) x1 x2 x1 XNOR x2 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1 It was given to prove that this can not be classified using any linear classifier. Which I already did. Now the second part of the problem is to use the kernel function $K(X,Y) = (X.Y)^{2}$ and prove that there is linear separator for this data when this kernel function is applied. I proved it following way: Applying transformation using that kernel, I could see $\phi(X) = [x_1^{2} ,\sqrt{2}x_1x_2,x_2^{2}]$ And I transformed entire dataset to this $$\begin{bmatrix} &1&\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&-\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&-\sqrt{2}&1\\ &1&\sqrt{2}&1\\ \end{bmatrix} $$ Which can be easily separable. But the problem wants me to find the weight and value of b variable. This is so far I have done, but I'm really stuck thinking around I know $\alpha_i(y_i(W.X+b)-1)=0 $ and for non support vectors $\alpha_i$ is zero But how can I know which data points are support vectors? I know these are points lying closer to "gutter" or hyperplane. But how can I know it mathematically? as this can't separated using a linear classifier and therefore I can't know which points lies closer to the imaginative plane. Also how will I find $\alpha_i$ for these support vectors? Don't I need weight and b value for it? But I want to find $\alpha_i$ first inorder to find weight and b value. This question probably is a naïve one, which came up due to not having deeper understanding of SVM. But I would appreciate giving me some pointers to correct my thinking and guide me to solve this problem. Edit: added my original problem statement, in case my explanation wasn't that clear.
