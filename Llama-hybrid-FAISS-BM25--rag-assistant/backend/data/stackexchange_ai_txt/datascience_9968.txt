Jobs for gaining experience in preperation for data science

Data Scientist positions are not the most common entry level jobs. They require hard work, knowledge and most of all experience. The problem is, I am uncertain what entry level jobs can help you get experience in data science. I apologise for not asking a technical question, but I have been searching an answer and most importantly advice from experts and data science practitioners. Currently, I am studying to become a Data Scientist and I was wondering what are good entry level jobs that can help me build a good foundation for future success in the field?
