Formula/Algorithm for Weighting Game Outcomes

I have an interesting conceptual problem, and I'm wondering if anyone can help me quantify it. Basically, I'm playing a set of games... and for each game I know the probability that I will win, the probability that I will tie, and the probability that I will lose (each game will have different probabilities). At a high level, what I want to know is: which games should I focus my attention on? For example, I'm not going to put any effort into games that I have a 0% chance of winning (or games that I have a 100% chance of winning). But for a 50/50 game, I will care a lot and want to put in the most effort. If ties were not involved, it would be as simple as: "care-ability" = how close is my chance of winning to 50%? But with ties, it complicates things. I'm not sure it's strictly necessary, but if you need to, you can assume that a win is 0 points, a tie would give you 1 point, and a win would give you 2 points. In other words, it would be just as valuable to go from a loss to a tie, as it would to go from a tie to a win. You can also assume that all games are independent. Basically, I'm just looking for a quantitative metric for "care-ability" (a value from 0 to 1 for example). Anybody have any ideas for how to approach something like this? If you're an economics person, you can imagine I have a finite number of dollars I can spend on improving my chances of winning games. How would you allocate those dollars across the games in order to maximize your expected outcomes? Thanks in advance! EDIT: Sorry, I've since realized that this was a fairly poorly phrased question. I don't specify the relationship between additional investment and produced outcome. I wanted to assume it was a linear relationship, but in that case, it doesn't matter which game you invest in, since it will always increase your expected value the same way. My actual problem is a little more complicated, and I need to rethink it a bit. Thanks to everyone who helped and gave great ideas!
