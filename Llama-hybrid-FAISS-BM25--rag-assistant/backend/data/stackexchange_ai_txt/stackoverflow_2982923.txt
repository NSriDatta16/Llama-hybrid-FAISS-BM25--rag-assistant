JRobert had the right idea. If you were using C++, then you would call ISpRecognizer::SetRecoState ( SPRST_ACTIVE ), and then, if you're running on Windows 7, QI the ISpRecognizer for ISpRecognizer3 and call ISpRecognizer3::SetActiveCategory (NULL) to force the recognizer into the ON state. But, since you're using C#, you should use System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer and set the State property to Listening. (Note that this will not, as far as I know, switch from Sleep to On.)
