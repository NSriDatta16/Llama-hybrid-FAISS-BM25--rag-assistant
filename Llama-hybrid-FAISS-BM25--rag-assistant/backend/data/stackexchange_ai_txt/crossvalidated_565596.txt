Deriving life expectancy from FLIPI index data for FLIPI(3) High Risk

Deriving life expectancy from FLIPI index data for FLIPI(3) High Risk This updated analysis attempts to transform deaths per year into average years of survival weighted by deaths per year It looks like the 65% of follicular lymphoma patients with a high risk FLIPI index that die within the first ten years will live an average of 4.18 years. This analysis is entirely based on the referenced paper and does not take into account the better prognosis since the advent of rituximab. Cumulative number of deaths comes from Number of events for high risk. From Figure 4 shown above . The last three columns were adjusted for missing data by interpolating from the graph. Months 12 - 120 converted to Years 1-10 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 end of year 54 109 152 202 229 245 260 281 300 315 cumulative deaths 89 77 69 58 53 50 46 42 38 35 survival % 54 55 43 50 27 16 15 21 19 15 incremental deaths Converting deaths per year into average years of survival. This is the part that I am least certain of. Average years of survival weighted by deaths per year 54 x 1 = 54 55 x 2 = 110 43 x 3 = 129 50 x 4 = 200 27 x 5 = 135 16 x 6 = 96 15 x 7 = 105 21 x 8 = 168 19 x 9 = 171 15 x 10 = 150 ----------------- 315 1318 / 315 = 4.18
