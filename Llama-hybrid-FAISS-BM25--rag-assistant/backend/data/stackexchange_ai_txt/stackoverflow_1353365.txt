Aside from the official response from us, think of RIA Services as simply a more automated approach to combining your server and client together - in most mainstream cases its Silverlight + ASP.NET. Now an easy way to look at this is the basic fundamental problems its looking to solve, first being "How do i get my POCO/VO/TO etc from the server to the client and back again without having to write my own serialization/deserialization logic?" - answer, .NET RIA Services handles that for you via some basic code-gen the team have put in place and also leveraging the power of ADO.NET Data Services. I like to personally think of .NET RIA DataServices as being the glue between Client & Server and as part of that you get a lot of tricky and powerful API's to help you marshall data etc back and forth. The main job of RIA Services is to keep you focused on building Applications etc and less on "designing your own framework from scratch". A quick ASCII raw diagram is this: CLIENT(Silverlight) -> ADO.NET Data Services (Client) CLOUD ADO.NET Data Services (Server) We'll do a better job of explaining the WHAT soon, and good feedback here for us. - Scott Barnes Rich Platforms Product Manager Microsoft.
