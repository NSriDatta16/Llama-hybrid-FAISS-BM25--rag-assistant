I'm thinking that the line-height is the culprit. Try setting the line height of the h2 to somewhere around 13 to 15 pixels. By default it is set to normal. According to W3C , line-height: normal "Tells user agents to set the used value to a "reasonable" value based on the font of the element." Firefox and Chrome could be setting different "reasonable" values since they are built on entirely different rendering engines.
