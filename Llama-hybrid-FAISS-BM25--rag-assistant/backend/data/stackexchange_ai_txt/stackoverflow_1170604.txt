BTW, I found the WSDL at http://score.itsc.uah.edu/services/catalog/SCOOPCatalogServices.wsdl . This is unusual. I've seen multiple bindings for a given port type, perhaps one for SOAP 1.1 and one for SOAP 1.2; but I don't think I've ever seen this pattern of one port type per operation. There's a problem with the WSDL, according to XMLSpy. The are missing their soapAction attributes.
