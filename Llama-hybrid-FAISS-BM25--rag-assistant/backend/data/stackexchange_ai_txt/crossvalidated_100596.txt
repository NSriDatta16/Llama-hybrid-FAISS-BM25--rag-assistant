With your background I would look to " The Elements of Statistical Learning " (Springer) by Hastie, Trevor, Tibshirani, Robert, Friedman, Jerome. Another good book is A. C. Davison: "Statistical Models" (Cambridge) But, the one book you REALY, REALLY should study is this one: David A. Freedman: "Statistical Models. Theory and Practice. Revised Edition." (Cambridge) From the foreword by some friends: "Some books are correct. Some are clear. Some are useful. Some are entertaining. Few are even two of these. This book is all four. Statistical Models: Theory and Practice is lucid, candid and insightful, a joy to read. We are fortunate that David Freedman finished this new edition before his death in late 2008. We are deeply saddened by his passing, and we greatly admire the energy and cheer he brought to this volume—and many other projects—during his final months. " This book is low on mathematics (which does NOT mean "easy"), but high on the conceptual side, and not only presents models, but critizes them too. You will love it!
