FastVectorHighlighter.Net returning null on GetBestFragment

I have a large index, on which Highlighter.Net works fine, but FastVectorHighlighter returns null as a Best Fragment on Some documents. the searcher works fine. It is just the highlighter. The field has been indexed in the same manner for all documents, so I fail to understand Why it highlights some documents but not all. Using Lucene.Net 2.9.2, built from trunk rev942061
