Historical weather data with machine learning?

My company gave me a task to build some weather forecasting. I have now historical weather data for 10 years (temperature, precipitation in mm, humidity and etc. more than 30 features total). We need to know what probability for rainfall in South-Asian countries in particular time period (week, month)? Now I'm able to calculate approx probability based only on monthly averages (like if for 10 years 1st of Dec was rainy 8 times, so the probability is 80%). Of course, it's not a scientific approach at all, but sometimes we need to know rainfall probability for 3 or more months period in advance. I was thinking to try building a neural network model, but don't understand how it might work in production? What data to give to this model after training it? Does anybody have any ideas?
