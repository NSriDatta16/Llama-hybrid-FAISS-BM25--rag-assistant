I found an example POM for the Servlet 3.0 API on DZone from September. Suggest you use the java.net repo, at http://download.java.net/maven/2/ There are Java EE APIs in there, for example http://download.java.net/maven/2/javax/javaee-web-api/6.0/ with POM that look like they might be what you're after, for example: javax javaee-web-api 6.0 I'm guessing that the version conventions for the APIs have been changed to match the version of the overall EE spec (i.e. Java EE 6 vs. Servlets 3.0) as part of the new 'profiles'. Looking in the JAR, looks like all the 3.0 servlet stuff is in there. Enjoy!
