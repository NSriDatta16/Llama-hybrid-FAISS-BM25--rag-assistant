match the label and get value from Labelvaluebean

I'm getting a list of organization type and code are stored as labelvaluebean as below: [LabelValueBean[ORG1, XX], [ORG2, AA]] - in array. later these values are stored in a session variable. My question is, is there a way I can search thru this array to match the name and get the code ? (for ex: match with ORG1 and get XX). If user enter ORG1, I should send XX to back-end.
