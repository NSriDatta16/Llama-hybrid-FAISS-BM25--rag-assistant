The term "null hypothesis" is usually used in a frequentist setting, where characteristics of the population, such as its mean, are regarded as fixed, not random. There, it makes no sense to talk about the probability of the null hypothesis. In a Bayesian setting, these characteristics are regarded as random and we can talk about things like the probability of a population mean equalling 0. However, a typical Bayesian would give a prior probability of 0 to many common frequentist null hypotheses, such as the hypothesis that the mean of a normal distribution exactly equals a prespecified value.
