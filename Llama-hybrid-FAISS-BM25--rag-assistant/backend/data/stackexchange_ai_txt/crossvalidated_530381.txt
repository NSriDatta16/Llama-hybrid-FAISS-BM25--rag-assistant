paired t test to check if features in test and holdout datasets are from same distribution

The machine learning model we are developing is having different resuls on test and holdout and we want to check if the test and holdout are from the same distributions or if there is a feature drift between the two datasets. For doing that i am doing the following : I calculate the summary statistics and calculate mean for all the features in the 2 datasets By taking the mean values for every feature, i now have two columns having the feature means from 2 dataset I run a paired sample t test on those two columns I calculate the t score on google sheets with the T.test function (2 tailed test and a paired test) and see the score to 0.42 Assuming that this statistical methodology is correct, how should the tscore of 0.42 interpreted to check if the distributions are same or different?
