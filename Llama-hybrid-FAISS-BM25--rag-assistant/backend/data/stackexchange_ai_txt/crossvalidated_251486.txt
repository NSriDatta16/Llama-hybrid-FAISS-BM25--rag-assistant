Read carefully: it doesn't say that the time series is not stationary. It says that the initial coefficients are not stationary (which I presume means they don't describe a stationary process). You could try putting in your own guess for starting values, as it suggests. But I suspect that it's choosing bad starting values in the first place because the model is mis-specified. If you already differenced the time series, you probably don't also want to specify integration order 1. You probably mean order=(2, 0, 2), not order=(2, 1, 2).
