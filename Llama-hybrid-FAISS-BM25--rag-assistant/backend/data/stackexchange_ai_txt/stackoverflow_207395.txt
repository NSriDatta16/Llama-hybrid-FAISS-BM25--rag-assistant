MS Money 2002 is what got me started on financial software and saving and paying attention to income vs. outlays, so I'll always have a great soft spot in my heart for it. However, I've used Wesabe and more recently, Mint as online tools that integrate all my banking for me. Mint lets me track my checking, savings, mortgage and retirement accounts, and recently started allowing customization of categories. It also checks my credit card interest versus other offers (and savings / checking) to see where I can save money. Of course it's got all the reports so I can see how much I spent on groceries versus new monitors. I love it, and because of that, I'd avoid reimplementing the wheel if I were you - at least check it out for a couple of weeks.
