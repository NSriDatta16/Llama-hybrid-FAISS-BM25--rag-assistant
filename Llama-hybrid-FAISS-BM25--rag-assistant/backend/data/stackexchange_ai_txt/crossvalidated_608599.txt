switching from probability to classification while maintaining exact ORs

I am trying to create a database with a dichotomized dependent variables and a bunch of binary (1/0) independent variables. I'd like to pre-set some associations between the independent variables and the outcome. Doing so is relatively easy - after generating the random binary covariates, I run a binomial function to predict the outcome, where I set the #number_of_test to (1) and the probability of an event to expit(b0+b1var1+b2var2.....), where b0=frequency of the outcome in the none-exposed, and b1,b2,....=my pre-specified odds ratio for each covariate. What I realize however is that the prespecified ORs are never fully retrievable when I then run a simple GLM model on the final simulated data. This makes sense, since the process of switching from a probability of having the outcome (which is de-facto what I simulate with the equation above) to a dichotomized 1/0 variable has some randomness to it. So when I set the OR I do so on the probability scale. But when I then use the predicted probability to create the classification 1/0 variable - I introduce some randomness. All of this means that for each database I would generate, the obtained ORs are close to the ones I a-priori defined, but not exact. Does that mean that there is never really a way to retrieve a prespecified OR from a single simulated database? I completely understand that one way here would be simulate the data many times and run the GLM on each simulated database â€“ on average the prespecified ORs should be obtained. But is there a way to ensure one gets the correct/prespecified ORs with only one simulated database?
