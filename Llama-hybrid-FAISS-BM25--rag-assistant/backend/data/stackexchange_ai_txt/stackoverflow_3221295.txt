Not getting DragEnter/Over, Drop events in silverlight 4 app

I'm dragging UserControl objects from one Canvas to another with the intention of dropping there. When mousing over the destination, the dragged object actually goes under it. I get no DragEnter, DragOver or DragLeave events. If I drop the object there, I get no Drop event. My root object is a border, then a grid. The grid covers the entire browser client area. It has 8 columns. In each of the columns there is a canvas that is placed by the XAML. Example of odd behavior: When I drag an item from column 3 to column 4 (or any greater) the object slides under the canvas. If I drag from column 3 to column 2 (or any lesser) the object slides over the top. So it appears that zorder is affected by the order of creation of the Canvases. Can someone clarify this? The Canvas objects in each of the columns have DragEnter/Leave events associated but none of them fire, whether the object goes over or under the Canvas. I found that a Canvas must have a background in order to get mouse events. Each of the Canvases in the columns have a Background. The mouse events fire if I'm not dragging anything. I'm nearing the end of my rope and sure would appreciate some assistance. Thanks, Greg
