Keytool set hostname

I am just attempting to use the java keytool but I cannot figure out how to set the hostname. This is what is how I am attempting: hostname[username:/this/is/a/path][640]% keytool -keystore server.keystore -genkeypair -alias hostname Enter keystore password: Re-enter new password: What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: hostname What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: hostname What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: hostname What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: hostname What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: hostname What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: CA Is CN=hostname, OU=hostname, O=hostname, L=hostname, ST=hostname, C=CA correct? [no]: yes Enter key password for (RETURN if same as keystore password): hostname[username:/this/is/a/path][641]% Since I have set all fields to hostname can I assume that my hostname is set to hostname?
