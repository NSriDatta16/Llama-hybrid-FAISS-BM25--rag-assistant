Sending/Parsing multiple JSON objects

I have a Sinatra server that is returning multiple JSON objects from the database in a streaming manner. The objects would look like: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} {"a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 6} ... but this is invalid JSON. I can add a hack into Sinatra's event processing (manually injecting the missing array delimiters) to make the response look like: [ {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} , {"a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 6} ] which is valid JSON now, but this technique is inelegant. Is there some way to do this client-side? Basically, what I want is to have a JavaScript function read a string and consume a valid JSON object, and then return to me the JSON object and the remainder of the string, iteratively being called until the entire string is consumed.
