Is a Bayesian framework more in keeping with neurobiologic processes?

Human thinking appears based on intercommunicating neurons and plastic synapses. In keeping with these neurobiologic premises and the evident assumption that every human thought, hypothesis and theory must first exist as a specific connection between neurons, is a Bayesian statistical framework more neurobiologically coherent and plausible than a frequentist one?
