Possible to create Magento orders while authorize.net in test mode?

Will Magento allow orders to be created with either authorize.net set to TEST mode on the Magento side or the authorize.net website? We see orders in processing mode that were put in when we thought authorize.net was in TEST mode. The orders were made using real credit cards, not the test 4222* card numbers. I thought when either side was in TEST mode, Magento would throw up a dialog box when submitting a order, saying that authorize.net was in test mode. Basically, is it possible to place an order all the way if authorize.net is set to TEST mode on the Magento site or authorize.net site?
