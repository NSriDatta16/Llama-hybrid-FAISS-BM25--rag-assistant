Does it have to do with the fitting algorithm we use(OLS against ML)? Yes. Stationarity is a condition for some time series models, but not others. It is required for ARMA models. ARIMA models are used when the time series is not stationary to transform it so that it is suitable for ARMA modeling. Exponential smoothing forecasting methods on the other hand don't require stationarity. What is strange to me is that they don't check for stationarity and the predictions they make are accurate. Checking for stationarity isn't about improving the accuracy of the model per se , it is about keeping the model stable. See this post and this post . Trying to fit an ARMA model to non stationary data would lead to a model that diverges very quickly. they use OLS regression in order to analyse and predict a certain variable y. Among the different explanatory variables they use, they have the lagged values of y. It is possible that the data is already stationary by nature - which is why OLS works on the lagged values of y without any transformations. Also, for the case of ARIMA models, ML is used only if moving average terms are used. If only auto-regressive terms are used that OLS works. From what you describe they don't have any moving average terms in the explanatory variables.
