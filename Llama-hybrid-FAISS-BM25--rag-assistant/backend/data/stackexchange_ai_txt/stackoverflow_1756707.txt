Track Improvement Requests

We receive 5-10 improvement requests each day from our customers. Some of them are good, and some not so good. I can easily pick out the ones that I agree with, but I'd like a good way to organize the rest, so if we get a lot of similar requests we can prioritize those appropriately. We have a large backlog of good ideas, so a request usually won't get added to the work queue unless we see a strong demand from customers. This makes it impractical , so it doesn't make sense to track them with our current work item tracking (TFS). The main goal of organizing them is so that we can see where the demand is strongest, and we can determine which features are most important to our users. Any suggestions are welcome.
