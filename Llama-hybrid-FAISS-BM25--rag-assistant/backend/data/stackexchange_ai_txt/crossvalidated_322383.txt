Can I use CATPCA to reduce the amount of variables in a multinominal logistics regression?

Dear to whom it may concern. I am analyzing survey data and I have one dependent nominal variable and 11 nominal independent variables for the multinominal logistics regression. I just wanted to find the best way to reduce the amount of independent variables in the multi-nominal logistics regression? Can I use CATPCA for this reduction? if not what approach or method do I take. a note that I am restricted to using SPSS. Many thanks in advance
