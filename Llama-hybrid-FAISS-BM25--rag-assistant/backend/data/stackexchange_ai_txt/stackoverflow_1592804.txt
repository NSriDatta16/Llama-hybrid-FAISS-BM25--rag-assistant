How do I workaround heap fragmentation in a C++ server program?

Heap fragmentation can cause a server application that is expected to run continuously for many months to suddenly start malfunctioning thinking that it's out of memory. Let's assume that I've done my best to minimize runtime heap fragmentation in my VC++ server application but still it builds up and causes problems. I could for example automatically restart the application every month or every half million requests processed - safely stop it and safely start again with a new heap. What else can I do to workaround heap fragmentation?
