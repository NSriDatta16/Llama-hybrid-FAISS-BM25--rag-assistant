One way to treat such a situation is to use a Bayesian argument. Suppose you have an opinion, perhaps based on personal experience, perhaps based on some data, or perhaps based on a combination of personal experience and data that about $1/4$ of men cheat on their wives. You might say that the proportion $p$ of cheaters is roughly expressed by a beta prior distribution $p \sim \mathsf{Beta}(4,12),$ which has mean $1/4,$ probability 95% of being in the interval $(0.078, 0.481),$ and density $f(p) \propto p^3(1-p)^{11},$ where the symbol $\propto$ indicates that the 'kernel' of the density function is shown (without the constant that makes it integrate to unity). qbeta(c(.025,.975), 4, 12) [1] 0.07787155 0.48089113 curve(dbeta(x, 4, 12), 0, 1, lwd=2, ylab="Density", xlab="p", main="BETA(4,12)") abline(v=0:1, col="green2") abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v=c(0.078, 0.481), col="orange", lty="dotted") Now, suppose you are able to get reliable data on $n = 50$ married men from some population of interest, finding $x = 10$ cheaters among the fifty. Then the binomial likelihood function of these data is $$g(x|p) = p^x(1-p)^{50-x} \propto p^{10}(1-p)^{40}.$$ Using Bayes' Theorem, we can get the posterior distribution $h(p|x)$ by multiplying the beta prior density by the binomial likelihood function: $$h(p|x) = f(p)\times g(x|p) \propto p^{13}(1-p)^{51},$$ where we recognize the result as the kernel of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(14, 52).$ Thus, the posterior mean is $14/66 = 0.212$ and a 95% posterior probability interval for $p$ based on the prior and the data is $(0.123, 0.318).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 14, 52) [1] 0.1230531 0.3176880 If you get additional data later, you can use the posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(14, 52)$ as the new prior, and the additional data to get a new posterior and probability interval.
