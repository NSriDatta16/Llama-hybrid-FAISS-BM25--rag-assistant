Validating data set using standard deviation

Suppose I have two data sets. The average of one data set is 5.5 secs and the standard deviation is 0.0435. The average of the other data set is 5.2 secs but the standard deviation is 0.5123. I know that something is wrong with the second data set because the standard deviation is too high. My question is how I should interpret the standard deviation value so that I could use the value to determine if data set is valid. Standard devation might not be the one I should use to do this. I will appreciate suggestions for any other methods to validate this data set.
