XML schema defines dateTime as ISO8601 with some exceptions and you should stick with this, otherwise you will get serious interoperability issues. If you want to send/receive date using different format, use simpleType with regular expression restriction and parse/format the date in your application code: If you really want to mess around with built-in types (highly inadvisable), your XML framework/library might have some support for that. For instance in Java/JAXB you can apply custom transformers/formatters to any type, so that in client/server code you are still using Date object (not the 8-digit String ), but it is marshalled/unmarshalled using your custom routine.
