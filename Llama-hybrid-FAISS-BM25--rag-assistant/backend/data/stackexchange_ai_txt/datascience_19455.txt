How can you decide the window size on a pooling layer?

On the convolutional neural network, there used one or more pooling layers. As far as I know many tutorials instruct you to set it either 2 or 3 for the window size. For example, in this tutorial : Pooling Layers After some ReLU layers, programmers may choose to apply a pooling layer. It is also referred to as a downsampling layer. In this category, there are also several layer options, with maxpooling being the most popular. This basically takes a filter ( normally of size 2x2 ) and a stride of the same length. It then applies it to the input volume and outputs the maximum number in every subregion that the filter convolves around. I make the relevant part bold. But why is it usually set to 2 (or in some cases 3 )? How can I know what size is appropriate? Should I just tweak the parameter via a trial and error like a brute-force way, or is there any tips on deciding the window size?
