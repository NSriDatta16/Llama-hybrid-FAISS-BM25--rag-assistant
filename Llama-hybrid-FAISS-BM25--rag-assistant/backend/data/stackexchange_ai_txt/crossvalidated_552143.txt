Can Statistical Models and Machine Learning Models be used to make Predictions about Individuals?

In the context of using statistical models to make individual predictions, I have often heard of the "Ecological Fallacy": This is a particularly relevant problem in statistics. If you have a dataset and you are interested in creating a statistical or a machine learning model that will make predictions about unseen data at the "individual level" - to what extent does the ecological fallacy complicate this goal? This seems to be logical on one level : if you collect data on a limited number of individuals, any statistical model will implicitly assume that all other individuals from the population will be similar to the data you have collected - and whenever this is not the case, the statistical model will be unable to make reliable predictions. On the other hand, statistical and machine learning models are quite often used for predictions at the individual level. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks have been used to classify individual X-rays for diseases: Thus, these are my conclusions: Perhaps the Ecological Fallacy can be avoided if enough data is available, such that patterns in unseen data is likely to be represented within the available data (e.g. millions of x-rays)? In a more classical setting (e.g. https://www.jstor.org/stable/202485 ), big data was not available which made the Ecological Fallacy more of an issue - but with enough data, the Ecological Fallacy can be mitigated. However, when you have many variables - the "Curse of Dimensionality" means that you will begin to require more and more rows of data for the "space" to be "less sparse". This could mean that in datasets with many variables, the Ecological Fallacy along with the Curse of Dimensionality can further complicate statistical modelling. Are my conclusions correct? Can a large number of observations potentially reduce the "Ecological Fallacy"?
