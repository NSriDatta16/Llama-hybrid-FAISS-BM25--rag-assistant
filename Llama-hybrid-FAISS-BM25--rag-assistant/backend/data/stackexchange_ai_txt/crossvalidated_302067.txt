Logistic regression: precision of p(Y)

There are many usual methods to measure the predictive power of logistic regression (or any method predicting probabilities such as probit regression). Some of them are inspired from R-squared for example ( https://statisticalhorizons.com/r2logistic ). You can also use ROC curves. These indicators reach 100% when the dependent variable $Y$ can be perfectly predicted by $X$: you know by reading $X$ what $Y$ will be for sure: 0 or 1. And your model tells you without an error. Now assume that $Y$ really has a strong degree of indetermination given $X$. For the same $X$, $Y$ might be 0 or 1, and there is not enough information in $X$ to decide. But you still expect to find a precise conditional probability. Logistic regression typically outputs this probability $p(Y|X)$. Now, you want to measure the precision of this probability. For example, you want to estimate $E(\left(p_{model}(y|X)-p_{real}(y|X)\right)^2)$. Or find an indicator that reaches 100% when the probability is predicted perfectly: all information available in $X$ about $Y$ is used. Is there a way to do it?
