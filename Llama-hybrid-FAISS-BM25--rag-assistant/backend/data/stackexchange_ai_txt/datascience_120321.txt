ChatGPT: How to use long texts in prompt?

I like the website chatpdf.com a lot. You can upload a PDF file and then discuss the textual content of the file with the file "itself". It uses ChatGPT. I would like to program something similar. But I wonder how to use the content of long PDF files in a ChatGPT prompt, as ChatGPT only accepts 4096 tokens per conversation. How can I reduce the number of tokens needed?
