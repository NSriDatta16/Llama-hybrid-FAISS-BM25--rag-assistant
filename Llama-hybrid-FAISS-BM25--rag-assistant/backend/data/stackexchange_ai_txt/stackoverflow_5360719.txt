Just applying format newString $base64x64.; doesn't actually change the value of newString at all. When you say that OldString looks the same as new string, what do you mean? You say that long strings won't encode, so I assume that you're seeing some evidence of encoding in your method. Note that you've specified an explicit length of 64 on the format, so that the formatted value will take up a field width of 64. So you'll only be able to encode a string of length 48 with that format (BASE64 generates 4 bytes for every 3 in). You say a long string, but how long? As Gilbert mentions, the maximum format length on the BASE64X format is 32767, which means that the maximum output base64 string that you can generate is 32767. It's possible that your input string is just too long, and you'd have to split it somehow.
