I was thinking about what you could do that is simple and close to your needs... If you're ok with the criteria being the current day, rather than the past 24 hours, then you could implement directories named with the date, say yyyymmdd format, then in your iso interface layer look for the file in the current day's directory.. if you don't find it, then there is no cache of it and you generate it. You could implement house keeping to purge non current day directories at a convenient time. This strategy will make your 24 hour time frame become more like 0-24 hour.. so an average of 12... skewed depending on the time of the day when you think your users are likely to use your app. You could adjust the timeframe by being clever with the algorithm to generate the directory. For example you could make it produce a unique directory name every 2 days (for an average of 24 hour caching). If IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames() was working with a filespec, you could encode the date into the latter part of the filename. Unfortunately it's still returning *.* regardless.
