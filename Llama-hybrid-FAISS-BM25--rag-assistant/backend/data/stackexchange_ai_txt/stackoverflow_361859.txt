It sounds like you're going to have to create a new project in Xcode, go into the old directory, and drag all your source files, nibs, and resources into the Xcode files sidebar in the new project. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, unless you really did a lot of work with custom build settings or targets. Either that, or revert to the last check-in in your source control and manually add any code files which changed between now and then.
