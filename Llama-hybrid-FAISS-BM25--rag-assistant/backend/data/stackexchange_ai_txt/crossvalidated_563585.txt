Validation error saturates

I am training Autoencoder (1 hl) on keras. I have used validation split of 20%. Training seems ok, but for the validation set the MSE error(shown in blue) seems to saturate with whatever no. of hidden nodes. It does not goes further down. What could be possible reason? I've tried various LR with adam. At 0.001, there are kinks in graph, at 0.0001(this one) the graph is smooth but still saturates.
