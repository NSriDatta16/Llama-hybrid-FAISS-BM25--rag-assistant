Background I am afraid what you describe is the bootstrap method of Efron (1979) and not the generic Monte Carlo method that is not specifically linked with statistics... Check the Wikipedia entry on bootstrap. Question The Monte Carlo sample you create by resampling from your data is not "fresh and untainted" since it is a replica of your data (obtained via the empirical distribution). It is useful to get statistical properties of a procedure you built on the original data (like bias, coverage, &tc.), not to create new samples. So I am also afraid the answer is that this proposal is a misapplication of the bootstrap method.
