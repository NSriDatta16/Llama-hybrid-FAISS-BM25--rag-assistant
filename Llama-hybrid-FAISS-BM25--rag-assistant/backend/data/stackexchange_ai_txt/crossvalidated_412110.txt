How to analyze time series data with very few samples for response variable

I want to use R to model a person's blood-iron level to predict how it changes over time. My response variable is blood-iron level and my explanatory variables are related to diet, use of different kinds of supplements (drops, tablets, blood infusion), etc. My data is in time-series format with one row per day spanning approximately one year. The quirk is that I only have four values for my response variable. It feels strange to model this as a time series with ~350 data points if the response variable will almost always be NA. Is there a simpler approach? Should I "dplyr" the data frame into only four rows somehow? I am ultimately hoping that the model would estimate the effect on blood-iron level of: - One day of time passing. - One day of eating an iron-rich diet. - One day of taking supplement X/Y/Z. But I have not approached this kind of problem in R before.
