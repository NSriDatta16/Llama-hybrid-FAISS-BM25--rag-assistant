Convergence of credible regions on simple Bayesian model

Consider a basic Bayesian model : $$ \begin{array}{rcl} \theta &\sim &\pi(\theta)\\ X_1, \cdots, X_n&\overset{IID}{\sim} &\mathcal{N}(\theta, I_d)\\ \end{array} $$ where $d$ is the (fixed) dimension of random variable $X$ . The posterior distribution is given by: $$\pi(\theta\mid X)\propto \pi(\theta)\varphi\left(\sqrt{n}(\theta - \overline{X})\right) $$ where $\varphi$ is the density of a $d$ -dimensional standard normal random variable. Consider the highest density credible regions defined by $C_n = \{\theta : \pi(\theta\mid X) \geq h_n\}$ where $h_n$ insures a given coverage of $1 - \alpha$ . Question : Can we show that, when $n\to\infty$ , $\sqrt{n}(C_n - \overline X)$ converges to the ellipso√Ød of level $1-\alpha$ under standard normal distribution ? Under what assumptions on the prior distribution $\pi$ ? I expect this to be true, since the prior influence would vanish asymptotically (suppose the prior has support equal to $\mathbb{R}^d$ ) but I cannot prove it. Maybe assuming the prior to be log-concave could help, since it guarantees the credible regions to be convex... Any help would be appreciated.
