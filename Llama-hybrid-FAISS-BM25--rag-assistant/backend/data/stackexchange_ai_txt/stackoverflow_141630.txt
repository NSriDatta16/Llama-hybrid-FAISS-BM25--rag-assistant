How can I read raw (CF_HTML) clipboard data in a webpage or C#?

If I drag and drop a selection of a webpage from Firefox to HTML-Kit, HTML-Kit asks me whether I want to paste as text or HTML. If I select "text," I get this: Version:0.9 StartHTML:00000147 EndHTML:00000516 StartFragment:00000181 EndFragment:00000480 SourceURL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus Additional details have been garnered from the Suda , an 11th-century encyclopaedia of the Byzantium which likely took its information from traditional accounts. According to MSDN , this is "CF_HTML" formatted clipboard data. Is it the same on OS X and Linux systems? Is there any way to access this kind of detailed information (as opposed to just the plain clip fragment) in a webpage-to-webpage drag and drop operation? What about to a C# WinForms desktop application?
