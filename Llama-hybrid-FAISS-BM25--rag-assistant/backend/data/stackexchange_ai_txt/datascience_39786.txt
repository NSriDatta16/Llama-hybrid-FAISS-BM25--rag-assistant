Latent Space of VAE

Say I have a dataset $D = \{a_1,a_2,a_3,...a_n\}$ on which I train a basic variational autoencoder (VAE) on (a couple of fully connected layers separated by nonlinearities). Does the latent space of the VAE have a feature coordinate for $a_1 + a_2$ and $a_1 - a_2$ (which are not part of dataset $D$ )?
