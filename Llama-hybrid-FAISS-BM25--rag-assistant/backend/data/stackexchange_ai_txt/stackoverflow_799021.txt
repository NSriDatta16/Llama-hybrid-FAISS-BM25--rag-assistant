Found the solution, turns out that the body should not be wider than the report size so for example if you have a standard letter page: 8.5" x 11" than the body should be less than 8.5, pay special attention if you have margins since you have to subtract those inches too, I want a one inch margin per side so left and right would sum up two inches: 8.5 - 2 = 6.5 So if you plan to have a letter report with one inch margins make sure the body is 6.5 at the most then it would fit. Pretty obvious huh? but I did not figured it out at the beginning since the report viewer designer does not have any rulers to mark the beginning of the body, only for the report.
