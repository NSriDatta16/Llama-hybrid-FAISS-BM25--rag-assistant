First of all, yes you can use k-means for cluster those time series. The default implementation of kmeans relies on the Euclidean distance, but can be modified to feed the algorithm with a specific time series distance, like DTW. Check here for more information: On Clustering Multimedia Time Series Data Using K-Means and Dynamic Time Warping . Second, i don't think you can use SPSS for those purposes, but i do know that you can use Matlab, there are plenty of implementations of kmeans and DTW avialable.
