I don't think you can store a FileReference into a SharedObject. Or at least, I don't think you could get the file data back, so in practice there's not much difference. However, as of Flash Player 10, there's a load method in the FileReference object that lets you read the file (through the data property). The data is accessed as a ByteArray, which can be serialized and stored into a SO for later retrieval. So you could ask the user to select a file, read its binary data and store it in a SO (there's a 100 Kb limit by default, so you would most likely have to ask the user for some extra space). Next time your app is loaded, you should be able to get the file data from the SO (provided that the data was successfully saved and the SO has not been deleted).
