‘static‘ UIButton ontop UIScrollview?

I want to achieve a rather simple effect. A scrollView and a static button above it. So far not problem. Unfortunately a problem occurs if I want to scroll the view "trough" the button. So start dragging inside the button will effect the button, not the scroll view. Any ideas on how to achieve that? Thanks a lot! I think this approach won't work because touchesBegan is deprecated in UIScrollView … (Is this info true?) Not the solution :-) @implementation MySuperButton + (id)buttonWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { return [[[self alloc] initWithFrame:frame] autorelease]; } - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if (self == [super initWithFrame:frame]) { NSLog(@"initWithFrame"); } return self; } -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"[self nextResponder]: %@", [self nextResponder]); } @end Unfotunately this does not work, yet. I think the next responder is a my UIView not my UIScrollView. Any ideas? If my viewcontroller which is the nextResponder, passes the touches to the scrollView, nothing happens aswell.
