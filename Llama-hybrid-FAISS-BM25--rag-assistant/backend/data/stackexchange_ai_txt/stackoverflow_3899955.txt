Whoosh has, by default, only stemming for the english language. To implement stemming for another language, first look inside: /your_path_to_whoosh/whoosh/lang/analysis.py This is where StemmingAnalyzer (the default analyzer) is defined and an excellent starting point. The stem function, imported from porter.py , is the other important place to look in. So, the three steps are: Implement your own stemming function, taking as a reference the stem function in porter.py and any grammar and language references you will need to get the rules right. Implement your own Analyzer taking as reference StemmingAnalyzer inside analysis.py . The file is heavily documented so you should have no problem navigating through it. You'll see that StemmingAnalyzer is basically a chaining of a Tokenizer with a regex to match words, a lowercase filter and the stemming filter which basically calls the above stemming function. You'll see that StemFilter takes the stemming function as a parameter, so you don't have to reimplement the filter. Pass your brand new Analyzer function at schema creation time, see here: http://files.whoosh.ca/whoosh/docs/latest/schema.html#creating-a-schema
