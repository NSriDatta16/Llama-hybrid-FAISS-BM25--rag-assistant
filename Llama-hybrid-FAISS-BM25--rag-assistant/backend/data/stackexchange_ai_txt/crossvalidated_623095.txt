Cross-validation is a method for estimating the operational performance of a method of constructing a model. It can be used for essentially any task for which you need a performance estimate. Hyper-parameter tuning is one use of a performance estimate (we tune the model to maximise performance). Note however if we use cross-validation to tune parameters it no longer provides an unbiased performance estimate (i.e. it may be an unreliable guide to operational performance). So if you want to use cross-validation for hyper-parameter tuning and you need an unbiased performance estimate you need something like nested cross-validation. Mrs Marsupial and I wrote a (hopefully) accessible paper on this topic: G. C. Cawley and N. L. C. Talbot, Over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2010. Research, vol. 11, pp. 2079-2107, July 2010. ( pdf ) Sometimes we want a performance estimate simply so we know how well the system is likely to perform in operation.
