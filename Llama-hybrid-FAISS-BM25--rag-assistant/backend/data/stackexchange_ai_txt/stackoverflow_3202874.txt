EDITED (D'oh, more coffee required) These strings are bigger than 85,000 bytes so they will be residing on the large object heap which is rarely garbage collected and not compacted (leading to fragmentation, especially if you're allocating lots of short lived large objects). What WinDbg is telling you is correct - these don't have a root and they are garbage, but because they're on the LOH they may not get cleared out quickly (if at all). You definitely need to re-think how you are processing the XML, look to streaming data in/out rather than loading/creating in memory up-front.
