I'm on IIS 7 and have access to the URL Rewrite module http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/460/using-the-url-rewrite-module/ . I solved this by putting this in the web.config file of the MVC 2 application: ... http://mysite.com -> https://mysite.com http://www.mysite.com -> https://mysite.com https://www.mysite.com -> https://mysite.com This is simple and it works, but it would still be nice to have some sort of elegant MVC only solution.
