Select your ARIMA parameters on training set only?

I have a time series of 61 monthly observations and I would like to build an ARIMA forecasting model. To test my model, I separated my data into a training set of the 51 first observations, and a test set with the remaining 10. Now my question is, when I am plotting the ACF and PACF to get an idea of the appropriate p and q parameters I should use in my model, should I plot the ACF and PACF only on my training set? Knowing that my ARIMA will be applied on the training set to forecast 10 future values, that I will compare to the observed ones in my test set.
