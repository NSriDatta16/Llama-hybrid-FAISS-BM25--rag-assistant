I'm typing this from memory here as I don't have it installed on this machine and I haven't seen that setting before, but how about adding something like this to the InitializeRow event: foreach (UltraGridCell cell in e.Row.Cells) { if(cell.Column.Key == "Topic") //from your grid above cell.Title = cell.Row.Index; } The row object itself does not have a "Title" property from memory, but the cell does. See if that works... Regards, Rob G
