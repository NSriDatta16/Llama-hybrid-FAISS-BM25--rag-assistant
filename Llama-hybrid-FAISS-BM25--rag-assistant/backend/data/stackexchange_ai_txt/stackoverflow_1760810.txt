Try it with firefox and you will probably find that it will be saved with the correct extension. IIRC, since version 3 IE prefers to ignore the mime type and sniff the file content to see what the "correct" file format is. Maybe is uses the magic cookie? Is this Word 2007 or later? Try Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment; filename='MyNewFile.doc'") attachment encourages the browser to save the file instead of displaying it.
