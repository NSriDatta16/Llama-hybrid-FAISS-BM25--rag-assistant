Appropriate distribution for the given problem

Red blood cell deficiency may be determined by examining a specimen of the blood under a microscope. Suppose that certain small fixed volume contains on an average $20$ red cells for normal persons. What is the probability that a specimen from a normal person will contain less that $15$ red cells ? I thought of using the Exponential distribution for this problem since a single parameter is involved and the average number of cell is given. Thus , $N$ denotes the number of red cells present in the specimen of a normal person. So , $N$ ~ $Exp(\lambda)$ , where $ \frac{1}{\lambda} = 20$. Hence , $P(N 'time' related or a 'process' related thing is going on , here although I was able to get a solution , but that doesn't seem correct. Does it ?
