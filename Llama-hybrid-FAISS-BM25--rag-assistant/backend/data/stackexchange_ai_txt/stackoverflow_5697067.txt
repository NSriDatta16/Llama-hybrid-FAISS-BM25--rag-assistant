CSS for grabbing cursors (drag & drop)

I have a JavaScript webapp where the user needs to grab the background to move the whole screen around. So I want the cursor to change when they're hovering over the background. The -moz-grab and -moz-grabbing CSS cursors are ideal for this. Of course, they only work in Firefox... are there equivalent cursors for other browsers? Do I have to do something a little more custom than standard CSS cursors?
