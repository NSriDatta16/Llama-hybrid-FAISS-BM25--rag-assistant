JS: How to prevent the default action on images in browsers?

In IE, for example, when you press the left button on an image and keeping it pressed try to move the mouse, the drag n' drop action is taking place; how could I prevent this default action so that doing that way nothing will happen. I am building an image cropper, so you should understand why I need that. I am not much interested in knowing how to do so with help of jQuery or the like. As I study JavaScript, I prefer coding in plain-vanilla JS. It is important for me to learn how to make it cross-browser if there are any differences for such a thing.
