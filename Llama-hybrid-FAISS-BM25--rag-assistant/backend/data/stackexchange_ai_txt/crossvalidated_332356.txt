Probabilistic interpretation of Thin Plate Smoothing Splines

TLDR: Do thin plate regression splines have a probabilistic/Bayesian interpretation? Given input-output pairs $(x_i,y_i)$, $i=1,...,n$; I want to estimate a function $f(\cdot)$ as follows \begin{equation}f(x)\approx u(x)=\phi(x_i)^T\beta +\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x,x_i),\end{equation} where $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a kernel function and $\phi(x_i)$ is a feature vector of size $m https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665800/ My question is as follows. Suppose that I let $k(x,x'):=|x-x'|^2 \ln(|x-x'|)$ and $\phi(x)^T=(1,x)$, i.e. thin plate spline regression. Now, $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ is not a positive semidefinite function and the above interpretation doesn't work. Does the above model and its solution still have a probabilistic interpretation as for the case the $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ is positive semidefinite?
