Your intuition is somewhat correct, and somewhat incorrect. The score from randomly guessing does tend to "even out" better the more questions there are. When guessing randomly on a test of 1 million questions, it's very unlikely that you'll get a score that's far from 0. When guess randomly on a test with only 1 question, it's not even possible to get a score of 0, you will either score a 1 or a -1/3. But the expected value of randomly guessing on a single question is in fact zero, so random guessing confers no benefit or disadvantage overall. Averaged over the whole class, students who choose to randomly guess for every question will perform no better or worse than students who leave every question blank. When answering only 1 question, 25% of students will score better than a non-answering student, and 75% will do worse, but the average score over all the students who guess will be 0, the same as students who don't answer the question. On a test with one question where everybody randomly guesses, 1/4 of people will pick the right answer and get a score of 1, and 3/4 will pick the wrong answer and get a score of -1/3. In a way, whether this equivalent to leaving it blank and getting a score of 0 comes down to your level of risk aversion. If you need a score of 0 or higher to pass the class, random guessing is a bad strategy, since it's likely you will fail, while you could guarantee success by not answering. The fewer questions there are, the more likely it becomes that there will be random, nonzero, individual benefit/loss from guessing, but the average net benefit to the class from guessing or will be zero. To think about it another way - consider a game where we roll a 4-sided die, and I pay you \$10 on a 4, but you pay me \$3.33 on a 1-3. The scoring system on the test assumes that you should be indifferent to whether you play this game or not, but depending on your risk-taking aversion, you may just prefer to not play and just stick with your \$0. The variance of the outcome is higher if you choose to play one round (you'll either wind up with \$10 or -\$3.33), but the expected value of the outcome is identical (\$0).
