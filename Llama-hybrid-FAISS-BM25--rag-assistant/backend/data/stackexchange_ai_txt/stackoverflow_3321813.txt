You'd want to use reflection to some degree. If you have the type, or the name of the type, you can get a Type instance. E.g. Type.GetType("System.Int32") Then you can call Type.GetMembers() on that Type object, see here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/424c79hc.aspx ...and you'll have an array of MemberInfo objects which have the name ( .Name ), type of the member ( .MemberType ), and from that other information, like parameter lists. Hope that helps.
