I'm assuming that $X$ are the values (e.g. $X=3$ means throwing ⚂) and $Y$ are the counts (so $X=3$ and $Y=4$ means that you observed ⚂ four times out of $\sum_j Y_j = 15$ throws in total). First of all, your language is confusing. The "probability distribution of Y given X" sounds like a conditional probability , while it doesn't seem that you are conditioning on anything here, but rather counting the outcomes. As for your question, $\hat p_i = Y_i / \sum_j Y_j$ would be the estimate of the probability of observing the $X_i$ outcome using the empirical probability . This would be also the maximum likelihood estimator for the categorical distribution that the dice throws are following. Alternatively, you can use the Bayesian estimator if you can define a prior for the probabilities. It is a valid way of estimating the distribution, though the obvious limitation is that the less data you have, the less precise and trustworthy the result would be.
