Silverlight scrolling animation utilizes large amounts of CPU time

In our app, we have some scrolling credits in a ChildWindow . When showing this window, our CPU utilization is very high. The text is using a BitmapCache and hardware acceleration is enabled. Even after removing the clipping rectangle and the drop shadow from the child window, the CPU usage climbs to 80-90%. When I enable redraw region visualization, I see that only the scrolling text is getting redrawn, so I'm unsure why the CPU is going crazy. I tried animating both Canvas.Top and the TranslateY property of a CompositeTransform to do the scrolling. Any ideas as to what may be causing this animation to be so expensive? Are there any good articles out there that have recommendations for optimizing animations in general? Here's my XAML: Update: The CPU problem was not directly related to the ChildWindow itself but to the DropShadowEffect objects underneath which Silverlight was wastefully re-rendering. I've added an answer to describe how I worked around this.
