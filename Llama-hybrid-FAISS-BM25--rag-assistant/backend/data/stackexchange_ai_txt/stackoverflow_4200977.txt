Hey Megan, zod is correct. First, you need to pass the id for the table submission. Then, you need to check if the record exists. You can do this two ways: SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM submission WHERE ID = $id If total > 0, then you know you need to update; otherwise, you need to insert the record. If you are using MySQL (like you code shows). You can also use the "ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" INSERT INTO submission (id, Date,url,uploadedfile,contact) VALUES (1,'2010-12-31','www.google.com', 'Megan') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Date = now(); It's a handy tool, but you have to check if it applies to you. You can get more information regarding this feature in the following site: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-on-duplicate.html
