It's OK as long as the 400 individuals in each category were randomly selected from all the members of the category. If they were, you have a stratified, but nonetheless random, sample. Where things may go a little wrong is if there's some model misspecification, for example, the slope of some regressor actually varies across occupational status but the model forces it to be the same across occupational status. If the dataset were not stratified, one could still interpret the slope as a weighted average of the three underlying slopes, with weights more-or-less proportional to the fraction of the population with each occupational status (there are other influences on the weights too,) but with the current scheme, the slopes won't have this nice "average slope across the population" interpretation. Still, you'd rather not misspecify the model more than necessary.
