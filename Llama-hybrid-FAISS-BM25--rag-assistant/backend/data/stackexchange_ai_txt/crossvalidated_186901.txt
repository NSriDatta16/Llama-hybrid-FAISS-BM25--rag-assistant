Implementing raw code for back-propagation neural network

I want to implement back-propagation neural network algorithm in raw code, not using any library as my interest to understand in depth operations/customization of this algorithm. In this regard, I need to follow step-by-step simulation of back-propagation algorithm. More precisely, what code I should write in R language to each of steps in back-propagation neural network. Can anyone show me the close explanation of steps in this algorithm. I don't need any code. Just show me what operations is done in each steps. FYI: for reviewers, this is not my assignment. I'm doing my assignments using neuralnet library. Please leave a comment before any report.
