Simple Elegant pattern to separate Data Access, Business logic and presentation

I need a simple pattern to do the above. Few things to note: 1) I have a class that I am obliged to use that does the actual data retrieving and it return DataTable 2) I am not concerned with the generic interfaces that support all possible database types, we are sticking with one database type. 3) How do I elegantly trap the error and inform the user that error occured. 4) Do not offer me to learn MVC - it is not an option right now. I am interested in the actual pattern design.
