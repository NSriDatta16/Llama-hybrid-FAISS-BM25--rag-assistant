What does depth mean in a 1-dimensional neural network?

Can some explain to me what depth means in the context a 1-D CNN? I understand that in a one one image the depth = 3 (RGB), but suppose you simply had a graph of n values equally spaced along an x axis. What would the depth be then? Thanks in advance.
