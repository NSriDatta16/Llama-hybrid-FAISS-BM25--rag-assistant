I don't know how you log transformed this, but logarithms of negative values are complex numbers and logarithm of zero is undefined. In short, logarithmic transformation makes no sense statistically for such a variable. If you look carefully at your results, you should see lots of missing values (NAs). Further, set aside the zero and negative values on your scale and imagine it translated to all positive numbers. There is still another problem, as your distribution is approximately symmetric. Logarithmic transformation of a symmetric distribution can never bring it closer to normality. At most, you could use something like $\text{sign}(y) \log(1 + |y|)$ but that kind of transformation is usually needed only if $y$ can take on both very large positive values and very large negative values (e.g. profit (or loss)). Here the bounds $[-100, 100]$ rule that out. What distribution it is, however, is not really material if you want to apply regression. Regression doesn't entail an assumption about the marginal distribution of the response, although some flavours of regression may be better than others here. I wouldn't rule out absolutely plain or vanilla regression, but watch carefully for impossible predicted values. You could map from $[-100, 100]$ to $[0, 1]$ by $(\text{difference} + 100) / 200$ and then logit and beta regression are in range. That procedure respects the bounds. But you need to choose distribution family carefully (and look out for more realistic standard error calculations). Percentage difference is, however, a fragile metric and it is entirely possible that the extreme values are moderate outliers not just in terms of the response but on other variables too. It's hard to be confident of anything without more information, except that plain logarithmic transformation can't be what you want. The bounds rule out a normal in the strict sense, and also a logistic in the strict sense. Both normal and logistic are in principle unbounded, although that doesn't stop the normal being a good fit when it is (e.g. often to adult heights). Scatter plots of this outcome and leading predictors in a scatter plot matrix would be very helpful. EDIT In a comment the transformation used was revealed as taking logarithms after adding 100, which takes care of the negative values (and works for all given no $-$ 100 in the data). Here I mocked up a sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 30, showing that such a transformation imparts negative skew. The plots are quantile normal plots before and after transformation and the logarithms are natural. It's salutary to plot $\log(y + 100)$ over the interval $(-100, 100]$ as it doesn't have the kind of behaviour you should want over the entirety of possible values.
