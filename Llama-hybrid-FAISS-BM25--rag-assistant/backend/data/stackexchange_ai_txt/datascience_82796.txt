The idea of using a test set is to mimic the real-world application of using machine learning to, say, do speech recognition for people who aren’t born yet. That’s the situation where you don’t know the label, so you can’t calculate the error or loss. However, we mimic that (we hope) by withholding some data from the training. We fit the model on the training data and the estimate the error on unseen data by using our withheld data, since we know the correct label or value for those points, even though we didn’t tell the model. Our estimate on the holdout data might be badly wrong when we deploy the model to, say, Siri or Alexa, but some kind of error calculation on withheld data is the next-best that we can do until it goes into production and we see how the model performs.
