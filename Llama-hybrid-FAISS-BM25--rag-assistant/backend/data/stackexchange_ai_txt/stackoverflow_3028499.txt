How can I add similar functionality to a number of methods in java?

I have a lot of methods for logging, like logSomeAction , logAnotherAction etc. Now I want all these methods make a small pause after printing messages (Thread.sleep). If I do it manually, I would do something like this: //before: public static void logSomeAction () { System.out.println (msg(SOME_ACTION)); } //after: public static void logSomeAction () { System.out.println (msg(SOME_ACTION)); try { Thread.sleep (2000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) { } } I remember that Java has proxy classes and some other magic-making tools. Is there any way avoid copy-n-pasting N sleep-blocks to N logging methods?
