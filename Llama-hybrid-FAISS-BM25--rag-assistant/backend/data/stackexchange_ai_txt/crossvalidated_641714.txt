You are comparing Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning (what you call Deep Learning Classifier), these are different paradigms, different inputs, and more importantly, different kind of supervision. Reinforcement Learning uses a reward signal as supervision, there is no "correct answer" here. Supervised Learning uses labels as supervision that provide a correct answer. The two are not comparable, you can use neural networks inside reinforcement learning algorithms (like DQN).
