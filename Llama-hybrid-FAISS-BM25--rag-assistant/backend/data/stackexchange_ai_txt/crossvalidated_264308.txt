Information Gain is just a metric used to choose the attribute on which the data has to be split at the node. One important point to note is that, while Information Gain is the metric used in classification, Standard Deviation is used as the metric in case of Regression Forest. While the attribute with the highest Information Gain is chosen as the attribute to split the data on in case of classification, the attribute with the highest decrease in Standard Deviation is used in case of regression. After the regression tree is built, each leaf node in the tree might contain multiple samples from the training set. The average of the target variables of this leaf node is the output for any test sample that follows this decision path. You can check out my personal blog for more information about regression trees: Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost Hope that answers your question.
