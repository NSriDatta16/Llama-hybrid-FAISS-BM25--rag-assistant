De-trending requires a pre-specification of of how many values do you require before declaring that a new trend has started. Given this specification , say n values then one has to be concerned with distinguishing between Level Shifts ( i.e. intercept changes ) and time trend changes. If you assume that there are no Level Shifts then simply search for different points in time and select those points which have been find to be statistically significant. For example if you have the series 1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11 ...this would suggest two points in time where the trend "changed" , period 1 and period 5. Alternatively if you have a series like 0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,,,,,, there is only 1 point in time where a significant trend is evidenced i.e. period 5 . Outliers and ARIMA structure in a time series can lead to distortions in the identification of trend-point changes and may need to be incorporated prior to trend-point detection. A recent paper on tree-ring data http://www.autobox.com/pdfs/forestdisturbance.pdf discusses this issue.
