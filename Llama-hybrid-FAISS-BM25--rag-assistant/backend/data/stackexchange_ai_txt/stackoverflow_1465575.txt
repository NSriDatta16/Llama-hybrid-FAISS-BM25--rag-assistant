What if you want to fill a List<> with multiple instances of an object? Would you need to decorate your code with #pragma so the compiler leaves you alone? How would you even declare a class to have these sorts of restrictions? List<> is really nothing more than a C# class, you can decompile mscorlib.dll and see its full implementation. So to have this sort of knowledge, it would have to be hard coded somewhere. Attributes? That would be incredibly restricting. Special methods to validate your code? Would add overhead to your objects. This kind of stuff is never (and I do mean never) used for a reason: the extremely small number of cases where it would help rather than hinder comes nowhere near to outweighing the very real cost it would require in both implementation difficulty (of the framework itself AND of your code) and performance hits (from overbloated objects that have to be moved around the memory as the GC does its thing).
