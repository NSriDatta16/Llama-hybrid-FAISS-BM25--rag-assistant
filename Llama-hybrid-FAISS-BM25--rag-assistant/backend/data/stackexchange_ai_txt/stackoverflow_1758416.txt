When Organization is Sequential , the record deleted is the last record read. The Delete statement is valid only when the last operation against the file is a successful Read statement. If not, the Delete returns a File Status value of 43. Because a Delete cannot return File Status values beginning with a 2 when the file is Open with Sequential Access, coding Invalid Key on such a Delete is not allowed. When Dynamic or Random access is selected for the file, the Delete statment, like the Rewrite , becomes a little less restrictive. The record being deleted need not have bene previously read. Simply fill in the primary Key information in the record description for the fle and issue the Delete statement. If the record does not exist, a File Status of 23 is returned and an Invalid Key condition exists. From page 274 of Sams Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 Hours page 274 (which I have just dusted down from off my bookshelf). So in your case you'll presumably set up your records to be sorted by INPUTFILEID , make a record as you go through of occurences of a given INPUTFILEID past its first occurence, and Delete accordingly (after you have written it to your output file).
