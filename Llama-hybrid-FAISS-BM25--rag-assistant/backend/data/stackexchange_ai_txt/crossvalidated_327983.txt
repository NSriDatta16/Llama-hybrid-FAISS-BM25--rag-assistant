Yes, you need to form a null and alternative hypothesis. This is the Frequentist method (a Bayesian would do it differently). The average male salary may have been higher by an amount that can be explained purely by chance. As a first try, you can use an independent samples T (Student t) test. This is well described on the web or in a standard statistical text book. This can also be done easily with any Stats package or with R or by using the functionality in Excel (t statistic under Statistical functions). Your null hypothesis, H0, is that the salaries levels are the same. There are some complications that you should consider, namely that your salary data is likely to be skewed. You can use more sophisticated techniques to handle this, but the T test is reasonable start.
