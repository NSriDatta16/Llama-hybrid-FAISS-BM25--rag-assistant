Your NSArrayController is only observing its content array. You want to observe values of the objects in that array, which is not the same thing. I'd strongly encourage you to read all the documentation on Key-Value Observing and Cocoa Bindings . You'll see that you'll need to observe items as they're added to your setPointValue array and stop observing them when they're removed. You can do this by creating indexed collection accessor methods for your setPointValue and setting up or tearing down observing for items added and removed therein. You'll also need to react to receiving notification of the changes to your observed items to trigger your save method. Sosborn is correct - this is effectively a duplicate of this question . See the accepted answer the OP provided himself for the most direct solution (better than my original answer to this question).
