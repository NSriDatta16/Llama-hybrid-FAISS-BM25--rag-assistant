If there are never any deletes from the table, you can assume that the database will simply add new blocks to the end of the table. However, there's no guarantee as to whether those blocks on disk are either contiguous, or even advancing properly (i.e. the table can well be fragmented over time). Any SELECT from a table with no indexes will result in a table scan. Indexes are how you "tell" the database about things like "timestamps are in ascending order". A clustered index is good for telling the database you want to keep the rows in index order within the table. However, it is typically (depending on your implementation) only valuable on reasonably static data, as that's the only way the DB will ensure that the rows of the table are indeed in index order, as it does that by rebuilding the table.
