Magento template question

I have a problem with Magento's configurable product template. http://clientsupports.com/mind/index.php/clothing/bottoms/33.html I would like to move color and size under the price $33.00. I tried to modify catalog.xml in layout directory. I tried to find a template file under catalog/product/view, but I can't find anything. What files should I update??
