Use an appropriate Panel control (StackPanel, DockPanel, etc) for the alignment you are wanting, rather than using the default Grid. The Grid control makes it easy to start dragging controls onto the window wherever you want (without being quite as unstructured as the Canvas), but doesn't make any assumptions about what kind of layout you are actually trying to construct. If the layout you are trying to design is, in fact, a 'grid' (or table, e.g. rows and columns), I suggest either using the UniformGrid control (for evenly-spaced rows and columns) or the Grid with height/width set per row/column and margins on all elements set to 0 (to fully fill its cell).
