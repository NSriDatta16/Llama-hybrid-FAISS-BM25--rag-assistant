If I understand correctly your question, you should do something like this: select b1 from Bean1 as b1 join b1.bean2 as b2 where b1.id = ?1 and b2.id= ?2 group by b2.id However, this will probably won't work, since you must put in group by something from the select. But the following should work: select b2.id from Bean1 as b1 join b1.bean2 as b2 where b1.id = ?1 and b2.id= ?2 group by b2.id If you want to fetch b1, but to group by b2.id, you can try something like this: select b1, b2.id from Bean1 as b1 join b1.bean2 as b2 where b1.id = ?1 and b2.id= ?2 group by b2.id Pay attention that you'll get array in the result with Bean1 at index 0.
