What you want cannot be done in C++. In order to generate code for an object, your compiler needs to know how much storage its class requires. In order to know that, it must know how much storage is required for each member of the class. If you want to create a class of type bar with a member of type foo, the compiler has to know how big a foo is. The only way it knows that is if it has the definition of foo available (via #include). Otherwise, your only option is to use a forward-declaration of foo and a pointer or reference instead of an actual foo object.
