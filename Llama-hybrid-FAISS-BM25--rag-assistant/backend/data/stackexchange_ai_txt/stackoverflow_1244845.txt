How do I elegantly handle using a PasswordBox in WPF?

I'm aware that you can't Bind to PasswordBox.Password in WPF. How do I handle a form that contains one? All other controls on the form are bound to properties on a business object, but I have to manually set and retrieve a password property whenever the input changes. I know that others have created custom controls that allow binding to this property, but, on the other hand, Microsoft explicitly disallows binding to this property for a reason. Are there any elegant solutions to this problem, or am I stuck writing code to bridge the gap between my form and my business object?
