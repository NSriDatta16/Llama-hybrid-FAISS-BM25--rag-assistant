Interface bloat is the gradual addition of elements that turn what may been a simple, elegant interface into one littered with buttons, menus, options, etc. all over the place that ruin the original cohesive feel of the application. One example that comes to mind for me is iTunes. In it's early renditions, it was quite simple, but has, over time, added quite a lot of features that might qualify as bloat (iTunes DJ, Coverflow, Genius).
