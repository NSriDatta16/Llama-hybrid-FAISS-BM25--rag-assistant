Most performant ASP.NET web controls suite

Personally I've been working for years with Telerik's RadControls and DevExpress ASP.NET controls. IMHO they both produce quite an impressive HTML overhead on the client side thus for that I've never been highly pleased with them. Of course I also know about Infragistics, ComponentOne, ComponentArt, etc. I'd assume they are not much different than those I mentioned. Which (commercial) controls suite generates the most compact HTML on the client side? I'm inclined to think there is no "most performant controls suite" rather a combination of server controls and Javascript based controls (eg. jQuery UI). Would you agree with that? What combinations did you achieve the best/most performant user experience with?
