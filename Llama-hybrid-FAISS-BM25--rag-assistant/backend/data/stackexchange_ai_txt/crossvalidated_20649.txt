There are a few books that might be useful. If you are mathematically challenged you might want to start with two SAGE books by Mcdowall, Mcleary, Meidinger and Hay called "Interrupted Time Series Analysis" 1980 OR "Applied Time Series Analysis" by Richard McLeary. As you learn more about time series and decide that you you want more than prose and that you are willing to suffer through some math the Wei text published by Addison-Wessley entitled "Time Series Analysis" would be an excellent choice. In terms of web-based educational material, I have written a lot of useful material which can be viewed at http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting entitled "Introduction to Forecasting".
