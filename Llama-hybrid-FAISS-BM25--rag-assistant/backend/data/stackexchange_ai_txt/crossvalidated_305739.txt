This group of males has, on average, a higher level than this group of females. Any conclusion that "males" have a higher level than "females" is unsafe. What population is your sample drawn from? How confident are you that the drawn is random? Are both distributions more or less normal? Age is correlated with blood glucose levels - do you have ages so you can control for that? Even setting aside these considerations, a pair of histograms would help. Many e.g. a long tail of males has a lower level than any females in the sample - the larger standard deviation for males should push you to examine the distribution. OK, maybe this is a homework question, but if you are going to use these methods you need to step back and look at the wider context.
