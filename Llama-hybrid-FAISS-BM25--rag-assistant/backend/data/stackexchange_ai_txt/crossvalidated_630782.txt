How to measure change in growth rate between contiguous periods

I recently conducted a simple time-series analysis on some data. In this time series, we observe two elements (red and blue) that affect the trend during alternating periods. I want to measure how much better or worse one period type is from the other period type (A and B) by measuring the effect they have in the trend, in the sense of how much they change the trend when they appear. It's direction, magnitude, etc. My approach involved fitting a linear regression model to each period in the data and then calculating and comparing the slopes, measuring the change in slope per period in percentage terms. However, I am unsure about the validity of my method. It feels somewhat weak and discrete. Is there a standard or commonly used approach to measure the impact of each element on the trend? How should I best tackle this problem?
