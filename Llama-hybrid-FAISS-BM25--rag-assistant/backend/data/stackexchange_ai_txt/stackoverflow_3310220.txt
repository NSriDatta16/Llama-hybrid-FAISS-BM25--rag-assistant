You can't have 2 elements with the id "test" but if the code was as follows: then you could use $("#test p").not("#test2") or $("#test p:not(#test2)") to select just the other two paragraphs. See http://api.jquery.com/not/ for the documentation for the not() method (first option) or http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/ for the :not() selector (second option). Note: this won't select "everything" but rather the second and third paragraph elements. I assume that's what you meant :)
