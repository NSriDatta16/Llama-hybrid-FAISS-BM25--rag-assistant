Sounds as a pun, but the TaskDatabase takes over this task. :) When you set an archive date on an item, the record about this gets into the Tasks table of the core database. Afterwards, the TaskDatabaseAgent iterates that table with the defined frequency and processes tasks. The frequency is defined as usual, in section of web.config. The message "The item was archived at ..." should not confuse you - it is displayed once the date/time is reached. But the item will be archived the next time the scheduling agent runs the tasks database. Play with scheduling settings and you'll see how it works.
