How to select from datetime in sqlite?

Joined is a datetime data type column in the database and dates are saved as '12/05/2010 15:54:32' This my query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE joined BETWEEN '12/05/2010 00:00:00' AND '12/05/2010 23:59:59' ORDER BY id ASC But it doesn't work. It returns no rows. So how i gan get them? Solution: SELECT * FROM users WHERE joined BETWEEN '2010-05-05 00:00:00' AND '2010-05-12 23:59:59' ORDER BY id ASC
