I'm pretty sure - that chunking into several resources is useless, since anyway you're reading in the end all files into RAM/heap, which size is limited. In resembling situation (I need to show in TextView relatively large text) I had overcome situation using special class which was implementing CharSequence interface. In fact CharSequence has several abstract methods which can be used for chunking/positioning in big file for necessary fragments, like: abstract char charAt(int index) abstract CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) Probably in your situtation it might help.
