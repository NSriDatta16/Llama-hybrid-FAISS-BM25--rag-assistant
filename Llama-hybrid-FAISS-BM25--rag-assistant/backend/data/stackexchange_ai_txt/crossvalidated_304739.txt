Sklearn has a module for calibration curves and also Brier score. Both of these address the issue of probability accuracy. A calibration curve is a scatter plot where one axis is predicted probability and the other is the true probability. This is computed by taking, e.g., 100 cases, Q=40 of which are truly positive. The actaul probability of these 100 being positive is 0.4. We put each of these cases through the fit model and produce a probability estimate for each. Ideally, if we averaged these 100 estimates we would get 0.4. With a calibration curve, just repeat this process for different Qs and you should get a diagonal line. Brier score is MSE wrt this line. You are correct that Log loss is difficult to interpret and also related. Precision/recall are not so useful for this. They depend on a threshold and are traded off.
