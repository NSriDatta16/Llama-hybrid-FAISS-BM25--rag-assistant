First off, do not look to standard time series forecasting algorithms. These presuppose exactly one observations per time bucket, e.g., per day, week or month (and this observation may be "zero"). What you have, in contrast, is zero or multiple observations per time bucket. In addition, standard forecasting methods expect the time series to be continuous, but you may well have "holes" in the series where some teams do not work on some tasks or task types. Instead, I would use standard regression models, "regression" being in the Machine Learning sense: predicting a numerical output. Just feed in your predictors and build models as usual. If you suspect time dynamics, model these. Maybe your teams are less productive on Fridays? Then feed in Boolean dummies for day of week. Perhaps they are less productive during summer? Feed in a Fourier transform of the day of year . Possibly start with a multiple linear regression as a benchmark before trying more complex methods. Think about what all those zeros in Hours are: did people really finish a task in zero time, or is that really a missing piece of information, or was the task open and they did not work on it that day? As always, understanding your data is usually much more important than tweaking models. You may want to look at zero-inflated models. In your question, you show TeamID and TaskID . I hope you actually have task (and/or team) features so you can actually predict something, because TaskID sounds like an ID that was used for one task and will therefore not be used again - so you would not be able to forecast for a new TaskID . But again, this is standard ML. Finally, the MAPE has major shortcomings , especially if we have zeros, whose treatments makes quite a difference . Either use it as an objective measure, or if you use a "standard" loss function like MSE or likelihood, you may want to post-process predictions to find the point prediction that minimizes the expected MAPE. Actually, I have never seen a business problem that was better solved using a MAPE-optimal forecast rather than an MSE-optimal forecast.
