One way is to document that if Winbase.h is included, it must be included before this header. Normally that would be a horrible requirement, but with Windows headers, it's pretty much a given that you're in for a world of pain unless you include them first (normally in a precompiled header, as @sharptooth says). That done, put this in your header: #ifdef UpdateResource #pragma push_macro("UpdateResource") #undef UpdateResource #endif Anyone simultaneously needing the original definition of UpdateResource and your class just needs to put #pragma pop_macro("UpdateResource")
