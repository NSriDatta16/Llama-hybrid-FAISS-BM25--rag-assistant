I have at least one experience doing so. For the NHTS 2017 dataset, I have modeled a number of variables. Notably, random forests perform quite well on predicting vehicle ownership per household (using most of the other household-level variables as features), somewhat outperforming logit models (which are, for whatever reason, state-of-the-art in travel modeling). There are a dozen classes here. On the other hand, modeling individuals' work schedules (jointly hour leaving to go to work and hour leaving from work) has a large quantity of combinations. After some data preprocessing, there are over 200 classes. Random forest models perform abysmally here, in terms of accuracy. I get about 20% accuracy for an RF model with optimized max depth, and almost 60% accuracy for a logistic regression. Interestingly, the log loss of the RF model is still lower than that of the logistic model. These results ended up as an extended abstract at TRB. You can read the paper unpaywalled here
