Code coverage in Win32 app

We are just about to start a new project. The Proof of Concept (PoC) for this project was done simply using Win32. The plan is/was to flesh out the PoC, tidy the uglier parts and meet the requirements set by the project owners. One of the requirements for the actual project is 100% code coverage but I can see problems ahead: How can I acheive 100% code coverage with Win32 - the message pump will be exceptionally difficult to test effectively?! I could compile to a DLL but won't there be code in the main app that won't be under coverage? I am thinking of dropping the Win32 code and moving to MFC - at least then a lot of the boiler plate stuff will be hidden from view (and therefore coverage). Any thoughts on the problem?
