Bayesian methods are very general. While there obviously is Naive Bayes, it can of course be used outside the "labeled data" domains. Bayesian statistic is often defined on sets. The sets could be labels, but they could also be anything else. I figure you could use Bayesian statistics to test for mutual information, for example. So this common use of statistics - sets or predicates, and probably generalizable to fuzzy sets - can be used in various disciplines. After all, I can define predicates such as $x_3 3 | x_3
