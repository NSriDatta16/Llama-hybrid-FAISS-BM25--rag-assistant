I loved @whuber 's answer - before I only had a vague idea in my mind of how covariance could be visualised, but those rectangle plots are genius. However since the formula for covariance involves the mean, and the OP's original question did state that the 'receiver' does understand the concept of the mean, I thought I would have a crack at adapting @whuber's rectangle plots to compare each data point to the means of x and y, as this more represents what's going on in the covariance formula. I thought it actually ended up looking fairly intuitive: The blue dot in the middle of each plot is the mean of x (x_mean) and mean of y (y_mean). The rectangles are comparing the value of x - x_mean and y - y_mean for each data point. The rectangle is green when either: both x and y are greater than their respective means both x and y are less than their respective means The rectangle is red when either: x is greater than x_mean but y is less than y_mean x is less than x_mean but y is greater than y_mean Covariance (and correlation) can be both strongly negative and strongly positive. When the graph is dominated by one colour more than the other, it means that the data mostly follows a consistent pattern. If the graph has lots more green than red, it means that y generally increases when x increases. If the graph has lots more red than green, it means that y generally decreases when x increases. If the graph isn't dominated by one colour or the other, it means that there isn't much of a pattern to how x and y relate to each other. The actual value of the covariance for two different variables x and y, is basically the sum of all the green area minus all the red area, then divided by the total number of data points - effectively the average greenness-vs-redness of the graph. How does that sound/look?
