What does static_assert do, and what would you use it for?

Could you give an example where static_assert(...) ('C++11') would solve the problem in hand elegantly? I am familiar with run-time assert(...) . When should I prefer static_assert(...) over regular assert(...) ? Also, in boost there is something called BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT , is it the same as static_assert(...) ?
