php mass email and reminders

I am working on a site where I have the admin manager and i am trying to see how can I allow the admin to send mass emails to notify the event he is organizing, once he invites for the first time then towards during the event date, cron job should automatically send reminder to the author the email id's he used first time. something like how evite does. would like to learn these functionalities and also if possible how to send email if the event is canceled or postponed. regards
