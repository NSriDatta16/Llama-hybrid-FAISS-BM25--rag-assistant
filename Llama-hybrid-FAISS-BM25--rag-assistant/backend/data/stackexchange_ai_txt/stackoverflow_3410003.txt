iPhone Smooth Transition from One Video To Another

I have to figure out the best way to transition from one video to the next BASIC IDEA: An example would be that there is a video of a person walking.....the user taps the video and a seamless transition occurs to a video of a person running (over simplified example) My first thought was to create 2 movie players and use transitions between the 2 view elements. But movie-player doesn't support that. stopping the current video, loading new content, and then starting it is a solution but not very elegant. We are making a interactive sales tool for our reps and we want this to look as professional as possible. CURRENT THOUGHT: If there was some sample code for AVPlayer, it would seem I could use AVVideoComposition to switch between videos? But details on how that might happen don't seem to be currently available. POSSIBLE CLUE: I figured this would be easy as I bought an app called Live Cams HD that shows 16 different video feeds at once. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
