Basically, it is the fundamental property of all machine learning algorithms to improve performance with more available training data. It has been coined by Mitchell in 1997: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." Tom Mitchell
