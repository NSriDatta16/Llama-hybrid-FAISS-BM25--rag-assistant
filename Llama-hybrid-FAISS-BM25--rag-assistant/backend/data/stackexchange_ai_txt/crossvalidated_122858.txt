How to deal with variable new behavior in multiple linear regression

Let's suppose that I have one model with 6 dummy variables for the days of the week and from those in 5 days a specific event happen, suppose that is daytostudy variable and I want to predict how many exercises I can make in each day. At a specific moment in time (recent data) I've began to study also during Saturdays, so all my past behavior changes and the predicted value when I use daytostudy = 1 on Saturdays will have a new behavior. What is the best way to deal with the change of the behavior of the new variable in a multiple linear regression model? Can you please point me also some references!?
