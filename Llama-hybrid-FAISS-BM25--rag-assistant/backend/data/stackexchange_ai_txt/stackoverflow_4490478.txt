It would be more RESTful to construct by resource-collection/id pairs, e.g. /fruits/:id1/items/:id2, where id1 = orange, id2 = 3 /fruits/orange/items/3 Then the answer to the second question would be also correct if you lose the 's' on oranges, as you are treating orange as an instance of a resource and not a resource collection. /fruits/orange/comments e.g. slide 48 of http://www.slideshare.net/Wombert/phpnw10-designing-http-services-and-restful-interfaces
