Time series plot using netcdf data in python

I am trying to plot a time series for a 3d plot. I know that the variable must be made 1d inorder to make it viable for the time series plot. Actually I want the data within a box of latitude and longitude. So if anyone can help me in this regard of how to plot it will be much appreciated.
