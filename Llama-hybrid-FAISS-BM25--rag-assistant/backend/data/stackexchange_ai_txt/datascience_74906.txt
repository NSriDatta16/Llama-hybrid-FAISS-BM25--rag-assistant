I believe that using drop-out is the best solution for such a problem. I also suggest ensembling methods such as RandomForest instead of a neural network because RandomForest is robust w.r.t overfitting. Also, as you mentioned, your data is not that much complex. So, it would be a good idea to use RandomForest.
