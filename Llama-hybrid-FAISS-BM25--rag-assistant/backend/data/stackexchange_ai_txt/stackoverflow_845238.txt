I don't have much experience in RDBMS. However, I have read papers of Codd and books by C.J. Date. So, instead of using RDBMS jargon, I'll try to explain in more common sensical terms (at least to me!) Here goes - Singer names should be standard on "First Name - Last Name" basis Each "Singer" should have an entry in the "Artists Group" table even if they have performed solo Each entry in the "Artists Group" will consist of multiple "Singer" ordered alphabetically. There should be a single occurance of a specific combination. Each song will have an entry of a unique record from "Artists Group" regardless of whether they are solo, duets or in a gang. I don't know if this makes much sense, but it's my two cents!
