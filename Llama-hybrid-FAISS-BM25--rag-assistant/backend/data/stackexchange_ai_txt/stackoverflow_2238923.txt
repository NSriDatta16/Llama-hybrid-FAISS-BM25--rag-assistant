Magento; private/public filesystem layer

I want to split up the magento package in a private and public web directory. E.g. the private directory is reuseable on multiple projects, its just the app. private/ app, downloader, includes, lib, pkginfo, var public/ 404, js, media, report, skin + current root files (index.php etc.) Im setting this up in SVN where just one copy of magento can handle various projects on different stages. I've listed my first goals; Private directory containing all the reuseable package parts Public directory containing just local core code, package extensions, skins and API implementations Downsizes working copies significantly For db's im planning to use a piece of local code fixing the base url Separate Zend Framework and other potential libraries These should point to a global existing library directory (Zend is already here ;-)) Keeping magento's vendor source up2date Packages are tagged untouched to ensure a proper update Im not sure how to set up the flow in SVN from vendor source to separated directories.
