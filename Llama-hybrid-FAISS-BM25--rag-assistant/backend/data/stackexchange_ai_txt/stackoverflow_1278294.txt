Winpcap simple question - how to send packets to a specified ip/port?

I read the tutorials and so, but I am not getting it. It does let you send packets, but how can you tell Winpcap where to send those packets? Is there any header I should put on the packets so it will know to which ip/port's to forward it? I mean. Let's imagine I want to send some data to my MSN, as if I had wrote something to someone on my list. I can use the sendpacket(), but it will only take the packet/byte array as argument, not specifing to which app/ip/port so send it. Thanks
