How to traverse Table data in Java and pass that to servlet for using in JSP

I am a PHP programmer and got to know that for me Object oriented-ness, Strict type, and missing powerful array from PHP can be a big problem in Java. I tried to get code related to above question but no one works. My questions: How to traverse table in various way? Is there any good tutorial for me related to collection that can be helpful for PHP programmer. I learned Oracle tutorial but that has not solved my problem. That may require lots of attention! I need practical way to learn. Is there any good method to know how object are structured inside? In PHP I can use print_r, var_dump and can see what is inside. Here is more explanation asked by a commenter: try { ArrayList Rows = new ArrayList(); while (resultSet.next()){ ArrayList row = new ArrayList(); for (int i = 1; i Here, do I have a leisure to add complete rows at a time and use that in ArrayList? I do not want to use getString()/getInteger() etc on each column. Or in Java, I need to get every column data one by one.
