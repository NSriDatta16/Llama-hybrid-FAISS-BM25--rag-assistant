Best method of estimating the output rate of a group

I have a sample dataset consisting of 2 fields, output volume and input time (in hours) for different persons performing an identical task several times each. What is the best method of estimating the average output per hour of the group? Are there any checks to perform on the sample dataset to evaluate the reliability and validity of the estimate obtained? This would mainly be used for forecasting and capacity planning. Thank you
