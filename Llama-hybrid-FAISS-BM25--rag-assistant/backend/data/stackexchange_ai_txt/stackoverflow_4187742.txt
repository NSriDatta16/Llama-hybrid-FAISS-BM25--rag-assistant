PartialView and unobtrusive client validation not working

I'm currently using ASP.NET MVC3 RC and I'm using the unobtrusive JQuery validations as described by Brad Wilson on his blog . It works great but when I send my form (in Ajax) to the server, I do some server side validations and return the same row (that is included in a partial view) if my model state isn't valid. 2 problems with that : 1st : When I do a return PartialView in my action, all the unobtrusive attributes aren't rendered. I found a "non elegant" way to do it but when I do it, client validations are broken. After I return from my action, even if I call jQuery.validator.unobtrusive.parse() on my updated row, $("form").valid() always return true even if it's not the case. 2nd : I want my rendered view to be render as a string on the server so I can send it back in a JsonResult (ex: myJSonResult.html=RenderPartialToString("partialName",model) ). Has a reference, there's my view (editInvitation) : x.ID,new{id="ID"}) %> x.GroupID,new{id="GroupID"}) %> x.Name, new { id = "Name" })%> x.Name) %> x.Email, new { id = "Email" })%> x.Email) %> And my controller action : if (TryUpdateModel(invitation)) { validModel = true; //Other stuff } if (Request.IsAjaxRequest()) { //TODO : I return a partial view but I would prefer to return a JSonResult with the rendered view as a string in an Property of my JSon result return PartialView(validModel ? "DisplayInvitation" : "EditInvitation", invitation); } Thanks
