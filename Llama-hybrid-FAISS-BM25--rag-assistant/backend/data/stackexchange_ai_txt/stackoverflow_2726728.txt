Yup this is a known bug in SSMS - I believe all versions, reported here on connect . I have experienced it in the past, yet had machines that never had any problems. I would love to say I have a solution for it, but unfortunately the solution for me was to allow windows authentication for connecting instead. My recommendation is to post on the bug report and if enough people do it Microsoft will either fix it or provide information about it. Yes, they do pay attention to connect bug reports when they get 'popular'.
