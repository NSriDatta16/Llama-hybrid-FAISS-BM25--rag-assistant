This may not be the most elegant solution, but my general method to determine starting values when a using function like nls() is to put the x and y values in a spreadsheet program like Excel. And plot these. I then add two columns for the x and y values for the fitted function. And add a curve for the fitted line to the plot. I have cells for the coefficients of the fitted function, and the fitted-y values are hot-linked to these, so that when I change the values in the cells for the coefficients, the curve for the fitted function changes. In this way, you can make sure that the initial values you choose result in a function that reasonably fits the data. Hopefully this makes sense.
