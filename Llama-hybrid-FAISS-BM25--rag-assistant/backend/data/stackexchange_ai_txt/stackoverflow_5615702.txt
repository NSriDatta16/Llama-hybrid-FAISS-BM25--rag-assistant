I don't fully understand why you need to include jQuery more than once. For example, the draggable plugin will work fine if you've already included jQuery further up on the page. The same goes for any UI scripts you're including. Your script declarations will likely work better like this: The draggable stuff should work fine without needing to have its own set of the same base libraries defined. Given this might not be working for you, let's see if it's the jQuery files that are the problem at all. The jQuery noConflict() method allows you to assign different variables to call jQuery instead of the very common $ symbol. See if the following works: var j = jQuery.noConflict(); You can then use the letter j where you would ordinarily use $. For example: j('#myElement').draggable();
