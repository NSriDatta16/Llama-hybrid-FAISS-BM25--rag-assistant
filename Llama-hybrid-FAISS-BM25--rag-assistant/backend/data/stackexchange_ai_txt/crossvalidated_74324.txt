If you want an estimate of the average (arithmetic mean) and its error, the bootstrap seems reasonable to me. But are you sure you want the arithmetic mean and its error? Of course, it depends on your application, but for most purpose, it seems to me that you would want something else. You might want estimation of quantiles (say, 10th, median and 90th percentiles), either of the installation rate (possibly weighted, possibly not); or you might want to go straight to "number of fixtures" to be installed.
