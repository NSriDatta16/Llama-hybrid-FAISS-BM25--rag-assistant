PHP - LaTeX rendering

I am in the design stages of a new project which will take a data set and load it into a document, then render the document around a template. The rendered file could be a data set of CSV, a PDF marketing letter, an email, ... a lot of things. The data will not be math equations, I'm simply looking at an elegant way of connecting many data sources into many documents and outputting in many templates I'm entirely in the dark here with using latex in php. Is there anything like this out there? Most of what I could are plugins find is focused on rendering latex equations into one PNGs rather than allowing me to decide between PDF, CSV, raw-text, etc... Alternatively, could I do this with something else?
