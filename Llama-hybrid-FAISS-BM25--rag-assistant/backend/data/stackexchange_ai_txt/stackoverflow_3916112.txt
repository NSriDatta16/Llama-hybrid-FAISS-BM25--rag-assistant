Doppleganger, you can probably use a Filter , specifically a QueryWrapperFilter . Follow the example from Lucene in Action . You may have to make some modifications for use in python, but otherwise it should be simple: Create the query that narrows this down to 5000 hits. Use it to build a QueryWrapperFilter. Use the filter in a search involving the fuzzy query.
