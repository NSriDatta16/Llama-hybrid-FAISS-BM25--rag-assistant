General rule: use all the data you can get, keeping aside a test set and validation set. It is unlikely there is a combinatoric issue as an 8 dimensional output is not large in the context of machine learning. Also, not all of the $2^8$ possible labels may occur, due to correlation or other inter-relationships between label dimensions (depending on the data). For example, in the extreme, all digits might always be the same so only two labels ever occur: (0,0,0, ...) and (1,1,1, ...) meaning there is effectively only 1 classification task rather than 8. In your case, maybe certain people always speak at the same time. If any combination is possible then it really is effectively 8 independent tasks, but that is not necessarily a problem. The data requirement here is more about you learning a pattern in very-high dimensional data (sound clips) from relatively few samples (I don't know how many dimension each clip has but presumably mroe than the number of samples you have?). That means there are many possible functions that map x to y for the training data, many of which may not capture the latent structure needed to generalise (i.e. they are finding spurious correlations). In short, you are probably over-fitting. If so, remedies are: get more labelled data if possible; regularise, e.g. $\ell_2$ to keep weights small, $\ell_1$ to make them sparse, dropout; and if you can get unlabelled sound clips use semi-supervised learning .
