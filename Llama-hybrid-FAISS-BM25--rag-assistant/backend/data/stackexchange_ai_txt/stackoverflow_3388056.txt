According to the metadata in DotNetOpenAuth.dll , the enumerations are described as: AuthenticationStatus.Canceled : The authentication was canceled by the user agent while at the provider. AuthenticationStatus.Failed : The authentication failed because an error was detected in the OpenId communication. This should be shown by Visual Studio's intellisense (if you're using VS). I obtained it from v3.4.5.10202 of the dll.
