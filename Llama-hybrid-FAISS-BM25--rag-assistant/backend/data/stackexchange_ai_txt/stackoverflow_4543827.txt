I wrote a library that duplicates the settings from setting.bundle inside the app, during that I discovered that the defaults in setting.bundle are not registered unless the user goes to the app's settings in the settings app. Here's the function I wrote that goes though the all the plists in the settings.bundle and registers the user defaults: http://bitbucket.org/keegan3d/inappsettings/src/2053acd0524e/InAppSettings/InAppSettingsReader.m I'm not sure why it's working in iOS 3.2 for you but it might be that the settings are registered from a previous build.
