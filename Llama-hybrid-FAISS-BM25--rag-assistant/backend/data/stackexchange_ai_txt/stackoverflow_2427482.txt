I think what Fowler means is that in a layered application the focus is on organizing "vertical" de-coupled communications between layers. Another architecture is SOA (Services Oriented), where the focus it on organizing "horizontal" de-coupled communications between components. (Within a component the implementation may use either model). This is nothing new. Other instances of this horizontal pattern are COM/ COM+, CORBA, workflows, and now "messaging" or ESB architectures.
