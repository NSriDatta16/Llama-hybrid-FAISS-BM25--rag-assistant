I prefer using jQuery for AJAXy stuff like that. It also has a lot of very good plugins that make writing client-side code very easy. Here is the plugin page specifically for Drag-n-Drop. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Plugins/category/45 Ajax callback are also very easy so saving the setup should be fairly easy as well.
