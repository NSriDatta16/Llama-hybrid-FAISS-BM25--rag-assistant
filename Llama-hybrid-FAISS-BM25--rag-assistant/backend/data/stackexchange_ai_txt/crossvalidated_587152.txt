How do I find the marginal distributions of a GARCH(p, q) process?

Let $X_t$ be a stationary GARCH(p, q) process. Given the coefficients for the process, how do I derive the stationary/marginal distribution? What about the distribution after only marginalizing out some of the variables? I'd like to do Bayesian estimation of a GARCH process under the assumption that the first few observations are drawn from the stationary distribution.
