How can I make a CMFCRibbonEdit automatically convert contents to uppercase?

I am using the MFC Feature pack in Visual Studio 2008. I have an edit box (CMFCRibbonEdit) in a ribbon that I would like only to contain uppercase letters. I know that I can pass ES_UPPERCASE to the "Create" method, however "Create" is called from the Ribbon itself, and not explicitly by my code. To add the edit box to my ribbon, I call this: CMFCRibbonPanel* pPanel = pCategoryViewer->AddPanel("Panel Title"); CMFCRibbonEdit *cEdit = new CMFCRibbonPanel( ID_MYEDITBOX, 60, "Edit Title" ); pPanel->Add( cEdit ); Based on what I read on MSDN I saw I could overload the "CreateEdit" function of CMFCRibbonEdit. I tried that, but it didn't work. class UpperCaseRibbonEdit : public CMFCRibbonEdit { public: UpperCaseRibbonEdit( UINT nID, int nWidth, LPCTSTR lpszLabel ) :CMFCRibbonEdit( nID, nWidth, lpszLabel ) {} CMFCRibbonRichEditCtrl* CreateEdit( CWnd* pWndParent, DWORD dwEditStyle ) { return CMFCRibbonEdit::CreateEdit( pWndParent, dwEditStyle | ES_UPPERCASE ); } }; I also tried making this call after initializing my ribbon and its controls. This didn't work either. HWND editHwnd = GetDlgItem( ID_MYEDITBOX )->GetSafeHwnd(); SetWindowLong(editHwnd, GWL_STYLE, (LONG)GetWindowLong(editHwnd, GWL_STYLE) | ES_UPPERCASE); Does anyone know how I could accomplish this?
