You might be able to jimmy (in Microsoft VC++ and maybe other compilers): #pragma pack(16) such that malloc( ) is forced to return a 16-byte-aligned pointer. Something along the lines of: ptr_16byte = malloc( 10 * sizeof( my_16byte_aligned_struct )); If it worked at all for malloc( ), I'd think it would work for realloc( ) just as well. Just a thought. -- pete
