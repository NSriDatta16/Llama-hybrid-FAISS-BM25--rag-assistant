Validation of logistic regression - goodness of fit (pearson)

I have developed a scoring system using logistic regression. The score ranges between 0 and 6 (using integers) and predicts death. It does not use a conventional regression formula and thus I am not able to calculate a precise value of the predicted risk of dying. An example of the score could look like this: Score Dead Alive 0 0 101 1 1 911 2 3 672 3 2 291 4 8 78 5 10 60 6 5 4 I know that I have to use Pearson's goodness of fit to test the goodness-of-fit and have three cohorts, a development cohort and two independent validation cohorts. My question is: How do I calculate the Pearson Goodness-of-fit test in each cohort? In the development cohort, what would be my expected mortality? In the validation cohorts, I guess that I could use the observed mortality in the development cohort as expected mortality.
