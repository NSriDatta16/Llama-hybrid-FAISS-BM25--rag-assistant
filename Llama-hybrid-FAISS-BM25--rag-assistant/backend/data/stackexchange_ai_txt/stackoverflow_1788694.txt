Thanks for your answers. I try to restart my mysql server but nothing change. About the cpu and ram, nothing wrong, my cpu is around 2% and I have 100Mo free for 1 Go installed. I run OPTIMIZE TABLE on all tables but the problem is still here. But, I analyse I/O hard disk and my hard disk write many things every time. I have an average of 75.33 requests/secondes which write on my disk. The problem is may be here. How know what program write every time ?
