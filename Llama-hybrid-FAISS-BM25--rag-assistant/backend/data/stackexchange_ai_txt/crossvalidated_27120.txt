Why does Lasso do better than SVM?

I have been evaluation various regression techniques over a regression dataset . I am surprised by the fact that cross-validated RMSE of Lasso is better than SVM and Random Forest in my case. Can this happen? I believed that a non-linear modelling technique like random forest or SVM would do better than a linear model like Lasso. Is that really possible!?
