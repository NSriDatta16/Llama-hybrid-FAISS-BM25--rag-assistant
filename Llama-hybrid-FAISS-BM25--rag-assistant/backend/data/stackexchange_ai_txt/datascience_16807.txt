Why mini batch size is better than one single "batch" with all training data?

I often read that in case of Deep Learning models the usual practice is to apply mini batches (generally a small one, 32/64) over several training epochs. I cannot really fathom the reason behind this. Unless I'm mistaken, the batch size is the number of training instances let seen by the model during a training iteration; and epoch is a full turn when each of the training instances have been seen by the model. If so, I cannot see the advantage of iterate over an almost insignificant subset of the training instances several times in contrast with applying a "max batch" by expose all the available training instances in each turn to the model (assuming, of course, enough the memory). What is the advantage of this approach?
