I believe the best answer for your question is: it depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your intention is to present a smoothed version of this time series, then the answer would be yes. You could apply some kind of "noise filter" to smoothen the series, so your plot would look more like a linear trend. But if you intend to fit a model over the data you could use an approach that takes seasonality and trend into account. As an example, your model could look like this: $ log(y_t) = b_0 t + b_1 s_{t-n} + \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 log(y_{t-1}) + \alpha_2 log(y_{t-2}) + \epsilon_t$ . Where $t$ would be the trend component and $s_{t-n}$ the seasonality component. In this case, the answer would be no, because you would deal with seasonality and trend somehow.
