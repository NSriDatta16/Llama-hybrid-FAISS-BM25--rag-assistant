If I have a shallow network and I use the unit-step function as the activation for the hidden nodes and the output nodes, is the model considered a non-linear classifier? Yes, such model could be used as a non-linear classifier. In fact, to take it a step further, if I had a shallow network and I used unit-step activation for the hidden nodes, but a linear activation for the output, this would still be considered a model that can (no guarantee that the training algorithm can train the model) solve non-linearly separable problems, is that correct? Such model can (in theory) approximate any mapping to arbitrary precision (given enough units). From Bishop's great book Neural networks for pattern recongition , sec. 4.3.2, p. 131 (emphasis mine): Thus we see that the function $y(x_1,x_2)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of step functions whose arguments are linear combinations of $x_1$ and $x_2$ . In other words the function $y(x_1,x_2)$ can be approximated by a two-layer network with threshold hidden units and linear output units .
