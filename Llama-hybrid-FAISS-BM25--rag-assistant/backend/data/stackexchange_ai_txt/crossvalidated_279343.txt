If you are only interested in the total data, then one way would be to do a one-way chi-square test against the assumption of a uniform distribution. But I'd suggest instead doing a logistic regression with "survived" as the dependent variable and "time period" as the independent variable. If desired, you could also add "weight" and possibly the interaction of weight and time as other independent variables.
