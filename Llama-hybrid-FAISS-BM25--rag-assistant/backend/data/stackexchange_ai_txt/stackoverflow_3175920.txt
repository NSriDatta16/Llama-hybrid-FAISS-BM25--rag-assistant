Implement the NSTableViewDelegate method tableView:shouldReorderColumn:toColumn: to control this behaviour. From the documentation : When a column is initially dragged by the user, the delegate is first called with a newColumnIndex value of -1 . Returning NO will disallow that column from being reordered at all. Returning YES allows it to be reordered, and the delegate will be called again when the column reaches a new location.
