If your problem is caching, there's really nothing you can do to keep an organization from caching it. You can try to add this code to see if it makes a difference: Response.Expires = 0 Response.Expiresabsolute = Now() - 1 Response.AddHeader "pragma","no-cache" Response.AddHeader "cache-control","private" Response.CacheControl = "no-cache" If this doesn't work, you may need to contact that organization's IT department and ask them to add a caching exception for your page/site.
