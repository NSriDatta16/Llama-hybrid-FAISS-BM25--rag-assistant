Given distribution of $X$ and $X|Y=y$, is it possible to find distribution of $Y$?

What the title says! My intuition is NO since in Bayesian statistics we typically specify the prior and likelihood, and from those two we can compute the posterior and so on. We can interpret $Y$ = data and $X$ = unknown parameters, and thus we are given prior $f_X(x)$ and posterior $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$ , instead of likelihood $f_{Y|X}(y|x)$ , and want to find data distribution $f_Y(y)$ without accounting for parameters $X$ . I would appreciate if someone could confirm either way, either with a description of how to compute $f_Y(y)$ if it is indeed possible, or with a simple counter-example from which I could construct two joint PDFs (or PMFs) $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ of $(X,Y)$ such that the marginal PDFs of $X$ and the conditional PDFs of $X|Y=y$ are exactly the same for $f$ and $g$ , but for which the marginal PDFs of $Y$ are different for $f$ and $g$ . Thanks!
