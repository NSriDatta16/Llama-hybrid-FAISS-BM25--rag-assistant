How to customize the Xcode toolbar?

When customizing the Xcode toolbar, am I pretty much limited by the buttons they give me in the Customize dialog? I'd like to add actions like Step Over, Continue, Toggle Breakpoint, etc... but can't find a way to do so. I tried dragging menu items to the toolbar a la Visual Studio, but to no avail. Am I missing something simple?
