Evaluating goodness-of-fit for GARCH models in R with QQ-plots (rugarch package)

I'm currently working with multivariate GARCH representations of time-series for financial data using the rmgarch R package. This package in turn uses the well-known rugarch package to fit the 'marginal' GARCH processes. Right now I'm evaluating the goodness-of-fit and parameter estimates when using different conditional distributions for the variance innovations. It seems that (skewed) student's t and skewed normal fit my data better as they present heavier-than-normal tails, skew, and excess kurtosis. In addition, the parameter estimates seem to become more significant (particularly the estimate for $\alpha_1$ ) when using non-normal distributions. Typically, I would analyse the standardised residuals of my model (available in "fit object"@mfit$stdresid for a DCC-fitted model), and use for example a QQ plot against the theoretical distribution to examine the behaviour, along with an ACF plot to examine autocorrelations. This is easily done when assuming normal innovations as the standard qqnorm in R does the trick, however I'm less sure how to do this procedure for the skewed normal and (skewed) $t$ distributions. Is there a good way to produce these kinds of QQ-plots in R? The GARCH package(s) will readily output estimates for skew and shape, but I'm not sure how to incorporate these into QQ-plots. Also, as a side question: currently I'm fitting three time series. Two of them seem to want Student's $t$ distribution, and one skewed normal. For the joint innovations, however, I'm currently using a multivariate normal distribution. Does this make sense from a mathematical perspective? As you might tell, I'm relatively inexperienced with time-series models, but this seems akin to fitting a joint distribution normally but with non-normal marginal distributions, which seems odd. Thanks for any help! :)
