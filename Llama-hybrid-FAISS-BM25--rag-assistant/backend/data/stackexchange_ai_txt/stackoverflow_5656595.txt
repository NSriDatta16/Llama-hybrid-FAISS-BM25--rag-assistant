The problem is that the scripts included in the dynamic part of the page run before the new page fragment is inserted into the DOM. But often these scripts want to modify the HTML they're being delivered with. I'm fairly sure that in that case, the only sensible thing is to place the script after the HTML element. Everything else would become kludgy quickly - I guess you could implement your own "ready" handler that gets executed after your HTML has been inserted, but that would be a lot of work to implement for no real gain.
