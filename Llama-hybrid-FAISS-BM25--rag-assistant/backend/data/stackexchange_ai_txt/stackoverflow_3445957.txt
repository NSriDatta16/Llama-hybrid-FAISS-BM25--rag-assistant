Rails: Many-to-many relationships with 3 Models

I have a situation where I have Products , Suppliers , ShoppingLists and Valuations . A shopping_list consist of many valuations each with a product , an specific supplier and a price . My models are as follows: class Product :valuations end class Supplier :valuations end class ShoppingList :valuations has_many :suppliers, :through => :valuations end class Valuation My routes.rb is: map.resources :shopping_lists do |shopping_list| shopping_list.resources :valuations end map.resources :product map.resources :supplier I wonder if this could be the best solution , anyway what I want is that the user can create as many lists as he wish, each with several valuations. The first time a shopping list is created its also filled with one valuation at least . Then, the user can add/remove valuations to/from the shopping_list. I would like a simple and elegant solution, without Ajax callbacks. What is the best way to do this, from the controllers/views/routes perspectives? Or should I completley change my schema ? Thanks!
