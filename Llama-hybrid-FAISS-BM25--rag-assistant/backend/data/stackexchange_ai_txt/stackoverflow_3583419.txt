Mapping String contents key/value pairs to a HashMap

I'm trying to establish some way of mapping a String document to a HashMap as follows: the String contains key/value pair $key1=value1 $key2=value2 value21 value22 $key3=value3 what I want to end up with is: key1, value1 key2, value2 value21\nvalue22 key3, value3 Is there a pattern I can use for this? It looks like an interesting puzzle, so far I have come up with using split("[$]{1}[A-Za-z]+[=]{1}") to separate the different values but then it has to be a different iteration to identify the keys, so I'm looking for a more elegant solution.
