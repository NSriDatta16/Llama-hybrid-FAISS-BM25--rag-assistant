Good starting point for NLP sentence classification on limited computational resources?

I am designing a project where I plan to train a supervised ML model to classify English sentences of 10-30 words long into one of 8 or 9 categories by what kind of meaning it conveys. I have a good PC (i7 8core, 16G RAM, 1050 Ti) but it does not hold up against large models like BERT. I am wondering what are the best LSTM's or encoders specifically designed for this kind of training that can achieve relatively good performance using limited hardware.
