When querying FreeBusy status with GetUserAvailabilityRequest, what should I use for AttendeeType?

I'm writing an application that queries a user's Outlook calendar to see if they are available to be contacted "right now" (i.e., they do not have a current appointment that is marked as Away or Out Of Office). I'm using the GetUserAvailabilityRequest xml message and it's working well, but I'm a bit confused as to what I should use for the AttendeeType. AttendeeType is a field that allows me to specify the kind of meeting attendee I'm looking for -- whether it's the meeting organizer, a required attendee, an optional attendee, a room resource, etc. But for this application I don't care about the attendee type; I only care if the person has a current appointment that marks them as unavailable. If Bob is out of his office attending a meeting, I don't care if he put the meeting together or if he was invited by Carol; I only care that Bob is out of his office. Is there a value I can use for AttendeeType that will catch all attendee types? Most of the examples I've seen use the value "Required", but they don't explain why.
