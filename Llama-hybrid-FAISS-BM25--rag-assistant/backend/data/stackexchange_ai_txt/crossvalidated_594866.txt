If your validation and test sets are sufficiently large neither of them have been used to train the model and are also suspected to have been sampled from the same distribution then the validation loss will be a good approximation of the test loss. However, your validation loss is about 3 times greater than the test loss which means at least one of the assumptions is not valid. If I had to guess, I'd guess that your test set is an easier test for your model than your validation set (assumption 3. not valid) as this is a common mistake. Regarding the RMSE, if the RMSE on the validation set decreases it does not necessarily mean that the RMSE on the test set will also decrease. This is due to the random nature of modelling. Instead, you want the moving average of your validation and test losses to decrease as you train the model from epoch to epoch. In other words, the RMSE of the test going from 30 to 38 is not a sign to be concerned. What's a bit concerning is the difference in magnitude between the test and validation losses.
