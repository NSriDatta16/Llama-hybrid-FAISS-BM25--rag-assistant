That what confused you is how it learns about what's in an image. What is in an image is digitally represented by the values in the image's pixels. If you take an example of color in the image. The pixel may have three values, each for the three main colors - Red, Green and Blue ( RGB ). A pixel with ( 10,50,100 ) means it has 'less' blue color elements than a pixel with ( 40,50,100 ). Thus, in the image the first pixel represent a region with less color blue. This is the information the neural network learns, from one location/region of the image to the other and ends up 'knowing' what is in the image. The same principle is applied for other image features (besides color) that may be used as input to neural network. See this ,and this for basic image concepts and then move to this to learn how neural network work.
