Well the obvious reason on why this is the case is that JavaScript wasn't around when we started sending HTML around, and HTML was an improvement to sending around plaintext documents. The reason we don't do this now: we eschew complex solutions to problems that aren't really problems. Average internet connections download nearly 1M bytes per second, and web browsers are quite adept at parsing and starting to render this HTML before it's even all ready to be. They're also great at parallelizing the downloading of resources on the page. If we want to save a few bytes at the cost of some compute cycles, we gzip content before sending it. Problem solved. And for the record, we do this with AJAX in complex webpages (checkout Github's source browsing for a great example of how awesome this can be).
