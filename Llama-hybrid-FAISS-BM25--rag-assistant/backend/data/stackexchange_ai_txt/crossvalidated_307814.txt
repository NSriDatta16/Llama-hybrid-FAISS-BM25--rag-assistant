Negative Binomial distribution

I am trying to compare average calving intervals (number of days between two consecutive times that a cow gives birth) between different breeds of cattle. The variable called "calving interval" is a discrete variable, and I believe it has a negative binomial distribution. What would be a simple way to test if a variable really has a neg. binomial distribution, using R?
