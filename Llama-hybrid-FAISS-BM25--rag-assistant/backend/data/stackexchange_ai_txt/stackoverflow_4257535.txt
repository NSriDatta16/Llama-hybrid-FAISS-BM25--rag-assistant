Modifying asp.net app's global visual identity without a master page

I've to fix an old ASP.NET application's appearance so that it can conform to the new web visual identity of my organization. The old application does not have any master page and uses a very basic .include file. Modifying the .include header does not change the overall look of the app's pages much, and I still have to manually import new css definitions, replace the table tags with divs on the 60 odd .aspx pages. How should I proceed? I have long term maintainability in mind, so a master page is the obvious solution. Are there any css parsers which can ease this conversion? Thank you. -Dhruv
