I don't think the question is well-posed. Javascript can do anything, as it is Turing complete (in particular any turing complete language can do JSON parsing), but access to external resources (such as sockets or a webcam) is limited to the API which are available on a certain environment. So it depends on the environment: the answer will be different for a browser, node.js or rhino. If you mean Javascript inside a browser: not much. The basic available API are the DOM and BOM, although with HTML5 there will be some new features for storage and sockets. EDIT I have read your update, and I think it is unreasonable to ask for the features of every existing environment. Still, it seems to me you are mostly interested in the features of client-side Javascript - i.e. in the browser. Until recently, one was tied with the following two APIs: DOM: allows to traverse and modify the Document Object Model, that is, operates on the content of the current page. It can add div or other elements, change elements style and so on. BOM: the Browser object model. It allows you to operate on browser features which are not tied to the current document, for instance resize the current window. In particular this includes the XMLHttpRequest: allows you to make an HTTP request in the background, it is at the base of all the AJAX-driven application. For security reasons, there are domain restriction on where you can send this request: these are known as the same origin policy . For obvious security reasons there was (and still there is not) a way to operate on local documents. With the advent of HTML5 there are a number of new API, some of which are still under heavy development. In general you cannot rely on those API on older browers. This presentation sums up the new goodies which will be available once all clients support HTML5. Besides the DOM and BOM API you can also make use of Web API's . Note that XMLHttpRequest is a Web API. You can see the complete list at this link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API .
