when given two time series with different time steps, what is better: Using the Lowest or the biggest time step ? For your timeseries analysis you should do both: get to the highest granularity possible with the daily dataset, and also repeat the analysis with the monthly dataset. With the monthly dataset you have 120 data points, which is sufficient to get a timeseries model even with seasonality in your data. For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ? To obtain say weekly or monthly data from daily data, you can use smoothing functions. For financial data, you can use moving average or exponential smoothing, but if those do not work for your data, then you can use the spline smoothing function "smooth.spline" in R: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html The model returned will have less noise than the original daily dataset, and you can get values for the desired time points. Finally, these data points can be used in your timeseries analysis. For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ? To obtain daily data when you have monthly or weekly data, you can use interpolation. First, you should find an equation to describe the data. In order to do this you should plot the data (e.g. price over time). When factors are known to you, this equation should be influenced by those factors. When factors are unknown, you can use a best fit equation. The simplest would be a linear function or piecewise linear function, but for financial data this won't work well. In that case, you should consider piecewise cubic spline interpolation. This link goes into more detail on possible interpolation functions: http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf . In R, there is a method for doing interpolation of timeseries data. Here you would create a vector with say weekly values and NAs in the gaps for the daily values, and then use the "interpNA" function to get the interpolated values for the NAs. However, this function uses the "approx" function to get the interpolated values, which applies either a linear or constant interpolation. To perform cubic spline interpolation in R, you should use the "splinefun" function instead. Something to be aware of is that timeseries models typically do some sort of averaging to forecast future values whether you are looking at exponential smoothing or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods amongst others. So a timeseries model to forecast daily values may not be the best choice, but the weekly or monthly models may be better.
