Adding to Jon Skeet's answer, this page shows there are 3 billion searches on Google per day. Don't know how accurate it is, but I would guess it's in the ball park. is 14 characters and at 3 billion searches per day, it amounts to approximately 39.12 GB of data per day ignoring compressions, or around 26 GB if we take gzipping into account. However, Google might actually send the closing tags for body and html for older browsers by looking at their user agents. I cannot confirm or deny this, but looking at modern browsers - Safari, Firefox, and Chrome shows that all are missing the closing tags. So if you think it works for you, then go for it :). There's no harm in implementing this which may or may not be a micro-optimization for you depending on the scale you're operating at.
