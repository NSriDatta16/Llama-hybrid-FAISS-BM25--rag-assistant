T-test unknown or known standard deviation?

One week ago I performed the following two experiments: 1) I made a tensile test on 30 steel wires. These wires have not been through a surface treatment. The maximum load is (in average) 28 Newton, with a standard deviation of 3,54 N. 2) I made a tensile test on 30 steel wires. These wires have BEEN through a surface treatment. The maximum load is (in average) 25 Newton, with a standard deviation of 3,94 N. I am about to do a statistical analysis of this experiment but I am in doubt whether I should use the Z test (known variance) or the T test (unknown variance)? Which should I use and why?
