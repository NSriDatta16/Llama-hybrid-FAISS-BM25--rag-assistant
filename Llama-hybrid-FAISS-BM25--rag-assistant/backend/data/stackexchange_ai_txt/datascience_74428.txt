Topology of Data

Do every data resembles some form of space like manifold? Meaning, do geometry of data (especially the big data) is a manifold? Is every data embedded to some sphere? If that is so, can we also say that whatever geometry of data after doing the dimensionality reduction is a (n-k) sphere, given that n is a dimension of the data before dimensionality reduction? Basically, I am curious if geometry of every data would be a topological manifold (better yet, the differentiable manifold)...
