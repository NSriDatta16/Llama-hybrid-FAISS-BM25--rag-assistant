I believe that the optimization to not perform fragment processing is done by using the Z-buffer to determine if a pixel is visible or not (and early out the pipeline if the pixel isn't visible). As a result rendering back-to-front will be worst-case for that optimization (no optimization possible) and front-to-back is best-case (all eventually hidden pixels are already hidden).
