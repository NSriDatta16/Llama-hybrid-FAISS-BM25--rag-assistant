Is it valid to get the average of the corresponding elements of two time series?

Say I have two time series that have the same length within the same time period. I need to replace the two time series with a single time series that explains the variations in both. So what I thought I could do was get the average of the corresponding elements and form the resulting time series. For example, say the two time series represent the number of leaves taken by two individuals, and I want to check the leave patterns of the two individuals by a single time series. That is, I want to obtain the series that best represents both of their leave-taking patterns. Is this procedure statistically valid? If not, what method should I use?
