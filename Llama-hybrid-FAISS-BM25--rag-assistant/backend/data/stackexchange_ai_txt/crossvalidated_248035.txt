This is an old question, but I thought it would be useful to add that my DHARMa R package (available from CRAN, see here ) now provides standardized residuals for GLMs and GLMMs, based on a simulation approach similar to what is suggested by @GregSnow. From the package description: The DHARMa package uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled residuals from fitted generalized linear mixed models. Currently supported are all 'merMod' classes from 'lme4' ('lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes. Alternatively, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The package also provides a number of plot and test functions for typical model mispecification problem, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and spatial / temporal autocorrelation. @Momo - you may want to update your recommendation 6, it is misleading. Normality of deviance residuals is in general not expected under a Poisson , as explained in the DHARMa vignette or here ; and seing deviance residuals (or any other standard residuals) that differ from a straight line in a qqnorm plot is therefore in general no concern at all . The DHARMa package provides a qq plot that is reliable for diagnosing deviations from Poisson or other GLM families. I have created an example that demonstrates the problem with the deviance residuals here .
