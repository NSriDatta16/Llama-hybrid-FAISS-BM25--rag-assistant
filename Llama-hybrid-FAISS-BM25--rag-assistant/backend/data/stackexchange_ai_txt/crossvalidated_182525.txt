If we do not know the normalizing constant for a posterior distribution, why does it imply we can only sample dependent draws?

I read in a pdf here: MCMC - Harvard that (pg. 8) Suppose we want to draw from our posterior distribution $p(\theta|y)$ , but we cannot sample independent draws from it. For example, we often do not know the normalizing constant. I was wondering why not knowing the normalizing constant implies that we can only sample dependent draws. Furthermore, if we knew the normalizing constant, what makes it imply we can sample independent draws?
