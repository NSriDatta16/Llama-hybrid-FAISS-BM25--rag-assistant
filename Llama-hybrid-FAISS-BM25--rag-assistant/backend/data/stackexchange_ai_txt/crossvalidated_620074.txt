Why do matrices of simulation data generated in R create strongly related latent variables?

When creating examples of matrices for CFA in R for students, I still have a problem with getting data that looks realistic - specifically, that between latent variables I often have covariance path coefficients greater than 1 (standardized!) which just seems unrealistic. Let's consider an example: library(lavaan) library(simstudy) library(lavaanPlot) samples = 1000 number_of_items = 21 number_of_factors = 3 correlation = 0.5 # generate "equal" array of correlations sigma And now we have latent variables related to each other at a standardized coefficient of 1 or greater : Importantly, the selected model is only one of the possibilities of specifying the model, but the same problem will occur for most of the possible model arrangements - you can increase/decrease the number of items, you can increase/decrease the number of latent variables, you can swap them, you can change the number of cases, or even transpose variables to Likert scales (as for CFA standardized questionnaires) and the problem will still be the same. (Of course, the model can be specified so that not all latent variables are related to each other, but I am interested in the validation of measurement tools that usually assume that relationships between all latent variables should be checked.) I've also checked these fit factors in SPSS AMOS and other programs and they are exactly the same, so I suspect it's not Lavaan's fault, just some kind of data problem. So I have questions : What does it mean for this specific data that the path coefficients are greater than or very close to 1? In many places on internet forums there are advice to "explore data", but here we all have simulation data ready and no matter how many times the process is repeated (draw a new data matrix) the problem is still the same. Why does generated data behave this way and real data collected from research do not? I mean any database in which there is a matrix of the same number of variables with a similar average level of correlation. (I'm not attaching the data because it's not really possible here). So - at first glance, we have similar data, the same number of cases, the same variable ranges, the same average correlations between items, and in the case of real data, this problem practically does not occur to me. Does this mean that the simulated data is somehow different from the real data and that the simulations performed on them are not realistic?
