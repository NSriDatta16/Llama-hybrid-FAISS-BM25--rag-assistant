I'm not sure I fully understand. The package has already been thoroughly tested under several Windows accounts, and it does find all the files and rename all the files. Under the Agent, it does absolutely nothing visible, but takes five minutes to do it. NO permissions errors or any other errors. I didn't mention that an earlier attempt DID get permissions errors because we had failed to give the service acount access to the input and output directories. I cannot log in as the service account to try that because I do not have a pasword for it. But sa isd job owner so it should be able to switch to the service account--and the access errors we got ten days ago show that it can. The package itself has not changed in those ten days. We just deleted the job in order to do a complete "dress rehearsal" of deployment procedure. So what has changed, I presume, is some detail in the deployment procedure, which unfortunately was not in source control at the time it succeeded.
