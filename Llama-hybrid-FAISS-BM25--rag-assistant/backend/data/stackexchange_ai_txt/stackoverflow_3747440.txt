Does it matter which point you choose as the start when connecting a control to an action? No. Big Nerd Ranch recommends always dragging from sender to receiver (outlet to object or control to target) to make clear which direction the message(s) will go in. It's equally valid to drag in the other direction, but does not reinforce the message direction to new Cocoa and Cocoa Touch programmers. (To be clear, that blog is authored by a former BNR class attendee, not by BNR or anyone working for BNR.) After the First Name editable box is connected to the action the text directs the reader to also connect the Last Name and Email editable boxes to the same action. However in these cases the text directs the reader to start the control-drag operation from the small circle to the right side of the textFieldChanged action in the black window of the controller instance and to end at the Last Name and Email editable boxes. This seems opposite to how I understand the general rule of starting at the control while setting an action. One advantage of the right-click-on-action-receiver-and-drag-from-the-actions way is that it's easier to connect a bunch of actions at once. That sounds like the best reason for the tutorial making an exception there, aside from just being by a different author or authors (I'm guessing) with a different way of doing things.
