Tool for response time analysis on JBoss server?

I am running a pretty high traffic cluster of JBoss servers serving REST requests and I am interested in tools reading the access logs in Tomcat format (with %D parameter) to provide a detailed analysis of the response time on a per-call basis. Ideally this tool would generate a chart showing the progression of the response time throughout the day, hour per hour, then a weekly view with averages on the day, and monthly with average on the weeks (CACTI style). I've looked for such tools and couldn't find anything. Is any of you guys aware of something close to that before I start writing my own? I haven't looked into CACTI extensions yet, but that be an option?
