How can I remove index.php from the address while redirect requests to index.php via fastcgi?

I have a basic Magento (PHP app, using index.php as the controller) setup on an Ubuntu server. I configured NGINX to use PHP-CGI to serve all PHP pages. While the site is working as expected, all the URLs are of the form: http://domain.com/index.php/apparel/shoes.html Is there a way to use the nginx rewrite setting so that I can have the URLs like this instead: http://domain.com/apparel/shoes.html Currently, this is what I have in the configuration file to handle page requests: # catch rewritten and standard URLs location ~* ^(/index.php)?(.*) { include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; fastcgi_index index.php; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/index.php$1; fastcgi_read_timeout 600; } Thanks.
