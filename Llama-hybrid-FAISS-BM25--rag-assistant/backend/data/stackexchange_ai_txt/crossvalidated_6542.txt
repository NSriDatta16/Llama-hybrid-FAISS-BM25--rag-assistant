E.T. Jaynes "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science: Principles and Elementary Applications Vol 1", Cambridge University Press, 2003 is pretty much a must-read for the Bayesian side of statistics, at about the right level. I'm looking forward to recommendations for the frequentist side of things (I have loads of monographs, but very few good general texts).
