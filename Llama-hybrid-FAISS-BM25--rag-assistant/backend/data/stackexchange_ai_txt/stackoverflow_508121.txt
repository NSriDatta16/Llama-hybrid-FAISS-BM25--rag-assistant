Don't use regular expressions to validate e-mail addresses Instead, from mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list 1 written by Ben Finney. The best advice I've seen when people ask "How do I validate whether an email address is valid?" was "Try sending mail to it". It's both Pythonic, and truly the best way. If you actually want to confirm, don't try to validate it statically; use the email address, and check the result. Send an email to that address, and don't use it any further unless you get a reply saying "yes, this is the right address to use" from the recipient. The sending system's mail transport agent, not regular expressions, determines which part is the domain to send the mail to. The domain name system, not regular expressions, determines what domains are valid, and what host should receive mail for that domain. Most especially, the receiving mail system, not regular expressions, determines what local-parts are valid. 1 This is original link before it went dead
