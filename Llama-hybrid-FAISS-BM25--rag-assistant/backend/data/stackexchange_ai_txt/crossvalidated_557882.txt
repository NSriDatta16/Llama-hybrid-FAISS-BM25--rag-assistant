One advantage of decision tree is that it can be used to explain a single prediction, by following the prediction process which mimics that of a human being. Logistic regression does not have this property. When you build a logistic regression model, it is a global model that represents all your data and it cannot explain a single prediction as decision tree does. If you want to stick with logistic regression, but have the possibility to explain a single prediction, you may consider post-hoc explainability technique, e.g. LORE( https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10820 ), which builds a tree locally around the sample you want to explain. While post-hoc technique is normally intended for blackbox models, it can also provide explanation for a single prediction from your logistic regression.
