Google brought me here, and I dislike how the comments just assume everyone knows that FA and PCA are related. So to answer your question: yes . See Tipping and Bishop, Probabilistic principal component analysis , 1996 . This paper is great because: It discusses the connection between FA and PCA (Section 2.2) It discusses using the SVD to compute the ML parameters (Appendix A)
