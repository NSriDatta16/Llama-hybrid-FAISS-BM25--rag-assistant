Dynamic form submission using javascript - how to elegant code?

Here is the problem: My page displays a set of items. Each item has a check box associated to it (which is part of a form). User might check any of these check boxes and press 'Delete' button. The same page also has a 'Upload' button which would upload an excel sheet of items. At the moment, my form action sumbits to say : "xyzAction" and I have two different handlers (analogous to Struts Action) - one for deletion of stores and other for uploading stores. I am told that the best way to do this is to rely on javascript by doing one of these: 1)) Switching form action on press of upload and delete buttons - there by invoke different actions. 2) Use a hidden variable "act" to set it to delete / upload and submit to a single form. The server side action would take care of identifying the act and forwarding to the corresponding action. Approach (1) - seems very inelegant to me. Playing with form action seems unnecessary. Approach (2) - would obviously not work if your javascript is turned off and is not very elegant either. There must be a third way to doing this?, which would make me happy?
