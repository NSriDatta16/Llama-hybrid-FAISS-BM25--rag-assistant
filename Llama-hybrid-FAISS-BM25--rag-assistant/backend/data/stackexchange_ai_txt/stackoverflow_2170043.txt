R: apt-get install r-cran-foo vs. install.packages("foo")

When installing R packages (say mcmcpack in this example) under Ubuntu I have the choice between the following two methods of installation: # Let the distribution's packaging system take care of installation/upgrades apt-get install r-cran-mcmcpack # Let R take care of installation/upgrades install.packages("mcmcpack") Questions: Is any of the two ways of installing R packages considered "best practice"? Assume that I first install.packages("mcmcpack") and later on apt-get install r-cran-mcmcpack - should I expect trouble? Assume that I first apt-get install r-cran-mcmcpack and later on install.packages("mcmcpack") - should I expect trouble?
