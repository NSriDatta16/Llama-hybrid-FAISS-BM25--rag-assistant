"framework of views" If you are in early stages of this task then i would encourage you to drop this idea of "framework of views". While its true that it hides alot of complexity to some extent only at the cost of performance. And if you have nested views, you will have lot of problems going forward. Go to any SQL Server forums and look for nested views performance issues and you will see the pain. One of the problems is some predicates are NOT pushed down correctly and efficiently as it would have been on the actual tables. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bartd/archive/2006/08/14/select-from-a-view-slower-than-equivalent-select-from-the-base-table.aspx Indexed views solve some problems effectively but not in all cases and comes with lot of restrictions. If the readwrite ratio is less then you will have more performance issues. I have used indexed views effectively in some cases to drop the IO significantly [tens of thousands logical IOs to single digit IOs] but those had high read to write ratio. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc917715.aspx
