What hardware are you running on? Can you use platform-specific optimizations (like vectorization)? Can you get a better compiler? E.g. switch from GCC to Intel? Can you make your algorithm run in parallel? Can you reduce cache misses by reorganizing data? Can you disable asserts? Micro-optimize for your compiler and platform. In the style of, "at an if/else, put the most common statement first"
