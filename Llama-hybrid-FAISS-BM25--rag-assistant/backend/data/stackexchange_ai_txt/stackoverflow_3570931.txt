jetty via apache mod_proxy

Using an Apache virtualhost and mod_proxy I want to access a java application (myapp) available in a jetty instance on port 8080. With ProxyPass / localhost:8080/ on my apache virtualhost configuration I can access the application running in jetty with www.mydomain.com/myapp but I want the application to be accessed from www.mydomain.com. Trying with ProxyPass / localhost:8080/myapp The application cannot be found because the request becomes www.mydomain.com/myappmyapp/. Then tried with: ProxyPass localhost:8080/myapp/ SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1 SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1 I can access the application but just for the first request. Subsequent requests become www.mydomain.com/myappmyapp/ After reading many times wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/Apache and the apache mod_proxy docs the only way I managed to use the application properly from www.mydomain.com is with the following configuration: ProxyPass localhost:8080/myapp/ SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1 SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1 ProxyPass localhost:8080/myapp/ SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1 SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1 so the request is forwarded to the jetty application in both cases. I am quite new to apache and jetty and I am pretty sure there is a better and more elegant way of achieving the same result. In fact apache complains saying: [warn] worker localhost:8080/myapp/ already used by another worker
