How do applications collect statistics?

I need to collect statistics from my server application written in python. I am looking for some general guidance on how to setup models and exactly how to store the statistics information. I was thinking of storing and organizing all this information in a database, but my implementation is turning out to be too specific. I need to collect stats like active users, requests processed and things like that over time. Are there any guides or techniques out there to create some more generic statistics storage systems?
