As @Brandmaier said, OpenMx will do the trick. But almost any other SEM software (except, AFAIK, Amos) will do. I'd use Lavaan within R, but Mplus is also widely used. You can convince yourself by running a logistic regression, then running an equivalent analysis in your SEM software of choice, and seeing if you get the same answer (you should).
