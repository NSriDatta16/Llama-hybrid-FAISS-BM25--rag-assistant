VS 2010: unable to unit test

I posted this on MSDN as well but this community usually is much more helpful: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vsunittest/thread/9a2717c7-4d24-4940-b5be-2bc3df6d7c7d In a nutshell, VS refuses to start the testing agent. The machine is restarted to make sure nothing is in its memory. In other words, VSPerfMon is NOT running and hasn't been run prior. Any help is welcome.
