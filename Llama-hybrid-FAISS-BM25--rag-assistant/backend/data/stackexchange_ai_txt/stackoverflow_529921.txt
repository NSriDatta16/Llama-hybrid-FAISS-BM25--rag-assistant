Guide in organizing large Django projects

Anyone could recommend a good guide/tutorial/article with tips/guidelines in how to organize and partition a large Django project? I'm looking for advices in what to do when you need to start factorizing the initial unique files (models.py, urls.py, views.py) and working with more than a few dozens of entities.
