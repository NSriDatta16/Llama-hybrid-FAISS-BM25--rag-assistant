Apologies if I'm oversimplifying your question, but are you asking how to define an Objective-C method? If so, you're going to have to learn Objective-C, there's no way around it: The Objective-C Programming Language - Object Messaging You can do a lot of great things with no code on the iPhone and Mac platforms, but it's hard to imagine completing any useful application without writing some code. Example - (float)multiplyThisFloatByTwoPointFive:(float)numberToMultiply { return numberToMultiply * 2.5; } To call it: [self multiplyThisFloatByTwoPointFive:3.7]; Libraries If you mean "I want to put these non-class-specific methods somewhere I can access them universally", eg, a library, you can do this in two ways: Create some sort of "library" class like "MySpecialMathClass" (not to be confused with "my special education math class") or "MyAppAnimationTricks" and put your methods there (you'd define them as +someMethod: not -someMethod:, class- not instance-method, per Objective-C). If they only ever deal with primitives (such as int, float, double ...), consider just making them C functions, rather than Objective-C methods.
