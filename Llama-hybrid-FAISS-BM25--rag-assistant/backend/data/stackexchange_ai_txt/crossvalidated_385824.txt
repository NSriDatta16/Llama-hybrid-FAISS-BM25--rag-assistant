Softmax distributes the 'probability' 0-1 between the available classes. It does not express incertitude, it is not a PDF function. If you want to express the incertitude you should be looking into bayesian neural networks. Have a look at this paper: Uncertainty in Deep Learning Some rather recent probability frameworks: Tensorflow probability Edward Pyro pytorch Interesting keynote talk by Zoubin Ghahramani (University of Cambridge) Have a look at this paper: Mixture Density Networks : I guess you can implement it and add as a final layer to CONVNET. If you do implement it don't forget sharing is caring ;-) Good luck
