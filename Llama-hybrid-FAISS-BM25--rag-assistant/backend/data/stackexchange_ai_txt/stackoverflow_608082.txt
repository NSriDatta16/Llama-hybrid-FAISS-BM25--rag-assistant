convert vector of strings/doubles to arrays

I am using matheval library. Its functions take c-style parameters, for example: #include char * evaluator_evaluate(void * evaluator, int count, char **names, double *values); In my case, I want to convert std::vector of names and std::vector of values to char ** and double * Also, every name correspond to a unique value, and there could be repetitions. What is the best way to arrange names and values elegantly in terms of data structures? For now, I use vectors, and both contains repetitions. Edit Please keep in mind that order of names and values matters and should match. Thanks
