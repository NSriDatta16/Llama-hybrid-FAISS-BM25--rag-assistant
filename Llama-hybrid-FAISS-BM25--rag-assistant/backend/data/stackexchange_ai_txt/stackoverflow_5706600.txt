PHP, deleting a category from unlimited category table

I would like to know what is the best way to achieve deleting a category (with all sub categories) from unlimited category table. I was planing to go with; Delete the category and sub-categories. Since it is unlimited category system, in the end run another function to clear categories which has no parent_id records in the table. Is there any other, preferably more elegant way to achieve this? Edit: My category table's structure array(8) { ["id"]=> NULL ["parent_id"]=> NULL ["siteID"]=> NULL ["memberGroups"]=> NULL ["name"]=> NULL ["language"]=> NULL ["protectDelete"]=> NULL ["typeID"]=> NULL } Thank you for your time and concern.
