The following MySQL regex string will match all the html tags, so you can strip them out " ]" + -- Match any character that is NOT a “>” "*" + -- Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy) ">" -- Match the character “>” literally OR I know this does not answer your question directly, but if you have access to scripting languages, they normal have built in functions for stripping html tags from text. eg. in php you can do this... $htmltext = ' Test paragraph. Other text '; $plaintext = strip_tags($text); // or use regex... $result = preg_replace('/ ]*>/i', '', $text); http://php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php
