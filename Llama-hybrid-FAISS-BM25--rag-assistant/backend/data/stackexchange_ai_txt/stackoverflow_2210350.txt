Once upon a time I did something like this. I allocated a rage of control ids (not used in resource.h). Added controls with these ids dynamically to the page. To handle the event I took over the OnCommand on the Windows and listened for controls with ids in the range I was looking for. (I need to search old code to be more specific)
