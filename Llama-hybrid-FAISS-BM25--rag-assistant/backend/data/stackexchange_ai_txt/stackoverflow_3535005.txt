You often find this type of coding in Data-Driven Programming design patterns. This is handy when you want to include several times the same file (the Data ) but where macros are substituted with different code or other data. Let's assume some attributes and there respective types: /// @file data.h my_attribute(color, int) my_attribute(volume, float) The coding part can use data without even needing to know the quantity. As an example, let's print some information. /// @file main.c void help() { #define my_attibute(name,type) cout (note the #name is used to get the text string "color" instead of a value color ) This way your code is independent from data . Edit: fix typo and english sentence according to @RBerteig
