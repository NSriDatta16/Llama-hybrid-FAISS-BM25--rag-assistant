How to work around Twitter OAuth?

I've been pushing stuff from our website to our company twitter account automatically. Like some news updates, updates to some sections of our site, etc ... It's all been happening automatically using the Zend Framekwork Twitter service, or other very simple php code that uses a username/password hardcoded. Now, Twitter killed the old fashion authentication. Which is the right thing to do when offering twitter integration to customers (which use OAuth for user-centric stuff), but for internal stuff, isn't that overkill? Is there an easy way to update my code to make it work again? Can I somehow hard code an oauth authentication key of some sort so that I don't have to create a whole login process with database storage for a single-user application?
