I haven't used klocwork, but it should be able to find unreachable code. A static analysis tool (Klocwork) can only find code that can never possibly be reached, it won't find code that never is reached in practice. There are other tools that you can run to determine the code coverage at run time, as the product is put through a wide variety of use cases. These vary depending on the platform you are running, and they instrument code (which can cause performance issues in very sensitive code).
