You can try with many other methods such as: random forests (RF) support vector machines GAMs etc. If you use R, you might consider reading this book http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/user2014/ , which comes with a great R package. Personally, I love RF, they work just as good as most of available methods$^1$ and are very easy to tune. $^1$ For a comparison study on classification problems, see Fernández-Delgado et al. (2014) Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems? JMLR 15 , pp. 3133−3181. PDF
