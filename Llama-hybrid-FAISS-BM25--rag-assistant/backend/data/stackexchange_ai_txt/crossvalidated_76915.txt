In PCA you want to describe the data in fewer variables. You can get the same information in fewer variables than with all the variables. For example, hours studied and test score might be correlated and we do not have to include both. In your example, let's say your objective is to measure how "good" a student/person is. Looking at all these variables, it can be confusing to see how to do this. PCA allows us to clearly see which students are good/bad. If the first principal component explains most of the variation of the data, then this is all we need. You would find the correlation between this component and all the variables. "Large" correlations signify important variables. For example, the first component might be strongly correlated with hours studied and test score. So high values of the first component indicate high values of study time and test score.
