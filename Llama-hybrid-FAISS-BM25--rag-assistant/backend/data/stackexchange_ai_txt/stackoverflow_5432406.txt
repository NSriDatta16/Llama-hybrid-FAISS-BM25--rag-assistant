Getting 404 with Socket.IO

Finally set up my node instance running on a dedicated ip alongside my apache server. I just began setting up socket.io and everything is working well, server+client communicating. However it seems that one of the dependencies never loads: "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://.../socket.io/lib/vendor/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf " Has anyone encountered this before? How do I fix it? Thanks
