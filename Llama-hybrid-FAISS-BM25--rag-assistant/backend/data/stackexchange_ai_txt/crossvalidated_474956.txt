As other comments have pointed out Bonferroni correction is not the right way to control for dependent grouping factors. You would use such a correction if you ran multiple models and want to account for multiple testing. Try using a mixed effects logistic regression (= generalized linear mixed model) from the lme4 package. It will allow you to account for the correlations between individual birds and their baseline parasite risk: lme4::glmer(parasites ~ water_temp + salinity + (1|bird) where bird gives a unique identifier for each bird and his observations throughout the seasons. A tutorial for such analysis can be found here . An alternative would be to do time-to-event analysis , which wouldn't only evaluate whether birds have parasites but also the time they remain free from parasites. For this you should look into Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying coefficients . You would also have to format your data differently.
