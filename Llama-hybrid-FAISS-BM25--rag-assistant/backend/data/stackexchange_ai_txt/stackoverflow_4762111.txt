I can't tell if you're trying to connect your navigation controller directly to your window, just from a second XIB (which should work) or if you're making your navigation controller a subview of another view, which won't work. UINavigationController is only intended to be used as either the primary subview of a UIWindow or as a subview of a UITabController . Apple doesn't want you embedding a navigation controller in other contexts. See Combined View Controller Interfaces in the View Controller Programming Guide for more details.
