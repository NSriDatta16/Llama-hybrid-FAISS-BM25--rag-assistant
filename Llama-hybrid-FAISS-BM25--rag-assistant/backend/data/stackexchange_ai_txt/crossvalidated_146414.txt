It appears you have estimated a relation $$ \ln Y = a_0 + a_1(X_1/Z_1) + a_2 \ln X_2$$ so $$a_2 = \frac {\partial \ln Y}{\partial \ln X_2}$$ By treating partial differentials as quantities (I won't tell if you don't) We have $$\frac {\partial \ln Y}{\partial \ln X_2} = \frac {\partial \ln Y}{\partial \ln X_2}\cdot \frac {1}{\partial X_2/\partial X_2} = \frac {\partial \ln Y}{\partial X_2}\cdot \frac {1}{\partial \ln X_2/\partial X_2}$$ $$=\frac {1}{Y}\frac {\partial Y}{\partial X_2} \cdot \frac {1}{1/X_2} = \frac {\partial Y}{\partial X_2} \cdot \frac {X_2}{Y} = \frac {\partial Y/\partial X_2}{Y/X_2}$$ The last expression is the definition of point elasticity (the ratio of "marginal over the average"), and for small changes in $X_2$, it approximates the more general definition of elasticity expressed as $$\frac {\text {% Δ in Y}}{\text{% Δ in}\, X_2}$$ In your case therefore $$\frac {\text {% Δ in Y}}{\text{% Δ in}\, X_2} = a_2 = 0.049$$ then, if $\text{% Δ in}\, X_2 =0.01$ we have $$\text {% Δ in Y} = 0.049 \times 0.01 = 0.00049 = 0.049\%$$ So the second paper is correct (the change in $Y$ is ~"five basis points", as a banker would say).
