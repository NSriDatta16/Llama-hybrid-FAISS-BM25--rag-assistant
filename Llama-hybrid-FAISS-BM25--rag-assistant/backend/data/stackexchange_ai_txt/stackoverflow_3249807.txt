Most of the $_SERVER variables are attacker controlled (remote_addr is pulled directly from the tcp socket and there for cannot be spoofed or otherwise tampered with). However an attacker can change the user-agent to anything. Don't re-invent the wheal. session_start() and the $_SESSION super-global is secure, easy to implement and robust. To use this you should always call session_start() in a header file for all pages. if(!$_SESSION[logged_in]){ header("location: login.php"); die();//Yes php keeps executing so you need this! } then in login.php: if(login($_REQUEST[user],$_REQUEST[password])){ $_SESSION[logged_in]=true; }
