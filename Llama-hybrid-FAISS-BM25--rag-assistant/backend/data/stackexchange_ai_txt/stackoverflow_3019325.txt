XSD applies to the whole DOM document but not DOM fragment. However, as your fragment is also valid XML, why not copy it to another DOM object as the root? You can leverage appendChild or cloneNode to achive this and then validate the new DOM. By the way, if you want to validate a specified DOM fragment, validateNode method is there for you.
