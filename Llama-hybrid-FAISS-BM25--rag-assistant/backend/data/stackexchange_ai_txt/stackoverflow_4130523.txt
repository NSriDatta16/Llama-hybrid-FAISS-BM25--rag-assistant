Validating polynomials from a String

I'm trying to make a polynomial operator (sum, rest, multiplication and division of two or more polynomials). The code must be in Java and using linked lists. I was wondering how do calculators or how to validate whether a polynomial is valid or not. I want to construct a polynomial from a String, but I don't know if there is another class that can ease things. This is a homework assignment so I'm not asking for complete code, just something that points me in a good direction. There are two classes, one for nodes (named Monomio) and one for the list (named Polinomio, is the sum of monomials). The node class has Monomio siguienteMonomio; // The next monomial int exponente; // I don't know how to say this in English, maybe power int coeficiente; // The coefficient // A bunch of methods, to sum, multiply etc. and the list class has Monomio primerMonomio; //First Monomial Monomio ultimoMonomio; //Last Monomial // A bunch of methods, like organize the polynomial by the power, multiply, sum, etc. Now I need a constructor like this. public Polinomio(String polinomio){ enter code here } The user should enter something like this: 10x^2 - 7x + 9 So the constructor makes a list of three nodes: //First node int coeficiente = 10; int exponente = 2; Monomio siguienteMonomio = //secondNode //Second node int coeficiente = -7; int exponente = 1; Monomio siguienteMonomio = //thirdNode //Third node int coeficiente = 9; int exponente = 0; Monomio siguienteMonomio = null; So, any ideas of how to make this? I can simply track specific characters (+ - ^ x). But that would be long and maybe there is a better way to do.
