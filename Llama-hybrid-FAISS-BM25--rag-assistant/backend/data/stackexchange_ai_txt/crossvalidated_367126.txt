The paradox is one of measure theory and conditioning rather than one of Bayesian inference (and thus you should modify the title of the question). To quote Andrei Kolmogorov, " The concept of a conditional probability with regard to an isolated hypothesis whose probability equals 0 is inadmissible. " When one defines the density $f$ of the random variable $X$, it can indeed be anything including the null function on any set $A\subset(-1,1)$ of measure zero. However, it seems to me that the easiest explanation is that one cannot choose the set $A$ a posteriori , that is once $X$ or $|X|$ is observed to be $x$, so that $x\in A$. Meaning that the actual observation $x$ (or more precisely the actual realisation $x$ of the random variable $X$) has probability zero to belong to $A$. When setting $$\mathbb{P}[X=0.5 \, |\, |X|=0.5]=\frac{\mathbb{P}[|X|=0.5 \,|\, X=0.5] \, f(0.5)}{f(0.5)+f(-0.5)}=\frac{ f(0.5)}{f(0.5)+f(-0.5)}$$ (a) the first equality is an incorrect application of Bayes' formula for sets, since the sets are of measure zero and (b) conditioning on the set of measure zero $\{\omega;|X(\omega)|=0.5\}$ is to be understood, rather than as a conditional probability, as setting the value of the function$$\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_{X=|X|}||X|=x]$$ at $x=0.5$, which is not uniquely defined since the only constraint is the definition of conditional expectations as $$\mathbb{P}[X=|X|]=\mathbb{E}\{\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_{X=|X|}||X|]\}$$
