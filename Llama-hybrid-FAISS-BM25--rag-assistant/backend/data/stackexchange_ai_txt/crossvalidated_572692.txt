What to do with time series model, if residuals are autocorrelated for a certain lag?

I'm doing a time series forecast (with hourly data), and after plotting the autocorrelation of the residuals, I get a bigger value for every 24th lag (the pikes in the picture). I tried to include the 24th lag of the dependent variable in the model, but no change. What are my options in this case, if I want to remove the autocorrelation between the residuals?
