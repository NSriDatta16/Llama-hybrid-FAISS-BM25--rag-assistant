Nothing happens after starting a Java Web start app

I've never done a Java Web start application before. I wrote my app's JNLP files and published them along with all the JARs to my Web server. However, after getting the initial splash screen where JWS loads the libraries, nothing happens. Do you have any suggestions on how to debug this, perhaps get some console output? I've tried cleaning the cache through "javaws -uninstall" but it doesn't help. Any suggestion is appreciated.
