imputation via propensity score matching

I have a propensity score matching / data imputation question. The purpose of the propensity score modeling is to put subjects from two different clinical trials on a similar footing so that a key clinical measurement from one study can be attributed / imputed to the other study. The goal is NOT to directly compare the two studies, so this is a very atypical kind of propensity score usage. My question to this List is more about data modeling philosophy than computer syntax &etc. Here is the data setup: Dataset A for Clinical Trial A Represents data from clinical trial A Two arms, ‘ACTIVE’ and ‘PLACEBO’ The active drug is the same as with Clinical Trial B The trial design is very similar to Clinical Trial B One measurement is a clinical continuous measure obtained via laboratory assay Number of randomized subjects = 500 A subset of the baseline covariates is identical to a subset of the baseline covariates in Clinical Trial B Dataset B for Clinical Trial B Represents data from clinical trial B Two arms, ‘ACTIVE’ and ‘PLACEBO’ The active drug is the same as with Clinical Trial A The trial design is very similar to Clinical Trial A Does NOT have the clinical continuous measure that is available in Clinical Trial A Number of randomized subjects = 5000 A subset of the baseline covariates is identical to a subset of the baseline covariates in Clinical Trial A Primary endpoint is time-to-event Here is the analysis setup: I have separately split Dataset A and Dataset B into ‘ACTIVE’ and ‘PLACEBO’ subjects. For the ‘PLACEBO’ subjects I have entered the baseline covariate subsets into an appropriate logistic regression procedure. The outcome variable is a factor variable representing Clinical Trial A = ‘Y’, so the estimated propensity scores are the estimated probabilities that a ‘PLACEBO’ subject is from Clinical Trial A. I then, finally, use the %GMATCH algorithm (posted on Mayo Clinic website, implementation of the Greedy algorithm) in SAS to match 1-to-many where the Clinical Trial A subjects are thought of as ‘case’ subjects and the Clinical Trial B subjects are thought of as ‘control’ subjects. The average number of Clinical Trial B subjects matched to a single Clinical Trial A subject is approximately 5. I have done a similar analysis for the ‘ACTIVE’ subjects. Here is my question: At the end, I will combine the Clinical Trial B matched ‘PLACEBO’ and ‘ACTIVE’ subjects and perform a Cox PH regression to compare ‘PLACEBO’ and ‘ACTIVE’ – there will be no Clinical Trial A subjects in this analysis. I want to incorporate the clinical continuous measurement “borrowed” from Clinical Trial A as a covariate. When doing this, how should I best take into account the 1-to-many matching? Do I need to weight the Clinical Trial B subjects, or can I simply enter the matched Clinical Trial B subjects into a Cox PH regression and ignore the 1-to-many issue?
