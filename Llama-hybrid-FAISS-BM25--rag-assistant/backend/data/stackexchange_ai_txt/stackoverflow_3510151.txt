Calling LowLevelKeyboardProcedure in DLL

I've managed to get input hooks working, but now I'm kinda lost with putting them into a library. I have a simple header with INPUTHOOK_EXPORTS defined in the IDE, so the dll exports (Visual Studio). #pragma once #ifdef INPUTHOOK_EXPORTS #define INPUTHOOK_API __declspec(dllexport) #else #define INPUTHOOK_API __declspec(dllimport) #endif INPUTHOOK_API void InstallInputHook(); INPUTHOOK_API void RemoveInputHook(); and of course: The cpp file The thing is, when I try to compile this library, I get two unresolved externals, one for SetWindowsHookEx and for UnhookWindowsHookEx respectively. Why these two functions are not available, while others are and without any problem? As far as I see, I do have the includes right. Thank you
