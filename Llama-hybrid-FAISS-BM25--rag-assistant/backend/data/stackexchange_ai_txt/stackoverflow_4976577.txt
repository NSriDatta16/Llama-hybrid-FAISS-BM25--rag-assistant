MATLAB does not support multiclass SVM at the moment. You could use svmtrain (2-classes) to achieve this, but it would be much easier to use a standard SVM package. I have used LIBSVM and can confirm that it's very easy to use. %%# Your data D = [ 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 5 0 0 2 6 4 1 0 3 3 8 1 7 2 6 4 2 9 1 7 10 3]; %%# For clarity Attributes = D(:,1:4); Classes = D(:,5); train = [1 3 5 6]; test = [2 4]; %%# Train model = svmtrain(Classes(train),Attributes(train,:),'-s 0 -t 2'); %%# Test [predict_label, accuracy, prob_estimates] = svmpredict(Classes(test), Attributes(test,:), model);
