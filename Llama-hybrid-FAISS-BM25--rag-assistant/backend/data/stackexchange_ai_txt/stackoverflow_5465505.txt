Sliding Window Average For Multiple Time Periods - SQL Server

I have a SQL query that returns the average time to signup for our users who signed up in the last 30 days: select avg(datediff(dd, acquisitiontime,createdate)) from users where createdate > getdate() - 30 and acquisitionmedium = 'cpc' and acquisitionsource = 'google' and acquisitiontime is not null I want to watch how this has changed over time. How do I change this query so that I can spit out a table with (Month, Avg Time to Signup for that Month)?
