Appropriate GLM when response variable is proportion, but not binomial

The response variable I'm dealing with is the proportion of a total area that is suitable habitat for a species of interest. So although the response variable is bounded between 0 and 1, my intuition is that it wouldn't be appropriate to call it binomial since the numerator and denominator of the proportion are non-integer. The beta distribution comes to mind, but I'm uncertain of the appropriate link function and whether there tools in R to deal with a beta. Some background on my eventual goal: I'll likely be pursuing a conditional autoregressive model to account for spatial autocorrelation. I'll be treating space as 1-dimensional since I'm dealing with a river system, and so each observational unit only has two neighbors: one upstream and downstream. I'll be working in R and JAGS/BUGS if I decide to go Bayesian.
