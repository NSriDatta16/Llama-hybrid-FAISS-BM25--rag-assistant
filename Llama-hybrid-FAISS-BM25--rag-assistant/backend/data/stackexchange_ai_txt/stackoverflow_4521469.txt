You can do this by removing empty lines first and appending line space with G command: sed '/^$/d;G' text.txt Edit2: the above command will add empty lines between each paragraph, if this is not desired, you could do: sed -n '1{/^$/p};{/./,/^$/p}' Or, if you don't mind that all leading empty lines will be stripped, it may be written as: sed -n '/./,/^$/p' since the first expression just evaluates the first line, and prints it if it is blank. Here: -n option suppresses pattern space auto-printing, /./,/^$/ defines the range between at least one character and none character (i.e. empty space between newlines) and p tells to print this range.
