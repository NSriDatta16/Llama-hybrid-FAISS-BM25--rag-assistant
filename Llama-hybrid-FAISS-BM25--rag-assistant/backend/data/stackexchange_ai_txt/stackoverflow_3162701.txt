You need to provide more information about the source of the text (the web? user input?), the domain (is it just clothes?), the potential formatting and vocabulary... Assuming worst case scenario you need to start learning NLP. A very good free book is the documentation of NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/book . It is also a very good introduction to Python and the SW is free (for various usages). Be warned: NLP is hard. It doesn't always work. It is not fun at times. The state of the art is no where near where you imagine it is. Assuming a better scenario (your text is semi-structured) - a good free tool is pyparsing . There is a book, plenty of examples and the resulting code is extremely attractive. I hope this helps...
