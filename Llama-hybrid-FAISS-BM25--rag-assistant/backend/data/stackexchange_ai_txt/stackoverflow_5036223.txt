Connecting to a database

I'm trying to connect to a database but nothing I try works. SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(@"Data Source=C:\Users\Gerard Foley\Desktop\Northwind.sdf"); conn.Open(); No matter what I try I just get the error: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified) I stole the connection string from Database Explorer -> Properties -> Connection String. What am I missing? I can get the tables to show up in a DataGridView fine (by dragging from Data Sources), but I want to use my own UI and queries. I just can't seem to figure this ADO thing out. Using c# express 2010 and sql server express 2008.
