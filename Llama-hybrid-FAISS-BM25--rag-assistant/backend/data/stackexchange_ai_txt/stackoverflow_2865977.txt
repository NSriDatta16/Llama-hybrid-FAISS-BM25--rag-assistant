Info on Seam's EntityQuery?

I've been working with Seam and JPA/Hibernate for quite some time, but have just started looking at making use of the EntityHome and EntityQuery classes more. EntityHome seems relatively straightforward in terms of what it is and how I can leverage it. But, EntityQuery is a bit less clear. I understand the ability to grab, for example, a list containing all of a given entity. However, I've also seen some examples using a RESTRICTIONS array. How exactly is this used? Are the OR conditions or AND conditions? Can anyone give me some more detailed information as to how EntityQuery is intended to be used? I've checked the few books I have on Seam and JPA, but none of them really reference the EntityQuery classes. It seems like I very useful mechanism, and I'd like to get some more use out of them if I can. Thanks!
