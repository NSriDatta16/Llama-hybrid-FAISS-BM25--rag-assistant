LINQ to SQL join when there aren't results

Given the following database structure alt text http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26791/tables.png I'm trying to write a LINQ query that will return images grouped by tags it's associated with. So far I've got this: var images = from img in db.Images join imgTags in db.ImageTags on img.idImage equals imgTags.idImage join t in db.Tags on imgTags.idTag equals t.idTag where img.OCRData.Contains(searchText.Text) group img by new { t.TagName } into aGroup select new { GroupName = aGroup.Key.TagName, Items = from x in aGroup select new ImageFragment() { ImageID = x.idImage, ScanDate = x.ScanTime } }; Which works great. However, I also want to return Images that do not have any tags associated with them in a group of "(Untagged)" or something. I can't wrap my head around how I would do this without inserting a default tag for every image and that seems like generally not a very good solution.
