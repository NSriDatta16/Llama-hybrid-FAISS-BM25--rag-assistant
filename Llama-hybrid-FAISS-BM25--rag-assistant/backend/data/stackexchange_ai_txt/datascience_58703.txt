Autoencoder is an unsupervised learning approach to compress the information/knowledge. Your knowledge is half-way there. One half - It finds the hidden attributes and prepares the compressed knowledge(Encoder). Second half it reconstructs the knowledge (Decoder). This way it will learn to reconstruct the knowledge. Hope it helps to give clarity.
