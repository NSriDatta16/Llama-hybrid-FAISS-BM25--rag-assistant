In the best cases of the EM algorithm, $Q(\theta \vert \theta^t)$ is available in closed form. In the case described by the OP this may not be the case. If $Q$ is not available in closed form did you try Stochastic EM? Stochastic EM (SEM) approximates the expectation with a Monte Carlo sample. The samples are drawn from $\Pr(Z \vert X, \theta^t)$ and $$\mathbb{E}_{Z \vert X, \theta^t}\left(log(\Pr(Z \vert X, \theta^t))\right)\approx \sum_{i=1}^N\left(log(\Pr(Z_i \vert X, \theta^t))\right).$$ In this case the estimated $Q$ function is then optimized numerically, unless the rare case when a closed form is actually available with this approximation. Using the SEM your estimated are no-longer guaranteed to be strictly increasing the $Q$ function. The sequence of estimates $\theta^{t+1} \vert \theta^t$ now form a Markov chain and some interesting probabilistic statements can be made about the stochastic evolution of the Markov chain.
