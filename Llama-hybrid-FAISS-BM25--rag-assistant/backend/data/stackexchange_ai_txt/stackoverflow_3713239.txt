A few points, in no particular order: Layouts are related to screen size and thus to large, medium, small and drawables are related to density and thus to hdpi,mdpi,ldpi. It is obvious to some and not so easy to understand to others. Read through this and create your emulator devices as specified in this page, double check to ensure you got them right. Now start with just a simple layout and test it on the default device skin, then add layout-320x480, test, repeat for other sizes. If you are using layout-large/small etc, remember to add the correct lines to AndroidManifest.xml One simple way to do this is to have a default layout.xml and drawables folder, and for different sizes have layout-320x480.xml etc folders and different densities we have drawables-hdpi etc folders. If you make sure to set android:anyDensity="false" /> in manifest file then the handset will get correct layouts and assets depending on its attributes. If you set android:anyDensity="false" /> in manifest file the handset handles the sizing of drawables, typically taking assets from drawables folder and resizing it.
