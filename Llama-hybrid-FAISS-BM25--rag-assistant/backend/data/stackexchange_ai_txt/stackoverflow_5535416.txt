How do I add link targets to Ruby mkmf?

In my Ruby extension , the code is organized into directories, with extconf.rb sitting at the root of the tree among the main library files. The problem with this setup is that all files inside directories are not being linked against my library. mkmf doesn't seem to consider them at all. How do I manually add them as link targets in mkmf ? Better question would be: is there a more flexible build system for Ruby that I can use?
