When there is a separate validation set, as commonly seen in many works employing neural networks, it's just validation, not CV. When CV is present, your validation set is not constant any more. Typically, the dataset is divided into train and test sets, and afterwards, on the entire training set, one uses cross-validation for hyper-parameter tuning, dynamically changing the validation fold and training folds. So, training set and validation set in CV is a bit intertwined. Probably, that is the reason you feel the literature seems to be using training set for hyperparameter tuning.
