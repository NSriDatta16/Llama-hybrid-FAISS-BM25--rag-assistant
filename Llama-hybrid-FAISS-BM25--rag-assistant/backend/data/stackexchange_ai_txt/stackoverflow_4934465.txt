I finally came up with a solution: A client that wants to build locally (i.e. desktop-builds) needs to install a Build Controller and Build Agent on his desktop machine. Then he needs to pick that controller for the build. In the build template, the Get activity needs to be deleted, and the Create Workspace activity needs to be replaced with a Get Workspace , to use an existing one. Finally, remove the command to copy to a drop folder. You're building locally. Not necessary. Assaf
