Below is output from compiler. It's strange that running build the second time succeeds. However I suspect the problem might be due to this error with running mt.exe which is responsible for embedding information from manifest into executable... Generating Code... link /LIBPATH:"c:\Qt\4.5.2-vc\lib" /NOLOGO /DEBUG /MANIFEST /MANIFESTFILE:"debug\formExtractor.intermediate.manifest" /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS "/MANIFESTDEPENDENCY:type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*' processorArchitecture='*'" /OUT:debug\formExtractor.exe @.\nmD932.tmp mt.exe -nologo -manifest "debug\formExtractor.intermediate.manifest" -outputresource:debug\formExtractor.exe;1 'mt.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'mt.exe' : return code '0x1' Stop. NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN\nmake.exe"' : return code '0x2' Stop. Exited with code 2. UPDATE Failing to run mt.exe during the linking process was indeed the cause of the problem. I added path to Windows SDK ( C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin ) to the PATH environment variable and I'm able to run executable now. Comments to various answers; @Shay Output txt file from sxstrace is empty. Have no idea why. However there's the following information in the application log: Faulting application formExtractor.exe, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x4a638ee1, faulting module MSVCR90D.dll, version 6.0.6002.18005, time stamp 0x49e03824, exception code 0xc0000135, fault offset 0x0006f04e, process id 0xf68, application start time 0x01ca08ba801ac5cf. Version 6.0.6002.18005? What the heck is this? @Kirill V. Lyadvinsky Dependency Walker finds msvcr90d.dll used by qtwebkit4.dll file in c:\windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc90.debugcrt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.1_none_bb1f6aa1308c35eb\MSVCR90D.DLL but doesn't find (the other version of?) msvcr90d.dll file linked directly by the executable. However DW doesn't seem to show it's version anywhere, does it? Contest of formExtractor.intermediate.manifest file From the manifest file it looks like the executable is being linked to a different version of msvcr90d.dll than the qtwebkit4.dll . What's strange is the fact that both versions of msvcr90d.dll are present in c:\windows\winsxs folder in the following sub folders x86_microsoft.vc90.debugcrt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.21022.8_none_96748342450f6aa2 and x86_microsoft.vc90.debugcrt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.1_none_bb1f6aa1308c35eb Any ideas? @knight666 I'm using Qt framework which I compiled using exactly the compiler I'm using now so I think there's no mismatch here. Additionally Dependency Walker shows the missing msvcr90d.dll file is linked directly to the executable so it's not a fault of any 3rd party library I think.
