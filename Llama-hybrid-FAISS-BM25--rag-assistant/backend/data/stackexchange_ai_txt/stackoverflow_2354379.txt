How to measure robustness?

I am working on a thesis about measuring quality of a product. The product in this case is a website. I have identified several quality attributes and measurement techniques. One quality attribute is "Robustness". I want to measure that somehow, but I can't find any useful information how to do this in an objective manner. Is there any static or dynamic metric that could measure robustness? I.e. like unit test coverage, is there a way to meassure robustness like that? If so, is there any (free) tool that can do such a thing? Does anyone have any experience with such tooling? Last but not least, perhaps there are other ways to determine robustness, if you have any ideas about that I am all ears.
