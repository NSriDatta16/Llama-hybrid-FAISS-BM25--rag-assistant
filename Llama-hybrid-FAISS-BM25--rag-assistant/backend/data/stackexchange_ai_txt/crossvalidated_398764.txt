importance sampling from posterior distribution in R

Today I read that Importance Sampling can be used to draw posterior distribution samples just like Rejection Sampling. However, my understanding of Importance Sampling is that its main purpose is to just compute expectations (ie. integrals) that would otherwise be hard to compute. How can Importance Sampling be used to draw posterior distribution samples from a Bayesian Model? I only know the posterior positive ratio up to some constant, i.e., a constant term in the normalisation.
