SQL Server FILESTREAM storage

If I have a SQL Server 2008 database that uses FILESTREAM and stores 10 terabytes of files. Must all the files reside on the same physical box (requiring a 10+ terabyte server)? Or can I store 1 terabyte on one server, another terabyte on a second server, and so on? From what I have read it appears you can only store files on a single server (remote or local)?
