A few cautions: First, PCA on a combination of continuous and categorical variables is a little tricky. It's been discussed here many times. Second, be careful about the direction of the PCs. It's possible for a PC to be the opposite direction of other PCs. Third, you are assuming that all the PCs will be about "how good an agent is". Since PCA is designed to get at separate qualities (and, if you choose an orthogonal rotation, qualities that are uncorrelated) this may not be a good assumption. Fourth, if you add up the PCs then you are weighting each of them equally. It might be better to force an analysis with a single component.
