How to implement credible 95% interval for median odds ratio using JAGS?

As described in Merlo et al ( J Epidem Comm Health 2006 ), the 95% credible interval for MOR is calculated using MCMC. MOR is defined as $\exp(\sqrt{2\sigma^2}\times 0.675)$, where $\sigma$ is the level-2 variance of the random intercept $u$ from a null model of a hierarchical logistic regression. Does anyone have an idea of how to write a program for an Markov chain Monte Carlo to calculate the standard error of the median odds ratio (MOR) using rjags ? My dependent variable is outcome(alive/dead) and the clustering (level2)variable is Hospital. There are 140 hospitals and would like to see variations in outcome between hospitals. Other risk factors will be included later as independent level1 variables.
