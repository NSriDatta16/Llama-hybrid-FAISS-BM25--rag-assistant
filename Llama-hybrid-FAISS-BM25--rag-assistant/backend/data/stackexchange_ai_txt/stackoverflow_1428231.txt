C# Reordering the Tables in a Dataset

I create a custom dataset that I pass off to a black boxed component. The dataset consists of usually 5-6 tables (with unique names assigned by me). The component takes the dataset and builds a drop down combo box based off the table names. What I am needing to do though is to change the ordering of the tables within the dataset. I need to do this so I first offer up to the user the appropriate selection in the drop down (based off what section in the application they are in). So for instance...if they are in "Section A" then that is the first table name shown in the drop down list...if the user goes to "Section F" then that is what is shown in the list first...so on and so forth. The more code intensive way is of course to just change the ordering in which I add the tables to the dataset. This would work, but I thought there had to be some way to do this more elegantly and with less code. I am working in C# with the 3.5 framework.
