Seriously, if you don't know why it's better, why do you think you're qualified to convince someone else? I don't mean to disparage you but most people arguing something would do so because they believe it to be true (presumably because of some reason or reasons), something that seems lacking in this case. I mean I could try and convince you that C# is a better language than F# but I'd be wasting my time. My knowledge of both is near-non-existent.
