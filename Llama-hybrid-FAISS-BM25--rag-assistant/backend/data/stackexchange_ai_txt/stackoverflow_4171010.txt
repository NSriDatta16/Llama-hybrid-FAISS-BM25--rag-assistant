I don't know if this is exactly what you're trying to do, but with Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs) you can draw to multiple color buffers simultaneously. Within the shader, though, it will still just be as if you're writing one fragment. That is, the shader is unaware of how many attachments the FBO has.
