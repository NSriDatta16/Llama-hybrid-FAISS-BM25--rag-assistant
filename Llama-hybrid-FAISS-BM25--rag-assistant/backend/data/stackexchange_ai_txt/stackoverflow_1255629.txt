There isn't a standard that I know of for where 3rd part plugins should go. You can define an external extension location and store your party plugins/features there. This also allows you to reuse the plugins in multiple Eclipse installs if you wish. You add an Extension location by going to Ganymede onwards: Help->Software Updates->Available Software->Add Site->Local Older versions: Help->Software Updates->Manage Configuration->Add Extension Location For Ganymede onwards, the extension locations work a bit differently (IIRC the plugins are copied to the standard Eclipse install, which kind of defeats the point),there is however a new concept called dropins that you might find useful.
