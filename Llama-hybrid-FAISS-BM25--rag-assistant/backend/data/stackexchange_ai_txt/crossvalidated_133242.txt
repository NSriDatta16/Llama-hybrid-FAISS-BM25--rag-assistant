Let's try it and see if we can figure it out. The following example is coded in R , which is free and will let you reproduce the example, but hopefully the code is self-explanatory: group1 = c(1,2,3) group2 = c(4,5,6,7,8,9) mean(group1) # 2 mean(group2) # 6.5 mean(c(group1, group2)) # 5 mean(c(mean(group1), mean(group2))) # 4.25 So what we see is that you certainly can calculate the mean of the means, but the mean of the means and the mean of all the raw data don't match. We can also try a weighted average using @BilltheLizard's suggestion to use each group's sample size as a weight (the weights are indicated with the w argument): weighted.mean(c(mean(group1), mean(group2)), w=c(3,6)) # 5 This now gives us the same answer.
