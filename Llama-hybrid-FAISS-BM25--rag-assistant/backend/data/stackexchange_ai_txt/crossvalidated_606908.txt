Elbow plot and plot of average silhouette width disagree with each other

I am fairly new to using clustering. On the data science course I am on, we recently covered agglomerative clustering and k means clustering. I have created a toy example to see if I can use R to cluster data correctly using the method of kmeans. I have created five sets of two points that are very close to each other: Obviously, we would expect to create 5 different clusters. Now, when I plot the average silhouette width, I get this plot: This agrees with what seems obvious. But when I create the elbow plot, I get something much different: This plot suggests that 2-3 clusters seems to be ideal. In this case it is obvious that the plot isn't right, but for more complicated data, how would we know?
