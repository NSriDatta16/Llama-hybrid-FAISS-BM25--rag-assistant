The conditional logistic regression model conditions out an intercept for each stratum, so the linear predictor is only determined up to a stratum-specific offset. Stata uses zero for this offset; R uses the stratum mean of the covariate (for numerical stability) So > m head(predict(mod_sim, type = 'lp')) 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.037724631 0.020958128 -0.006986043 -0.051696716 0.066367406 -0.031437192 > head(with(sim_data, coef(mod_sim)*(Open-m) )) [1] 0.037724631 0.020958128 -0.006986043 -0.051696716 0.066367406 -0.031437192 You get type="risk" just by exponentiating these With type="terms" the default centering is at the sample mean ( mod_sim$means ) rather than the stratum mean. > head(with(sim_data, coef(mod_sim)*(Open-mod_sim$means) )) [1] 0.03314235 0.01637584 -0.01156833 -0.05627900 0.04152560 -0.05627900 > head(predict(mod_sim, type = 'terms')) Open 1 0.03314235 2 0.01637584 3 -0.01156833 4 -0.05627900 5 0.04152560 6 -0.05627900 With type="expected" you're computing an absolute risk, so the intercept for each stratum has to be estimated (and the predictions aren't all that useful, since they are only for the observed strata) The documentation for this is under ?predict.coxph because clogit uses the relationship to the Cox model for computation
