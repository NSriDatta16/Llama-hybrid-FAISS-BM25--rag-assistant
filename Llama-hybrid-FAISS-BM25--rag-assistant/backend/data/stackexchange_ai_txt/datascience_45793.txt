CNN strategy in recognizing spinned images

I wrote my CNN code from scratch with some convolution kernels. But my CNN can't recognize flipped/spinned images correctly when there are only a few convolution kernels (3*3). My convolution kernels change very little during training. Why? When there are over 10 convolution kernels, my CNN starts to recognize fipped images. So more kernels help. However it also starts to make wrong recognition. How will the resolution of images affect the result compared to the convolution kernel size? The higher the resolution, the higher the dimension of this fitting problem
