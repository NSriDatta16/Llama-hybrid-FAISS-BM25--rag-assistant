It appears that you would like to reuse fragments of a JSP (header, footer) across multiple JSP pages. If that is the case, consider using one dedicated view (for example login_form.jsp) and using JSP include statements to incorporate the 'common' fragments from that JSP page. As an example (of login_form.jsp): This would allow you to reuse common header and footer content across multiple JSP pages. I would also recommend having a look at Spring MVC ( documentation ), it is a pretty good approach for Spring based web apps.
