Blockquote mysql_fetch_assoc() Returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row and moves the internal data pointer ahead. More info on mysql_fetch_assoc() can be found here So construct a string as it uses up all the input: $str = ""; while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res)){ $str .= " ".$row['field']." ".$row['price']." "; } echo $str; echo $str; The: .= bit is short hand for add to the end of the variable. Another way of writing it would be: $str = $str . "something"; This all could be made much more elegant, but as you're learning I will let you work that out in good time :)
