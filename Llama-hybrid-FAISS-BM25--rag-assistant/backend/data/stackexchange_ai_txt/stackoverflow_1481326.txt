It is not at all clear what you need the parameters for in that query. I would suggest that you simply build a query without ANY parameters that includes all of the columns you need. Then build small form based on this query. You can then drop this small form into your existing form and display the several fields of data based on the key value setting. (just ensure that you setup the link master and child settings for the sub-form). Here what a form looks like: (source: shaw.ca ) So, in the above the bill to displays the customer info based on customer id and is a related table to in invoice. In other words to display several fields of data based on a key value from another table you donâ€™t need to write one line of code. So this whole process and goal of yours can be done by drag and drop with the mouse. I often have something like a invoice, or purchase order and I ONLY have the customer ID. By using a sub-form I can display the whole address and several fields of data without writing any code. As you move from record to record, this whole set of fields will update and always display the correct related data.
