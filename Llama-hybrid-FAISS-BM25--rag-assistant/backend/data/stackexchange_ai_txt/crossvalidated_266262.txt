For folks who are interested in NN prediction confidence estimation, you may wish to take a look at Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning (Gal et al., 2016) . Briefly, it demonstrates how the variance of a network's predictions with dropout over a population of runs in which dropout is performed can be used to estimate prediction confidence. This approach can be employed for networks designed for classification or for regression.
