The info you get from the Marshal class is only relevant if the type actually gets marshaled. The internal memory layout of a managed structure is not discoverable through any documented means, other than peeking at the assembly code perhaps. Which means the CLR is free to reorganize the layout of the structure and optimize the packing. Swapping the D and V fields makes your structure smaller due the alignment requirements of a double. It saves 6 bytes on your 64-bit machine. Not sure why this would be an issue for you, it shouldn't be. Consider Marshal.StructureToPtr() to get the structure laid-out the way you want it.
