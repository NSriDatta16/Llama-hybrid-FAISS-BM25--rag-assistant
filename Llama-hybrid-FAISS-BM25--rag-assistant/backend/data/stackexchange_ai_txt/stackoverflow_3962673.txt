Can an XNA Game use IsolatedStorageSettings for WP7?

I've been trying to port some Windows Phone 7 code between Silverlight to XNA which relies on IsolatedStorageSettings but I can't get Visual Studio to resolve it. When I have a look at what Intellisense is resolving under System.IO.IsolatedStorage & it lists IsolatedStorageFile, IsolatedStorageException & IsolatedStorageStream. The documentation says that the supported version is for Silverlight but I don't understand why I am seeing the difference because of the project types. http://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev10.query?appId=Dev10IDEF1&l=EN-US&k=k(SYSTEM.IO.ISOLATEDSTORAGE.ISOLATEDSTORAGESETTINGS);k(ISOLATEDSTORAGESETTINGS);k(TargetFrameworkMoniker-%22SILVERLIGHT,VERSION%3dV4.0%22);k(DevLang-CSHARP)&rd=true Thanks
