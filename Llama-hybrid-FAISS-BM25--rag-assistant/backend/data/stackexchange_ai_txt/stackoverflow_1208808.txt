Only 9 values? Quicksort is overkill. Perhaps use insertion sort, bubble sort or other simpler sorting algorithms when working with smaller datasets. Performance Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both О(n²), where n is the number of items being sorted. There exist many sorting algorithms with the substantially better worst-case or average complexity of O(n log n). Even other О(n²) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to have better performance than bubble sort. Therefore bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large. However, granted, you did not even have to sort to get the median as others have suggested.
