Here's my stab at the solution: select avg(a.Weight) as AverageWeight from DoctorsVisit as a innner join (select UserID, max (Date) as LatestDate from DoctorsVisit group by UserID) as b on a.UserID = b.UserID and a.Date = b.LatestDate; Note that the User table isn't used at all. This average omits entirely users who have no doctors visits at all, or whose weight is recorded as NULL in their latest doctors visit. This average is skewed if any users have more than one visit on the same date, and if the latest date is one of those date where the user got wighed more than once.
