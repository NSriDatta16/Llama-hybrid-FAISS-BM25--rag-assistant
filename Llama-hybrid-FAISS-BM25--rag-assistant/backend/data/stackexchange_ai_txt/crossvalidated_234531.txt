Is the ROC a good choice for a regression model? AuROC is not a suitable figure of merit for regression models. A better typical choice would be e.g. mean squared error, in your case sqrt (mean ((test$Sepal.Length - prediction)^2)) How can I get the accuracies for every fold and for the entire model? Your error[i]= error (test$Sepal.Length, prediction) is one possibility. I usually prefer to store the predicitions rather than the surrogate models' performance as that allows to look at different figures of merit afterwards, allowing better insight. If you store the error, you need to take into account that in general test sample size can vary a bit across folds and you need to take care to properly average them ($\sqrt a + \sqrt b \neq \sqrt{a + b}$) - which depends on the figure of merit you decided to use.
