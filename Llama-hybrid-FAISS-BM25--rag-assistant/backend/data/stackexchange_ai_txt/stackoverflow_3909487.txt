Calculating sliding averages

I'm not even sure what sliding average is, but someone told me it would help with something I'm working on. I have a table of random values -- table[n] = random(100) / 100 I need to populate table2 with their sliding averages. I think this is the terminology. Let me know if it doesn't make sense.
