Accessing SQL Server 2008 R2 Express with SQL Server Management Studio

OK maybe I'm being stupid somehow, and my googleing has not found a clear step by step user case for beginners. I have just installed into my Win 7 Pro 64-bit SP1 machine SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Database with Advanced Services [downloaded from here http://www.microsoft.com/express/Database/InstallOptions.aspx]. (Actually I have removed and installed it 3 times now to check I'm not missing anything config wise). I have left basically all settings as default, with the exception of calling the Instance SQLEXPRESS (all caps vs default SQLexpress) my last installation I have left set as 'windows authentication mode' with only the same user as I am running now selected (only one user on this machine anyway). After completion I have restarted the machine, I can see the services SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) -> Started -> Automatic SQL Server Agent (SQLEXPRESS) -> -> Manual SQL Server Browser -> -> Manual SQL Server Reporting Service (SQLEXPRESS) -> Started -> Automatic SQL Server VSS Writer -> Started -> Automatic .. So it seems to be up OK. As part of the installation process it also installed SQL Server Management Studio 2008 R2 and when I try and connect I am choosing: Server: Database Engine Servername : \SQLEXPRESS Authentication: Windows Authentication User name: (selected for me and not alterable) machinename\username Password: (also blank greyed out) I hit connect and get the following message. Cannot connect to \SQLEXPRESS. A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 25 - Connection string is not valid) (.Net SqlClient Data Provider) Error Number: 87 Severity: 20 State: 0 OK, so given I am not entering a username or password, and I'm certain of the server instance name - and that it is running ... what am I doing wrong?
