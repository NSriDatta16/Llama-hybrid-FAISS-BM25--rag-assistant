My first thought is to opt for a penalized logistic regression (Lasso or Ridge). By taking on some bias from the penalization, you lose some variance, which should help improve perditions. That being said, you should test against a bunch of models (including some very dumb models, like always sending out an ambulance/HERS, or a simple decision rule like if the patient is farther than 20km, send out a HERS). I think the more salient aspect will be the model validation. Look into clinical prediction model literature for ways people are validating models which deal with life/death scenarios. Though machine learning and statistics can do a lot, you need to be damn sure of your model when it comes to someone's life.
