What do you see actually happening? A few notes: You shouldn't be doing this with a UIImageView-- those are specifically intended to be containers for image files. You should just use a subclass of a regular UIView for this. In your touchesBegan , you know that touch1 and touch2 will always be set to the same thing, right? You don't seem to ever be using touch1. point is a misleading variable name for something that is a rect. Your drawRect is not unreasonable. What is pointColor ? If you're drawing black-on-black that might be part of the problem.
