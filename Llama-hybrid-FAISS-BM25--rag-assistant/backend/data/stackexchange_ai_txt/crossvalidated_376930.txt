It's reasonable choice but it doesn't need to be only z-score. PCA requires each column to have zero mean in order for the algorithm to find a correct first principal component. See this answer for nice visualization and more details https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/22331/226852 There are other scaling methods that allow your data to have zero mean as well.
