If your purpose is to simply add one more diagnostic to your analysis, then check your stat package options/outputs. For instance, in MATLAB LinearModel class has the standard diagnostics such as Leverage, Cook's Distance and Dfbetas. So, you can pick any of the diagnostics and report them together with your modeling results. This is very mechanical. If you're truly interested in finding the outliers, then it's a different story. You'd have to do much more than this. It would require understanding the data set, nature of the measurements, underlying process etc.
