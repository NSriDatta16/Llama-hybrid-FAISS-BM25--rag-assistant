Print the prediction of convolutional neural network

I have designed a convolutional neural network using tensorflow which looks as follows #Define a convolutional neural network function def conv_net(x, weights, biases): conv1 = conv2d(x, weights['wc1'], biases['bc1']) conv1 = maxpool2d(conv1, k=2) conv2 = conv2d(conv1, weights['wc2'], biases['bc2']) conv2 = maxpool2d(conv2, k=2) conv3 = conv2d(conv2, weights['wc3'], biases['bc3']) conv3 = maxpool2d(conv3, k=2) conv4 = conv2d(conv3, weights['wc4'], biases['bc4']) conv4 = maxpool2d(conv4, k=2) # Fully connected layer # Reshape conv2 output to fit fully connected layer input fc1 = tf.reshape(conv4, [-1, weights['wd1'].get_shape().as_list()[0]]) fc1 = tf.add(tf.matmul(fc1, weights['wd1']), biases['bd1']) fc1 = tf.nn.relu(fc1) # Output, class prediction out = tf.add(tf.matmul(fc1, weights['out']), biases['out']) return out The code I'm using to train and test the model is as follows : #Train and Test the Model with tf.Session() as sess: sess.run(init) train_loss = [] test_loss = [] train_accuracy = [] test_accuracy = [] summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./Output', sess.graph) for i in range(training_iters): for batch in range(len(X_train)//batch_size): batch_x = X_train[batch*batch_size:min((batch+1)*batch_size,len(X_train))] batch_y = y_train[batch*batch_size:min((batch+1)*batch_size,len(y_train))] # Run optimization op and Calculate batch loss and accuracy opt = sess.run(optimizer, feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y}) loss, acc = sess.run([cost, accuracy], feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y}) print("Iter " + str(i) + ", Loss= " + \ "{:.6f}".format(loss) + ", Training Accuracy= " + \ "{:.5f}".format(acc)) print("Optimization Completed") # Calculate accuracy for all test data test_acc,valid_loss = sess.run([accuracy,cost], feed_dict={x: X_test,y : y_test}) train_loss.append(loss) test_loss.append(valid_loss) train_accuracy.append(acc) test_accuracy.append(test_acc) print("Testing Accuracy:","{:.5f}".format(test_acc)) summary_writer.close() This prints the accuracy but not the predictions. How can I print the predictions? p.s new to neural network
