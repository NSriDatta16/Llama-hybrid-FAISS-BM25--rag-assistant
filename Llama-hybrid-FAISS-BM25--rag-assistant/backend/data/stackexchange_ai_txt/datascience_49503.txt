Use text classifier on unseen data

I've trained a few models to classify between two categories of text. Logistic regression was the best. Now how can i test it on unseen data? I tried this: def train_model(): classifier.fit(feature_vector_train, label) predictions = classifier.predict(feature_vector_valid) joblib.dump(classifier, url+name) ... load_model =joblib.load('my_model.pkl) result = load_model.score('testx') It tells me i need a y input. However, if it's new i don't have the label. WHat am i missing?
