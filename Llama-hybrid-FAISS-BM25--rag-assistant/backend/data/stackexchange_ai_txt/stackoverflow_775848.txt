Compute numerical values from a space separated text file, within a range of lines

I have a file with the following values: for 3 threads: Average time taken for API1 is: 19097.7 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19173.1 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19777.7 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19243.1 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API1 is: 19737.7 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19128.1 nanoseconds. for 5 threads: Average time taken for API1 is: 19097.7 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19173.1 nanoseconds. Average time taken for API2 is: 19777.7 nanoseconds. ... I wish to calculate the sum of the 1API lines and the 2API lines, and sum them. Another requirement is that i also want to figure out for each thread on a separate basis. Is there a way to do this using perl, sed, awk or just shell scripts? What I can current get is: cat result | grep API1 | awk {'print $7'}
