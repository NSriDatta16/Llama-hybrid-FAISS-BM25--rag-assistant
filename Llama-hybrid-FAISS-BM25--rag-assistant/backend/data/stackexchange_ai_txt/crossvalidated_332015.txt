Why can variable importance be negative/zero while its correlation with the response variable is high?

I don't have a working example for this, as I'm using a large dataset in R with the ranger package (Random Forest algorithm) I fit a model using the ranger package with predictors $X_1,...,X_k$ and a response variable $Y$ with the purpose of looking at the variable importance of each predictor. After fitting the model, I calculated variable importance using the permutation method and importance() . One of the variables (say $X_1$) is highly correlated with the response variable $Y$ (~0.7), but based on the Random Forest model the variable importance of $X_1$ is negative! I would assume if a variable is highly correlated with the response, it would be seen as more important I'm not sure if there's a simple explanation for this? Thanks so much!
