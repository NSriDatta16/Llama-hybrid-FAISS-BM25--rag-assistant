The statement myControl.Position.X = 1.0f; actually calls the getter and not the setter of your Position property. A way to do what you want to do could be by exposing the X and Y values directly on your class, like so: public class Control { protected Point m_Position = new Point(); public float PositionX { get { return m_Position.X; } set { m_Position.X = value; } // reorganize internal structure.. reorganize(); } ... Same thing for PositionY protected reorganize() { // do some stuff } } Another way would be to implement some event on the Position class that is raised every time X or Y change. This would entail making X and Y into properties on the Point object, and raising an event each time they are changed. Your control would then have to subscribe to that event.
