Which Method for making a time series stationary would work better?

If there is a possible multiplicative time series (seasonality increasing marginally over time) that has a large trend component and a smaller seasonal component, would a Lag 1 difference to remove the trend and then a subsequent Lag 12 difference to remove seasonality be better or a log transformation and a Lag 1 Difference to stabilize variance. Both plots would look stationary and satisfy adf, which would be better a approach?
