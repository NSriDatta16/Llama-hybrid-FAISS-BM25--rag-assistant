This is what I see in the relevant paragraph when I click 'View Source' in my browser: You can see the URLs of the button icons in there. (They are from an Iranian site, www.kamran.ir.) I am not an html expert; I thought at first that kamran must be a macro defined in templates/egocentric/styles/egocentric.css, but it's not. Is it possible that the site has changed since you last looked at it?
