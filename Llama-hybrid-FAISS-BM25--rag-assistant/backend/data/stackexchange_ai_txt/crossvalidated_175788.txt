Using Half-Normal Plot to Identify Outlying Observations

When we perform linear regression diagnostic, we usually utilize the half-normal plot (available in the faraway package in R) to identify outlying observations. For example, if we want to identify large leverage points, we simply use haft-normal plot to plot the diagonal entries of the hat matrix and look for the outlying point(s). Note that there's no reason to expect a straight line in the half-normal plot, since there's no reason to assume quantities, such as the cook's distances or leverages, to be normally distributed. Does anyone know why "unusually" large values will appear as outlying points in the half-normal plot? Is there any theory or proof behind this?
