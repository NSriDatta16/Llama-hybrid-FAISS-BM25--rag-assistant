Help me with a solution for what could be solutioned by virtual static fields... in FPC

I'm doing an event manager in Freepascal Each event is an object type TEvent (=object), each kind of event must derive from this class. Events are differentiated by an integer identificator, assigned dynamically. The problem is that i want to retrieve the event id of an instance, and i can't do it well. All instances of a class(object) have a unique id => so it should be static field. All classes have a diferent id => so it should be virtual. Event ids are assignated in run time , and can change => so it can't be a simple method In sum, I can't put all this together. I'm looking for an elegant solution, i don't want to write a hardcoded table, actualizing it in every constructor... etc, i'd prefer something taking advantage of the polymorphism Can anyone help me with another technical or design solution? I remark I don't want to use class instead of object construct.(property doesn't work on objects? :(
