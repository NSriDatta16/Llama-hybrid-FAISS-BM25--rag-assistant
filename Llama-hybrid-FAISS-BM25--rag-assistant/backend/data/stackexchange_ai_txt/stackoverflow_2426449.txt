paragraph " " padding not applied

The following three pieces of code behave exactly the same: A paragraph of text here... A paragraph of text here... A paragraph of text here... How do I get the paragraph indented on both sides? (I tried 15px instead of 15 (EDIT - but only on the first two), I also tried separating the numbers with commas, like an example I found on Google.) The above code is in a div which is in the body, no other divs or tables, etc. are involved. The div is defined: Thanks for any help.
