Testing if "A=B+C" holds for the means Since you do not have paired data, you can only test the hypothesis that the mean of A is equal to the sum of means of B and C, $\mu_A=\mu_B+\mu_C$ , or equivalently, $\mu_A-\mu_B -\mu_C = 0$ . Your simulation based approach You did not explain how you get to a final $p$ -value in your simulations, where you permute $B$ and $C$ , but I assume you would calculate the mean of the permtest p-values as final result, and this is fine. You can certainly cut down on the number of simulations. If you can assume normality If your data do not deviate much from a normal distribution, you can test this hypothesis with a $t$ -test. Here is the version to test if the contrast A - B - C has mean zero. For such a $t$ -test, compute the group averages $\bar{x}_A, \bar{x}_B, \bar{x}_C,$ and estimate the within-group variances as $s^2_A, s^2_B, s^2_C$ . Your test statistic, $$ t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B- \bar{x}_C}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_A}{n_A} + \frac{s^2_B}{n_B}+\frac{s^2_C}{n_C}}}, $$ here with $n_A=n_B=n_C=30$ , follows approximately $t$ -distributed with $df=n_A+n_B+n_C-3=87$ degrees of freedom. The p-value for a two-sided test is computed as $$\text{pval} = 2(1-F_{t(87)}(|t|)),$$ where $F_{t(87)}$ is the cumulative distribution function of the t-distribution with 87 df. Make sure to take the absolute value. Here is simple "home made" R code, assuming you have stored your data in three vectors A , B , C . nA Important: when data are paired , you should neither use this test, nor the one suggested in the original post, see also @mkt's answer with simulated paired data. A test assuming independent data would have relatively low power then. Update: you can have it much simpler I realized that it makes no theoretical difference if you apply an ordinary two-sample $t$ -test on group A and group (B+C) (still under normality assumption, R code): t.test(A, B+C)
