I recommend you look into R , the open source software for statistical computing. R supports many vectorized functions to deal with element by element computation of objects. Chapter 3 of The R Inferno provides a good outline on vectorization in R. From your post above, I'm assuming you have some background in computer programming, and R's command line interface will probably feel right at home to you. Here's your pseudo code above implemented in R: set.seed(42) #Makes random numbers reproducible. x z [1] 29 32 23 20 19 23 35 4 23 19 I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to do with the error coding, but R has the capability to support just about any mathematical or statistical computation you can dream up. If someone else hasn't already implemented a solution for your problem, you can leverage the fact R is a programming language and write your own code to solve it. It is relatively easy to interface with other languages such as C, C++, python from R so there are plenty of options there.
