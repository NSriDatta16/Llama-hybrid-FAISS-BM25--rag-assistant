Because it's Naive (see wikipedia): it assumes the features are independent, the probabilities are incorrect if this assumption is not correct. eg assume you are predicting mortality based on smoking and drinking. NB may well identify people who smoke and drink as higher risk (=probability), just because there is a correlation between smoking and drinking. Suggest you setup a contingency table for eg smoking, drinking, dying and calcuate Naive bayes. probabilities vs true probabilities why don't you use logistic regression instead?
