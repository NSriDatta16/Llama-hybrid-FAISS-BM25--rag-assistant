The overarching issue that I can see in your data/problem are the customers with 0 spend. Because they haven't spent anything it's kind of hard to quantitatively predict their spending behavior except in an average sense (the average 2 year spend of people with 0 seven day spend and the standard deviation). So yes I would consider them differently by setting up two separate models. I definitely agree with the log transform approach. It is highly recommended for data that is restricted to being positive. See here for a good explanation: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/08/21/you-should-usually-log-transform-your-positive-data/ Now as far as evaluating this as a prediction problem: In your approach you are considering each variable separately but never together. You are trying to infer the relationship between 7 day spend and 2 year spend so you should be looking at them on the same plot. Then you can see the relationship between the two variables and that will guide the kind of analysis you do. Does the relationship look linear? Or is it non-linear? Again I would do this with the log of the values. So my approach would be: 1) Make a scatter plot of log(7 day spend) vs log(2 year spend) 2) Perform a regression analysis (should be easy to do in R) such as a linear regression on the log transformed data: $\log(2 year spend) = \alpha*\log(7 day spend) + \beta$ 3) Evaluate the regression analysis in the context of the prediction error (how far off are the predictions the model makes vs the actual 2 year spend of your training data) and see if that is good enough for your purposes. If it isn't then you may need to consider using a longer interval (e.g., 1 year spend) or possibly a different model with more variables (do you know anything else besides spend?)
