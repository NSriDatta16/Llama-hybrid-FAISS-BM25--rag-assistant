Working with time series data with several times stamps on a dates, and implementing machine learning

I'm trying to implement predictive analytics on a production data. my goal is to predict next downtime, it's reason and issues. My data looks like below; import pandas as pd data = {'Date': ['16-08-2021', '16-08-2021', '17-08-2021', '18-08-2021', '19-08-2021 5'], 'Reason no': ['R13', 'R2', 'R5', 'R2', 'R3'], 'Minutes': [115, 625, 625, 1364, 1440], 'Issues': ['Not meeting the hourly target output', 'Air leak issue', 'other problem', 'Air leak issue', 'Air leak issue']} df = pd.DataFrame(data) we can see on 16-08-2021 we have 2 downtimes of different categories. so what we can do is modify this data into 2 separate time stamp. like '16-08-2021 1AM', '16-08-2021 4AM' and also assign time features to all other dates. Minutes is the downtime , My goal is to forecast the next downtime for next 2 days (which can be like e.g 'Date': ['20-08-2021 5AM', '20-08-2021 6PM', '21-08-2021 12AM'], 'Reason no': ['R5', 'R2', 'R2'], 'Minutes': [655, 142, 425], 'Issues': [ 'Air leak issue', 'other problem', 'Air leak issue']} what i have seen is most tutorial just treat datetime data as id and ignores it , but in my case date and timestamp is an important tool. i want to train my model using LSTM and other hybrid technique. So, How can I deal multiple data of same date using pandas and python. And keep date-time as a feature variable. kindly looking for help. Thank you. Also looking for any additional insights and suggestions.
