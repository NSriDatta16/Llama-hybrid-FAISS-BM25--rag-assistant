I have this now fixed, its has taken me the guts of a day so I hope it helps someone some day. I found the article How to use Pax Logging in my bundles and it mentioned to make sure I used the following in my MANIFEST Import-Package: org.apache.log4j; version="[1.2,1.3)"; provider=paxlogging, org.apache.commons.logging; version="[1.0,1.1)"; provider=paxlogging This code makes sure that the provider for the logging is paxlogging. Without it I never was able to see any of my logging messages now I can which is great configuring this does not seem to work with fragments so I am looking into ConfAdmin for this but for now I am happy and can continue development with proper logging.
