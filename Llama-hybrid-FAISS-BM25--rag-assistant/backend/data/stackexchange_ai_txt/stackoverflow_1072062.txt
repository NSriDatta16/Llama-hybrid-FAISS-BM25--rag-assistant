Given an anonymous type named bookRatingList which contains an list of bookRatings (new {bookid = somevalue, rating = somevalue}) you can use the following code: var bookRatingAverageList = from book in bookRatingList orderby book.bookid group book by book.bookid into groupedList select new { BookId = groupedList.Key, AverageRating = groupedList.Average(b => b.rating)}; The result should be an array of anonymous typed objects with BookId and AverageRating properties and ordered by BookId.
