You need to iclude the wp-blog-header.php to your magento template. If you add the following line at the top of your magento template, you will have access to all WP commands: require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/wp-blog-header.php'); (make sure you use the right path) Now you just ned to create a loop and display the post. You may also get posts from a specific category if you wish.
