What is the difference between a neural network and a deep neural network, and why do the deep ones work better?

I haven't seen the question stated precisely in these terms, and this is why I make a new question. What I am interested in knowing is not the definition of a neural network, but understanding the actual difference with a deep neural network. For more context: I know what a neural network is and how backpropagation works. I know that a DNN must have multiple hidden layers. However, 10 years ago in class I learned that having several layers or one layer (not counting the input and output layers) was equivalent in terms of the functions a neural network is able to represent (see Cybenko's Universal approximation theorem ), and that having more layers made it more complex to analyse without gain in performance. Obviously, that is not the case anymore. I suppose, maybe wrongly, that the differences are in terms of training algorithm and properties rather than structure, and therefore I would really appreciate if the answer could underline the reasons that made the move to DNN possible (e.g. mathematical proof or randomly playing with networks?) and desirable (e.g. speed of convergence?)
