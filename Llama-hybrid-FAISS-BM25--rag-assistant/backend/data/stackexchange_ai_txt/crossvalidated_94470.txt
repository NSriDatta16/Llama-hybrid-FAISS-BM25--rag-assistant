Correlating two questionnaires with grouped items

I need to correlate employee engagement (gathered data using the 9 item UWES questionnaire) and organizational commitment (gathered data using the 18 item Organizational Commitment Scale). The both of them can be divided into different components; UWES - Vigour (3-items in questionnaire), Dedication (3 items in questionnaire) & Commitment (3 items in questionnaire). OCS - Affective Commitment (6 items in questionnaire), Continuance Commitment (6 items in questionnaire) & Normative Commitment (6 items in questionnaire). I have an R-matrix set up correlating all the individual questions from both questionnaires, using Pearson's r . However I would like to correlate the components, and not individual items from the questionnaires. What would you recommend I use? Thanks!
