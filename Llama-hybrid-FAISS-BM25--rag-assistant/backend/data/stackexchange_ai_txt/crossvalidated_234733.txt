Cross-validation: splitting data for multi-label regression

Can you please suggest existing algorithms/implementations/articles for splitting the data for cross-validation for multi-label regression models (matrix factorization and multiple T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 C1 8 6 10 empty 8 8 8 9 C2 9 7 5 9 6 7 10 5 C3 empty 9 9 8 empty 7 10 empty C4 10 8 5 empty 10 9 empty 10 C5 8 10 empty 5 5 8 10 10 C6 6 6 7 7 5 5 5 C7 6 empty 8 empty 9 empty 6 9 C8 empty 8 6 5 7 10 5 10 C9 8 8 9 8 9 10 10 empty E.g. in sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit the label distribution is treated correctly: labels are accordingly distributed between folds, but the density of label value is not taken into account. Workaround of course is to convert label values to labels only via binning, e.g. T1:8 to T1_value_4.5, T1_value_5.0, T1_value_5.5, etc. But more elegant solution is needed.
