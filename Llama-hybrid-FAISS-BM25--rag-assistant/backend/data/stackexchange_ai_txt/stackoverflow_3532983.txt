What you read is incorrect. Interfaces cannot have member variables. In VB.Net the only allowable definitions inside an interface are Properties Methods Events Type Definitions (not legal in C#) I'm not entirely sure what the above paragraph is referring to. Based on the text though it sounds like it's refering to Java. They phrase static and final is most often associated with Java code and not .Net (static and readonly). Can you give us some more context on it?
