Meaning of y axis in Random Forest partial dependence plot

I am using the RandomForest R package and am confused at how to interpret the values of the Y-axis in their partial dependence plots. Help docs state that the plot is a "graphical depiction of the marginal effect of a variable on the class probability." However, I am still confused as to what exactly the y-axis represents. Particularly, what do the negative values mean? What does it mean to have a negative influence on accurately predicting the class? And what is the most important feature from these figures, is it the max value, the shape of the trend etc? Can you compare the partial plots with partial plots of other variables? How might these plots compare with response curves created in Maxent (a distribution modeling software)?
