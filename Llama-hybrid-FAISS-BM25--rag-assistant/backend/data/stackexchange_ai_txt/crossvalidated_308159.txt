The median would give a number $m$ so that, if you were to watch a random episode, you would have an equal chance of your "happiness" with the episode to be either above or below $m$. (I use "happiness" to summarize your average of a "rating" and your "satisfaction".) The mean would of course give you your overall "happiness" over an entire season. The question of how to assess "bestness" is still open. Both summaries of central tendency are valid. Whether one is preferable depends on what you want to do with the result.
