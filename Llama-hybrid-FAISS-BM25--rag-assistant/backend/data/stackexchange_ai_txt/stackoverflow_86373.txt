I like Eclipse's VisualEditor (VE), and sometime ago I've tried to switch to another editor, but I found it impossible. Visual editor has this feature that it generates manageable, readable, editable, and easy-to-understand code. Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor and WindowBuilder it uses the lazy initialization pattern to separate initialization of components. Also it does not need to lock down parts of code that you can't edit; you may edit code by hand, and VE is still able to work with your changes. The only disadvantage of VE is that it uses Eclipse v3.2 (Callisto) (there is no official build for Eclipse v3.4 (Ganymede), or Eclipse v3.3 (Europa)), so effectively you have to use two Eclipses instances, one for VE and one for the rest of the development. I took it from recent discussion on comp.lang.java.gui (I was the author of this post, so I could do it rightfully). Here is the link to the whole discussion.
