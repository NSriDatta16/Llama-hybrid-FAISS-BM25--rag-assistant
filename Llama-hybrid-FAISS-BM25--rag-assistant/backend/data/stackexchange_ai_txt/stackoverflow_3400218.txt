How to stop someone uploading a script in textarea?

I have a situation where users can submit feedback through a textarea on a HTML page or JSP. This works fine and the text ends up in the database. But, can anyone suggest any safeguards which could prevent somebody trying to submit malicious scripts which could possibly affect the page's behaviour? I am aware of parsing the text entered and converting any to '&GT'; But is there anything more I could do to validate the entered text? Thanks Mr Morgan
