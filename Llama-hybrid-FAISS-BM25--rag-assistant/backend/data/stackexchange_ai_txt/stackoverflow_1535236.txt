How to structure a website project in Eclipse

I am starting a web application project that will have an Adobe Flex front-end and a PHP/MySQL back-end. I've developed a lot of C++ desktop applications, but am new to building web applications, and to the Eclipse environment. I have set up my current project structure in Subversion as: --MyWebsite +--tags +--branches +--trunk ---index.html +--images +--BasicHtmlSubSite +--PHPServices +--FlexComponentA I check out trunk into E:\Dev\Projects\MyWebSite\workspace, and that directory is also my Eclipse Workspace (but I excluded the .metadata folder from Subversion, and only check in the projects). So my questions are: 1) Is this a good site structure? Specifically, how closely should my Subversion/Eclipse folder structure mirror the eventual folder structure in htdocs? 2) How do I include index.html (or maybe index.php someday) in an Eclipse project? I've tried putting it in a Static HTML project (StaticLandingPage) under the workspace, and adding a FileSync build action to move it to the root of the webserver, but the StaticLandingPage folder gets deployed to the server too, which I don't want. I just want to be able to deploy a single html file from within a project to the htdocs directory. I should add that I'm developing on Windows, with Eclipse Ganymede, Adobe Flash Builder 4, PDT 2.x, Subclipse, FileSync, and the WST plugin (I think it was). I'm using XAMPP for a local server.
