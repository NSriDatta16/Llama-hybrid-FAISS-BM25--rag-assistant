Accounting for repeated measurements vs cross section with averages

If I had repeated measures of the units in my sample, is it always preferable to analyse as is and account for these with a method such as GEE or a multi-level model - because of the gain in information -, or are there times when it is better to average within unit and analyse the data cross sectionally? Thanks
