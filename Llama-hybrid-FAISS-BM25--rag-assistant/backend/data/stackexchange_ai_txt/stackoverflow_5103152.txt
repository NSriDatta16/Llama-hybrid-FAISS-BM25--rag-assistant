How to create another version or re-package my application in Eclipse

I want to create a free version of my application which will be limited in features and have notifications and links to get the full version. I can create another copy of the entire project on the hard drive but the package path needs to change in all .java files and manifest. Do I do this manually or is there a better way in Eclipse to organise different versions of an application?
