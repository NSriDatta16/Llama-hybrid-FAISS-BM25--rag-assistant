Comparing Odds ratios between dependant samples?

I am in a bit of quandary with a research project: I have to compare and contrast the epidemiological picture of homicide with the media coverage of homicide in a specific geographic area and time-span. Now I'm using Poisson regression to work out the OR of a crime being committed (male vs.female, black vs white etc.) in the epidemiological data. Then I am also working out the OR for a crime story being reported based on victim characteristics (male vs. female, black vs white etc.) Now let's say I arrive at the following: the OR for victimhood is 4.0 for male [ref group] vs female in the epidemiological data, but OR for the media covering such a homicide is 7.0 for male vs female. Given that the samples are dependant, such that theoretically the media data is derived from/overlaps with the epidemiological data, how can I statistically compare these odds ratios? Thanks.
