Using regex to capture a numeric value within a string in C#

I have a string of characters which has 0 or more occurrences of ABC = dddd within it. The dddd stands for an integer value, not necessarily four digits. What I'd like to do is capture the integer values that occur within this pattern. I know how to perform matches with regexes but I'm new to capturing. It's not necessary to capture all the ABC integer values in one callâ€”it's fine to loop over the string. If this is too involved I'll just write a tiny parser, but I'd like to use regex if it's reasonably elegant. Expertise greatly appreciated.
