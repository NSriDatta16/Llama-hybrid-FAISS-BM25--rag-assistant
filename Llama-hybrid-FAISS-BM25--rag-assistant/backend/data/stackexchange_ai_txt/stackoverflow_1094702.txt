As Robert points out, you can install Mylyn and the Trac Connector into an Eclipse runtime to get the basic functionality. Tasktop is needed if you'd like further desktop integration, e.g., Task-focused web browsing with IE (Embedded) or Firefox (External) GMail and Outlook/Exchange email integration (Create tasks from messages) Google and Outlook/Exchange calendar integration (View upcoming appointments) Linking local documents (View documents in your task contexts) Time tracking (Automatically generate reports) Tasktop also provides access to additional connectors if you need them. Although Tasktop Pro isn't free, I encourage you to consider the value of the time savings Tasktop makes possible. If your organization is interested in Tasktop for your team, I can provide more information about the benefits and ROI. Wesley Coelho Tasktop Technologies
