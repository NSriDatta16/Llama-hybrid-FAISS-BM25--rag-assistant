Whitespace block delimiters force a certain amount of code formatting, which seems to irritate some programmers. Some in our shop seem to be of the attitude that they are too busy, or can't be bothered to pay attention to formatting standards, and a language that forces it rubs them raw. Sometimes the same folks gripe when others do not follow the same patterns of putting curly braces on a new line ;) I find that Python code from the web is more commonly "readable", since this minor formatting requirement is in place. IMO, this requirement is a very useful feature. IIRC, does not Haskell, OCaml (#light), and F# also use whitespace in the same fashion? For some reason, I have not seen any complaints about these languages.
