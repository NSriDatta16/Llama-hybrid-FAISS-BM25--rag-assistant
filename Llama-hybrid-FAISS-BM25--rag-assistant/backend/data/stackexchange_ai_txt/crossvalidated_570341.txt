Is it valid to cross-validate linear regression models out of chronological order in a time series context?

For simplicity I'll stick to the univariate case with one exogenous regressor. Suppose I have X = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) Y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n ) where i i came before x j chronologically, and likewise for y i and y j , regardless of the unit of time, for 1 Leaving aside the usual caveats about the interpretability of a regression model fitted to time series data, is there anything philosophically incorrect about cross-validating my linear regression trained on these data out of order? For example, is it sound to do leave-one-out cross-validation with (x k , y k ) as the test set, incorporating data (x t , y t ) in the training set for t > k? Given linear regression's distributional assumptions of linearity and constant variance, the order of the exogenous and endogenous coordinates doesn't matter within the same training set as long as pairwise indices are preserved (i.e. the ranks are kept the same, x k is only matched to y k and not some other y i ). It seems to follow that there should be no advantage to requiring that the test data strictly come after the training data for linear regression in particular, which has no notion of time or temporal order, if we are already making these distributional assumptions.
