Loop unrolling can make execution faster (otherwise Duff's Device wouldn't have been invented), but that's a function of so many variables (processor, cache size, compiler settings, what myfunction is actually doing, etc.) that you can't rely on it to always be true, or for whatever improvement to be worth the cost in readability and maintainability. The only way to know for sure if it makes a difference for your particular platform is to code up both versions and profile them. Depending on what myfunction actually does, the difference could be so far down in the noise as to be undetectable. This kind of micro-optimization should only be done if all of the following are true: You're failing to meet a hard performance requirement; You've already picked the proper algorithm and data structure for the problem at hand (e.g., in the average case a poorly optimized Quicksort will beat the pants off of a highly optimized bubble sort, and in the worst case they'll be equally bad); You're compiling with the highest level of optimization that the compiler offers;
