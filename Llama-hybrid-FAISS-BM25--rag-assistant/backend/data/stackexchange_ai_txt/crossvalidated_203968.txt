Threshold for Mahalanobis distance

I have training samples that I project onto the eigenspace via pca. What is a reasonable threshold for the mahalanobis distance (to the mean) to reject invalid input data ? The paper here states that a distance of 3 standard deviations would be reasonable. However, the example stated here has training data up to 10 standard deviations. What threshold should I set for my application of face recognition ? I have found that the distance of my training samples to the mean can go up to 8-9 standard deviations. Is there a rule of thumb for setting a threshold for the mahalanobis distance ? Thank you.
