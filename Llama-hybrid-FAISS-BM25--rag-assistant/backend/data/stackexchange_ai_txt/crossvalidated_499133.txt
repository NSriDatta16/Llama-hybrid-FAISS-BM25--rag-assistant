I cannot make complete sense of you graphs. But generally speaking, good predictive power of a model does not necessarily have to results in "significant" predictors. The way I understand you confuse the significance with influence. But actually the significance cannot tell you something about the relevance of a predictor. Because your sample size is rather small for 15 independent variables (IV). It is not surprise that you will not find many significant effects. To asses whether a variable has some relevance to the prediction you could look at the varaince that is explained by each of the IVs. What I would suggest to try would be to see if a random forest model works better. ANNs are hard to train, especially with so little data. Pus you can get a ranking of most mimportant variables
