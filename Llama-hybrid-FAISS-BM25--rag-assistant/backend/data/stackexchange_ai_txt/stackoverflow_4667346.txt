There are developer certificates that allow to install onto hardware physically connected to the machine where Xcode runs on. There are Adhoc certificates , created after on the developer web portal you entered the UDID of your user devices. That type is used used for adhoc distribution and the resulting IPA can be send to users to install via iTunes without going through the app store. There are distribution (Release) certificates that are required to put stuff into the app store. In project properties ensure you have the correct certificate for the chosen build type selected. When in doubt about the adhoc profile then delete it and copy the release profile across. Change the certificate from release to adhoc and try again. You can test your own adhoc builds by doing a build and archive, then drag and drop the resulting IPA onto iTunes (apps tab) and do a sync.
