Liferay can be used as a simple CMS, without much Java knowledge : creating, editing and positioning of web content fragments are drag'n'drop and use of the included rich text editor. But to start using Liferay for your company, there are two main steps : a technical configuration (database, etc.), and a look'n'feel customization. The technical part First of all, you should get rid of the 7cogs website : this is called a hook in the Liferay wording. To do that, if you are using Tomcat for the application server, just delete the 7cogs directory as stated here . You can now create the configuration file for your installation : it's a simple text properties file, named portal-ext.properties and placed in the webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes folder of your tomcat installation. This file handles most of the configuration of the Liferay portal, for example : the name of your company if you want to display a terms of use page on first login if you want anybody to be able to create an account on your portal the database where the data will be stored To do this, the properties in the portal-ext.properties override default properties found in a embedded portal.properties file located in the jar file portal-impl.jar, in the webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib directory. Just unzip the jar file in a temporary folder to access the portal.properties file. A sample portal-ext.properties file : company.default.web.id=yourcompany.com terms.of.use.required=false company.security.strangers=false jdbc.default.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver jdbc.default.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useFastDateParsing=false jdbc.default.username=root jdbc.default.password=root Once done, you can startup your application server. As the default admin (named test, something you can change in the portal-ext.properties file), you can access to the centralized web "control center", located in the "dock" (the strange menu labelled "welcome Test" in the upper right part of any page once logged in). I would advise you to read the administration guide , useful for most administrative tasks. The "branding" part Liferay uses "Themes" to automatically decorate the portal pages (logo, navigation, portlet borders...) using images, CSS, Javascript (JQuery) and the templating language Velocity. The themes are bundled in a .war file, like a standard web application, and deployed on the fly either via the control center or by dropping the file in the deploy directory of the server. Liferay can use several themes at the same time, one for each community (a group of pages, users and content) for example. Creating your own theme can be done afterwards, using the " Plugins SDK ". The Wiki , forums and blogs can be very useful.
