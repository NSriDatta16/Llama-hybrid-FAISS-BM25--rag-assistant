Silverlight 2 Drag and Drop tutorials

I'm wondering if people can suggest the best tutorial that will walk me through the best way to do Drag and Drop with control collision detection etc, using MS Silverlight V2. I've done the Jesse Liberty tutorials at Silverlight.net, and they were a good introduction, but I'm looking for something a bit deeper. Suggestions?
