edit : you're apparently defining $start inside your function. If it's defined before your SQL statement, it'll be, obviously, accessible. However, I doubut your pagination function will be very useful if you don't pass it $start or $end . You can also define default values with this syntax: function paginate($connection, $tableName, $start=0, $end="ALL") { original follows Functions have their own scope; you should pass the function the variables defined outside it: function paginate($connection, $tableName, $start, $end) { The only exception are the superglobals $GLOBALS , $_GET , $_POST , $_COOKIE , $_REQUEST , $_SESSION , $_FILES , $_ENV and $_SERVER . You can also access functions defined outside any function through the superglobal array $GLOBALS or by adding global $var; in the beginning of the function implementation. You are, however, discouraged to do so, except (arguably) for application scoped configuration directives.
