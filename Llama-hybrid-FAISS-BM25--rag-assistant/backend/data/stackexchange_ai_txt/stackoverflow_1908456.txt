The already-posted answers are great. In addition, whenever you're coding something in Python and you start doing something that feels clumsy, take a step back and think. If you can't think of a more elegant way to do it, post it as a question on Stack Overflow. I can't count the number of times that I've seen someone reduce ten lines of Python into one (which is still perfectly easy to read and understand).
