I'd recommend embedding a servlet container (Apache Tomcat or Jetty, I like Tomcat more) in your application and creating a set of JSP/JSF servlets for the web interface. This solution will let you use all java enterprise technologies (like JAAS) with your web interface and avoid reinventing the wheel. I would estimate the effort of creating such solution with tomcat to 1 day of intensive copy/paste. After the skeleton starts breathing, web pages themselves can be created in Eclipse visual tool with several mouse drags/clicks.
