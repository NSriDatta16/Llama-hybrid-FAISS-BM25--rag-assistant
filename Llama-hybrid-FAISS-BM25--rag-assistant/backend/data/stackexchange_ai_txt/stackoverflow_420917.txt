The reason a salt can make a rainbow-table attack fail is that for n-bits of salt, the rainbow table has to be 2^n times larger than the table size without the salt. Your example of using 'foo' as a salt could make the rainbow-table 16 million times larger. Given Carl's example of a 128-bit salt, this makes the table 2^128 times larger - now that's big - or put another way, how long before someone has portable storage that big?
