There's no canonical resource on this. The best way to think about these views are with the concept of scope. Certain data in Magento is returned differently depending on which level (website, store, etc. you're on) I'd start by getting a good understanding of the Layout system . Basically, layouts are abstracted out into a tree of "Block" objects. Most of these Blocks objects render a specific phtml template file. The phtml template files are considered the store's theme. You can point to a different group of templates depending on which store, store view or website is currently selected. Step Two would be to get familiar with the configuration system . Magento takes certain actions based on the values set here, and the values can be set on a global, website, or store level. The obvious example here is locale. Finally, Magento's EAV model system allows even the models to have have values scoped at the global, website, or store level.
