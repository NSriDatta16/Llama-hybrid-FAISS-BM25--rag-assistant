You can reproduce the effect of the #pragma once in a standard way using the following: #if !defined GUARD_SYMBOL #include "GUARDED_FILE" #endif although it is much more verbose. As others have said, it helps with compilation times since the file is not searched for / opened instead of opening the file and ignoring everything inside it - the file still has to be parsed by the preprocessor.
