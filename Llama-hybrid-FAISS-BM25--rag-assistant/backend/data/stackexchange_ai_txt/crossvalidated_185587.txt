Handedness — Observational study vs. Experiment

Let's say your goal is to determine whether left handed people are more coordinated with their right hands than right handed people are with their left. You gather up 20 left-handed people and 20 right-handed people, have each one throw a ball into a basket with both their dominant and non-dominant hands, and then compare the distribution of the ratio of makes with non-dominant vs. dominant between both groups. Would this be considered as an experiment or an observational study? I am leaning towards it being a prospective observational study since it lacks the notable characteristics of an experiment, such as random assignment — you cannot randomly assign handedness. On the other hand (no pun intended), since you have two groups and are comparing outcomes between them, could this in a sense be a matched experiment? I also found this experiment dealing with handedness vs. tonal pitch memory that seems to have a similar setup where they compare one statistic across two groups: This experiment employed 74 right-handers and 30 left-handers... The right-handers produced an average error rate of 41.5% and the left-handers a rate of 36.5%. which seems similar to this setup, substituting error rates for ratio of success with non-dominant vs dominant.
