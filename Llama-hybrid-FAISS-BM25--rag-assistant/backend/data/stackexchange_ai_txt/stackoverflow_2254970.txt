A transaction has nothing to do with how the data is organised, it's a specific database operation. Within a transaction you can do multiple reads and writes, and the whole thing succeeds or fails together. The limitation is that all the entities affected must be in the same group. If you were using transactions, then you'd know you were: looking up team data doesn't make it a transaction. If your players use a reference property to specify the team, you'd query that in GQL with WHERE team=KEY('Team', ) , being the id of the team entity. Alternatively, you can do this: for player in team.player_set: # iterating over the players in the team... When the Player kind has a reference property to the Team kind, teams automagically gain this player_set collection (well, actually it's a Query) which you can iterate. It's called a "back-reference"
