Converting a development team from FTP to a Versioning System

I work at a small LAMP Development Studio where the idea has been to just get the code done and go on to the next item on the list. The team works in Zend Studio 5.5 connected to the Live server via FTP or SFTP. What they love about this is the speed of their deployment of code (since its just modifying live code). But of course this is not good due to many obvious reasons. I would like to move them to a Versioning System (CVS, SVN or any other tool) but the catch is, I am not their senior so I need a carrot for them to start using this. What kind of setup would I need to build on their machine so they can code along as usual? What I would do is create this setup on my machine and then show them. I know this is kinda unusual but it's turned into a passion of mine to change their way of thinking from the usual hacking of code to structure and elegance. Thanks. UPDATE (for Jonathan Leffler's answer): Yes No Yes, they really do Question also, the studio makes a centralized CMS system that is hosted on hundreds of sites, they need to modify individual sites, should the sites be in the main compository or within their own one?
