Maybe the Zend_Mail component of Zend Framework might help, here ? (If it's like several other components of ZF, it might be do-able to "extract" it from the framework, to use it as some standalone component) Quoting a portion of this page : Reading Mail Messages : Zend_Mail can read mail messages from several local or remote mail storages. And there is table of features : Feature Mbox Maildir Pop3 IMAP Storage type local local remote remote Fetch message Yes Yes Yes Yes Fetch MIME-part emulated emulated emulated emulated Folders Yes Yes No Yes Create message/folder No todo No todo Flags No Yes No Yes Quota No Yes No No So it seems Zend_Mail is able to do at least some manipulations on "local" mail -- including reading them (Not sure whether Courrier uses Mbox or Maildir, but as both are supported...) .
