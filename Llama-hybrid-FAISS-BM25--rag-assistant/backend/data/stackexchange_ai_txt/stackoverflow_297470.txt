Use GET or POST for a search form

I have a couple search forms, 1 with ~50 fields and the other with ~100. Typically, as the HTML spec says, I do searches using the GET method as no data is changed. I haven't run into this problem yet, but I'm wondering if I will run out of URL space soon? The limit of Internet Explorer is 2083 characters. Other browsers, have a much higher limit . I'm running Apache, so the limit there is around 4000 characters, which IIS is 16384 characters. At 100 fields, say average field name length of 10 characters, that's already 5000 characters...amazing on the 100 field form, I haven't had any errors yet. (25% of the fields are multiple selects, so the field length is much longer.) So, I'm wondering what my options are. (Shortening the forms is not an option.) Here my ideas: Use POST. I don't like this as much because at the moment users can bookmark their searches and perform them again later--a really dang nice feature. Have JavaScript loop through the form to determine which fields are different than default, populate another form and submit that one. The user would of course bookmark the shortened version. Any other ideas? Also, does anyone know if the length is the encoded length or just plain text? I'm developing in PHP, but it probably doesn't make a difference. Edit: I am unable to remove any fields; I am unable to shorten the form. This is what the client has asked for and they often do use a range of fields, in the different categories. I know that it's hard to think of a form that looks nice with this many fields, but the users don't have a problem understanding how it works.
