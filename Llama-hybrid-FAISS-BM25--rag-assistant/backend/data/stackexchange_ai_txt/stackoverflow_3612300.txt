Working on large JavaScript applications

Our file structures is pretty good, organizing functionality in separate folders. My question is how do others work on applications that involves upwards of 500 JavaScript files. We have written a maven plugin to concatenate these files together (also runs YUI compressor). However, this involves 3-10seconds of compiling for every change. Is this step necessary for organization of a large application, I feel like a well structured HTML file pulling in all these resources would save me 45minutes every day.
