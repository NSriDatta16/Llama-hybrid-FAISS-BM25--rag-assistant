You are right about the loss, you can verify the details with BERT source code here https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/run_squad.py#L646-L652 I guess "maximum scoring span is used as the prediction" means since it formulates the Squad task as a sequence labeling task, when doing prediction, the words in the most probable span are used as the predicted answer. There are also other ways to solve Squad, for example by a sequence generation model, Long-Term Memory Networks for Question Answering .
