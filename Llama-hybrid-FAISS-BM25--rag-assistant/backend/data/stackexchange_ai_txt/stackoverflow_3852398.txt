The simplest way would be to use a QofQ: select clusterPrivateReferrals.msgCount as privateReferrals, clusterNHSReferrals.msgCount as NHSReferrals, clusterPrivateReferrals.organizationName from clusterPrivateReferrals join clusterNHSReferrals on clusterNHSReferrals.organizationName = clusterPrivateReferrals.organizationName order by (privateReferrals+privateReferrals) desc I've not tested this, so you may need to tweak it a little. Now, you should be able to use the two Referrals columns as the data columns for the graph.
