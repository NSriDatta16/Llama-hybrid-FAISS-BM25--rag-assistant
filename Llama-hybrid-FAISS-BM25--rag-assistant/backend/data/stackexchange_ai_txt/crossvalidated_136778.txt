EDIT: With PCA you can report how the (rotated) variables load onto the various factors (Efficacy, Perserverance, Effort, Achievement). By doing so you justify the grouping of variables. If an instrument/questionnaire is designed to group in this way, you could confirm/disprove that using the factor loadings. If it is an established instrument I would check how it is generally reported in the literature. Use a correction of alpha for multiple comparisons, such as the Holm-Bonferroni method. If you have a hierarchical situation, you might be better of using a nested ANOVA for group comparisons. Just check that all the assumptions of the test are fulfilled.
