Learning how to use Subversion

This is probably a really stupid newbie-sounding question to you developer type people, but I'm at a loss :( I've been trying to learn how to use Subversion for keeping the history of my code, but I'm finding it pretty confusing. I read the 'book' that comes with Subversion, but I didn't find it all that helpful. I'm using Windows, and I downloaded the TortoiseSVN GUI for it. All I really want to know how to do is to create a new project, put a file in it (any old file), and then update that file, just so I can see how it works. I created a 'repository' (in svn_repository/test), and if anyone could tell me how I'm supposed to go about creating a new file/putting a file in it, and then updating that file I'd be really happy :) Knowing my luck it'll be something as simple as "drag and drop the file into the directory". Apologies for asking such a stupid question! Also if anyone could tell me how to go about making it work with Zend Studio, that would be extra awesome-points. Thanks!
