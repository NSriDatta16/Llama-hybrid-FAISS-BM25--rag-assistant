Transform continuous variable to discrete variable

I am having an input data set( 14 x 250 ) which has attached a labels set ( 1 x 250 ). The labels set is discrete( 0 vs. 1). The problem is that the each one of the 14 characteristics are continuous. For example, for characteristic 1 I am having : 10.18 ; 11.18 ; 9.89 ; 22.45 0 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0 I want to transform the continuous variables to discrete variables, and while I am doing this I want to have a Mutual Information value between the transformed characteristics and the label values, as high as possible. Also, I want to keep the number of variables in which I split each characteristic as low as possible, because I want to use them for a Bayesian Network model. Could you recommend me some transform algorithms/techniques for this? Or some matlab build in functions. I know that I can apply the mean and standard deviation for each characteristic and then build the labels based on it, but I am not sure whether the mutual information value will be high.
