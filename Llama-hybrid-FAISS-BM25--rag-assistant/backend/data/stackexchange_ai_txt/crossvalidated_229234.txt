Sample average of fixed-subsample MLE's

Theory of MLE's state that, for $X_1, \cdots, X_n \overset{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim} F(\theta)$, that $\widehat{\theta}_{MLE}(\textbf{X}_n) \overset{p}{\rightarrow} \theta$ (assuming some regularity conditions). Now suppose $X_{ij} \overset{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim} F(\theta)$ for all $i$ and $j = 1, \cdots, J$ for fixed $J$. Compute $\widehat{\theta}_{MLE}(\textbf{X}_{iJ})$ (that is, the MLE based on the subsample $i1, \cdots, iJ$). Then calculate $\widehat{\theta}_{MLE}^* = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\widehat{\theta}_{MLE}(\textbf{X}_{iJ})$. Is it also true that $\widehat{\theta}_{MLE}^* \overset{p}{\rightarrow} \theta$? Are there conditions to guarantee this is true?
