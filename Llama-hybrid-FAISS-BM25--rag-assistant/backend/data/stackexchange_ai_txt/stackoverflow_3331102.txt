I plan to use jsfiddle for html demos on my site, but how can I store my actual code?

My site will feature dozens and dozens of front end live demos ( html pages with cross browser bugs ), but instead of just throwing it on jsfiddle.net and linking to demos from articles I would actually like to store them in a database or organized dynamically generated flat files. Example: http://site/css-bug/ will feature an article on a certain bug in X browser. I can have many ( demos ) to one ( bug/article ). They will contain HTML, CSS and some Javascript. Another possibility I was pondering about was making my own jsfiddle.net clone, and in doing so I would have to mimic the way jsfiddle stores them ( however it does ). I'm thinking this is the best route to go, but would appreciate advice. Background info: As of now I am manually making static html files in directories and linking to them, and I am using Django for my application which links to these demos ( which reside on a media server ).
