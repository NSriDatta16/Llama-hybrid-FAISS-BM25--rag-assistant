I think you're getting confused. In the paper XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System , the calculations you are referring to are to calculate the optimal weight and whether to make a split in the first place. The gradient and hessian here refer to the first and second derivatives of the loss function. Explicitely you are summing over all trees thus far, and all samples. In practice you would likely just use a batch of samples.
