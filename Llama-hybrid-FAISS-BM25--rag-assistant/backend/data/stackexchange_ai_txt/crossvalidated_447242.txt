There are reasons why t-sne is not used as a clustering algorithm. First, as you point out yourself, that t-sne does not generate any cluster assignments. Instead, it performs dimensionality reduction, embedding the data into a low dimensional space that is easy to visualize . You could, of course, use a standard clustering algorithm such as k-means on this embedding to get clusters. However, if the clusters exist in the data, you should not need to map it to 2D first. Secondly, and this is quite crucial, t-sne may create embedding containing clusters that don't really exist in the real data. Also, it may disregard clusters that do exist in the real data. Depending on the randomness in the algorithm and chosen hyperparameters, you may get very different results. I recommend reading the article How to Use t-SNE Effectively discussing some of these unexpected scenarios. Another, related issue is reproducibility of t-sne results. Finally, if there are real clusters in your data, you should be able to find them using standard, well understood clustering algorithms. Using methods that people understand gives way more credibility to your results and makes it easier to interpret them.
