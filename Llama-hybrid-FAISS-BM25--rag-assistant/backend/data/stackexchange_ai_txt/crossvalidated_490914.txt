Yes it is possible to do this with a Bayesian time series model. Predictions from Bayesian models are distributions rather than single values. Usually, these distribution are represented by samples (when using MCMC for example). So in practice, we can apply your "multiple output" idea for each sample, that is for a given sample, make a prediction one step ahead and then use this prediction to make another prediction one step ahead (so two steps ahead), and repeat this process as many times as you want. Doing that, each sample actually represents a predicted trajectory and the collection of samples gives you the predictive distribution of future trajectories.
