A latent class model (or latent profile, or more generally, a finite mixture model) can be thought of as a probablistic model for clustering (or unsupervised classification). The goal is generally the same - to identify homogenous groups within a larger population. I think the main differences between latent class models and algorithmic approaches to clustering are that the former obviously lends itself to more theoretical speculation about the nature of the clustering; and because the latent class model is probablistic, it gives additional alternatives for assessing model fit via likelihood statistics, and better captures/retains uncertainty in the classification. You might find some useful tidbits in this thread , as well as this answer on a related post by chl. There are also parallels (on a conceptual level) with this question about PCA vs factor analysis, and this one too.
