For debugging, add autocheck => 1 to the $mech object, it will print the error and return on the earliest unsuccessful call. Also, add a print $mech->content after the call to $mech->submit , You may be getting some error page, in which case you can try setting user agent: $mech->agent_alias( 'Windows IE 6' ) Or, maybe you need to get a cookie from an earlier page in order to upload. (you can test this by clearing cookies in your browser and trying to upload straight from the upload page)
