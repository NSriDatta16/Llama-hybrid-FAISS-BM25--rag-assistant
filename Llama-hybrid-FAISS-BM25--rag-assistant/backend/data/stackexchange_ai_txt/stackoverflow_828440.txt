The point of each particular unit test is not that it never breaks, but that it continues to work as long as the feature it tests for also works. That way, an accidental change to a tested feature produces a failed test you find out and not your end user. If the feature is changed on purpose, then you should expect to see some tests break. If you don't, then you didn't have enough coverage of the feature in the test suite.
