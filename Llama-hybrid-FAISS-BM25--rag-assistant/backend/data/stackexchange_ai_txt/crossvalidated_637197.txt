Goodness of fit in GLM produces NANs

I have a GLM model which has a quadratic term and looks like this. glm(formula = tumor_count ~ exp_val + I(exp_val^2), family = "poisson", data = x) tumor_count is the number of tumor cells in a region of tissue and exp_val is average expression of a gene in that region of a tissue. While the tumor_count is represented as the dependent variable (is a counts data 0, 1... and so on) and the independent variable exp_val is a numeric value (which could be fraction or a normalized value > 1 like counts per millions) I am doing this for multiple genes. I am getting the following error when I tried the ideas presented here glm in R - which pvalue represents the goodness of fit of entire model? When I do this I get the following error : pchisq( summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ deviance- summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ null.deviance, summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ df.residual- summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ df.null, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] NaN Warning message: In pchisq(summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ deviance - summary(count_glm_model $HOXA9)$ null.deviance, : NaNs produced I was wondering what I am doing wrong and how can I get a p-value defining the fit of the model?
