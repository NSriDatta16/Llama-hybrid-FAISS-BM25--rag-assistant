SQL Server returned column name truncated to 29 characters using PHP

I have a SQL Server query that I take the result from and insert into an array like while($row = mssql_fetch_array($res, MSSQL_ASSOC)) { ... } Now, the problem is that looking at the $row I see that the column named customer_social_sequrity_number becomes the key customer_social_sequrity_numbe . All other keys seems to be trunkated to 29 characters to. Is this a limit? I can't find any information about such a limit. This is a bit of a drag since I'm importing data from a 3rd party database and use the key of the array to mapp the data to an object. Does not seem to be a limitation on the PHP side as stated. Is it possibly some limitation on the SQL Server part? Running the query using MS Query Analyzer it seems fine.
