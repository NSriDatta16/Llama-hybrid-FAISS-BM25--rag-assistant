This is a very hard question. The first thing you need to awnser yourself is, do you really want your application to really run at the same speed or just appear to run the same speed? 99% of the time you only want it to appear to run the same speed. Now there are two problems: Speeding up you application or slowing it down. Speeding up your application is really hard, since that requires things like dynamic LOD that adjusts to the current speed. This means LOD in everything, not only graphics. Slowing your application down is fairly easy. You have two options sleeping or "busy waiting". It basically depends on your target frame rate for your simulation. If your simulation is way above something like 50 ms you can sleep. The problem is that when sleeping you are depended on the process scheduler and it works on average system at granularity of 10 ms. In games busy waiting is not such a bad idea. What you do is you update your simulation and render your frame, then you use an time accumulator for the next frame. When rendering frames without simulation you then interpolate the state to get a smooth animation.
