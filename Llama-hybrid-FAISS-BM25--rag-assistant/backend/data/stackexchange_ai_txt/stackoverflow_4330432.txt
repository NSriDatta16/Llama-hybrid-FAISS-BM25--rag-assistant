I expect that C# will be easier, if your goal is to learn a language well, as javascript is easy to modify but to do it well requires a great deal more effort. You can pick up on the basics of object-oriented programming easily, whereas there is a great deal of flexibility in javascript that allows you to do a great deal with little code, but with a steeper learning curve. What is your goal? Do you want to focus on writing some innovative webpages, where you are using HTML5 features? Then javascript would be the best option, as ASP.NET MVC is not going to push the boundaries of writing games in WebGL, or using the other new features available in HTML5. But, if you want something that will allow you more options, then C# can be used to help support web applications, as well as write desktop applications and enterprise apps, leveraging the power of .NET4.0. But, to really use .NET4 you will either need to use mono or use some version of Visual Studio, and if you use the express version then you will have some limitations. So, it may come down to cost, desires and goals, as to which one is better to start with, as they are very different.
