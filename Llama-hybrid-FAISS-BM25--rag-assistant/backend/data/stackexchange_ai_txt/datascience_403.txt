Why is there such a mismatch between the Model's predicted probability and theoretical probability in logistic regression?

I am trying to do Logistic Regression using SAS Enterprise Miner. My Independent variables are CPR/Inc (Categorical 1 to 7) OD/Inc (Categorical 1 to 4) Insurance (Binary 0 or 1) Income Loss (Binary 0 or 1) Living Arrangement (Categorical 1 to 7) Employment Status (categorical 1 to 8) My Dependent Variable is Default (Binary 0 or 1) The following is the output from running Regression Model. Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Estimates Standard Wald Parameter DF Estimate Error Chi-Square Pr > ChiSq Exp(Est) Intercept 1 -0.4148 0.0645 41.30 Now I used this Model to Score a new set of data. An example row of my new data is CPR - 7 OD - 4 Living Arrangement - 4 Employment Status - 4 Insurance - 0 Income Loss - 1 For this sample row, the model predicted output (Probability of default = 1) as 0.7335 To check this manually, I added the estimates Intercept + Emp Status 4 + Liv Arran 4 + Insurance 0 -0.4148 + 0.1100 + 0.0953 + 0.1256 = -0.0839 Odds ratio = Exponential(-0.0839) = 0.9195 Hence probability = 0.9195 / (1 + 0.9195) = 0.4790 I am unable to understand why there is such a mismatch between the Model's predicted probability and theoretical probability. Any help would be much appreciated . Thanks
