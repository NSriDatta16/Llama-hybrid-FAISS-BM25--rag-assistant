It turns out your question isn't well defined. Are you modeling the risk of default (Cox model for time-to-event outcome) or the probability of being in default (Logistic regression for probability with random effects, or lagged effects for prior default)? Furthermore, how are the covariates input to the model? You have many possible expressions for a covariate history $R_{i,t}$ . It can be as simple as modeling last month's income as a predictor of this month's risk of default - a time varying covariate in the Cox model. Hopefully no subject is in default at study timepoint 1, since you have a missing data problem in that case. Two lagged effects give more power and flexibility at the cost of higher dimensional analysis, and missing data for those who default at timepoint 2.
