vector (int *a) { for(int i=0; i This constructor couldn't possibly work. The v member is not initialized. You have not allocated storage for the values. The size member is uninitialized. The loop will try to read an undeterminate amount of values from the passed pointer. There is no way to initialize size . If you are given just an int* , there is no way to determine how large the pointed array is (if the pointer even points into an array in the first place). This is the reason, why the number of elements in the array has to be passed separately (and why plain arrays are a PITA).
