Fourier feature for multi seasonality

I am trying to forecast a univariate time series with multiple seasonality Something like this: library(forecast) fit Based on visualization my data show frequency of 7, 31 and 365. It is answered in few stack exchange answers that The value of K for fourier term can be chosen by minimizing the AIC. How would the pseudo code look like to find K for for each frequency ( 7, 31 and 365), to minimize AIC.
