replace(/([^A-Za-z0-9\s]+)\1+/, "") will remove repeated patterns of non-alphanumeric non-whitespace strings. However, this is a bad practice because you'll also be removing all non-ASCII European and other international language characters in the Unicode base. The only place where you really won't ever care about internationalization is in processing source code, but then you are not handling text quoted in strings and you may also accidentally de-comment a block. You may want to be more restrictive in what you try to remove by giving a list of characters to replace instead of the catch-all. Edit: I have done similar things before when trying to process early-version ShoutCAST radio names. At that time, stations tried to call attention to themselves by having obnoxious names like: > . I used used similar coding to get rid of repeated symbols, but then learnt (the hard way) to be careful in what I eventually remove.
