Gaussian process vs Neural Networks

Both Gaussian processes (GP) and Neural Networks (NN) are regression techniques that assume no underlying functional form of the response. How can these two methodologies be compared? What are the unique feature that a Gaussian process has that neural networks donâ€™t and vice versa? Also in the application of multivariate regression, both GP and NN can handle multiple outputs? But in what cases should the GP be used vs NN ?
