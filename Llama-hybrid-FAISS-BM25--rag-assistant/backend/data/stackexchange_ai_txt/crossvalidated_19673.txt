When the objective is to form/identify the relationship between two or more series , one might need to filter the stationary X variable in order to transform it to noise. This is a two step process , the differencing required and the ARMA structure . To retain objectivity and to avoid Model Specification Bias one should not assume the filter but rather construct that filter using the autocorrelative nature of the stationary X series. Then one takes the Y series and applies whatever differencing operators are necessary to make it stationary and then apply the previously developed filter to the stationary Y . This procedure has one and only one objective and that is to identify the relationship between between Y and X. One should never jump to conclusions about the required differencing operators, the ARMA filter and the relationship between the variables unless one is an econometrician who knows the model before they observe the data or if you speak directly to the almighty. Careful analysis regarding the normality of the errors requirement are necessary to believe any statistical test that may be computed. Computation of the F tests/ T tests is necessary but not sufficient. In summary I suggest that you pursue the subject of "How to Identify a Transfer Function Model" . Others and I have addressed this subject a number of times. If you wish you might peruse some of the answers to questions that have the tag "time series" attached to them. As Yogi said "You can observe a lot by simply reading / watching". Sometimes nice and simply answers can lead you astray and potentially overcomplicated/conservative answers like mine might require you to develop a better understanding of modelling time series data. As was once said "Toto, we are not in Kansas (i.e. cross-sectional data) anymore !"
