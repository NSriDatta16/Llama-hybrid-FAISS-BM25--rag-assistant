Since you have a different dataset, which is derived from a different data source, but there are some commonalities among them, you can try to adapt the model that you have produced for the first dataset (where we assume that we have a sufficient number of data available) to solve the new problem of the second dataset. In the literature this topic of machine learning is called Transfer Learning or in some cases you can find it as Domain Adaptation. The most important in this kind of adaptation/transfer is the kind of difference among the two datasets. They can have different marginal distributions or different feature spaces. In the latter case, which is called heterogeneous Transfer Learning, you need to find a way to align the two different feature spaces. If we assume that the source domain is the old dataset and the target domain is the newer one, then the Domain Adaptation process attempts to alter the source domain in a way to bring the distribution of the source closer to that of the target domain. Transfer Learning in comparison with Domain Adaptation, is a broader topic. Apart from the above explained difference in the marginal distributions or in feature spaces, Transfer Learning can also include the case when you want to transfer knowledge from an old task to a new and different one. Here are some surveys that analyzing the topic of Transfer Learning, PAN, S. J.; YANG, Q. A Survey on Transfer Learning.
