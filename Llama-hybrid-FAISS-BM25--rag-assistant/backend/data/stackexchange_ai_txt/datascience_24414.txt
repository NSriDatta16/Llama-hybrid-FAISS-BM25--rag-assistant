Can Reinforcement Learning work for Dutch auctions?

I had the following idea of Reinforcement Learning: There is the RL agent and the environment. The agent can execute actions, sends them to the environment and receives an observation and a reward (a float). Accounting problem: The reward might be delayed. Learning algorithms: Q-learning is one example. It basically tries to learn the mapping between State x Action to reward and works like this Can Reinforcement Learning work for a setting similar to Dutch auctions? The agent can make 3 actions: Increase, keep or lower the price The agents goal is to sell the item for the highest price. So the agent is the auctioneer. The auction item does not change. The bidders are anonymous and thus don't give a hint about their behavior. This means the observations are the same, only the time to the end gets lower - independently of the action of the agent.
