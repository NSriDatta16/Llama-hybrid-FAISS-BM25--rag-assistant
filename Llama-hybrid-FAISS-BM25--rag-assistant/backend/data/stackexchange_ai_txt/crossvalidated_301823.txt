Things are definitely nuanced here. Causation does not imply correlation nor even statistical dependence, at least not in the simple way we usually think about them, or in the way some answers are suggesting (just transforming $X$ or $Y$ etc). Consider the following causal model: $$ X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow U $$ That is, both $X$ and $U$ cause $Y$. Now let: $$ X \sim bernoulli(0.5)\\ U \sim bernoulli(0.5) \\ Y = 1- X - U + 2XU $$ Suppose you don't observe $U$. Notice that $P(Y|X) = P(Y)$. That is, even though $X$ causes $Y$ (in the non-parametric structural equation sense) you don't see any dependence! You can do any non-linear transformation you want and that won't reveal any dependence because there isn't any marginal dependency of $Y$ and $X$ here. The trick is that even though $X$ and $U$ cause $Y$, marginally their average causal effect is zero. You only see the (exact) dependence when conditioning both on $X$ and $U$ together (that also shows that $X\perp Y$ and $U\perp Y$ does not imply $\{X, U\} \perp Y$). So, yes, one could argue that, even though $X$ causes $Y$, the marginal causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is zero, so that's why we don't see dependence of $X$ and $Y$. But this just illustrates how nuanced the problem is, because $X$ does cause $Y$, not just in the way you naively would think (it interacts with $U$). So in short I would say that: (i) causality suggests dependence; but, (ii) the dependence is functional/structural dependence and it may or may not translate in the specific statistical dependence you are thinking of.
