Universal approximation is not a theorem about matching output of the model to given sampled variables (your $n$), but to a given function. As such, you do need to consider situations where $n/p \rightarrow \infty$. A (sufficiently complex 2+ layer) neural network can fit any such curve What you have done by looking at $n/p \rightarrow 0$ is shown that in high enough dimensional space, you can fit a hyperplane through any relatively small ($n The difference with neural networks is that a NN will fit an over-complex curve to simple data, but in order to perform your trick with linear regression, you need to add many more features than samples. It is not really a form of universal approximation, and has more in common with spurious correlations .
