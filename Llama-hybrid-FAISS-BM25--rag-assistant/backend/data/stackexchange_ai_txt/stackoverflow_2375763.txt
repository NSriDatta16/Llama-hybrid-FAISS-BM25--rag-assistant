How to open an URL in a QTableView

What is the best way to present a clickable URL in a QTableView (or QTreeView , QListView , etc...) Given a QStandardItemModel where some of the columns contain text with URLs I'd like them to become clickable and then handle the click by using QDesktopServices::openURL() I was hoping there would be some easy way to leverage QLabel 's textInteraction flags and to cram them into the table. I can't believe there's not an easier way to handle this. I really hope I'm missing something.
