There's an entire "How to predict the stock market with neural networks" cottage industry now that seems to have little to do with sound financial principles or rigorous time series analysis and everything to do with the current Deep Learning/Tensorflow hype. The blog post you mention seems to fall squarely within that category. That being said, some serious work on forecasting volatility with NNets has been done. See for example: Xu, Q., Liu, X., Jiang, C., & Yu, K. (2016). "Quantile autoregression neural network model with applications to evaluating value at risk" - Applied Soft Computing Borovykh, A., Bohte, S., & Oosterlee, C. W. (2017). "Conditional time series forecasting with convolutional neural networks" - arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04691
