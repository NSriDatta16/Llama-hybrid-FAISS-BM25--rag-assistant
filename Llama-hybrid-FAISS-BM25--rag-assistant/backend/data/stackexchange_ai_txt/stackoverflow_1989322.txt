Check for white space in any of the files that you are including. Just a single " " and PHP will send that output to the user agent (browser) and you can no longer do header things like change cookies or send header() data. That error states that index.php line 2 (the require) is causing something to be sent. So check to see if anything is output in that include or that the file includes blank lines/spaces at the end of the facebook.php file.
