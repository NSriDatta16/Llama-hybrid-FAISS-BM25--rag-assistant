Problem using include in Facelets

I have problems including a facelet template. I wanted to split some content up, so that I can reuse it somewhere else. So I changed this code: Title Header table To this: Title And inside admin-generic.xhtml I wrapped the code in a ui:composition. Header table But nothing is shown. I just get a blank page, with no errors. Is it wrong using ui:composition ? I have tried with ui:component but that didn't help either. Update : According to my Facelets Essentials Guide, it says: The ui:include tag can be used to include another Facelets file into your document. It simply includes whatever source file you specify. You can include any Facelets file that has ui:component or ui:composition tags (which trim the content outside themselves) or simply a fragment of XHTML or XML. Is that what is going on? Is the content outside of the include trimmed away? How can I just include the page, without the content outside being trimmed?
