How Do Machine Learning Models Work and Remember?

I am new to machine learning. I am confused about how a machine learning model remembers what it learns. And how it learns. I know the basic workflow of machine learning: first is data gathering, then data preprocessing, then creating training and test data sets, then training the ML learning algorithm. After training, we test the accuracy of our model with test data. But I am confused about how the algorithm is trained and how it remembers what it learns.
