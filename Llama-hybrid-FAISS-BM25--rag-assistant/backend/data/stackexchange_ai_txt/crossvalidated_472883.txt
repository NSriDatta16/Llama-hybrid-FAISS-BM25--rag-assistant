Regarding Convolution Neural Network

I have some question in CNN. Why should we add the 4th dimension eg. (1, 300, 300, 3) in model.predict() to the input image? What is the need for that 4th dimesnion? Shall we use image with RGBA values i.e., input_shape = (300, 300, 4) in keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation = 'relu', input_shape = (300, 300, 4)) ? I tried this but it says error: InvalidArgumentError : input depth must be evenly divisible by filter depth: 4 vs 3 . What should I do for images with RGBA values? I tried by converting it into RGB at model.predict() stage and it works fine. Is there any way to use without converting. Edit: Github link of entire code is below: https://github.com/beingmechon/rps_classification/blob/master/RPS_classification.ipynb
