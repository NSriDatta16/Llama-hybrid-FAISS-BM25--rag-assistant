You can use a variable as both "predictor" and "target". Imagine a simple regression problem, where past values of a variable are used to forecast future values of the same variable. Apart from that, you can have multiple predictor and target variables in the same problem. It is a multiple input / multiple output problem. A way of dealing with such problem with time series, is to deploy an LSTM-RNN that accepts multiple inputs and forecasts the signals of interest.
