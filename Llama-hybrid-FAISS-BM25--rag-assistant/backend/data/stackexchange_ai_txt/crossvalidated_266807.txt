In addition to the answer above, I would like to recommend this and this as additional reading. In STATA , it is possible to do an interaction term right off the regression command without generating an additional variable. Instead of having gen blck_educ = black * hsorged , you can run the command like: reg earn assignmt training afdc sex age married i.hsorged##i.black hispanic where i indicate dummy/factor variable (assuming both have only 0 or 1 in their values, other wise use c to indicate continuous variable). This way the code will be easier to read. The Interaction and its constitutive terms will be listed together and ease some interpretation when you generate tables etc. To greatly simplify your model, the first one, you have $$ earn = \alpha_1 hsorged + \alpha_2 black $$ In the one with interaction term, it becomes: $$ earn = \beta_1 hsorged + \beta_2 black + \beta_3 (hsorged \times black) $$ When the interaction is included, one should look at the statistical significance and coefficients with great attention to their substantive meanings because they are no longer the same. For instance, it is not surprising that the coefficient of black ($\beta_2$) has changed from -1744.983 to -876.932 in your analysis because the number now means a different thing: Without interaction, it means the average effect of black on earn With interaction, it means the average effect of black on earn when hsorged is set to 0. This is because when we do a derivative on earn with respect to black on the model with interaction, we will find that $$ \frac{d}{d(black)} earn = \beta_2 + \beta_3 hsorged $$ which shows that the effect of black on earn depend not just on $\beta_2$, but also the level of hsorged and its coefficient ($\beta_3$). So $\beta_2$ is now only the effect of black when hsorged = 0. The same logic also shows that $\beta_1$ is no longer the effect of hsorged but its effect when black = 0 Under this situation, it might be better to look at the effect of black when you set the value of hsorged to a range of possible values (in this case perhaps just 0 and 1?) This is doable in STATA with the command (if you specify the interaction term the way I did it above): margins dydx(hsorged black) at(hsorged=(0 1) black=(0 1)) after which marginsplot can also visualize the interactive relationship. Hope this helps in any way!
