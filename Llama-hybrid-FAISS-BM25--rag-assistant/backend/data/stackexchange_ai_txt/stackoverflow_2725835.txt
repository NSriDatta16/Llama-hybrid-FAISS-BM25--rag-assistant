I actually just posted my current approach to organising JS in Ruby on Rails . I have a namespaced JavaScript file for each of my controllers and then I use asset_packager to bind these many small files into a single file at deploy time. You could make this more granular and have a file for each action in a controller, but it means I have many small files scoped to small elements of functionality in the my system. Works really well.
