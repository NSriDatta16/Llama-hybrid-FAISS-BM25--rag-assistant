Measuring distance between two continuous distributions using their discrete approximations

I need to compute the distance between two continuous distributions. However, I have no idea as to what kind of distributions they are. I have a discrete approximation of the distributions. That is, the support is divided into multiple bins and the area of the pdf corresponding to each bin is given. Thus, the values I have can be thought of as a pmf (all non-negative values summing to 1). However, the catch is that the bins are not same for the two distributions. Is there a way to compute the distance between these two distributions? For eg, I could use KL divergence. But the values being sampled at different locations will cause a problem. I can circumvent this by resampling one of the distributions in accordance with the other by assuming piece-wise constancy. But I am looking for a more elegant measure which can compute the distance without resampling.
