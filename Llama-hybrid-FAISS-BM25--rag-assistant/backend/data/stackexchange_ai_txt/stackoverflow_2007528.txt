Adding nl2br to my Wordpress custom Meta Box

Okay let me see if I can explain this right. In wordpress we have a box to insert an excerpt. We need to add a second excerpt box. Instead of manually adding a custom field to every post I have placed a function to automatically add a custom field in the form of a Meta box on the admin post page. Okay so this is the problem that i'm having this function is working except for the fact that whatever you enter into this field it loses it's line breaks. So when our writers are contrubuting to this field in order to keep formatting of the block of text I have to manually add to the end of the paragraph. Here is my code: function my_create_post_meta_box() { add_meta_box( 'my-meta-box', 'Second Excerpt', 'my_post_meta_box', 'post', 'normal', 'high' ); } function my_post_meta_box( $object, $box ) { ?> Second Excerpt With Images for Post List Page ID, 'Second Excerpt', true ), 1 ); ?> " /> Thanks and any help would do.
