correlation with time

I have data that represents starting time and duration, and I need to know if they are correlated. I thought to convert time to int , considering only the hour, and use Pearson correlation. I don't know if it really makes sense to use Pearson correlation with time. It sounds like checking the trend of a time series. Do you think this can be correct? I also wonder: Is the time supposed to be a categorical datum, in which case Pearson is not really the best way to quantify the correlation?
