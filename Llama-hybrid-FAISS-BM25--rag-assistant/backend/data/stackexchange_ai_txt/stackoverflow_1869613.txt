How to create a month-view control in Silverlight

I need to create a outlook like monthview-control for showing appointments. (a grid showing all days in a month, with the weekdays aligned vertically. Day number and dayofweek should be shown for every day, and the appointments should be shown in a listview inside the correct day) And I need some input on where to start. Say the ViewModel would look something like this: public class MonthViewModel { public List DaysInMonth { get; set; } public List Appointments { get; set; } } public class Appointment { public string Title { get; set; } public DateTime Start { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } } Do I need to manually lay out the days, and place the appointments, or can I do it more elegant? I've tried several apporoches with binding but all unsuccessful. Any hints on what to do? Regards Larsi
