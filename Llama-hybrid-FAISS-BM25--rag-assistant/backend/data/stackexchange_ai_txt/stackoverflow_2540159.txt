This is what I did to speed up everything, this way I never have to create new sets. public static void lambda(HashSet s){ if(end(s)){ return; } ArrayList diff = new ArrayList (); for(int i=0;i On average this is much faster, and the program spend roughly the same amount of time on the addAll and removeAll.
