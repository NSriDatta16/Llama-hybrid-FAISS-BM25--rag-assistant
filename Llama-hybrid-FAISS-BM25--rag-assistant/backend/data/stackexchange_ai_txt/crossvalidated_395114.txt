Random effects for a mixed multinomial logistic regression in R?

I have a dataset in which individuals, each belonging to a particular group, repeatedly chose between multiple discrete outcomes. Something akin to: subID group choice 1 Red A 1 Red B 2 Blue B 2 Blue B 2 Blue C 3 Red A 3 Red B I'm interested in how group membership predicts choice, and want to account for non-independence of observations due to repeated choices being made by the same individuals. In turn, I planned to implement a mixed multinomial regression treating subID as a random effect. It would appear that mlogit is a common route for mixed logits. However, I am a bit unclear as to how to set the desired random effect. I was wondering: Does that seem like the best approach for R-based analysis? In reviewing the discussions had here and here , I'm a bit thrown off by the mlogit scheme. Can I indeed account for subID via the rpar argument? Any guidance would be thoroughly appreciated.
