Elegant way to check for missing packages and install them?

I seem to be sharing a lot of code with coauthors these days. Many of them are novice/intermediate R users and don't realize that they have to install packages they don't already have. Is there an elegant way to call installed.packages() , compare that to the ones I am loading and install if missing?
