Show posterior mean can be written as a weighted average of the prior mean and MLE

Suppose $Y_1, \dots Y_n$ are exponentially distributed: $Y_i | \lambda \sim Exp(\lambda)$ . Find the conjugate prior for $\lambda$ , and the corresponding posterior distribution. Show that the posterior mean for the failure rate $\lambda$ can be written as a weighted average of the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimator, $\hat{\lambda}=\bar{y}^{-1}$ . Given that the joint pdf as follow:- $P(Y_i | \lambda)=\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i}$ Then the likelihood function is $ L (\lambda | Y_i)\propto \lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}$ which give Gamma distribution with $\alpha = n+1$ and $\beta =\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$ . Thus, with the prior density $P(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{a-1} e^{- \lambda b}$ gives the posterior distribution as follow:- $P(\lambda | Y_i) \propto \lambda^{n+a-1} e^{-\lambda (\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i + b)}$ and resulting in Gamma distribution with $\alpha = n+a$ and $\beta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i + b$ . My problem now is how can I show the posterior mean for the failure rate Î» can be written as a weighted average of the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimator? As far I get as the following:- $E[\lambda | Y] = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{n+a}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i + b}$ Can anyone help me to show how the posterior mean above can be written as a weighted average of the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimator, $\hat{\lambda}=\bar{y}^{-1}$ ?
