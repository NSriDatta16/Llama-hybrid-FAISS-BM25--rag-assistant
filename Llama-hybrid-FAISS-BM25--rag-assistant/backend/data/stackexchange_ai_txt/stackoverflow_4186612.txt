How can I get the actual culture name from an iPhone web app?

CLARIFIED: This is a JavaScript Web Application not a Native Object-C application. I have a web application running on the iPhone that I need to globalize. I've configured Settings->General->International->Region Format to "United Kingdon" and left Language as "English". Upon inspection of the User Agent string I'm seeing the following: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0 like Mac OS X; en-us ) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/8A293 I would expect to en-GB but I'm seeing en-us. I've even tried restarting the iPhone and it remains en-us.
