What is the meaning of mean? Is the mean in column or row? The "mean" is for each column (a.k.a "feature" or "parameter"): the average value for the given feature. It is important to perform "standardization" (a.k.a "center-reduce") so that each feature can be "compared" to each other: when performing LDA, the variance is analysed to a feature that varies between $0$ and $100 000$ would be seen as having a better "discriminating power" compared to a feature that varies between $-1$ and $1$ . See the answer linked to by @Renthal for the math behind it.
