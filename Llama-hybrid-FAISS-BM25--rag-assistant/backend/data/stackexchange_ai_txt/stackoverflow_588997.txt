Whether it's x i or x r is irrelevant - it's the random number that we're feeding into function f(). I'm more likely to write the function (aside from formatting) as follows: (x 2 -x 1 ) * sum(f(x i ))/N That way, we can see that we're taking the average of N samples of f(x) to get an average height of the function, then multiplying by the width (x2-x1). Because, after all, integration is just calculating area under the curve. (Nice pictures at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/integ.html#c4 .
