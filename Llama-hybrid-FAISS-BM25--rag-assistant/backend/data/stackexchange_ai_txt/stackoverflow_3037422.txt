If you give the pictureboxes an OnMouseDown event that says something like this: (sender as PictureBox).DoDragDrop(sender, DragDropEffects.Copy); Then you can set the panels' AllowDrop property to true, and in their OnDragDrop event, you can get their name like this: string myName = (sender as Panel).Name; Edit: Also, you need to give the panels an OnDragEnter event like this: e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy; Of course, you can change Copy to Move or Link or whatever is appropriate for what you're doing. It just changes the mouse-pointer icon that's used.
