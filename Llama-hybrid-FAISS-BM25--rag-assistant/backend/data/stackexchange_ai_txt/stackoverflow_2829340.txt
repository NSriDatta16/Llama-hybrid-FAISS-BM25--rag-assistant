machine learning and code generator from strings

The problem: Given a set of hand categorized strings (or a set of ordered vectors of strings) generate a categorize function to categorize more input. In my case, that data (or most of it) is not natural language. The question: are there any tools out there that will do that? I'm thinking of some kind of reasonably polished, download, install and go kind of things, as opposed to to some library or a brittle academic program. (Please don't get stuck on details as the real details would restrict answers to less generally useful responses AND are under NDA.) As an example of what I'm looking at; the input I'm wanting to filter is computer generated status strings pulled from logs. Error messages (as an example) being filtered based on who needs to be informed or what action needs to be taken.
