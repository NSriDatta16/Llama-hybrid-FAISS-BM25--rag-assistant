Querying data with JavaScript

I am currently looking for an intelligent best practice solution for the following problem. Within a web page, I want to make use of data that is currently organised in some MySQL tables. Problem : I cannot access the database from the webserver, so I am not able to query the data using SQL. Therefore, I thought to transform the data into something JavaScript can handle (e.g. JSON) and perform all the operations on the data on client-side. Doing SQL-like queries on an object will probably be kind of hard, even if those I need will probably be easy (simple SELECTs). Is there a elegant way to do that? Some nice little javascript library? Thanks in advance for your ideas.
