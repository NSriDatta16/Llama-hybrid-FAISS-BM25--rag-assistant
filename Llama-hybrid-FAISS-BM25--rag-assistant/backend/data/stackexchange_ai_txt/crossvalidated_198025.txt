What are the variance and standard deviation for the bin counts for n rolls on a standard six-sided die?

I'm having trouble imagining what variance and deviation mean with a series of die rolls. That is, a fair die will fall with a flat distribution on all its values 1-6 in 6 bins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) over time (as n goes towards infinity). Firstly, does the concept of variance really make sense on such a question? [Edit: only if I provide some data on bin outcomes. Say n=36, and the die lands as follows: 1 (6 times), 2 (5x), 3 (5x), 4 (7x), 5 (7x), 6 (6x).] The average outcome will be n/6 over time for each of the six bins [Edit: My prior writeup was confusing, as I had said the mean was 3.5 -- but this mean face-value is irrelevant to the question.] Is this question even valid? It seems a perfectly flat distribution (as n-> infinity), with no other hidden variables, has no variance (or shouldn't have any), but then what should one make of the results when n is finite?
