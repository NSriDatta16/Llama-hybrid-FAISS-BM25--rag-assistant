An even faster way is to use lookup tables. Since you know all the values are intensities between 0 and 255, you construct the binary equivalent of each to speed up the process. % build table (computed once) [using gnovice option#1] lookupTable = cell2mat(arrayfun(@(i)bitget([0:255]',9-i),1:8,'UniformOutput',0)); % random' image I = randi(256, [240 320])-1; % decimal to binary conversion binI = lookupTable(I(:)+1,:); On my machine, it took on average 0.0036329 seconds (only the conversion). Note the lookup table has almost no space overhead: >> whos lookupTable Name Size Bytes Class Attributes lookupTable 256x8 2048 uint8
