Reaching child records in a SQL Server table

Out of my lack of SQL Server experience and taking into account that this task is a usual one for Line of Business applications, I'd like to ask, maybe there is a standard, common way of doing the following database operation: Assume we have two tables, connected with each other by one-to-many relationship, for example SalesOderHeader and SalesOrderLines http://s43.radikal.ru/i100/1002/1d/c664780e92d5.jpg Field SalesHeaderNo is a PK in SalesOderHeader table and a FK in SalesOrderLines table. In a front-end app a User selects some number of records in the SalesOderHeader table, using for example Date range, or IsSelected field by clicking checkbox fields in a GridView. Then User performs some operations (let it be just "move to another table") on selected range of Sales Orders. My question is: How, in this case, I can reach child records in the SalesOrderLines table for performing the same operations (in our case "move to another table") over these child records in as easy, correct, fast and elegant way as possible?
