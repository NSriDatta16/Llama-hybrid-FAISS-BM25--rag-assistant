Given the nature of your data, I'm not sure I understand the point of functional modelling (apart from the fact that the data are linked temporally with a certain smoothness, given that the weight of the participants won't vary too much). Indeed, you could also assume that you have $n$ vectors of observations in $R^4$ and perform a standard multivariate PCA. What are FPCs In either case (whether you decide to treat things with functional or multivariate modelling) the FPCs represent the scalar products of the observations (seen as a function in a Hilbert space of functions or a vector in $R^4$ ) with the eigenfunctions/vectors of the covariance operator/matrix. For a formal definition of this quantity in the functional framework see equation (7.24) on page 193 of Tailen Hsing, Randall Eubank (2015) (for the vectorial PCA case any lecture on the subject should contain this information). Interpreting FPCs As a result, to interpret the FPCs correctly, you need to have interpreted the eigenfunctions/vectors correctly. I can't go into too much detail on this point, as I'm clueless on the subject of weighloss. Interpretation of the eigenfunctions/vectors is generally a job for people who know the field in question (for example, in the case of data on monitoring weight loss of human beings, I would think of doctors or biologists). Nevertheless, in view of the information you give us on the data, a fairly plausible explanation of your observations can be given, keeping in mind that the FPCs are the results of the scalar products between the observations and the eigenfunctions/vectors. Probable interpretation of your results A fortiori, if the norm of an observation is large it will tend to have a large FPC. Here, participant number 1180 is probably one of the heaviest participants. Also, bearing in mind that prior to a principal component analysis we have centred the data, negative FPCs (for example participant 1679) probably often indicate that this is a person whose weight is below average (in the code the FPC1 vector only has positive entries). I don't have access to the data in question, so I'll leave comments about interpretations concerning participants as mere hypotheses. They shouldn't be too difficult to corroborate/infirm by looking at the participants' data more closely: for example, to your 'strong positive / strong negative' table you could add a 'person's average weight' column (which gives a good idea of the norm of the observation vectors and the influence of centring on the sign.
