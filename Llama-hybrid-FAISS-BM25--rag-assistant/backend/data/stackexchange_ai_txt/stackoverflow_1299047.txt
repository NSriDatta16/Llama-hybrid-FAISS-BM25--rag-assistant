Tcl/Tk was designed to embed scripting into C programs and is probably the easiest of any language to do this with. It has several mechanisms for doing this embedding. The API makes it very easy to retrofit it to command-line C programs using argv as it has calls for converting native Tcl data structures to and from char** . It also has GUI toolkit called Tk that is somewhat basic but very easy to use and substantially more flexible than you might think. In your case, the two mechanisms you would probably use in Tcl are the embedding where you just call main with the arguments passed from your Tcl program. The other is to fork the process with appropriate command line args and wait for it to complete. Both are fairly easy to accomplish with Tcl. I'm not aware of any QT bindings for Tcl but it is very portable and Tk can be themed thesedays so it doesn't look like a 1990 vintage Motif app. Se this posting for a more in-depth discussion of the topic.
