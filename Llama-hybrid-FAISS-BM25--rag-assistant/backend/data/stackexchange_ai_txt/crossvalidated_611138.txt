If I write $\rm{X}$ the matrix of the 7 last numerical columns, then a PCA should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\rm{X}^TX$ , a 7x7 square matrix corresponding to your 7D parameter space. Whether that or the converse computation on the transposed matrix happens depends on the software you're using, but anyway you'll see very quickly how many eigenvalues you get, either 7 or your number of rows... Your initial PCA should help you see whether the 3 groups are clustered in different parts of the parameter space, hopefully finding subspace dimensions to which you can attribute a meaning. Individual PCAs on the separate groups will describe the (group-specific) correlation between gene expressions, a valid but completely different question. In short, you can (and probably should) do both. Keep in mind though that the PCA is sensitive to the normalization of your variables; your choices there will be markedly reflected in the results.
