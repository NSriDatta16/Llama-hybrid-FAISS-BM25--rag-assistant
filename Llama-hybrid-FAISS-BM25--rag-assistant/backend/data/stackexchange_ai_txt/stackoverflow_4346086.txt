Edit: initial statement redacted, the standard actually does provide a full definition for the stack adaptor, nothing left to implentors. see top answer. You want a container that has a push and pop method and allows you to inspect elements anywhere in the container and uses a std::vector for storage. There is such a container in the standard template library it is called std::vector . Use std::stack only for bondage purposes
