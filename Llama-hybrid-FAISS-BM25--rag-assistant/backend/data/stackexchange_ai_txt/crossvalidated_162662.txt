@OncoStat just answered with something that implies this approach while I was writing up this answer: don't test the differences between the ROCs but rather the area under them. If you use the same folds in each experiment, you then have a classic paired test, in which case you can use a paired difference test , either $t$ or Wilcoxon. If your folds aren't consistent across the experiments, instead do an unpaired test. Alternatively, here's a slight reframing: instead of averaging, consider the random ROC for each experiment, so that you have three distributions with ten (curve-valued) samples from each. Then you want to know if those distributions differ. Assuming that the folds aren't paired, you can do a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) test . That requires a kernel between curves; a reasonable first-guess powerful choice might be a Gaussian kernel based on the functional $L_2$ distance, $k(f, g) = \exp\left( - \gamma \lVert f - g \rVert_2^2 \right)$, choosing $\gamma$ to maximize the MMD statistic .
