What has happened is that the estimates of the individual subject means have been shrunk towards the group mean, causing the std. deviation of the subject means (and consequently that of the mean of the subject means) to be "too small". This shrinkage is part and parcel of the hierarchical Bayesian approach. The group_mu values are the ones that you want. You can see in a more empirical manner that the group_mu values are correct by comparing the width of the observed 95% credible interval from your quantile summary to the width of the confidence interval you would expect in classical statistics if you had directly observed the 50 true subject means. In this case, that's just $1.96/\sqrt{50}$, or +/- 0.28, which corresponds pretty well to the quantile results you displayed above for group_mu : (-0.26,+0.25). Since you can't do better than you could if you'd actually observed the 50 subject means, it follows that the credible interval shouldn't be much smaller than the confidence interval (as you're not adding any substantial prior information to the likelihood.) Clearly the (-0.1, 0.09) quantiles of the alternative mean are too close to 0, by this comparison. In fact, you can use the ratio of the std. deviation of the mean of the estimated subject means to the std. deviation of group_mu as an index of how much shrinkage has taken place. (It's not the only such metric; I'm just pointing it out since you're calculating them both anyway.) If you have a very small ratio, that indicates, in a heuristic sense, that the hierarchical part of the model isn't adding much, and assuming all the subject means are the same may be a plausible alternative. Conversely, if the ratio is near one, that also indicates that the hierarchical part of the model isn't adding much, and just having a "fixed effects" model for the subject means would likely be almost as good - questions of modeling approaches etc. aside.
