Open file, read it, process, and write back - shortest method in Python

I want to do some basic filtering on a file. Read it, do processing, write it back. I'm not looking for "golfing", but want the simplest and most elegant method to achieve this. I came up with: from __future__ import with_statement filename = "..." # or sys.argv... with open(filename) as f: new_txt = # ...some translation of f.read() open(filename, 'w').write(new_txt) The with statement makes things shorter since I don't have to explicitly open and close the file. Any other ideas ?
