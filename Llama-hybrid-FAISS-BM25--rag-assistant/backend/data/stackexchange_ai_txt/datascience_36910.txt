It is not an indicator of quality if a clustering can be easily predicted by a classifier such as random forest. In particular with k-means I would argue that the opposite is true. You have 800 features. With so many festures. You usually have a scaling problem in k-means. In the worst case. The entire result only depends on a single feature. In this degenerate case, a single feature is enough, and a classifier will achieve 100% accuracy. So the conclusion "good classifier, hence good clustering" is clearly wrong.
