By default, random search and grid search are terrible algorithms unless one of the following holds. Your problem does not have a global structure, e.g., if the problem is multimodal and the number of local optima is huge Your problem is noisy, i.e., evaluating the same solution twice leads to different objective function values The budget of objective function calls is very small compared to the number of variables, e.g., smaller than 1x or 10x. The number of variables is very small, e.g., smaller than 5 (in practice). a few other conditions. Most people claim that random search is better than grid search. However, note that when the total number of function evaluations is predefined, grid search will lead to a good coverage of the search space which is not worse than random search with the same budget and the difference between the two is negligible if any. If you start to add some assumptions, e.g., that your problem is separable or almost separable, then you will find arguments to support grid search. Overall, both are comparably terrible unless in very few cases. Thus, there is no need to distinguish between them unless some additional assumptions about the problem are considered.
