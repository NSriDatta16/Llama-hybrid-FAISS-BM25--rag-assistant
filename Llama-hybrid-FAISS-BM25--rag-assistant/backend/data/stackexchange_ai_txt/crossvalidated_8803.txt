IME, the confidence interval is useful as it gives a sense of how uncertain your estimates are. Its a good way to check how variable your results might be, and to give others a sense for how likely the results are to be within a particular range. That being said, the typical interpretation of one is that 95 (for a 95% interval) times of 100 if this experiment were repeated, the true value of the mean (or whatever you've calculated the interval for) would lie in this range. So it does not tell you that it is 95% certain that the true value lies within that range. On the other hand, a bayesian credible interval will tell you this, but these are not as widely used.
