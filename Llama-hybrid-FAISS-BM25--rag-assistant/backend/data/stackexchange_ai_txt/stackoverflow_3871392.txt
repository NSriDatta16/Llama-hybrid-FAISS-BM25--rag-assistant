Stretchable image stretching part wider than 1px

I would like to create a UIButton which uses a stretchable image as Background image such as that I can easily resize the button for different labels etc. So I created the following code which works fine: UIImage *bgImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"Button-Template.png"]stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:2 topCapHeight:2]; UIButton *loginButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; loginButton.frame = CGRectMake(180, 280, 112, 40); [loginButton setBackgroundImage:bgImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; // some more stuff Now here is the catch: The iPhone SDK assumes that the strechable part of the image is exactly one pixel in width, which is not the case in my image as I want to create a pattern, which requires a repetition every two pixels (so 2 Pixels are one pattern unit). I have found no information in the docs whether it is possible to alter the value of the strechable part width (in my case 2 instead of 1), does anybody know how to do this or how I could achieve my goal with a workaround? Writing the stretching part on my own seems a little far fetched right now (though I might have to get back to this). Thanks!
