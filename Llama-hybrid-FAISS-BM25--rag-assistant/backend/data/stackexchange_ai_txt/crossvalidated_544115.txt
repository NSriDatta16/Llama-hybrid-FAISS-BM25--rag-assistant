Why is the mean of confidence interval the same as the coefficients in Logistic Regression?

I'm currently using statsmodels library to train a Logistic Regression. However, I noticed that logit.conf_int().mean(axis=1) and logit.param generates the same values. Why is that? What am I missing regarding confidence interval and coefficients relation? I'm calling 'logit' the following model: import statsmodels.formula.api as smf logit = smf.logit(formula=function, data=df).fit() I know I should share some data, but I don't think this is relevant in here, since you can achieve the same thing with any data you have available.
