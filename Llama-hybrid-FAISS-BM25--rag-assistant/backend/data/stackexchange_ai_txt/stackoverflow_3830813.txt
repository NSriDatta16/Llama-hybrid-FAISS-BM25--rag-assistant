In Reference.cs , you can find an existing attribute, like [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()] and do a search and replace with [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()][System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCode()] . The major drawback is that you have to redo this each time you update the reference. I don't understand why MS does not make the code coverage tool smart enough to skip service reference generated code.
