In our project we found some solution of this problem. We had to create complex raports with many active elements in each row (buttons for edit, accept etc.). We created div that is placed in updatepanel (for updating whole table when needed). In this div we created table with header definition and separate tables for eaach rows (those tables are put in update panels). For creating equal columns in each rows we have to use css classes for each table cell. So, we have something like this (in each row we have few buttons, dropdowns, tooltips, etc. but to understand idea I've truncated it to single column): Name John It is not elegant and generates large HTML, but works.
