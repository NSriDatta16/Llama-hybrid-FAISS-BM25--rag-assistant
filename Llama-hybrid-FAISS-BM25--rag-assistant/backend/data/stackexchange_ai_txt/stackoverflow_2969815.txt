Sharepoint tools for document version control

Does anyone know of any tools for extending the functionality of Sharepoint's existing version control system for Office documents? It'd be great to be able to do branching/merging, or to store versions as "deltas" off the previous to cut down on storage used. Any suggestions at all would be helpful. Thanks in advance!
