I am assuming you are using the image-processing toolbox in matlab. To distinguish text in an image. You might want to follow: Grayscale (speeds up things greatly). Contrast enhancement. Erode the image lightly to remove noise (scratches/blips) Dilation (heavy). Edge-Detection ( or ROI calculation). With Trial-and-error, you'll get the proper coefficients such that the image you obtain after 5th step will contain convex regions surrounding each letter/word/line/paragraph. NOTE: Essentially the more you dilate, the larger element you get. i.e. least dilation would be useful in identifying letters, whereas comparitively high dilation would be needed to identify lines and paragraphs. Online ImgProc MATLAB docs Check out the "Examples in Documentation" section in the online docs or refer to the image-processing toolbox documentation in Matlab Help menu. The examples given there will guide you to the proper functions to call and their various formats. Sample CODE (not mine)
