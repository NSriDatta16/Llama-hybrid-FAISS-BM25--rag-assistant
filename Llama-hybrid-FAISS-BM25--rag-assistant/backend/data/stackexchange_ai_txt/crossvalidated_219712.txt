Where does the conditional part of conditional logistic regression come from?

I am trying to fully understand where the conditional part of the term conditional logistic regression comes from. In particular, I can't seem to find a source in the literature that emphasizes that you are conditioning on some sort of sufficient statistic for the stratum parameters. Additionally, I can't seem to find a source that explains the intuition behind conditioning on such statistics.
