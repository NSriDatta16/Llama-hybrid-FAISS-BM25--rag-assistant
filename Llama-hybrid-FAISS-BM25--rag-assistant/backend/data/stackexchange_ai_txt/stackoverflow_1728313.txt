Is it possible to have a single physical USB device appear as two separate device classes?

I am in the early stages of development of a device requiring USB connectivity. As a minimum the device must appear as a legacy serial port, but it would be useful if it could simultaneously appear as a mass-storage device. Is this possible, or will the device need to switch between mass-storage and communications-device so that it is only one thing at a time? **[edit]**I was probably a bit quick in firing off a question; this suggests that it can indeed be done, using the USB Composite Device Framework . I'd still be interested if anyone has any experience of this and might have some tips or pointers, what platform was used, and what if any third-party tools or stacks they may have used.
