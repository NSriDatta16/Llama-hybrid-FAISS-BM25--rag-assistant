Are there any Java open source projects with both integration and unit test suites?

I am looking for an open source Java project containing two reasonably complete test suites: a suite of integration tests and a suite of unit tests , for the same code. Note that I am only interested in developer tests , written with JUnit or TestNG. I ask this because I often see people saying that having both unit and integration tests is necessary. But so far I don't know of any codebase with both kinds of test coverage. Does anyone know of any such project?
