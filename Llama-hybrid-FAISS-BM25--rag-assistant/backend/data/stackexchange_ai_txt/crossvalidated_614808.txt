If you have sufficiently long time series, you could run your DCC model on monthly data. Then you would have matching data frequencies for your dependent and independent variables. However, there seems to be no ARCH effect when using monthly data, while this problem does not occur when using daily data. Even if there are no ARCH patterns in monthly data, there might still be DCC patterns there. Note that in principle the DCC model can take any univariate conditional variance model as an input; it does not have to be GARCH. However, some software implementations (such as the rmgarch package in R) only allow univariate GARCH inputs to DCC. In such a case you may either create a fake object of the appropriate GARCH class but with constant conditional variance or use a GARCH model with restricted parameter values, e.g. $\alpha=0.001$ and $\beta=0.999$ that will produce a virtually constant conditional variance.
