@f coopens gave the theoretical approach (+1), but here are a couple of other alternatives for those of us who like making the computer do the work rather than thinking hard: Bootstrapping, with such small sample sizes I would not trust the non-parametric bootstrap, but if you had big enough sample sizes then you could take bootstrap samples and for each pair of samples calculate the means and the ratio, then look at the quantiles of the bootstrapped ratios. Parametric bootstrapping, if you are happy with the normality/t assumptions then you can generate a bunch of "means" from a normal or t with the appropriate means and sd, then compute the ratios and look at the quantiles of the bootstrap ratios. Bayesian, (with small samples this will work best with an informative prior). The nice thing with using McMC techniques to do Bayes is that you can look at the ratio of the means in each itteration and it will give you the posterior for the ratio without needing to work out the theory.
