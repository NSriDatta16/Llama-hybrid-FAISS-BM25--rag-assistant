ROC Curve has good AUC but logistic regression not statistically significant?

I ran a logistic regression with 1 predictor for dichotomous outcome, and the predictor was not statistically significant. I ran an ROC curve with the same variable, and got AUC around .70 which is fairly good predictive ability. How do I explain these discrepant results with the same variables?
