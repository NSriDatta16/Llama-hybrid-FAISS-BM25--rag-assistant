So you actually want the user to prove that he is who he claims he is, without revealing information about himself (assuming you can get ANY information with social hacking) There are 3 ways for authentication: Something you are (biometrics), Something you have (dongle for example) and Something you know (password,response...). 2 or 3-way authentication is much more secure than 1-way. Password reset/recovery, by definition reduces the security of the authentication procedure, because its now not A, but (A or B). (A= password, B=recover-password) Therefore, even if your authentication procedure is 1-way (password), your recovery processes should be a 2-way authentication. Let's see what are your options for the password recovery process: Something you are (SysAdmin that recognize you - usually not good for 5000 workers organization, Voice-print - too expensive to implement, ...) Something you have (e-mail account, phone number, ...) Something you know (personal details) Notice that corporate-ID tag with picture is a 2-way authentication (both something you are and something you have). I think the best procedure is for the employee to physically go to the IT department, show his picture ID, and ask for a password reset. If this is infeasible (too far - a remote branch for example), try to use a deligator who is recognized and can be trusted over the phone, so the employee will have to show the ID-tag to a local deligator. If you can't use the 'Something you are' - you're left with something you have (e-mail, phone-number,your own PC) and something you know (personal details...). You can't escape it.
