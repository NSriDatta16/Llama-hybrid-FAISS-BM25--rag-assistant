Problem with MySQL storage of a Craigslist parse

I'm using MagpieRSS to parse a Craigslist feed. The "title" field is: ***BUYING ALL BRAND NEW BLACKBERRY IN ANY QUANTITY BOLD~JAVELLIN~ONYX (Gramercy) $100000 and I'm using if( preg_match( "/\(*\)*\d+$/", $title, $matches ) ) to figure out the price. $matches[0] should have the price, if I'm not mistaken. However, when I put it in my MySQL table (DOUBLE datatype), it comes in as 100. It seems to only take the first 3 digits after the $. I've run this through preg_match checkers all over the web, but nada. Any thoughts?
