Thanks, reckoner, glad that you like the HTML output from coverage. I've never done anything to combine it with a profiler, and haven't heard of anyone else doing it either. When I created the HTML output, I had in the back of my mind the idea of having it be a generalized source-code-with-tool-annotations facility, but it was enough work just getting it built only for coverage!
