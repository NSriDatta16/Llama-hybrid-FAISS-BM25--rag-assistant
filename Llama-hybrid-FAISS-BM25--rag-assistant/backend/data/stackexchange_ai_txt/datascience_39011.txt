One approach to consider: You will need a similarity measure (say cosine similarity), S(A,B) between two pieces of text, and a way to threshold this measure. For a specific answer A_i, compute the average of similarity scores S(A_i, A_j) between A_i, and all other answers A_j. Call this Sim_i. Compute Sim_i, for all answers A_i. Take the least of all Sim_i, as the threshold similarity, Sim_T Given a new answer A_new, compute its score, Sim_new with respect to all answers. If Sim_new >= Sim_T, then accept the answer, else reject it. The idea is that the new answer should be accepted if it is "similar" to other known answers. How similar should it be? This is estimated using the similarity between known answers. This is the broad approach. The similarity measure and threshold computation can be experimented with.
