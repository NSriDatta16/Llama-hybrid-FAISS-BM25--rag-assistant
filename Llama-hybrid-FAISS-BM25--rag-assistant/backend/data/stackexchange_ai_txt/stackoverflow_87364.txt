Check your User Agent string. This same thing happened to me one time and I realized it was because I was testing out some pages as "googlebot". The JavaScript that is generated depends on knowing what the user agent is. From http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=tr&comments_parentId=160492&forumId=1 : To reset your user agent string type about:config into the location bar and press enter. This brings up a list of preferences. Enter general.useragent into the filter box, this should show a few preferences (probably 4 of them). If any have the status user set, right-click on the preference and choose Reset
