The Advantages of the Javascript solution are mainly that you dont need to reload the page which is very nice for the user. On the other hand you have the visitors with javascript disabled who wont be able to load the different pages. Also you cannot navigate over Javascript pages with the browser's back and forth buttons. The last thing I see is that your code could become messy if you're not very careful and organized.
