Are overdispersion and underdispersion in a binomial logistic regression model an issue if the model is not being used to make predictions?

If a binomial logistic regression model is being used strictly to identify variables that have an impact on the dependent variable but is not being used to make predictions, are underdispersion and over dispersion still an issue?
