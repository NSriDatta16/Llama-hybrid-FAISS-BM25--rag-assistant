Very High Level Discussion - Context Diagrams where the boxes might represent classes, packages, or sub-systems. High Level Design - Sequence diagrams which show the interface between sub-systems, still no classes directly used but may be implied from this. Detailed Design - Sequence diagrams which are at the class level. If there is a tricky algorithm for something such as the correlation of multiple data streams into a new stream then I will generally use a Flow Chart to work out the algorithm. If the solution requires knowledge of state then a State diagram is also used. Those are the ones I use most. When doing Data Warehouse design I draw Star Schemas to work out how to store the data. When doing Transactional DB design I use Entity Relationship diagrams to work our data storage. When designing a UI I just sketch it out. Once I start to get some parts of the UI worked out and want to play with some areas I will make a template, print out a copy copies and then use that as a guide to work on sub-sections. For colour schemes, it can be handy to make a graphic using the gimp and have layers for each piece of the design and then play with the layers colouring each one to find the right balance.
