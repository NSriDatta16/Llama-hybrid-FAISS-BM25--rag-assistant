What it does: This code, apparently, defines the top-level global google object, which has one main function, google.log . google.log seems to grab an image from the url: www.google.com/gen_204?atyp=... with a time-stamp to avoid caches. After this image loads, it deletes itself. google.log then appears to be using some tracking mechanism (similar to Google Analytics) to track visits to the page. Explanation for the weird obfuscation: All Google code is compiled by the Closure Compiler in Advanced mode, which automatically obfuscates the entire site. The Dojo Library is the only common JavaScript library (outside of the Closure Library) which can be used with the Closure Compiler's Advanced mode . Compiled code has exactly the same behavior as plain-text code, except that it is much smaller (average 25% over minifiers), runs much faster (especially on mobile devices), and is almost impossible to reverse engineer, even after passing through a beautifier, because the entire code base (including the library) is obfuscated. Code that is only "minified" (e.g. YUI compressor, Uglify) can be easily reverse-engineered after passing through a beautifier. You have been only reading "minified" JavaScript before. Closure Compiler goes way further than this.
