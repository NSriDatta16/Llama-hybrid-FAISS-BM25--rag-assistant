Strictly speaking, a predictive model does not necessarily confer any ability to generate understanding of the relationship between the predictors and target variable. In other words, the model can be a black box . It takes some input and produces some output, but there need not be any clear way for you to see how input maps to output. Complex machine learning algorithms such as neural networks function like this, being much harder to interpret than coefficients from a regression model. But recent years have seen a large increase in interest in making such machine learning models interpretable. For most (probably all) machine learning models, it is possible to quantify the relative importance of different predictors to understand which ones contribute to predictive power, and also examine partial-plot s to understand how individual predictors relate to the target variable. So nowadays, you can use most (probably all) predictive models to learn from your data. Whether it is the best approach depends on your goals, your data, and the kinds of claims you want to make. Since you seem less interested in making actual predictions, you could also consider using models designed for inference , such as regression. Incidentally, logistic regression is one such type of model - it is not a classification algorithm, though it can be used for classification.
