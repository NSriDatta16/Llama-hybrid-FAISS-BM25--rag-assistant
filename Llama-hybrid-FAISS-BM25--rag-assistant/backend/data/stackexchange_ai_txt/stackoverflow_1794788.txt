The problem is fixed, im not sure which of these fixed it, but one of them did: The output folder was shared on the network, stopped the sharing Defragmented the disk Emptied the Recycle Bin (it had almost 5 GB) I made them all together, so i not sure which solved the problem, but i suspect one of the first two. It was a an OS problem, nothing to do with Eclipse.
