how to protect php files

We're making a system as a group, and I'm the lead programmer. And I don't want that one of my group members will be able to steal my code and brag to others that they're the one who made it. Is there any technique that I could employ so that the code will be disarrange or encrypted or anything so that I'm the only one who could read the codes or something like that.
