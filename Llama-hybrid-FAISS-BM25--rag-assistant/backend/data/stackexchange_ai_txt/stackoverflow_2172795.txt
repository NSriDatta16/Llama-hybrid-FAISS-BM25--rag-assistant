No. Since literal has automatic storage, its elements will not be initialized, the values in the array is undefined. You could initialize every element to something special and check for that value. e.g. you could change char literal[100]; char literal[100] = {0}; to initialize every element to 0. You'd have to change your while loop termination check to while(index That might not be optimal if you need to perform more string manipulation on the array though, as 0 now means empty element and also 'end of string'.
