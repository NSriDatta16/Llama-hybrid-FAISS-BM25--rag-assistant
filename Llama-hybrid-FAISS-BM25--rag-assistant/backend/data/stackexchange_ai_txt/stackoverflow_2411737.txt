Unit-tests for a working codebase with limited time: How?

I have a few medium-sized Rails apps that I work on routinely, and only one of them has any unit tests at all. But I have seen the light and I want to change all that, except... I don't have the time to go in and starting writing tests class by class or something like that. How do you start writing unit tests on an existing -- and working -- codebase with limited time? For example, since any approach would have to be incremental, how would you order your unit-test writing? Start with superficial tests, then move on to more coverage, or cover just a few classes... etc. Note: I am asking this question thinking about Rails, but really I'm interested in how it applies to any language. Edit: Note, this question is not the same as this other one . The other one asks how hard this is, and was the result worth it. I'm asking about how to add unit tests.
