There's a bunch of things you could do. Perhaps the simplest is chi-square of the table of the two ratings. There is clearly a strong relationship. The fact that the cells are not even roughly equal is not a problem here, as all of them are pretty big. You could account for the ordinality of both by using a test such as Jonckheere-Terpstra rather than the usual chi-square. If you think one of the ratings "depends' (loosely used) on the other, you could do ordinal logistic regression. Or, you could look at the particular books where the ratings disagree. And probably several other things; again, it depends on what you want to find out.
