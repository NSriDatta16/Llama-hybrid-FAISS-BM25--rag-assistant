How can I manipulate appsettings in a web.config on a remote machine using Microsoft.Web.Administration?

I'm using the Microsoft.Web.Administration library to configure a web.config on a remote machine. I've been able to read sections and add new items for the most part using the GetWebConfiguration method on the Application object, but I've run into a snag with appSettings. I would like to be able to read and write to the appsettings section but I can't seem to find a way to do this and have not found a good example on-line. Is this supported using Microsoft.Web.Administration? If not, is there another elegant solution? The solution has to work remotely.
