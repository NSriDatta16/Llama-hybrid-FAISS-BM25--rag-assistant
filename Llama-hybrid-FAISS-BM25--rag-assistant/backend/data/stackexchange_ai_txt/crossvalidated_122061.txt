Relationship between Gini Importance and Prediction Performance (say AUC)?

I want to use the decrease in Gini impurity to rank features for my random forest classifier. I understand that the decrease in Gini impurity at one node is calculated as: $$ \Delta i(n) = i(n) - p_li(n_l) - p_ri(n_r) $$ The overall decrease in Gini impurity is summed over all nodes and all trees for a given node ref . I don't quite understand if there is a link between decrease in Gini impurity and the prediction performance? That is, Gini impurity says which features are more important relative to others. But can I deduce how much individual features will affect prediction performance given the Gini impurity? I have read the following posts: Gini decrease and Gini impurity of children nodes What is the relationship between the GINI score and the log-likelihood ratio
