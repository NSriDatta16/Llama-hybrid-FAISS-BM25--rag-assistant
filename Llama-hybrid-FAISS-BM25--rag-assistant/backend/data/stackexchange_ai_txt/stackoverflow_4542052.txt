How do I get the data from a surveillance camera to a storage I can stream from?

My sisters house was robbed Christmas evening :( I talked with her about making a surveillance system for her. The idea is to have a system that detects intruders and then send a SMS to you while streaming it to a private website. The hard part: How and where do I storage the data from the camera so it's streamable? I think I can manage to do the streaming, website and SMS server, but I need the data (fundamentation).
