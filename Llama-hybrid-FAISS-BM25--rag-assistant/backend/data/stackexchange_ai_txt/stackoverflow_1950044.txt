I don't think there is a single good reason to even attempt to support IE6 unless your single biggest client is paying you huge sums of money to support it. In this case its a no brainer. Versions of IE later than 6 have a standards mode, which helps substantially in getting most pages that look good in other browsers to look pretty ok in IE too. Now look at the actual usage statistics for browsers and the different IE versions. Oddball browsers, which would be IE 6 and earlier, as well as the 'other' browsers that could be pretty much anything, represent 24ish percent of the sampled traffic. That's a pretty healthy chunk, but it might not reflect your actual users. You can make good use of your logs for this. Have a look at the number of unique IPs and the browser each of those unique IP's is using. This can give you a good idea of what your users are actually using. Then take a look at total page views by the different IPs and compare the distributions according to browser. Probably some browsers are going to show more page views than others. It could be a sign when there is a sharp difference between the page views of two common user agents that one browser has some sort of usability shortcoming preventing those users from getting the higher number of page views This is a perfect opportunity to use a profile directed optimization. You have the data that tells you that a hot spot (popular browser) is suffering in performance (fewer average pageviews), so you can look at working on just that specific browser.
