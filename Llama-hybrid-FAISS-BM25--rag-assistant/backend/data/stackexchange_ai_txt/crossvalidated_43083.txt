Simplest test for consistency of a rating scale

I want to explain to a non-novice doctor the best way to validate consistency of a measure across a likert-scale. The variable describes an average dose across 5 levels of patients (lower to higher). Whats the easiest way to validate that the dose statistically increases from level 1 to level 2 to level3 ..to level 5?
