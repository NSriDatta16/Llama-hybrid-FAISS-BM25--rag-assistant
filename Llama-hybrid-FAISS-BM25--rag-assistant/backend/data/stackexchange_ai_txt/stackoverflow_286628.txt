Hooking a Stacktrace in Delphi 2009

The Exception class in Delphi 2009 received a number of new features. A number of them are related to getting a stacktrace: property StackTrace: string read GetStackTrace; property StackInfo: Pointer read FStackInfo; class var GetExceptionStackInfoProc: function (P: PExceptionRecord): Pointer; class var GetStackInfoStringProc: function (Info: Pointer): string ; class var CleanUpStackInfoProc: procedure (Info: Pointer); Has anyone used these to obtain a stack trace yet? Yeah, I know there are other ways to get a stack trace, but if it is supported natively in the Exception class I would rather leverage that. Update: There is an interest blog post about this . Covers it in a lot of depth.
