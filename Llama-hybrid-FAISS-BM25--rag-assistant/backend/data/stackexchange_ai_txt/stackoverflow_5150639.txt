Regions are horrible. They just hide the code you want to look at. To me, its like trying to read a book, but somebody put a cover over every paragraph. It makes no sense. I also think that the school commenting request deserves pushback. It adds zero value, creates busywork, and obscures the real comments (which are the code itself). /// /// RegularPay declared as double /// private double m_dRegularPay; This says the same thing three times. It says in a comment that RegularPay is a double, that private double RegularPay is a private double, and that m_dRegular pay is a private double. Actually, the comment and the notation indicate that at some point in time m_dRegularPay was a double. The private double identifiers state that it still is a private double. private double regularPay; That only states it once.
