Identify a contaminated distribution

I have a patchy time series of means, medians and sample sizes (n) that occasionally appears to be "contaminated" (either by bad or atypical data). For example: median Here the penultimate observation has a mean 3.5 times that of the median and is probably "contaminated". Is there a way to use information on just the mean, median and sample size (or neighbouring observations?) to identify a sample that is atypical? On a normality assumption, mean/median = 1.0 ? I do not have access to the original sample observations. Also, here I have data for every quarter, but for other locations there are quarters for which I have no data. I found this reference, but it is a bit dated and only covers cases with low N. Dixon, W. J. "Processing data for outliers."
