In my personal experience (which is not that extensive), machine learning algorithms are usually better at interpolating than extrapolating. So, I am not surprised that your RNN fails for test frequencies higher than those found in the training set (4 Hz). However, it also seems to fail for 0.75 Hz...so, the only thing I can think of is to have more examples in the training set, for a larger varieties of frequency values: with that, the network will have a better chance of generalizing its behavior.
