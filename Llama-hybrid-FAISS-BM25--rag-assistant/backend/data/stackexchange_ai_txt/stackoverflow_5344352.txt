Why does the modulo function in excel return the divisor?

I have an Excel validation formula which worked fine in Office '03, '07, but is failing in 2010. Did they change the definition of MOD recently? In 03/07 the following returns zero: =MOD(1, .05) However in 2010 it returns .05 . As far as I can tell they haven't changed how remainders worked since I was in 3rd grade when I learned about them. However, Microsoft may be taking certain liberties.
