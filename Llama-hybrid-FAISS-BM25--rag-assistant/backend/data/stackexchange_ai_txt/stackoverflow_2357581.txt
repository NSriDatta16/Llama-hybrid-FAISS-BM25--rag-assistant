Pre-processing !DEC$ directives in gfortran

I've got a large Fortran codebase that originally targeted Intel's compiler. I'm now gearing up to compile with gfortran. Unfortunately, the code is littered with Intel-style pre-processing directives like: !DEC$ IF DEFINED (MYDIRECTIVE) REAL, DIMENSION(:,:,:), ALLOCATABLE :: my_real_var !DEC$ ENDIF From what I can tell via googling and the gfortran docs, there is no internal gfortran support for anything besides C-style pre-processing, like: #if defined MYDIRECTIVE REAL, DIMENSION(:,:,:), ALLOCATABLE :: my_real_var #endif Has anyone else encountered this problem and come up with an elegant solution? Obviously, I could write a shell script which calls an external pre-processor before passing code to gfortran for compile, but this just doesn't seem like a terrific solution to me. Any thoughts? Thanks SO gurus!
