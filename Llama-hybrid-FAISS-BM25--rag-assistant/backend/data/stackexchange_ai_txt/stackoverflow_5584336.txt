It sounds like you are using an InstallUtil custom action to install and start your windows service and that this windows service has a dependency that is in the GAC. It's a known limitation of Winodows Installer that files for the WinSXS and GAC aren't installed until the Commit phase which is after your Custom Action is firing ( Deferred Phase ) First you should know that InstallUtil custom actions are very fragile and that there are better ways to do this. Second you'll never be able to get around the problem I described above except to either a) Set the service to Auto and do a reboot or b) not install the assembly to the GAC.
