report generation on php?

one of the most frequent requests I get is to create XY report for YZ App. These apps are normally built on PHP, so far I have manually created most of this reports, and while I enjoy the freedom of building it as I want, it usually becomes pretty tedious to calculate subtotals, averages, exporting to different formats etc. What solutions are out there (free/OSS preferred) that help me get this repetitive tasks cranking? edits: I'm talking about reports/summaries from SQL data. Many times from DBs not designed for reporting use. while I'm aware of "business-intelligence" we're not ready to implement a full scaled "intelligence" structure, looking more for a helper of sorts...
