Biostatistics book for mathematician

It would be great if you could recommend me some books on biostatistics for people with a solid background in mathematics. I have an MSc in mathematics and a PhD in bioinformatics/machine learning, with additional post-doc experience in mathematical/computational biology. Since I don't find many bioinformatic jobs in the industries in Europe, I am thinking of selling myself as a biostatistician.
