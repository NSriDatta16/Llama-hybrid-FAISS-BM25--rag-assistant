What's a good approach for building a calendar / event application (view)?

I would like to build a calendar 'component' for my website. I want to make it manageable and easy to extend in the future. I will not be using it for any other website but it want to make it solid independent of the rest of the website. The website is built with ASP.NET MVC. I want to include different views (month, week, day [maybe even year]). I'm planning on using different ways to present information to the users: Icons Colorization (weeks, hours, periods[!]) Popup screens The information needs to be displayed based on information contained in other (.NET) models. I want this logic to be separated correctly. I'm fairly good at javascript, so I will be able to build a nice interface for dragging and dropping events on the calendar and navigating through the calendar dates. However I want the component to work without javascript too. Should I build this component from scratch? If so, can you name the different parts which you would create to build the component? OR Can I alter the .NET Calendar control to fit my needs? Thanks for the input!
