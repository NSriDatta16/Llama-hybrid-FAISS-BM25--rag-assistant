Single and Double in .NET are represented as floating point numbers and unfortunately storing these kinds of numbers is not precise. You will get small discrepancies when working with 'Single' and 'Double' numbers. However there is an alternative - .NET has a Decimal type which is much better at dealing with these numbers. It's still not perfect (see http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/decimal.html - in particular the last paragraph) but will be much better at representing quantities like money.
