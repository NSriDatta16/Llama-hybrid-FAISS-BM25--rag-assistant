I would suggest having two builds (Incremental which is run on every check in, and a Full build which is run over night) The incremental runs shorter tests in about 7 minutes whereas the full build runs all tests for longer in less than 40 minutes. Clearcase does encourage a branching nightmare, but you should be able to have two builds per developer. I would question the value in having every develop on their own branch as I believe there is some benefit in having developers work together (in pairs or more) on the same branch. Note: One continuous integration server can have any number of agents and if you cannot afford more than one server, you can use PCs as builds agents. (You must have at least 30 of those)
