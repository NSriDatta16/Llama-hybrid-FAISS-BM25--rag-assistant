100 / 200 is 1/2 or 0.5. Since you are using ints, it rounds down to 0 (zero). And 0 * 100 is still 0. The part inside the parentheses is always evaluated first: if you want to get this working, use: decimal c = (a * 100) / b; Edit: if you want a more precise value rather than an "integer percentage" (ie. 33.333% instead of 33%), you should use Bragaadeesh's answer.
