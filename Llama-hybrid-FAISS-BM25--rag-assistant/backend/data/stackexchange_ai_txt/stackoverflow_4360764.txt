The wording on that error client denied by server configuration: /var/www/httpdocs/app/etc/local.xml is an Apache error message that's unrelated to your problem. Someone tried to directly access your local.xml file via a web browser but were blocked by the server configuration. This is correct behavior. Your white screen error is happening for another reason. Are there other errors in the log? Configure PHP to log PHP errors separately. You can access the magento admin, so turn on logging for Magento specific errors With the above in place, configure your store to only server file to your IP so you can figure out which error in the log(s) (Apache, PHP, or Magento) is related to your direct request.
