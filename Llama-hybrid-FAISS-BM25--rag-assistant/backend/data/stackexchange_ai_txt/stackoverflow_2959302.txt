After digging into the code and searching through everything, I realized that Magento uses a transaction model for the database connections. As a result, Imre L had the right idea, but the wrong code. As an experiment, I changed this code: $sql = "insert into {$tableName} values ('', '$customerId', '$acPI', '$acPI', '3')"; $writeconnection->query($sql); $sql = "insert into {$tableName} (magCID, anCID, anOID, anObjectType) values ('$customerId', '$acPI', '$acAI', '2')"; $writeconnection->query($sql); $sql = "insert into {$tableName} (magCID, anCID, anOID, anObjectType) values ('$customerId', '$acPI', '$acPPI', '1')"; $writeconnection->query($sql); to this: $sql = "insert into {$tableName} values ('', '$customerId', '$acPI', '$acPI', '3'); commit;"; $writeconnection->query($sql); $sql = "insert into {$tableName} (magCID, anCID, anOID, anObjectType) values ('$customerId', '$acPI', '$acAI', '2'); commit;"; $writeconnection->query($sql); $sql = "insert into {$tableName} (magCID, anCID, anOID, anObjectType) values ('$customerId', '$acPI', '$acPPI', '1'); commit;"; $writeconnection->query($sql); Amazingly enough, it worked. The new values appeared in the database. (I did not realize that MySQL supported transactions) Somewhere in my new code, I was preventing the commit statement to run, and therefore the values were not getting saved to the database. I will hunt this down as I go, but for now, the commit; will have to stay. Thanks for the help working on this.
