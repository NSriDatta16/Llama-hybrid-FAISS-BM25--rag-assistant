Taking a step back, why do you want to split the continuous measure of protein levels into a binary variable? Presumably you will lose a lot of information and most likely your predictive accuracy will be reduced. Unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, I'd treat protein level as a continuous predictor . You could perform a logistic regression predicting disease outcomes from a continuous measure of protein levels. If the protein coefficient is positive and significant you could make a claim about protein levels being a significant predictor of disease outcome. If you are concerned about the relationship being non-linear you could explore transformations of the protein level variable or explore non-linear predictive relationships (e.g., incorporating a quadratic effect).
