Magento: getting attributes from an attribute set without a product

I have set an attribute set in my Magento shop which has several binary attributes. For a pulldown I need a list of ALL the attributes inside this one attribute set, including their internal name and their label. Since this pulldown should appear in places that not necessarily have a product selected I can't go the usual route of "getting the attributes of a product". How do I go about of getting a list of all the attributes inside my set?
