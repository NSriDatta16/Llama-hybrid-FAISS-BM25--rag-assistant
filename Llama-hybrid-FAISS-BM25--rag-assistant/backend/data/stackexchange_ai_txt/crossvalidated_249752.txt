A few comments about flaws of noninformative priors (uninformative priors) are probably a good idea since the investigation of such flaws helped development of the concept of noninformative prior in history. You may want to add some comments about the drawbacks/flaws of adopting noninformative priors. Among many criticisms I point out two. (1) Generally the adoption of noninformative priors has consistency problems especially when the model distribution has multi-modal behavior. This problem is not unique to noninformative priors but is shared by many other Bayesian procedures as pointed out in the following paper along with its discussions. Diaconis, Persi, and David Freedman. "On the consistency of Bayes estimates." The Annals of Statistics (1986): 1-26. Nowadays the noninformative prior is no longer a research focus. It seems that there is more interest in more flexible choices of prior in nonparametric settings. Examples are the Gaussian process prior in nonparametric Bayes procedure or a flexible model like a mixture of Dirichlet priors, as in Antoniak, Charles E. "Mixtures of Dirichlet processes with applications to Bayesian nonparametric problems." The annals of statistics (1974): 1152-1174. But again such a prior has its own consistency problems. (2) Most so-called "noninformative priors" are not well-defined. This is probably the most evident problem associated with noninformative priors during their development. One example is that the limit definition of noninformative prior as a limit of a sequence of proper priors will lead to a marginalization paradox. As you mentioned, Bernardo's reference prior also has the problem that Berger never proved that its formal definition is independent from its construction/partition. See the discussion in Berger, James O., Jos√© M. Bernardo, and Dongchu Sun. "The formal definition of reference priors." The Annals of Statistics (2009): 905-938. One best definition about Jeffreys' prior that is well-defined is that it is chosen to be a prior such that it is invariant under certain parallel translation over the Riemannian manifold equipped with Fisher information metric, but even that does not solve the first problem. Also you may want to read my explanation about marginalization paradox .
