Grid Splitter and MinWidth

I am trying to set a MinWidth for my columns. MinWidth works correctly for Column 0 but not Column 2. The splitter just keeps dragging and I can get the Column to be less than the declared MinWidth The MinWidth seems to only take effect if the Column Width has a numeric value rather than Auto.... Is there a way to get that to work with Auto or just * ?? Any ideas?
