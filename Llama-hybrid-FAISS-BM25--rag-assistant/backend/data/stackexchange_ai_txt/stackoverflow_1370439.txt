Why can't I add Shared Binaries to TFS 2008 Source Control?

I have 2 TFS projects on the same server (ProjectA and ProjectB). Both have the following structure... $/ProjectName/Dev/Source/ApplicationName/ $/ProjectName/Dev/Source/SharedBinaries/ In ProjectA I can drag dlls into the ShareBinaries directory. In ProjectB, however, I cannot. TFS presents me with the 'Add to Source Control' dialog in which all the dlls are in the 'Excluded items' tab. Each dll has the description 'The item cannot be added because its destination path is cloaked.'. I can see no difference between how the 2 projects are setup. Help, I'm stumped!
