Quasi complete separation problem

I have some question related to quasi complete seperation problem on logistic regression algorithm. So i run the model to predict credit risk and turns out it gave me good prediction score (AUC around 95%) and the gap between auc train and test not wide. But turns out it have quasi complete seperation problem. So is that a problem and make my model bias/unstable? I also trying to make other model and handled the quasi complete seperation problem by removing some feature and it gave me AUC score around 76% but no more complete quasi seperation problem. So which model should i choose?
