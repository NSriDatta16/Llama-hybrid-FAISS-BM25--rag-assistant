Ruby on Rails - Why use tests?

I'm confused about what the various testing appliances in Ruby on Rails are for. I have been using the framework for about 6 months but I've never understood the testing part of it. The only testing I've used is JUnit3 in Java and that only briefly. Everything I've read about it just shows testing validations. Shouldn't the validations in rails just work? It seems more like testing the framework than testing the your code. Why would you need to test validations? Furthermore, the tests seem super fragile to any change in your code. So if you change anything in your models, you have to change your tests and fixtures to match. Doesn't this violate the DRY principle? Third, writing test code seems to take alot of time. Is that normal? Wouldn't it just be faster to refresh my browser and see if it worked? I already have to play with my application just to see if it flows correctly and make sure my CSS hasn't exploded. Why wouldn't manual testing be enough? I've asked these questions before and I haven't gotten more than "automated testing is automated". I am smart enough to figure out the advantages of automating a task. My problem is that costs of writing tests seem absurdly high compared to the benefits. That said, any detailed response is welcome because I probably missed a benefit or two.
