Combination of bayesian models in pymc3

Simplified problem is: I noted down peoplesâ€™ physiological parameters (age, BMI, resting heart rate, etc.) and asked them to perform exercises. From that I measured their HRmax and how well they perform (speed) and how long it takes to recover (recoveryTime). I have 3 linear models also related to each other like this (it is my assumption based on expert knowledge): HRmax ~ Age + BMI + HRrest Speed ~ Age + HRmax RecoveryTime ~ HRrest + HRmax + Speed I have N people-records with full information about all predictors and responses, but in the end I am interested to predict how well people will do the exercise (Speed), but also RecoveryTime and HRmax are of secondary interest, because I want to tell all three without asking someone to do the exercise, but just from their physiology metrics. How do I design such a model and implement it in pymc3? Do I make three models and them combine them somehow? Or is this one model with three likelihoods? I appreciate if you can help me with an explanation, references or indicating silly assumptions I have about Bayesian modeling.
