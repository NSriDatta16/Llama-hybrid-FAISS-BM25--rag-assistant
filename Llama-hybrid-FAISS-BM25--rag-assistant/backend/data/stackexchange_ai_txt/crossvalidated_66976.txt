How to cluster time series?

I have a question about cluster analysis. There are 3000 companies, which have to be clustered according to their power usage over 5 years. Each company has values for every hour during 5 years. I would like to find out if some companies have the same pattern in usage power over the time period. The results should be used for daily prediction of power usage. If you have some ideas how to cluster time series in SPSS, please share with me.
