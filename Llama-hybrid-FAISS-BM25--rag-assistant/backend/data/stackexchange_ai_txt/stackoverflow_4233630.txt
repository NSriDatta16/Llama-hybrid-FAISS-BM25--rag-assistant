Unit testing for a compiler output

As part of a university project, we have to write a compiler for a toy language. In order to do some testing for this, I was considering how best to go about writing something like unit tests. As the compiler is being written in haskell, Hunit and quickcheck are both available, but perhaps not quite appropriate. How can we do any kind of non-manual testing? The only idea i've had is effectively compiling to haskell too, seeing what the output is, and using some shell script to compare this to the output of the compiled program - this is quite a bit of work, and isn't too elegant either. The unit testing is to help us, and isn't part of assessed work itself.
