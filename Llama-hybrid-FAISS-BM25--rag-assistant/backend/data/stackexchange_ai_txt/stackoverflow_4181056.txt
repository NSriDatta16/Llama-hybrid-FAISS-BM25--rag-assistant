Don't temporarily stop, sleep or wait, instead simply exit/quit/return from the current routine/function/method. Break your current "stuff" into multiple fragments of code, each fragment in its own method. Use subsequent method(s) to do whatever comes next, and have that method called by the completion routine of your async network/SOAP request. Basically, your problem is that you are still thinking in terms of procedural coding. The proper paradigm is to use event driven coding: have the OS call your code, rather than having your code call the OS and waiting.
