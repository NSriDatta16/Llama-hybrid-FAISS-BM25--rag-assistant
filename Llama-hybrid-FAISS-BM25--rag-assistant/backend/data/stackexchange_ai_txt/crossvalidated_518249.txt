Am I coding dummy variables for disease groups correctly in logistic regression?

Normally I would code my dummy variables as follows: Original variable levels Dummy_disease1 Dummy_disease2 Dummy_disease3 Disease 1 1 0 0 Disease 2 0 1 0 Disease 3 0 0 1 However, I dont want to know if the odds for disease 1 are different compared to either disease 2 or 3 , but I want to specifically compare the odds for disease 1 versus disease 3 , and disease 2 versus disease 3 , .. (and other comparisons) To do this, I made the following dummy variables: Original variable levels ?Dummy_disease1 ?Dummy_disease2 ?Dummy_disease3 Disease 1 1 NA 1 Disease 2 NA 1 0 Disease 3 0 0 NA Is this OK? I am confused as this is not how dummy variables are normally computed or how the glm function in R would code the dummy variables. NB. An example using the second dummy variables: Do disease 1 or disease 2 change the odds for presence of calcification compared to disease 3?: model
