Typically a uniform prior on the slope and offset is used, however I like the idea of putting flat priors on $\tan^{-1}\left(a\right)$ and $b\cos\theta$ with $\theta$ being the angle between the line and y=0. This gives a prior of $$ p\left(a,b\right) = \left(1+a^2\right)^{-3/2} $$ which favours slopes around zero. This is derived at http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/#The-Prior , and Frequentism and Bayesianism: A Python-driven Primer by Jake Vanderblas
