Well, WHERE status=1 AND storage > used is correct. If you tried it and didn't get back the row with id=1 there's something wrong with your data. Are storage and used numeric columns? Or are they stored as a VARCHAR (or, gasp , TEXT )? If so, you won't be able to compare them quite the way you want, and will first have to convert or cast them to numeric types. It would be better to change the type to actually be numeric (i.e., INT or DECIMAL or whichever other type is appropriate).
