Word vectors as input in Keras

I have a corpus on which I want to perform sentiment analysis using LSTM and word embeddings. I have converted the words in the documents to word vectors using word2vec. My question is how to input these word vectors as input to keras? I don't want to use the Embeddings provided by keras. Thanks in advance.
