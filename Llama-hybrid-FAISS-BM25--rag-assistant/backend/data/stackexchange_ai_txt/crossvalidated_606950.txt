Sampling arbitrary differential function with mean $0$ so that sample mean's deviation from $0$ is minimized

This might be a basic question but here it goes: I have a differentiable (arbitrary) function $f(t)$ on some interval $[0, T]$ that has mean $T^{-1}\int_0^T f(t) = 0$ . I want to sample a set $S$ of $n > 1$ points such that the sample average is as close to $0$ as possible, on average. I think I would formulate this as that I want to find the distribution $p$ from which to sample $S$ that minimizes the sample mean's expected deviation from $0$ : $$p = \arg \min_{p'} \mathbb{E}_{S \sim p'}[|n^{-1}\sum_{t \in S}f(t)|]$$ My impression is that usually one wants to use uniform sampling to get a representative sample. But intuitively for this problem I feel like one would want to sample a random set of $n$ evenly spaced points, rather than uniform sampling of $n$ points. At least when I think of a function such as $f(t) = \sin(t)$ . But I don't know if that is correct, if it is true in general, and how to formalize it?
