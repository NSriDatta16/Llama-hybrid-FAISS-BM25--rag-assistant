You don't have to understand the whole site CSS by yourself, let the computer do its job. Get some inspection tool like Firebug (for Firefox) or Dragonfly (for Opera) and see which rules are applied to the box you want and its inner elements. This way you may easily rip only the required rules (just copy and paste non-striked-out ones from the right part of the CSS pane in case of Firebug).
