How to prove the properties of penalized likelihood estimator in Fan and Li (2001) paper

I'm reading through Fan and Li (2001) Variable Selection via Nonconcave Penalized Likelihood and its Oracle Properties . On p. 1349 (near the bottom-right corner) they proposed three properties that a good penalized estimator should have: Unbiasedness : The resulting estimator is nearly unbiased when the true unknown parameter is large to avoid unnecessary modeling bias. Sparsity : The resulting estimator is a thresholding rule, which automatically sets small estimated coefficient to zero to reduce model complexity. Continuity :The resulting estimator is continuous in data z to avoid instability in model prediction. They then showed that the hard thresholding penalty function can result in estimators with those good properties, given some conditions satisfied. Specifically, (1) A sufficient condition for unbiasedness is $p_\lambda'(\theta)=0$ for large $|z|$ ; (2) A sufficient condition for sparsity is $\text{min}_{\theta \neq 0} \{|\theta| + p_\lambda'(\theta)\} \gt 0$ ; (3) A sufficient and necessary condition for continuity is that the minimum of the function $|\theta| + p_\lambda'(\theta)$ is attained at 0. My questions are: For proving condition (2), they depicted a figure below. I am confused why $\theta + p_\lambda'(\theta)$ is a Parabola since it is equal to $\theta + 2(\lambda - \theta)I(\theta . And moreover, how does the proof to condition (2) come from this figure? Update: Figure 3 should be a general illustration about $\theta + p_\lambda'(\theta)$ against $\theta (>0)$ , as pointed out by @Glen_b. The last sentence of first paragraph in Page 3 concludes that "a penalty function satisfying the conditions of sparsity and continuity must be singular at the origin". Why is that? Obviously I totally missed the points here. Could any of you walk me through the arguments made for proving conditions (2) and (3)? Thank you very much for the help.
