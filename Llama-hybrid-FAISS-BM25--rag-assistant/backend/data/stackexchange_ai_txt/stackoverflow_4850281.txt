Try capturing the difference between the element's top left coordinate and the mouse pointer at the start of the dragging operation. At the end, add this difference to the mouse pointer location when setting the position of the element. You can capture the mouse position like so: $( ".selector" ).draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { // here, event.pageX and event.pageY contain the mouse pointer location } });
