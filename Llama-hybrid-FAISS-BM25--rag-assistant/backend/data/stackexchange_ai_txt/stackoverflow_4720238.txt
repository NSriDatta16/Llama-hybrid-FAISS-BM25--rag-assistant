User/Session Management between Sencha Touch and Rails (backend)

I'm programming a mobile application in Sencha Touch with the backend being Rails. I've found that I've been separating the two more and more as I get deeper into Sencha: where Im basically at the point where Rails only functions as my model storage (database) and Sencha pulls in everything it needs via JSON - reproducing much of the logic already present in rails. My question, is what do you advise when it comes to delegating functions to each application? I've implemented REST in my Sencha app so it can communicate User, and associated data and store it in the same format. Is this the right way to go for User Session management? Should I give more power back to rails? IE : where do I store the session? Can I do it on the server? Should I do it as session storage management? Local storage? I just dont know. I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks.
