Deep null checking, is there a better way?

Note: This question was asked before the introduction of the .? operator in C# 6 / Visual Studio 2015 . We've all been there, we have some deep property like cake.frosting.berries.loader that we need to check if it's null so there's no exception. The way to do is is to use a short-circuiting if statement if (cake != null && cake.frosting != null && cake.frosting.berries != null) ... This is not exactly elegant, and there should perhaps be an easier way to check the entire chain and see if it comes up against a null variable/property. Is it possible using some extension method or would it be a language feature, or is it just a bad idea?
