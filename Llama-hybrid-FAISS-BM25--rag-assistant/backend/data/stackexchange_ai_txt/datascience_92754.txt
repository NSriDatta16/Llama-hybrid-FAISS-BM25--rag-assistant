Word list as a baseline for measuring a classifier's performance?

I am working on a simple Naive Bayes classifier that categorizes text messages as either "positive" or "negative". I was told that the simplest baseline to measure the classifier's performance would be to compare it against a word list. However, I have no clue as to how this might be helpful. How can a word list be a baseline for a classifier? P.S. I am new to machine learning and data science, so please don't hate on my question.
