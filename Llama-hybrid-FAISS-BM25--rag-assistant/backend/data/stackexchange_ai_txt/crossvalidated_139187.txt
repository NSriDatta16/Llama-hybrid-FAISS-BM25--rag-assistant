Normalize time series with different lengths with linear interpolation in R

I have a large set of time series (100k, each 3 observations), their lengths varies about 10% on average. Each of them cover the time interval of the same lengths but varies due to rate of sampling, this is the cause of differents lengths of time series vectors. I would like to normalize lenght of each pair using linear interpolation, such that first and last observation in each time series remains the same. Is there R function for such manipulation ? Example R : input
