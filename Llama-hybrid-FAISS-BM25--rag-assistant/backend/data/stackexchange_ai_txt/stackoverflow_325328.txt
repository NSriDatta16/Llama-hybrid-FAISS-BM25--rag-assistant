Rules for using update sites in Eclipse?

Do you know any documentation about the rules of using update sites? I have managed the last 2 and a half years the update site of our company, and these are the problems I have to address: Not all projects use the same eclipse version. We had projects that used eclipse 2.1 (WSAD), eclipse 3.0 (RAD 6), eclipse 3.2 (RAD 7), eclipse 3.3 and eclipse 3.4. The update site of our company mostly packages things together. So I have written litte plugins (sometimes fragements) to package e.g. the configuration of Checkstyle for our company together with the current version of Checkstyle. We release two times a year new versions of what has changed. So if I have 1 update site or 4, this will change dramatically the load I have to take. So the question is: How many update sites should we use, and if the number is more than 1, how can I minimize the work to do to maintain the update sites?
