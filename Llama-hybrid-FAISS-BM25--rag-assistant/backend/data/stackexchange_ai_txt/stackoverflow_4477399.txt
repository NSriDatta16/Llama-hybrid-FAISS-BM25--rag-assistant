Since standard robots.txt is served from the root of your domain unless you can somehow reliably distinguish search engines from users I don't think what you are asking is possible. You could try filtering by user agent or possibly by IP range. Is there a reason why you don't want your users to not see what is in your robots.txt file? After all everything in that file is public.
