I wouldn't put those fields (which I generally call audit fields) on every database table. If it's a low-traffic, high-value table (like Users , for instance), it goes on, no question. I'd also add creator and modifier . If it's a table that gets hit a lot (an operation history table, say), then maybe the benefit isn't worth the cost of increased insert time and storage space. It's a call you'll need to make separately for each table.
