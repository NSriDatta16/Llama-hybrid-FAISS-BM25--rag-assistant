I need to improve my T-SQL query so that i can return the sum of columns

Here is my current query: SELECT patron_name, producer.federal_number, hst_number, average_bf_test, (SELECT MAX(s.statement_number) FROM statement s) AS statement_number, (SELECT MAX(s.period_ending) FROM statement s) AS period_ending FROM producer JOIN producer_details ON producer.federal_number = producer_details.federal_number JOIN statement ON producer.patron_number = statement.patron_number WHERE producer.patron_number = @PatronNo I need to improve it so that i can retrieve the sum of the money columns in my 'payment' table: quota_payment (money) total_deductions (money) net_cheque_or_direct_deposit (money) interim_payment (money) final_payment (money) statement_number (int) (FK) (statement_number is the primary key in the statement table) As per @Quassnoi's request, here is sample data and @Quassnoi's query output: producer Table: patron_number patron_name federal_number 20109 A. Beaton 44373 producer_details Table: federal_number hst_number average_bf_test 44373 R999999999 0.0392 statement Table: statement_number period_ending description amount_shipped patron_number 386 2009/07/30 Quota Milk Shipped 32.91 20109 387 2009/11/30 Quota Milk Shipped 22.34 20109 payment Table: quota_payment total_deductions net_cheque_or_direct_deposit interim_payment 22872.5800 7526.6500 15345.9300 6520.7000 18474.3400 4563.2300 13911.1100 3220.3000 final_payment statement_number 8825.2300 386 10690.8100 387 This is the data that is returned by @Quassnoi's query (originally the second row was NULLs for the money columns, however, it turns out that that was because there was only one row in the payment table at that time, but i've since added an additional row): patron_name federal_number hst_number average_bf_test A. Beaton 44373 R999999999 0.0392 A. Beaton 44373 R999999999 0.0392 statement_number period_ending quota_payment total_deductions 387 2009/11/30 22872.5800 7526.6500 387 2009/11/30 18474.3400 4563.2300 net_cheque_or_direct_deposit interim_payment final_payment 15345.9300 6520.7000 8825.2300 13911.1100 3220.3000 10690.8100 Here is the desired recordset: patron_name federal_number hst_number average_bf_test A. Beaton 44373 R999999999 0.0392 statement_number period_ending quota_payment total_deductions 387 2009/11/30 41346.92 12089.88 net_cheque_or_direct_deposit interim_payment final_payment 29257.04 9741.00 19516.04 I forgot to mention that the sum values for the money columns should be "year to date" values (meaning values from the previous year would not be included in the SUM results), which makes it a little more complicated.
