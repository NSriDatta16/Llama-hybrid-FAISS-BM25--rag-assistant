You might be writing your unit tests too close to your classes. What you should do is to test public APIs. When I mean public APIs, I don't mean public methods on all your classes, I mean your public controllers. By having your tests mimicking how a user would interact with your controller part without ever touching your model classes or helper function directly, you allow yourself to refactor your code without having to refactor your tests. Of course, sometimes even your public API changes and then you'll still have to change your tests, but that will happen way less often. The downside of this approach is that you'll often have to go through complex controller setup just to test a new tiny helper function you want to introduce, but I think that in the end, it's worth it. Moreover, you'll end up organizing your test code in a smarter way, making that setup code easier to write.
