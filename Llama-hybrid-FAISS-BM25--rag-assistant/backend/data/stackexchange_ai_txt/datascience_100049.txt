How to quantify the influence of multiple variables on a time series data

I have three variables in my time series data ( $X_1,X_2,X_3$ ). I then calculate $y = (X_1+X_2)-X_3$ for each time $t$ . Now, I need to look at a time interval and come up with a quantitative measure that tells me the influence three ( $X_1,X_2,X_3$ ) variables on $y$ . My expected outcome will be - for this time interval $t-10$ to $t$ , the influence of $\Delta X_1, \Delta X_2, \Delta X_3$ on $\Delta y$ is $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ respectively. Using $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ , I should be able to tell if $X_1$ or $X_2$ or $X_3$ influenced $y$ more during a particular time interval. What kind of statistical method I can use here?
