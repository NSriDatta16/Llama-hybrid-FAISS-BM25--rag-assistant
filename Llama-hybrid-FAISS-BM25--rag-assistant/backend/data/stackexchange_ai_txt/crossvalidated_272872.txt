When you are fitting a model, it is good practice to perform some kind of model validation. In your case, you are trying holdout validation and cross validation. Note, however, that these methods are for validation. The idea is that, by making a prediction on some data that you have not used to train the model, you obtain an estimate of how well your model will perform on new data. In the case of holdout validation, the model would be trained on your 70% of the data and tested on the 30% holdout. The goodness of fit metric you obtain (probably RMSE) on the 30% tells you how good the model will perform on unseen data. In the case of cross validation, you get a much better generalization estimate because it both trains and tests on every point. If you do 5-fold cross validation then you will have 5 different estimates of the goodness of fit, i.e. 5 different RMSE values. Averaging these values gives you a good idea of the goodness of fit overall. For either method, though, you want to fit your final model with all of the data . The purpose of cross validation is to check the model, not to build it. The actual model building is a separate step that uses all of the data to provide the best possible estimate.
