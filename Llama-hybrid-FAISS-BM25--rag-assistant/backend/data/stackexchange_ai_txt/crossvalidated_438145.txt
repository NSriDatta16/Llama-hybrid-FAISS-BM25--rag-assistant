In the paper the embedding dimension is the number of input variables, whilst the intrinsic dimension is the minimum number of variables needed to represent a point in the dataset. Eg x1=X, X2=X*X then the embedding dimension is 2, but the Intrinsic dimension is 1. Similarly could have x1=sin(theta), X2=cos(theta) .... In addition it does not have to be a perfect mapping: they are allowing a statistical relationship between input variables (is with some noise)
