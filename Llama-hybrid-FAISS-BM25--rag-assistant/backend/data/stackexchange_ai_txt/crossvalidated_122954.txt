Average of Dependent Variables

Suppose $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are dependent varibles with identical marginal distribution. Denote the common population mean as $\mu_0$. In this case, is $\frac{1}{n} \sum X_i$ a reasonably good estimator of $\mu_0$? I guess assymptotically it is still consistent. Is there any other suggestion?
