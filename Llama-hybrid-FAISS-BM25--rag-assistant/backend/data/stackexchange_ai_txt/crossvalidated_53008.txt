Logistic regression with categorical data

I'm trying to apply logistic regression to the data with binary predictor. But some of my variables are numerical and some are categorical. If I just do this in R I get the model where for every categorical variable I have coefficients and p-values for for variable's possible values except for the first. How can I interpret such model? And what is the best way of finding best model for such problem?
