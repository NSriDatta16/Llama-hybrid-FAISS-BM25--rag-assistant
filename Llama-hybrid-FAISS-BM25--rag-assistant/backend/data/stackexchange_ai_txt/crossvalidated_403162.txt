The approach of averaging vectors helped me get 0.90 auc with random forest in the binary text classification problem. It is easy to understand and painless to implement. The idea is the following: Load the pre-trained word2vec model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit (1.5GB). Draw vectors from the loaded word2vec model for each word in the document (sentence/abstract). Aggregate (average) the vectors for each document: sum all word vectors and divide by the number of words in a document. You can check the following code for the implementation of the approach: load the word2vec model make_agg_vec
