Likelihood of Gamma Distribution

I'm studying bayesian stats on my own and came across the following problem on Coursera. Can anyone help me understand how to work through this? $x_{i}\stackrel {iid}{\sim} Beta(\alpha,\beta), i=1....n $ $ \alpha \sim Gamma(a,b)$ $ \beta \sim Gamma(r,s)$ Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are independent a priori. Give the full conditional density for $\alpha$ up to proportionality $p(\alpha|\beta,x)$ ? Edited: I'm getting stuck with the setup for this. I have assumed that $p(\alpha|\beta,x)$ ? = $\frac{p(\alpha\cap\beta\cap x)}{p(\beta\cap x)}$ I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks
