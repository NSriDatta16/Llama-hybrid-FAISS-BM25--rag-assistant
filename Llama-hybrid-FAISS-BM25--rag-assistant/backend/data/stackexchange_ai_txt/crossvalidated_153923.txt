Determining the effect of number of likes

Let's say I have marketing data and I need to determine how effective the marketing is. The marketing strategy is to publish facebook posts at inconsistent intervals. The goal is to see how the number of likes translates into revenue . The data that I have is: Daily revenues (revenue vs time since a facebook post ) Number of likes (with date) The weather (sunshine, cloudy, rainy/snowy, and daytime temperature) (derived) Season and day of the week Most likely the relationship between number of likes and revenue will be non-linear and greatly depend on weather and the day of the week . Also, the weather is not independent of season . Finally, the effect of facebook posts is lagged, and potentially the lag varies significantly. Questions Do I need to correct for growth of revenues over the years? If yes, how? (by finding a regression model, and then adjusting the values around it?) How would I find the average lag period between a post and a change in revenue "due" to that post? What models can I use to determine the effect of likes ? Personal thoughts ARIMA (not quite sure how it works) Regression trees. For example, if I wanted to see how the power (to increase revenue) of the number of likes is affected by the weather , I could make a plot of likes vs weather by: To find one point on that plot, keep number of likes and weather static. Iterate over all possible values of all other variables. Merge the predictions into one (the average or the median). Fourier analysis to determine the lag Would a Markov model work here? Or potentially conditional random fields?
