functon is not a valid keyword here. Assuming that this is a cut & paste mistake, make sure of the following things: you have at least two scenes in your build settings it works in the editor (load the scene 0 in the editor and press play) you've added your script to an object in the scene '0' Also, I suggest using scene names instead of scene index when calling Application.LoadLevel . For example, you could have a scene called "Preload" and another called "Menu". Your "Preload" scene would be the first one in your build settings. The call would then be: Application.LoadLevel("Menu"); Which is less error-prone if you reorganize the order of the scenes in the build settings, especially once your project starts getting bigger.
