Estimate UCM Equation from Ucm model?

Given the output of a ucm sas procedure i need to estimate the equations from the given output , but i don't really know how to do it or where to start. Do you have any hints or anything that might help me? (I read the SAS documentation and the likes, but there isn't any example). It's the time series of the logarithm of the number of passengers. These are the print screens i have Anything would be really apreaciated!
