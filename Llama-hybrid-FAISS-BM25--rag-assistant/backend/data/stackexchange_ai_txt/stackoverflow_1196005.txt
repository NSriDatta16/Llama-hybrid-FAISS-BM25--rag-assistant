It totally depends on what simplexml_load_string does. Suppose the implementation uses globals: function simplexml_load_string() { global $a; $a++; /* we're increasing the global value of $a each time the function is called */ } It will definitely output unidentified behavior. Other than that, local variables storage will be deleted and pushed on the stack everytime.
