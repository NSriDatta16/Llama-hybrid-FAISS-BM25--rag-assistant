Pearson vs Spearman vs Kendall Averaging the results from the Pearson and Spearman coefficients does not make sense in this case. The Pearson coefficient measures the linear relationship between two numerical variables , while the Spearman coefficient measures the monotonic relationship between two variables . These are two different types of relationships, and averaging their values does not provide any meaningful information about the relationship between the variables in your dataset. Instead of averaging the values of the Pearson and Spearman coefficients, you could provide both coefficients to the user and explain what each coefficient represents and how it can be used to understand the relationship between the variables in your dataset. This would give the user more information and allow them to make more informed decisions based on the results. Overall, it is generally not a good idea to simply average the values of the Pearson and Spearman coefficients , as this does not provide any meaningful information about the relationship between the variables in your dataset.
