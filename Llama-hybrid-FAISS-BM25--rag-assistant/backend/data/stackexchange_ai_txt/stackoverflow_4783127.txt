ASP Response.Status not set correctly

I'm using Classic ASP and need to redirect a URL with a status code of 301. Here is the code I am using: response.clear Response.Status="301 Moved Permanently" Response.AddHeader "Location", "http://www.frickingnutz.com" Response.redirect ( "http://www.frickingnutz.com" ) response.end However, when I use one of the many 'header' checking sites, I discover that IIS is returning a 302 status code: HTTP/1.1 302 Object moved => Server => Microsoft-IIS/5.0 Date => Mon, 24 Jan 2011 14:20:08 GMT X-Powered-By => ASP.NET Location => http://www.frickingnutz.com Connection => Keep-Alive Content-Length => 148 Content-Type => text/html; Charset=UTF-8 Set-Cookie => ASPSESSIONIDACCTDCSS=NLPNLBHCFEBAPMPODJPMDNMB; path=/ Cache-control => private In fact I can't force any status code at all, I tried various different ones as a test, and all I can get is the 302. I suspect it is some IIS setting but couldn't find anything.
