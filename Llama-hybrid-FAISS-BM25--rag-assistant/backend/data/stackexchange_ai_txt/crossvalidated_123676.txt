(This is really a comment to @ttnphns's second answer) As far as the different type of reproduction of covariance assuming error by PC and by FA is concerned, I've simply printed out the loadings/components of variance which occur in the two procedures; just for the examples I took 2 variables. We assume the construction of the two items as of one common factor and itemspecific factors. Here is that factor-loadingsmatrix: L_fa: f1 f2 f3 X1: 0.894 0.447 . X1: 0.894 . 0.447 The correlation matrix by this is C: X1 X2 X1: 1.000 0.800 X2: 0.800 1.000 If we look at the loadings-matrix L_fa and interpret it as usual in FA that f2 and f3 are error terms/itemspecific error, we reproduce C without that error, receiving C1_Fa X1 X2 X1: 0.800 0.800 X2: 0.800 0.800 So we have perfectly reproduced the off-diagonal element, which is the covariance (and the diagonal is reduced) If we look at the pca-solution (can be done by simple rotations) we get the two factors from the same correlation-matrix: L_pca : f1 f2 X1: 0.949 -0.316 X2: 0.949 0.316 Assuming the second factor as error we get the reproduced matrix of covariances C1_PC : X1 X2 X1: 0.900 0.900 X2: 0.900 0.900 where we've overestimated the true correlation. This is because we ignored the correcting negative partial covariance in the second factor = error. Note that the PPCA would be identical with the first example. With more items this is no more so obvious but still an inherent effect. Therefore there is also the concept of MinRes-extraction (or -rotation?) and I've also seen something like maximum-determinant extraction and... [update] As for the question of @amoeba: I understood the concept of "Minimal Residuals" ("MinRes")-rotation as a concurring method to the earlier methods of CFA-computation, to achieve the best reproduction of the off-diagonal elements of a correlation matrix. I learned this in the 80'ies/90'ies and didn't follow the development of factor-analysis (as indepth as before in the recent years), so possibly "MinRes" is out of fashion. To compare it with the PCA-solution : one can think of finding the pc-solution by rotations of the factors when they are thought as axes in an euclidean space and the loadings are the coordinates of the items in that vectorspace. Then for a pair of axes say x,y the sums-of-squares from the loadings of the x-axis and that of the y-axis are computed. From this one can find a rotation angle, by which we should rotate, to get the sums-of-squares in the rotated axes maximal on the x° and minimal on the y°-axis (where the little circle indicates the rotated axes). Doing this for all pairs of axes (where only always the x-axis is the left and the y-axis is the right (so for 4 factors we have only 6 pairs of rotation)) and then repeat the whole process to a stable result realizes the so-called "Jacobi-method" for the finding of the principal components solution: it will locate the first axis such that it collects the maximum possible sum of squares of loadings ("SSqL") (which means also "of the variance") on one axis in the current correlational configuration. As far as I understood things, " MinRes " should look at the partial correlations instead of the SSqL; so it does not sum up the squares of the loadings (as done in the Jacobi-pc-rotation) but is sums up the crossproducts of the loadings in each factor - except of the "crossproducts" (=squares) of the loadings of each item with itself. After the criteria for the x and for the y-axis are computed it proceeds the same way as described for the iterative Jacobi-rotation. Since the rotation-criterion is numerically different from the maximum-SSqL-criterion the result/the rotational position shall be different from the PCA-solution. If it converges it should instead provide the maximum possible partial correlation on one axis in the first factor, the next maximal correlation on the next factor and so on. The idea seems to be, then to assume so many axes/factors such that the remaining/residual partial covariance becomes marginal. (Note this is only how I interpreted things, I've not seen that procedure explicitly written out (or cannot remember at the moment); a description at mathworld seems to express it rather in terms of the formulae like in amoeba's answer) and is likely more authoritative. Just found another reference in the R-project documentation and a likely very good reference in the Gorsuch book on factoranalysis, page 116, available via google-books )
