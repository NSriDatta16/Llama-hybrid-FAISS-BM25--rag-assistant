Reliable way to know if the user allows storage of Local Shared Objects (LSO)

There is a small feature I have implemented that makes uses of the Local Shared Objects to work properly. I wish to be able to help the user self-diagnose if he is unable to use the said feature because he refused access for this computer to writing local shared objects and give him instructions to work around the issue if it applies to him. I'm looking for something similar to the muted property of the Microphone class (http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/media/Microphone.html) or the Camera class.
