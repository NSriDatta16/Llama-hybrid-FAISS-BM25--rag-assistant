Statistics for rounded data

I wonder about the existence of "standard" statistical procedures for rounded (log)normal data. Indeed, in my work I often encounter rounded data which potentially cause some problems: "awful" qqplots, zeros for lognormal data... Do there exist in the literature some theoretical studies of usual statistical procedures (such as goodness-of-fit, t-test, ...) for rounded data ? EDIT: I have just discovered the MCMCtobit() function in the MCMCpack R package : Gaussian Linear Regression with a Censored Dependent Variable; the dependent variable may be censored from below, from above, or both. In my case the dependent variable is censored by its rounded value, hence the censoring is data-dependent. Is it correct to use MCMCtobit() in this context ? EDIT2 : Now I have discovered the grouped R package . I think this is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for the comments given below!
