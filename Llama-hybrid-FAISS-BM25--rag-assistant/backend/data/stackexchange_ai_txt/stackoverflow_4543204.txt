If your MyColumns derive from DataColumn, you can put them in the DataTable cast as a DataColumn. Your MyTable could then extract the columns and up-cast them to MyColumn. Please note that this isn't the best option; you might be better off using something other than ADO.NET 2. But if that's the route you have to go, that's an option for you. Note: you should always test the type of the DataColumn objects before upcasting to a MyColumn, lest InvalidCastException become a problem for you.
