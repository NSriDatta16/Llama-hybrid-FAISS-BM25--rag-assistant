Finally after some hours research and testing I found a VERY nice solution for embedding special fonts into websites. Using the approach via CSS3 font-face is imho the best solution. The only overhead-thing you have to do for IE, is to convert your Truetype fonts (Unfortunately OTF is not working.) into EOT files. Microsoft WEFT is a solution, but the BEST way to do this, is to use the open-sourced tool 'ttf2eot', which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/ A web-based frontend can be found searching 'kirsle wizards' on Google. The only thing to notice is browser support... IE4,5,6,7,8 use the EOT files, while TTF support is only provided by Firefox versions >= 3.1. About Safari and Opera I'm not sure, but Safari 4 worked for me, and Opera 10 too. (So Chrome doesn't support it I guess, due to usage of an older webkit version?!) Based on our agency's clients' tracking statistics "only" 15 to 20% of their visitors use incompatible browsers like Firefox 2.0 or 3.0, older Safari or Opera versions or Chrome.
