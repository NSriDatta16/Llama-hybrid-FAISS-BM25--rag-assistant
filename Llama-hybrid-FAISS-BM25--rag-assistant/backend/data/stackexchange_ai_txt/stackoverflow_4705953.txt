Is there any real advantage to use zend ce server over just referencing (include) the zend framework library?

I'm new to PHP frameworks, and currently I'm trying Zend Framework (ZF). I'm old fashioned when it comes to installing software, I like to install apache/mysql/php all separetely since I find easier and it gives me more control of it. It seems that the "encouraged" way to develop with Zend Framework is using the Zend (CE) Server. I personally don't like this idea of a app install everything else (PHP/Apache and so on). From what I've seen if I include Zend Framework Library in php.ini path I'm ready to go. So is there any real advantage to use the Full Zend (CE) Server??
