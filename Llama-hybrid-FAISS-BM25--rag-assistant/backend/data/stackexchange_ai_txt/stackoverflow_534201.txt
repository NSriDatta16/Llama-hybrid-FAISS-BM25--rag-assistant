Is it possible to measure function coverage with gcov?

Currently we use gcov with our testing suite for Linux C++ application and it does a good job at measuring line coverage. Can gcov produce function/method coverage report in addition to line coverage? Looking at the parameters gcov accepts I do not think it is possible, but I may be missing something. Or, probably, is there any other tool that can produce function/method coverage report out of statistics generated by gcc? Update: By function/method coverage I mean percentage of functions that get executed during tests.
