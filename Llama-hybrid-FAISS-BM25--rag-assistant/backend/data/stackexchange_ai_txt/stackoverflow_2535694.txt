Debugging mod_rewrite

I'm playing around with Apache's mod_rewrite module, and want to know if there is a decent way to output some debugging information? For example, the documentation lists a number of variables available: %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}, %{HTTP_REFERER}, %{HTTP_COOKIE} ... etc Is there a way I could output these just to see what I'm working with? I set up the RewriteLog (Level 2) and have been looking at that, but it'd be nice to be able to see the value of the variables.
