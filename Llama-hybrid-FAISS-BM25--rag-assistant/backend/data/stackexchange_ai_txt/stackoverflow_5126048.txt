Doing a join operation with a negative condition in Rails

I have two models: class Member and class MemberTag I want to perform the following join: Member.all(:joins=>:member_tags, :conditions=>" all members that don't have a member_tag with tag="hidden" ) How do I do this? I guess it's more of an SQL question, than a rails one :)
