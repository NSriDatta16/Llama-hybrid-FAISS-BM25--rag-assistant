One physical measurement for the quality of sound is the SNR: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio . I don't know of any lib that does that for you, but it is not to hard to do yourself: calculate the noise: noise[n] = manipulated[n] - original[n], n = sample index calculate the power of "noise" and of "original": p_noise[n] = noise[n] * noise[n], ... get the SNR by dividing the values = SNR[n] = p_original[n]/p_noise[n] You may want to calculate an average(!) SNR... I hope you can figure out how to do that yourself. This should put your on the right track.
