How do I build a on-the-fly search engine? (with ranking/relevancy)

I was a heavy user in Sphinx and Lucene. Sphinx just takes a database, indexes it. And you call Sphinx to get the ID's. But what if I want to create a search engine that's very tiny . Just a few rows of data and a few paragraphs of words? The trick is, the rows of data is constantly changing. So, I can't have an "index". I want to be able to rank by relevancy, just like Sphinx. How can I do that? Of course, I wouldn't go through the indexing...
