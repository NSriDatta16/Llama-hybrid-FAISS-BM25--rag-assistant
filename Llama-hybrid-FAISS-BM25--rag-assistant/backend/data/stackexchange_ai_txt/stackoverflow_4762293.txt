We need more information. What type is commands ? Either way, a better solution than a busy wait (spinning in a while loop) is to have some sort of wait/notify mechanism. The obvious candidate for your problem seems to be a BlockingQueue (like ArrayBlockingQueue or LinkedBlockingQueue ). The retrieval methods of this type block until there is data (a command) available, instead of requiring you to constantly poll until there is a command available. E.g. BlockingQueue commands = new LinkedBlockingQueue (); //... //wait for the next element and then get it while(!stop) { Command nextCommand = commands.take(); //do something with nextCommand } References LinkedBlockingQueue
