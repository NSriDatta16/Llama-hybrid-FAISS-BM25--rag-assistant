Coding standards are a classic bike-shed topic. People argue and fight about this stuff BECAUSE it's little, and ultimately not as important, as good design. Clean, readable code is worth having, and clean readable badly designed code is very little better than unreadable badly designed code. Maybe the most readable bad code makes it easier to figure out that it needs throwing away. Efforts to encourage team members to contribute clean readable code can include the promotion of style guides. Style guide reviews where you bash someone repeatedly for using the wrong style, are counter productive. If someone has trouble using an acceptable style, introduce them to the joys of using some tools. Do not make a highly competent programmer buckle under the strain of too much criticism over very minor points.
