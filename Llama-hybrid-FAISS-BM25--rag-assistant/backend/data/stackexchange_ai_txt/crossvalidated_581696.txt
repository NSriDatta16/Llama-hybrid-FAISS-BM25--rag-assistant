Cointegration between 2 Stocks. - confirming Times Series Stationarity using ADF & KPSS Test

I had created a google sheet with the help of online resources, - to conduct cointegration test on 2 stocks time series. It checks null hypothesis, to see that a unit root is present on the residual between linear regression any 2 stocks time series. Pl. refer google sheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0_oHLTcT9tmTJPgKVgkGwGWhooBM8uluwmWcC92eOk/edit?usp=sharing For ADF, It compares T-stat of Delta X & lagged X with critical Value at (10%, 5 % & 1%). I seek clarity for the process of KPSS test. In order to check stationarity of the residual series - the series selected in ADF is Delta X (daily change in the diff. between predicted Stock B value & actual StockB value) & lagged X. Do I need to select same series (Delta X & lagged X) or do we need to select time (date range of time series) and ratio (i.e. StockA / StockB), inorder to check stationarity of residual. The incomparability in ADF and KPSS results, created doubt on the results. Seek attention of the Statistics experts (as I am not). If more info reqd. do let me know.
