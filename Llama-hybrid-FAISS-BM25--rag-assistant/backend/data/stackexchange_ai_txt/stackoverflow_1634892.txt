jQuery UI Selectables - Start Drag-Selecting from Outside of Objects

I am using the jQuery UI Slectable http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/ Once initialized (just like in the demo on that link). drag-selecting only works if I start holding the mouse button on top of a object. If I start drag-selecting from outside of the objects, the selecting does not work. Is there any way to enable it so the user can initiate the drag-selecting outside of the Selectable objects?
