desktop icon functionality in a window

My wife complains that I have too many icons on the Windows XP-Pro desktop. I like to be able to quickly drop a file onto the icon for application I want to have open it. And I like to follow a link to open often-used deeply nested folders rather than navigate there. Thus, I have over 100 icons on the desktop. (We share the same user account because we switch back and forth so often and because we both need to access the same e-mail, so separate accounts isn't the answer.) I'd like to write a program which would have similar functionality to the Windows desktop. Then I could open that window to do the drag and drop work, but, when minimized, would leave the desktop display sparsely populated for my wife. As an added bonus, I could implement better organization of the icons than the desktop allows. This is similar to what an Explorer window does, with the key exception that the desktop allows you to do some arrangement of icons. (For instance, program icons on the left (with the most used ones near the top), folders at the top, data files on the right.) How do I go about getting an icon to display in a Windows Form (or on an appropriate control on the form)? (For instance, if I drop in a link to Notepad or a link to a file folder.) How do I take the same action that the desktop does if the icon is double clicked? (For instance, if a link to a folder is double clicked.) How do I take the same action that the desktop does if the icon has something dragged onto it? (For instance, a text file is dragged onto the Notepad icon.) I'm using Visual Studio and C#.NET for programming. I know how to do basic drag and drop. I do not know: A. what controls to use on the form to display the icons B. how to find the icon C. what commands are built by the desktop under various situations (so I can emulate the functionality) I apologize that this is a multi-part question, but it was hard to break apart without explaining the whole story again.
