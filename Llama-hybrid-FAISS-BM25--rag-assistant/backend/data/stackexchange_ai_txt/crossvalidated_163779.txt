In case of classification generally there are two ways to ensemble the prediction. Lets say it's a binary class classification problem and you have 3 models to ensemble called m1,m2 and m3 and the training dataset is called train and testing dataset called test.Models are already build on train.Then a python code will be as following. First method is to take a round of the average pred=round([m1.predict(test)+m2.predict(test)+m3.predict(test)]/3) So the output will be a vector of value 0 and 1 Second method is to ensemble the prediction probability of each class from these models and ensemble that and then decide the class either on the basis of a hard threshold or some logic. pred_proba=[m1.predict(test).predict_proba++ m2.predict(test).predict_proba +m3.predict(test).predict_proba]/3 # Simple average ensemble,however you can try weighted average as well iterate through the entire pred_proba vector to find which one in 0 and which 1 is 1 basing on hard threshold 0.5 pred=[] # Initialize a blank list for prediction for x in pred_proba: if x>0.5: pred.append[1] else: pred.append[0] So pred is the final ensemble prediction.
