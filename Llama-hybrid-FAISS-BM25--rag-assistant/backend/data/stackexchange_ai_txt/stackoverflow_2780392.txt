Hmm, you want either do what you describe, which will allow the Contract to be in invalid (start/end) state when someone tries to use the contact without prior date event, or you can try to add the call to that function in a constructor, so your contract is in proper state right away. There might be other solutions, but you should think about what other events (messages/method calls) can happen on the contract than the date. Some might affect the stae as well. BTW. your solution is not as complicated when you instead of embedding the state machine only connects the start and end to active and passive states.
