Use zip: [c/t for c,t in zip(conversions, trials)] The most elegant way to get floats is to upgrade to Python 3.x. If you need to use Python 2.x then you could write this: >>> [float(c)/t for c,t in zip(conversions, trials)] [0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75] Alternatively you could add this at the start of your file: from __future__ import division But note that this will affect the behaviour of division everywhere in your program, so you need to check carefully to see if there are any places where you want integer division and if so write // instead of / .
