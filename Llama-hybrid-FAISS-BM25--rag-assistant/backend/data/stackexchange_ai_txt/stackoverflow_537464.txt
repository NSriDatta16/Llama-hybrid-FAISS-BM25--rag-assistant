How to deal with those TDD breaking people?

Personally I really prefer Unit Testing and write them for "good" coverage. (let's say I try as hard as possible to write good tests ;) As usual some time later someone different needs to add some features to the code (add methods to classes and so on). He doesn't break those written unit tests but refuses to write additional (which would cover those additional features of the code he wrote). This leads to a big hole in the tdd process (and even worse maybe a broken window effect) anything I can do to make him write those tests? how do you deal with those people?
