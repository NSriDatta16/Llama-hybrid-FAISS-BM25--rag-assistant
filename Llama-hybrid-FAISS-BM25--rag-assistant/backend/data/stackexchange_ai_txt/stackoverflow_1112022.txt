Hmmm...I don't think you're going about this the right way. First of all, you should have your view controller adopt the UITextFieldDelegate protocol in your header file. @interface MyViewController : UIViewController Next, you want to want to use the following method in your implementation file: - (void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField { //My text field has been edited! } If you are building your application with Interface Builder, you can set your view controller as the delegate by dragging a connection from the delegate outlet to your File's Owner in your XIB. Otherwise, you will just use the following code: myTextField.delegate = self; That should do it!
