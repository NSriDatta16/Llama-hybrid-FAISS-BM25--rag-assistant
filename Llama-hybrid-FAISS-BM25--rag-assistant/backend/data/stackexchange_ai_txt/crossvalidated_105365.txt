My first try to approach this issue is through simple linear regression, in that case you could just run a regression with independent variable as week num and the dependent variable as traffic count, assuming linear relation, you could try to capture the long term trend, though this attitude assumes that all the OLS assumptions arn't violated, and in time series (which is your case) this could be easily violated. If youre using R, you could use the auto.arima function, and add external explaining variable as long term trend, let me show you an example with R (i tried to paste the data but got blocked by SO limitations) modArima and view Results of fit2, notice that the last coefficient of -0.6449 that shows the long term drop is significant Here you can see that the prediction manages to catch the long term drop:
