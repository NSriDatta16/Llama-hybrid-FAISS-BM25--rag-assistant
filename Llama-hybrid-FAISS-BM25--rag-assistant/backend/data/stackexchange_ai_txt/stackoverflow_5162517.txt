How to maintain a local mirror of Drupal.org projects?

Now that Drupal.org has switched to using Git , is there an easy way to maintain an up-to-date mirror of a selected subset (or even all) of the core and contrib projects locally? Or would that be discouraged because of the strain it would put on the drupal.org infrastructure? I realize I can clone individual projects, but I'd like a mirror that automatically pulls updates periodically. It would be nice to have projects available in the event of an outage, plus it would make it easier to develop when offline.
