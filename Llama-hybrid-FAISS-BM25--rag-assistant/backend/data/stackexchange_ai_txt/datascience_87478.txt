How to version data science projects with large files

I am working on a project with large data files (~300MB). I want to version my work along with the data files so that it is always available online. I tried using git-lfs but it has a 1GB/month bandwidth limit, beyond which you're blocked for a month. What are versioning tools using by data scientists for projects that use >100MB data files (both static and generated)?
