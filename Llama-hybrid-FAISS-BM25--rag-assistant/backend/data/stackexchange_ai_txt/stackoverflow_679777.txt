I did some experiments, and you can set console colors in emacs, but you are limited to this palette: black blue cyan green magenta red white yellow The white that you get is somewhat grayed out; full bright white is reserved for bold text. So if you run M-x facemenu-set-bold you will get bold (bright white) text for later insertions. I had no luck trying to force the default face to bold. (I don't really understand how faces work in emacs.)
