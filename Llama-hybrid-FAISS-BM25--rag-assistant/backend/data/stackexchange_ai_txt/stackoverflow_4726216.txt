You need to specify what template you are using for those methods or move the function implementation into the class. template storage :: ~storage() { delete[] organs; } Probably the easiest solution. The same should work for your second error as well. EDIT: Found a nice template tutorial which covers this, among other things. http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/
