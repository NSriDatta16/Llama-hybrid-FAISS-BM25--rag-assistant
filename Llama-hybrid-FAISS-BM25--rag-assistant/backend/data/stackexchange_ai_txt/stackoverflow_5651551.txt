Mo: As already stated, the two functions do exactly the same. You might also want to try doing something like this ( there cases where this might be beneficial ) function doSomething() { $return_value = false; if($oh) { $return_value = true; } return $return_value; } This doesnt do anything special, it's just a reorganisation.
