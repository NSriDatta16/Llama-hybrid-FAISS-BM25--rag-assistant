Maven template plugin?

I've looked and I can't seem to find a standalone maven plugin that one could use to generate files with Maven. I've seen a couple of projects that look like they might be going to do something like this, and I know the web start plugin uses velocity templates to generate the jnlp file. But I have not found anything that does this. In case you're wondering why one would want this - I'd like to be able to generate Eclipse plugin.xml files as part of a PDE build. Does anyone know of a Maven template plugin or how to generate Eclipse plugin.xml files from Maven?
