It is not incorrect to re-estimate the model with different reference categories in order to test the significance of group differences, but it's unnecessarily convoluted. It may be more elegant to estimate the model once and use a Wald tests on whether the coefficients are equal. This is easy in R. First, fit your model: model Then use the linearHypothesis function from the library car: linearHypothesis(model, "PoliticalOther = PoliticalRepublican")
