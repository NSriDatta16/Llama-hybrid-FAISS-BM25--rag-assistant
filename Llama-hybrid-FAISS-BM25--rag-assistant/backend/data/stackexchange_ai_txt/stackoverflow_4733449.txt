I would nominate myself except I would say that everyone should follow the four principles whether they are a nominated core moderator or not. Perhaps we should expect more from such a nominated position and I would be interested. I think those who have nominated themselves are top inidivudals and already set a higher example to others. I am open to discussion as to what people believe that might be. I particularly like; nominations who demonstrate a vision of how things could be done better. passion for the site and its quality. champion respect of others regardless of knowledge/skill level. challenge themselves and others to do better. encourage, guide and assist other moderators. but also have realistic expections of what can be achieved. My last thought; The speciality of moderators should represent the spread of expertise on this site.
