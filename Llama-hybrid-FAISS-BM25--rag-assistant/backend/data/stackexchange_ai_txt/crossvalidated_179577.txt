Thanks to the help on this forum i was also able to ask this consolidated form of the original question to one of the profs at my university who is teaching a time-series class this semester....which i should have taken :-) I thought his answer was pretty good, and also has some echos of other comments posted for this question. I'm not so sure I should accept this answer officially...but at least want to share it here. Prof Answer: You have some strange patterns in your data… it looks like there is some type of “structural break” (the form or pattern of the time process changes around time point 3000). It might make sense to break the time series into two pieces and analyze each separately, if everything else is not working so well. If covariances are indeed changing over time, then you would be violating the Box-Jenkins model. I would try some intermediate steps. First just difference your time series: compute Y_t= X_t - X_{t-1} (after log transformation) and see if it looks like there’s some similar pattern throughout. If so, then you could try fitting a ARMA model to the difference. Are you using a software package that computes ARMA models? Can you fit such models on the differences Y_t? Sometimes software packages will compute the k-step forecasts for the future… if you had those, then you could undo the differencing to get your predictions on-line. So for example, you get predictions in the future for Y_{n+1},…,Y_{n+k} and you know Y_{n+i} = X_{n+i}- X_{n+i-1} so you can find X_{n+i} = Y_{n+i}+X_{n+i-1} for i=1,…,k by the predictions for the differences Y_{n+i} and the observation you have for X_n. Otherwise, you might have to resort to Kalman filtering, which can be ok too. If you have any outliers you could just delete them in fitting the model. Essentially, you would have no information at that time point, but that’s better than misleading information. I guess that I just wonder (based on your initial graph) about how the fit of the time series model might improve if you considered breaking the time series into two pieces. Maybe you would do a better job of capturing extremes in the 2nd portion of the series.
