The attribute needs to have "Use in quick search" set to "Yes" in the attribute properties (e.g. under Catalog > Attributes > Manage Attributes). If you want to link to it easily, you could also enable "Use in advanced search", and then go to http://yoururl.com/catalogsearch/advanced , search for it and then just copypaste that URL. I use for example the following URL in our shop to link to selected products from the frontpage: http://www.k55.ch/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?front=683&mode=list This is just a search for products where the attribute with code "front" has the value "683". Actually, 683 is an internal id that magento generates, but that doesn't really matter.
