There's a good investigation by Joshua Flanagan with test harness and results on his blog. It reads as if he was having a similar problem to what you describe. There's two ways to do it, and you'll have to evaluate which is the best for you, and whether either have any knock-on effects. Explictly open and close the database connection. So rather than just open the database with SqlDatabase , you'll need to create a SqlConnection and call Open() on it. Simply add Connection Reset=False onto your connection string. I don't know the pros and cons of this approach however, so don't know if there's any side-effects of this as I understand this can disable connection pooling. You'll know better than I will within the context of your application/utility. I suggest reading the blog article for all the gory details, then do a little bit of digging around to see which is the best for you.
