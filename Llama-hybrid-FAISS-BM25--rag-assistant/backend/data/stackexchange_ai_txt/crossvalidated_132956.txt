No. The standard convention is that posterior [distribution] over parameter $\alpha$ is $$ P(\alpha | D) $$ Just like $P(x)$ is some distribution over $x$, $P(\alpha | D)$ is a distribution over $\alpha$. Posterior here means that we condition $\alpha$ on given data $D$. If we didn't, it'd be a prior (in Bayesian terms) [distribution] $P(\alpha)$. $P(D|\alpha)$ is not a distribution over $\alpha$, it's called likelihood .
