Statistical test to measure significant difference between 4 binary classifiers?

I have four versions of a neural network hardware. I am testing the hardwares to classify a single binary input into a binary output. The ANN hardwares are trained using a very simple relation, the NOT boolean function: Input Output -1 1 1 -1 However, I am using the following relation for verification Input..............Output $>$ zero............ $ zero $ zero............ $>$ zero A perfect NOT function classifier would follow the relation above: Now, I want to compare the performance of the 4 ANN hardwares to the perfect classifier. What statistical test can I use to show the statistical significance between the ann hardware and the perfect classifier?
