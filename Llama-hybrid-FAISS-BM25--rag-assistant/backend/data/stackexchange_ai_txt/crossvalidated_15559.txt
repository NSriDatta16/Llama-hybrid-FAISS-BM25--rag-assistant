I am assuming you know that the stepwise regression is a wrong approach (see Frank Harrell's terrific book , or just wait for his comments in this thread), and you are ready to face the criticism of the reviewers (or your dissertation committee, depending on your career stage). I am thus treating this as a programming exercise, rather than a rigorous methodological investigation. Stata stepwise command does not support factor variables, as you have probably discovered already, so you'd have to rewrite its main functionality, at least at a descriptive level. I will make use of Ben Jann's estadd command published in Stata Journal. net sj 7-2 st0085_1 net install st0085_1 webuse nlswork, clear foreach catvar of varlist race grade ind_code occ_code { regress ln_wage age i.`catvar' levelsof `catvar', local( thelevels ) tokenize `thelevels' local dotcat while "`1'"!="" { local dotcat `dotcat' `1'.`catvar' macro shift } test `dotcat' estadd scalar pnew = r(p) estimates store with_`catvar' } estimates tab with_* , stats( pnew ) The last line gives you the answers (not terribly informative in this case, of course, as the sample sizes are quite a bit larger than yours). Feel free to ask about specific commands in this code fragment. Of course, you'd modify this for your own data and estimation command of your liking. The above code assumes Stata 11 and factor variables; you have not stated what version of Stata you are using, which would've helped.
