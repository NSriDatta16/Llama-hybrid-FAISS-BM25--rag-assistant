In that context it probably means just "construct a database" so you just have to construct your database structure (tables, foreign keys etc) UPDATE: yes I think I will stick to my opinion. You have to design a database structure that will conform to that diagram (the diagram describes table relationships inside the database) and entities are tables. Database instance just means database. A quick search on google provides the answer: "An organization with an employees database might have three different instances: production (used to contain live data), pre-production (used to test new functionality prior to release into production) and development (used by database developers to create new functionality)." http://databases.about.com/od/administration/g/instance.htm Good luck :)
