I'm not a windows person so my answers won't exactly suit your situation. I'd recommend embedding a full blown scripting language interpreter into your application. Expose some primitives (ie. the parts of your rule engine you want public) and then provide a full blown interpreter. I know that TCL, Python and Guile are designed to be embedded in this fashion. I'd personally recommend Python since Scheme (guile) is a little esoteric and TCL seems to be losing ground generally.
