The answers above will work, but it is more elegant to have 4 viewcontrollers instead of 4 views. That gives you the option to make the actual views only when they are called for, and get rid (unload) some of the hidden ones in case the device is running short of memory. (You're basically reinventing apple's UITabBarController, that one uses viewcontrollers too)
