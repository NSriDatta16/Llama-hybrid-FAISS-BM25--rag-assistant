Testing multicollinearity assumption for logistic regression

My model is dealing with survey data for a mixed-effects logistic regression model. All of my variables in the model are categorical (most are binary). What can I use in R to assess the multicollinearity assumption? Model: mixed_model_one Sick, Wash_Binary, Food, MotherEducation, Vaccination , and Salary are binary. Hamlet has 5 unordered levels.
