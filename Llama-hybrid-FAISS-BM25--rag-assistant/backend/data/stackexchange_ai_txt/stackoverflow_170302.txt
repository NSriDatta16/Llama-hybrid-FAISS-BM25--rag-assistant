Should we take the coverage reported by such a tool with a grain of salt when writing tests? Absolutely. The coverage tool only tells you what proportion of lines in your code were actually run during tests. It doesn't say anything about how thoroughly those lines were tested . Some lines of code need to be tested only once or twice, but some need to be tested over a wide range of inputs. Coverage tools can't tell the difference.
