The difference lies not in the equations but in what they are used for. Whereas in linear regression X is an observed known value, in a linear factor model X is itself a random variable. The linear factor model is a statement about the joint distribution of X, Y and Z. Furthermore, linear factor models are often used to describe time series, for example it could relate a time series Y_t to another time series X_t that in turn is described by another stochastic process.
