Below is an overview of the data that you have collected (or will be collecting): Class Control: Inductive teaching approach (n=14) Student Score Pre Score Post Score Delayed Student 1 x y z ... ... ... ... Student 14 a b c Class Experimentation: Deductive teaching approach (n=16) Student Score Pre Score Post Score Delayed Student 1 x y z ... ... ... ... Student 16 a b c For your first assessment (post-test), one approach that I could suggest would be: for each group and each student, calculate the difference of score between Pre and Post. You will get 2 samples $X_1$ and $X_2$ of "differences" (i.e. increase or decrease in score within each class and by student) and then perform a Welch's t-test on the obtained samples to determine whether the means of both approaches are statistically significant: null hypothesis: means (variation of score in average) are equal alternative hypothesis: means (variation of score in average) are not equal in R, t.test(X1, X2) will perform a Welch t-test by default with unequal variance. The output of the test will also provide you with the confidence interval. You can follow the same approach for the second test. For this type of test, you can also consider Mann-Whitney. There is study from Winter and Dodou that you can find in the stats literature that could be relevant to your problem. Here is a link on a site that covers this issue: https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/best-way-to-analyze-likert-item-data-two-sample-t-test-versus-mann-whitney You can also have a look at @Glen_b's answer which discuss the approach: Mann Whitney or two tailed t-test
