Analyzing test scores with different size groups

Let's say I have a group of people who have taken a test, and the group is broken down into different races. However, the number of people of each race is different (30% Caucasian, 50% Asian, 20% African American). I measure the scores on a test for each person, and I want to see if the average score on the test is correlated with race. I know ANOVA is generally used to compare means of different groups, but I'm not entirely sure if it's applicable in this situation when the racial groups are of different size. What kind of analysis do you think I could do to answer this question?
