One potential problem is that everything is being stored in cookies. If someone somehow manages to get their hands on the Session ID, then they've also got the username and hashed string. Chris Shiflett suggests creating some kind of fingerprint from the User-Agent string, or some other regular header, and storing it in a GET variable. One way to bump up security is to have everything sent over SSL. Any time any kind of potential information is sent or received (such as the Session ID in a cookie), make it encrypted - not just the login form.
