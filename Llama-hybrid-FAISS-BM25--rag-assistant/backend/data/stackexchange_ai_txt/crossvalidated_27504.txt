I'm not quite sure how to explain your problem, but I can offer a potential solution -- try using an R package called glmnet instead. I have used glmnet for both linear and logistic regression. In one particular problem, I had approximately 1,200 cases (i.e. N = 1,200) and about 110 predictors. The package gave me great results. Of course, it's worth pointing out that glmnet is primarily used for penalized logistic regression, but since the package lets you select the degree of penalty to apply, I'm sure you can set the penalty to zero to obtain the results of regular logistic regression (i.e. one with no penalty). In any case, the package was made specifically for problems in high dimensions (even N
