I would recommend that you look into using Transactional Replication. It sounds as though you are looking to implement a scenario that is similar to what we are currently implementing ourselves. We use Transaction Replication (albeit real time, you would most likely wish to synchronize your environment on a less frequent schedule) to offload a copy of our live production database to another server for reporting purposes. Offloading reporting data is a common replication scenario and is described here in the Microsoft Replication documentation. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151784.aspx Brent is right in that there is indeed an element of configuration required with Replication, along with security considerations that would need to be addressed however, there are a number of key advantages to using Replication in my opinion, including: Reduced latency in comparison to log shipping. The ability to Publish only the Articles (tables) that are required for reporting. Reduced storage requirements. Less data being published means less network traffic. Access to your reporting data/database at all times. For example, in our environment, we decided to replicate only the specific tables (articles) from our production database that we actually require for reporting. I hope what I have described is clear and makes sense but please do feel free to contact me if you have any queries.
