How to correctly interpret the table function to determine logistic regression accuracy?

I have a set of data, that gives the length of a species of abalone, and its corresponding type (male, M, female, F, or infant, I). ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone ) I have constructed a logistic regression to create a model that will determine whether the abalone is M/F or I, given the length. (M and F are classed as the same.) So I write the following in R to generate and test the model on data points: g The output table is: pairs 0 F 0 I 0 M 1 F 1 I 1 M 218 6 210 1089 1336 1318 How can I correctly interpret this? These are the options I have come up with: 1089 females correctly identified, 218 females incorrectly identified; 1318 males correctly identified, 210 males incorrectly identified; 1336 infants correctly identified, 6 incorrectly identified. 218 females correctly identified, 6 infants and 210 males incorrectly identified; 1089 females incorrectly identified, 1336 infants and 1318 males incorrectly identified.
