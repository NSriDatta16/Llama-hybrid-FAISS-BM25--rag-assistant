If you're targeting iOS 3.2 or greater, you can use UIRotationGestureRecognizer . The code would look something like this: In your setup method ( viewDidLoad or init , etc,): UIRotationGestureRecognizer *rotationGesture = [[UIRotationGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleRotate:)]; rotationGesture.delegate = self; [myImageView addGestureRecognizer:rotationGesture]; [rotationGesture release]; The event handler: - (void)handleRotate:(UIRotationGestureRecognizer *)recognizer { if(recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { recognizer.view.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(recognizer.view.transform, recognizer.rotation); [recognizer setRotation:0]; } } I have some more examples of gesture recognizers (including the one above) on github .
