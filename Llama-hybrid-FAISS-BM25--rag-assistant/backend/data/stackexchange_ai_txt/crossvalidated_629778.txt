Updating a Beta prior based on observations from a product of two Independent Bernoulli variables

I'm working on a problem involving Bayesian updating with a Beta prior, but the data I observe comes from a slightly complex source. Let $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ and $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(q)$ , where $q$ is known. I don't directly observe $X$ . Instead, I observe $Z = XY$ . I would like to estimate $p$ . Here are some intuition based on some preliminary calculations: If $Z = 1$ , I believe the update on the prior $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ should be $\text{Beta}(\alpha+1,\beta)$ since $X$ definitely equals 1. If $Z = 0$ , I deduced that the update should be $\text{Beta}(\alpha+P(X=1|Z=0),\beta+1âˆ’P(X=1|Z=0))$ . Can someone provide a detailed proof or justification for these updates? Specifically, I'm interested in the logic behind the fractional update when observing $Z = 0$ and its validity within the Bayesian framework.
