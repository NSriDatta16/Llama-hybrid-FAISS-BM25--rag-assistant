What you're asking can't be done. From the docs: UIKit allows three different forms of action selector: - (void)action - (void)action:(id)sender - (void)action:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent *)event Since you have no influence on the event parameter, the sender object must include all information you want to pass to the action method. Despite what you have written in your comment on mihirsm's answer, you can indeed subclass UIButton to add all the additional info you want to each button instance. You could also use the button's tag property to identify it (assign a unique tag to each button) and store all the additional info in an array or dictionary using the tags as keys. Update: In the future, you can also use associative storage to add data to objects without subclassing them but this technology is not (yet) available on the iPhone platform (10.6 only at the moment).
