Controls versus standard HTML

I'm getting into ASP.NET (C# - I know it doesn't matter for this particular question, but full disclosure and all that), and while I love that the asp: -style controls save me a lot of tedious HTML-crafting, I am often frustrated with certain behaviors. I encountered one last night when working with Master Pages: my , when converted into HTML, became . There are other issues--I noticed that when you auto-populate a DataGrid, it adds attributes to the resulting table that I don't necessarily want there. I know that there is a certain amount of "convention over configuration" that you have to accept when you rely on a framework to take over some of your tedious duties, but the "conventions" in these cases aren't so much any established conventions, but rather unnecessary extras. I know why the ID adds the prefix, but I should be able to tweak and turn things like this off, especially since, as a bit of a web standards evangelist, I don't duplicated HTML id's in a single page anyway. So the question here is for those ASP.NET devs more seasoned than I: in your experiences in developing and deploying apps, how do you leverage these controls? Do you find yourself resorting back to hard-coded HTML? Do you use a blend? I don't want to design my HTML around idiosyncratic quirks in these controls, but, if possible, I'd like to leverage them when possible. What's a boy to do?
