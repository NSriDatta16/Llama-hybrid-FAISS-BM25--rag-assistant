Take a look at this link: HTTP Authorization and .NET WebRequest, WebClient Classes I had the same problem as you. I have only added one line and it started to work. Try this private void ThisDoesntWork() { WebClient wc = new WebClient(); wc.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("username", "password", "domain"); //After adding the headers it started to work ! wc.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)"); wc.DownloadString("http://teamfoundationserver/reports/........"); //blows up wih HTTP 401 }
