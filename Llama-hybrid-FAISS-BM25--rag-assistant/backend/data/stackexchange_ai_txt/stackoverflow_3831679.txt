This is not really a solution to linking issues but OpenCV is now in version 2.1 in release thanks to work by WillowGarage . The new builds use CMake based system and are much friendlier. Why don't you make a switch to a more up-to-date version. It offers many more functions especially in feature recognition using SIFT/HOG etc.
