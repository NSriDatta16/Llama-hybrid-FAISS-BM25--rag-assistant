To use special file extensions in your game, just do the following: Create some files in a format of your choice that have that extension, and then write some code that knows how to read that format, and point it at those files. File extensions are conventions, nothing more; there's nothing magic about them. ETA: As for embedding resources, there are a few different ways to approach that problem. One common technique is to keep all your resources bundled together in a small number of files - maybe only one (Guild Wars takes that approach). At the other extreme, you can leave your resources spread across many files in a directory tree, maybe in a custom format that requires special tools to modify, and maybe not. Civilization 4 does things this way, as do all the Turbine games I'm familiar with. This is a matter of taste, and not very important either way.
