How to use Python files spread out over many folders, or: how to organize a project

I am looking to make my project fulfill the guidelines described here: http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/docs/pph/ . I currently have the following directories: src/ test/ doc/ I would really like to organize my src/ file as follows: src/ similar_files/ other_files/ helpers/ etc However, I'm not familiar with how I could have my modules and classes interact the same way, i.e. if some module in one folder needs access to one in another folder. Is this a bad way to organize my project? If not, how can I accomplish what I want? Thanks!
