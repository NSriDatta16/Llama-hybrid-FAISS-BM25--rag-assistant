An H.264 stream is usually sent as a Transport Stream (TS). If you want to save it to file then you need to demux it and then mux it to a format suitable for file storage, for example MP4. You will probably need to disable bframes in your encoder. Saving an RTP H.264 didn't work for me with bframes enabled. I also advise to use a low keyint value because the dump will only be readable after the first keyframe. You can use VLC to save the incoming stream with this command: vlc -I rc rtp://@:4444 :sout=#std{access=file,mux=mp4,dst=output.mp4} :ipv4 Replace 4444 with the port number.
