How can I output a report in PDF format, where the name consists of values from fields?

I want to add functionality to my Access 2007 report whereby a PDF copy of the report is created at the click of a button. I know that there is an OutputTo macro which can do this for me, but it does not allow me to include report field values as part of the PDF's filename, namely: [Client Organisations].Code + "-" + Clients.Code + "-" + Invoices_Code + "-" + Format([Invoice Date],"yyyy") + ".pdf" While I have seen this MSDN thread and this SO question , I don't see the use of field values in any of the answers. I reckon VBA code is the way to go, so I (unsuccessfully) tried the following: Private Sub Create_PDF_Click() DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, , acFormatPDF, "" + [Client Organisations].Code + "-" + Clients.Code + "-" + Invoices_Code + "-" + Format([Invoice Date],"yyyy") + ".pdf", True End Sub Run-time error '2465': Microsoft Office Access can't find the field '|' referred to in your expression Any ideas out there?
