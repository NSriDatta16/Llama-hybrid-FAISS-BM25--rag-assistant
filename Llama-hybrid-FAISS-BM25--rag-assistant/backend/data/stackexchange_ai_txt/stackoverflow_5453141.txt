Not as far as I know. However, for O() notation to be meaningful, you have to define the cost of each basic operation first. This is often omitted, because "it's obvious". And most of the time it really is. Your (hypothetical) scenario is a good example of a situation where defining the costs is essential. Another, slightly more useful example is in the analysis of disk or tape storage search/sort algorithms.
