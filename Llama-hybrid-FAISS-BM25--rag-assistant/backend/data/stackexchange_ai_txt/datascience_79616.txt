Creating dummy variables

I have a Eurobarometer dataset and want to eventually create a logistic regression model and a linear probability model using a set of dates as the dependent variable. However, the dates in the dataset are displayed as long descriptors such as "Sunday 21st May 2005" in a column labelled v584 . How can I create a dummy variable to say 0 = before Sunday 29th May 2005 , 1 = after Sunday 29th May 2005 from the dates listed? And how can I include only specific date (E.g., only including the dates a week before "Sunday 29th May 2005" in 0 and only the dates a week after in 1 )?
