Yes it is a very good practice to set a seed when dealing with random algorithms. If you see that the accuracy measurement is very fluctuant, you can run it several times (like ten, if you can afford the computation time) and average the result. Keep in mind that you must compare accuracies of models based on a test set (not used in training) or in a cross-validation scheme. The MAPE error gives you an accuracy in %, so if your MAPE is 10, you have an error of 10% in average.
