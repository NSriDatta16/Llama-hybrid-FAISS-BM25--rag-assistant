OO and Writing Drupal Modules

Preface: Yes, I've read: http://drupal.org/node/547518 I am writing 'foo' module for Drupal6, where I am organizing the code in an OO fashion. There's a class called Foo that has a bunch of setters and accessors, and it is working quite well at abstracting some pretty nasty code and SQL. The question is is it common practice to expose a class for other modules, or is it better to wrap things in the more typical foo_myfnname()? For example, if I am writing the module's docs, should I tell people to do this: $foo = new Foo(); $something = $foo->get_something(); or tell them to call: foo_get_something(); which under the hood does: function foo_get_something() { $foo = new Foo(); return $foo->get_something(); }
