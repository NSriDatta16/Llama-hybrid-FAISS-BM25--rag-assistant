As normally the database stored in internal memory, can we specify the path of external storage and use it in similar way As I understand it, yes, though you will not be able to use SQLiteOpenHelper . How to determine the size of available space of database ? I used getMaximumSize() from SQLIteDatabase class but that gives me 1099511626752 Is this in bytes ? If assumed then this seems to be too large and not practical. I am using HTC G1 to test this. I expect that it would be the smaller of getMaximumSize() and the amount of free space available wherever you have the database stored. How can I determine the size of an entry in table ? I have no idea what "an entry" is, let alone how to compute its size. Can I check if any free space available before making entry in database ? Not easily, AFAICT. Android does not have the getFreeSpace() method on File .
