Why can RF learn multiplicative interaction but not additive interaction

The answer to the post Including Interaction Terms in Random Forest shows how a random forest can learn a multiplicative interactive term without it being specified as a feature. On the other hand, I read in ESL that tree-based models cannot learn linear combinations of features that are not pre-specified. Can someone explain why a RF is able to learn multiplicative interaction but not additive interaction?
