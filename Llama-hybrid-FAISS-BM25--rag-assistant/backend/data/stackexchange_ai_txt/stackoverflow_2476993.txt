As mentioned cookies are in HTTP::Cookies: You need to create a cookie jar You set the value of the cookies to put in the jar You then associate that jar with your user agent For example: my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $cookies = HTTP::Cookies->new(); $cookies->set_cookie(0,'cookiename', 'value','/','google.com',80,0,0,86400,0); $ua->cookie_jar($cookies); # Now make your request set_cookie has a rather large number of arguments: set_cookie( $version, $key, $val, $path, $domain, $port, $path_spec, $secure, $maxage, $discard, \%rest ) This is because the cookie jar is designed from the point of view of a browser (a UserAgent), rather than a single request. This means not all the arguments are so important in this case. The ones you need to get right are $key, $val, $path, $domain, $port. Regarding the: 500 Can't connect to www.google.com:80 (Bad hostname 'www.google.com') It means that LWP can't lookup the address for Google. Are you behind a web proxy? If so you will need to set your proxy in the UA too using something like: $ua->proxy(['http', 'https'], ' http://proxyhost.my.domain.com:8080/ ');
