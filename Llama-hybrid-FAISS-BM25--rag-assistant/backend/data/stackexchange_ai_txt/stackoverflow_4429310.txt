I tried your code, and it works well. It didn't saturated 100% CPU as you said, only took ~16%. I suppose that what is taking a long time to process, is the drawing of your form, or the drawing of your background windows (and not the wndproc implementation). Try limiting the amount of redraws that your form can do per second by adding a wait System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10); after this line: Marshal.StructureToPtr(rc, m.LParam, false); Sleeping 10 ms while dragging limits your form from redrawing more than 100 times per second, while leaving some CPU unused... EDIT: Forgot to mention that adding the sleep changed the ~16% to ~12% on my box.
