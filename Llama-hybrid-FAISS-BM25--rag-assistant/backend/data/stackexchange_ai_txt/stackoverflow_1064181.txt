I found a post from Robert Giesecke on the Delphi Prism newsgroups. In it, he announces a project you can add to a solution that lets you export arbitrary functions from a .Net DLL simply by adding the DllExport attribute to them. It supports marshaling just like DllImport . He demonstrates it with a Prism project, but I imagine it would work on C# classes as well. The post was made in March, so I'm not sure whether the attachment will still be available. The May release of Prism obviates such a tool since it supports unmanaged exports by itself.
