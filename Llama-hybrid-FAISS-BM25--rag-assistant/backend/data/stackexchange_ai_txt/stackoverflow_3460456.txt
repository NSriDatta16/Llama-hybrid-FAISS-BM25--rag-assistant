Do Perl subclasses inherit imported modules and pragmas?

Lets say you have a parent Perl class in one file: #!/usr/bin/perl package Foo; use strict; use warnings; use Data::Dumper; sub new{ my $class = shift; my %self = (); return bless %self, $class; } 1; and a subclass in a different file: #!/usr/bin/perl package Bar; use base "Foo"; 1; Will the subclass inherit the use statements from the parent? I know the method new will be inherited. Basically I am trying to reduce the amount of boilerplate in my code and I can't find a clear answer to this question.
