What text or tutorials would you recommend for learning machine learning for image processing?

I'm searching a good (and compact) book or online tutorial about multivariate pattern analysis in images with machine learning techniques. I took a machine learning course based on the Bishop text book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" from 2006 but I found it difficult and is currently out of date. Ideally the book would be oriented to practical applications and related to multivariate pattern analysis in images (image processing). The mathematical foundations and proofs are not important. Most important is that it present a variety of different algorithms and techniques are presented (e.g. SVM etc.) in an easy way with some explanations and perhaps implementation details. Can someone suggest a good book? What about the the book "Pattern Classification" from R. Duda, P. Hart, and D. Stork?
