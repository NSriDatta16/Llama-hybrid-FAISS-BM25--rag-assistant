Dimensionality Reduction. How to explain dynamics of feature subset based on all features data?

I have features: f1..f1000 . I want to explain dynamics of particular features subset: f1-f5 based on all features data (based on f1..f1000 ). Preferably I think of something like "partial PCA" , where some Principal Components created on all features will explain dynamics only of 5 of them (not all of them). If you know any kind of such Dimensionality Reduction technique I would be very glad for your help. Thanks!
