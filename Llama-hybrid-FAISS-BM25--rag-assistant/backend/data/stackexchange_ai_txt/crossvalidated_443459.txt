One sample t-test with Groups?

I wish to find the mean dollar value in my data while properly accounting for different groups. Say for example I have a set of data as follows: Customer | Date | Dollar Value ------------------------------------------- A | 05/03/2016 | 50 B | 05/03/2016 | 3 C | 05/03/2016 | 40 A | 06/03/2016 | 80000 B | 06/03/2016 | 50 C | 06/03/2016 | 60000 A | 07/03/2016 | 60 B | 07/03/2016 | 2 C | 07/03/2016 | 50 (Please note that this is only a small example subset of the data I'm looking at, the actual data has thousands of rows of data). From this data, the 'normal' days are 05/03/2016 and 07/03/2016 while the abnormal day is 06/03/2016 since the dollar value for each customer is very high relative to what they normally purchase. In addition, Customer B always purchases a smaller amount relative to Customers A and C . Now, what I would like to do is find the average dollar value (i.e. obtain a single value by using the Dollar Value column) and determine its significance while properly accounting for the customer and date (since specific dates and specific customers would greatly skew the mean as shown above), however, I'm not sure what sort of t-test I need to conduct in order to obtain this value. I was thinking of using something like clustering standard errors based on Customer and Date but I'm not sure if that's appropriate or how to even set this problem out, so any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
