Here is an example of where three positive and one negative loading on the error correction term makes intuitive sense. Consider a four-variable cointegrated system $(x_t, y_t, z_t, w_t)$ with $(x_t, y_t, z_t)$ being the three underlying stochastic trends and $w_t := x_t + y_t + z_t + \varepsilon_t$ where $\varepsilon_t$ is a stationary process. Define the error correction term as $ect_t := w_t - x_t - y_t - z_t (=\varepsilon_t)$. This is obviously stationary as $\varepsilon_t$ is stationary. Then it is natural to expect that the error correction term will have positive loadings in the equations for $\Delta x_t, \Delta y_t, \Delta z_t$ and a negative one in the equation for $\Delta w_t$, because: If $x_t$ deviates from the long run equilibrium by getting "too high", $ect_t$ will become negative , and then the positive loading on $ect_t$ will drag $x_{t+1}$ down, so back to equilibrium. The same holds for $y_t$ and $z_t$. If $w_t$ deviates from the long run equilibrium by getting "too high", $ect_t$ will become positive , and then the negative loading on $ect_t$ will drag $w_{t+1}$ down, so back to equilibrium. And the reverse for the cases of variables getting "too low".
