Your problem is that by using GUID fragments, you have to check for collisions against a larger and larger table. I assume you don't want to create sequential keys because it's vulnerable to URL spelunking, but then you should start with something sequential and then obfuscate it. Edit Going with a commenter's suggestion, I would: 1. take a sequential key 2. shift left 8 3. add a random value between 0 and 255 4. encode base-62 (0-9,A-Z,a-z) You will have no collisions, and the random bits will mean a person randomly trying URLs will only get one hit out of every 255 attempts.
