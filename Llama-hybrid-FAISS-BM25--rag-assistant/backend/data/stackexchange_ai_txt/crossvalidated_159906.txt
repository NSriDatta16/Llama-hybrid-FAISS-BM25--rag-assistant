A random variable may have infinite (or no) moments, for example, the Cauchy distribution has no mean and infinite variance - Why does the Cauchy distribution have no mean? . Then, let us define a time series (stochastic process) $X$ where $X_k$ follows the Cauchy distribution with scale $1$ for all $k$ and the $X_k$s are mutually independent. This process is strictly stationary (any joint distribution is just a joint distribution of independent Cauchy random variables and thus does not depend on shifting the time index). On the other hand, this process does not satisfy the conditions weakly stationarity - the mean and autocovariance do not stay constant since they do not exist.
