How to train a custom sentence completion model using tensorflow?

What I have A small corpus of English sentences (about 60,000). The Task Sentence completion model. Basically, something like Input: "Paris is the" Output: "Paris is the capital of France and a popular tourist destination." Requirement Based on open source, obviously, without calling any ChatGPT API or such. Must use generative AI capability There must be a custom training/fine-tuning component, based on my corpus, i.e. not pre-built model for direct inference. Best if based on tensorflow, otherwise, maybe pytorch or huggingface. My question I know it is a big task, but wondering is there any accessible tutorial, documentations on this? I can see many tutorials on neural machine translations, CLIP etc. but not on sentence completion.
