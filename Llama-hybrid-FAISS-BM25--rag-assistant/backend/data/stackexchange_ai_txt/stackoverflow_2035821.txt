SQL Server query freezes when I use "where"

I'm using SQL Server 2005 Express, and I'm running into a strange issue. I have a table called "DailyPrice" that has about 24 million records (I was able to make this table thanks to all your help in this thread: SQL Server 2005 slows down as I keep adding rows ) Now, I'm running a different fancy function in VB.NET where I need to get a list of entries based on a ticker symbol (just 1), and I need them organized from oldest to newest. This query works: SELECT Ticker, DateStamp, ClosePrice FROM DailyPrice WHERE (Ticker = 'DD') This one is either agonizing slow, or I get a timeout error: SELECT Ticker, DateStamp, ClosePrice FROM DailyPrice WHERE (Ticker = 'DD') ORDER BY DateStamp The fields Ticker and DateStamp are my primary index, in case that matters. Why does this slow down when i use ORDER BY? A couple hours ago the problem query ran speedily and fine, but only once - and now I'm plagued by timeouts.
