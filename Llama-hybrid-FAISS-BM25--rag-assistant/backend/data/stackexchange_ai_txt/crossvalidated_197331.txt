A related term to this question is "Parallel Analysis". In simple terms, the monte carlo simulation would generate 1000 (or such) 10304x236 matrices of random normally distributed data (this assumes, of course, that the data you analyzing are normally distributed; if your data were distributed differently, you'd use a different random distribution). You would then extract the eigenvalues for each data set you created, and average each eigenvalue across all 1000 (or such) replications while also creating confidence intervals. You then compare the eigenvalues from your data set to the average eigenvalues from your simulation. Wherever the eigenvalues from your dataset exceed the 99th confidence interval of the eigenvalues from the monte carlo simulation, that's how many factors the analysis would suggest to retain. For example, if the 25th eigenvalue from your data is 2.10 and the 26th is 1.97, and the 99th confidence interval of the 25th eigenvalues from the 1000 (or such) random data sets is 2.04 and the 26th is 2.01, this would suggest that you retain 25 components. There are functions built to do this for you. One link for Matlab is this: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44996-parallel-analysis--pa--to-for-determining-the-number-of-components-to-retain-from-pca/content/pa_test.m I found that one by googling "Parallel Analysis in Matlab".
