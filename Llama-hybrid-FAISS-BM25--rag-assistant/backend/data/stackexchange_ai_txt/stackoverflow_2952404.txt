I feel your pain. I once worked in a project where a checkout was 20GB. Working on the trunk and three branches at the same time would fill my HD. I hated it. You could split that thing into two folders in your repository, one ("main") containing all of the stuff which is interesting for everyone, the other ("big") containing only the 8GB of stuff most people don't care about. The "big" folder references "main" using externals. / -/main --file.aspx --anotherFile.aspx --/coolThings ----coolThing.aspx ----... -/big --/bigFolder ----someHugeMovie.mov ----someHugeSound.mp3 --/anotherBigFolder -/everything Most people would just checkout "main". Some would checkout "big" and, through externals, would get "main", too. Note that using externals requires attention when tagging, since you want to peg tagged versions' externals to a specific revision.
