See Download and Upload images from SQL Server via ASP.Net MVC for an example of how to stream a large file into a BLOB column, look at the Streaming Upload of BLOB data section. You can download the code from codeproject . The gist of it is that you need to upload in chunks and use UPDATE set column.WRITE syntax because the ADO.Net client has no proper streaming semantics. An alternative is to use FILESTREAM because the SqlFileStream type does support streaming, see FILESTREAM MVC: Download and Upload images from SQL Server for a full sample. But FILESTREAM storage comes with its quirks and is not a trivial decision (specially if your hosting doesn't offer it...).
