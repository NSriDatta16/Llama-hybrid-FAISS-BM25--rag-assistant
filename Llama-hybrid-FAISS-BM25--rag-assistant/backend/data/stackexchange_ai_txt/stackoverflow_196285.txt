"developers who think it's a waste of their time, or that they simply don't like doing it" Then reward them for it. What social engineering is necessary to get them to create test cases? Can QA look over the code and test cases and pronounce "Not Enough Coverage -- Need More Cases". If so, then the programmer that has "enough" coverage right away will be the Big Kahuna. So, my question is: Once the task is done, who should define the goal of "enough" test cases for this task? Once you know "enough", you can make the programmers responsible for filling in "enough" and QA responsible for assuring that "enough" testing is done. Too hard to define "enough"? Interesting. Probably this is the root cause of the conflict with the programmers in the first place. They might feel it's a waste of their time because they already did "enough" and now someone is saying it isn't "enough".
