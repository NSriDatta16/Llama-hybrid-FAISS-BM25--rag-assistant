Statistic for significance test comparing transition matrix to null

I have several pitch sequences (mini songs), that look something like this when plotted as a pitch profile (piano roll): I've coded each sequence in terms of its constituent interval sizes, and pooled all values together. Below is the transition matrix for interval bigrams, to show whether intervals of a given size are more likely followed by intervals of any other size: This comes from interval sizes organised into pairs, with each considered twice, such that element2 of one pair becomes element1 of the next: I'd like to do a significance test upon this transition matrix, against some null distribution with an equal number of pairs. I think this is equivalent to a permutation test but I'm not sure. Assume for a second that an appropriate null is generated by sampling each of the intervals from a random distribution with mean 0 and SD 5 semitones, which produces something likes this: My question is: which statistic is appropriate to perform the significance test on? What I want to know is whether specific patterns emerge out of the distribution, over what might be expected from intervals that follow one another randomly. A few rather vague hypotheses are available, such as: H_A: "after a large interval1 (>4 semitones), interval2 is likely to be smaller and in the opposite direction". H_B: "An interval2 is likely to be close in size to interval1" This suggests particular null shapes to use, e.g. weighted towards one quadrant (H_A), or radially around the origin of the axes (H_B). However, I wonder if I can test something more simple/general, like "in the empirical distribution, certain cells (interval bigrams) are more likely than others, leading to a few focal cells or sets of cells, as compared to the null distribution where bigrams solely converge onto the (0,0) point". I know multivariate statistical tests exist , but I'm not sure if that gets at my aim above.
