mysterious git behaviour

I have since fixed this problem. But I still don't know why what I did worked. We have an svn repository for our code at work. I have a local git-svn repository because I It began normally, and then suddenly decided it couldn't find the trunk. Unfortunately, I lost the exact error message, but it was yelling about not being about to find /refs/remotes/trunk ...and I was very scared. Luckily, though, I had no uncommitted code. Nothing to lose. Nevertheless, every time I tried to 'git svn rebase' after that, it would hang forEVER, and then I would get the following error: Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history I researched it for a whole day. I tried changing the svn-remote url from https://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx/xxx to https://xxx.xxx.xxx/xxx/xxx / as ridiculous as that seems. I then did a 'git svn fetch' ... and it re-fetched the whole trunk (all 1682 commits). But the rebase still wouldn't work. So I gave up for the day, and decided that the next day I would just create a new repository and start over (which would take a whole day). This morning, I went to ask the question on here before I went unabashedly deleting my repository. I came across this: git-svn rebase gone horribly wrong which wasn't exactly my problem, but I decided to try 'git reset --hard trunk' because that's what I wanted. And it worked. Everything is fine now. However. Why did it do that in the first place? I didn't change anything as far as I know, as I was not at work over the weekend. What kind of things would have caused that error? I assume I absent-mindedly did something awful, but I need to know what so I don't do it again. :) Thanks in advance.
