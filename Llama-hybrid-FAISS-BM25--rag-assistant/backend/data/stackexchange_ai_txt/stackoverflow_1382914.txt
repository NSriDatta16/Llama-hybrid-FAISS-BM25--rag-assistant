Ravadre has pointed to search tree based data structures. The big alternative is using a hash table . Its main disadvantage over trees is that the data inside it is not ordered – the ordering of elements is somewhat arbitrary. If you need to access the elements in sorted order, using hash tables is not advisable. However, if you do not need sorted items, go with a hash table: access time is O(1) on average and although this depends on a lot of factors, it is often still far superior to access time in tree-based structures. By the way, most programming languages already offer either or both data structures so you don’t need to implement them for yourself.
