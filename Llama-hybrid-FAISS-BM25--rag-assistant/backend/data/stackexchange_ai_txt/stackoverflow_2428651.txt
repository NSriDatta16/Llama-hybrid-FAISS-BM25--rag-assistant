Filter, sort and paginate in Codeigniter

Ive recently started using CodeIgniter as I was searching for a very lightweight framework and it seemed to come up as a top choice. I am new to the whole MVC thing, enjoying it but am stuck with something which seems very simple. I am coding a CMS and need a way to filter, sort and paginate the results. I am used to doing it with querystrings, so I would have something along the lines of: articles.php?order=title&sort=desc&filter=articletitle&page=5 I have no idea how I would go about doing this in CI so I just turned on the EnableQueryStrings in the config and it works fine, but i am getting the feeling its probably not the most elegant solution. I suppose I could have index.php/articles/index/order/title/sort/desc/filter/articletitle/page/5 but to me this seems very inflexible, what if for example i dont need to sort, how would i make sure i am looking at the correct uri segment? any ideas?
