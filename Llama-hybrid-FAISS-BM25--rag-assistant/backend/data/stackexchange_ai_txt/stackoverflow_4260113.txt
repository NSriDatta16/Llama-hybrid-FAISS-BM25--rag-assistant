Difference between JSPX and JSFF file-types inside ADF framework?

What is the difference between JSPF and JSFF file-types in ADF ? I have not been able to find sufficient information on JSFF files online. JSPX and JSFF refer to JSP Fragment and JSF Fragment respectively. JSFF is typically used in ADF projects.
