is there a way to train the models in batches? i m not talking about deep learning

I have 800,000 records. The training with all the records at once is not possible. Is there a way i can train a model on 50k records then continue training on next 50k records and so on... basically i dont want to start training all over again for the next batch, i want to continue training where i left off in the previous 50k batch I am not using deep learning. I just want to train a simple linear regression model or may be a tree based model on a large dataset
