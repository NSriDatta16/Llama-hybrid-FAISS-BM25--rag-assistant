Why do you care about statistical significance, if your goal appears to be a predictive model? The two things typically have very little to do with each other. You should consider to simply test the different versions on your training data using cross-validation and pick the summarization that leads to the best (or perhaps fewer categories than in the best, in order to not overfit too much) average performance across cross-validation folds?
