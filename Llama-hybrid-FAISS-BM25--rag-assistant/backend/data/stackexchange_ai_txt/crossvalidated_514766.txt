If you are only looking at one question at a time, and only looking at the correct/incorrect distinction, then you have a $2 \times 2$ contingency table and can use a chi-squared test. But some other analysis might be more informative: Looking at all the questions at once, I would start out with visualization. And you could get a test of the joint null hypothesis using logistic regression. Maybe look if there is a change in the choice of distractor options?
