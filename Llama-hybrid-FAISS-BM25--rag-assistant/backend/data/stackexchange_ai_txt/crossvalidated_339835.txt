The DF tests have a SEVERE drawback: they generally assume you have already removed other things that are making the data non-stationary. You may have to include variance stabilizing weights as suggested here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . This diagnostic check was implemented into AUTOBOX some 10 years ago. Other developers have seemingly ignored this very important aspect of time series modelling. Alternatively it may be necessary to simply transform the data via Box-Cox as I answered here http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18844/when-and-why-to-take-the-log-of-a-distribution-of-numbers . Often times (not your case) simple Intervention Detection remedies the apparent need for a Box-Cpx transformation as was presented here http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/u-didnt-need-logs Please post your actual data and I will take this a step further. EDITED After receipt of data . Time series data is nearly never trivial or simple thus simple brute-force methods rarely work. The data presented here aptly called THEGREAT suggests that some complexity is present. Note that ARIMA modelling even with empirically identified deterministic structure is non-causal . The identified structure can be a hint as to the nature of omitted causals. I introduced the data to an automatic package that I have helped to develop (AUTOBOX) and it delivered the following useful equation . a few anomalies , 3 seasonal pulses , an AR(3) structure based upon a significant deterministic change in error variance at or around period 43 of 67. The Actual, Fit and Forecast is here with cleansed data and actual presented here. In standard fashion the plot of the residuals is here with ACF here . Both suggesting sufficiency . The plot of the forecasts is here Hope this helps ....
