It depends on what you mean by "mobile" - and how you wish to simulate it. It sounds like you're trying for a purely agent based approach. I assume by "B" you're actually referring to a parameter that is usually "Beta". If that's the case, know that Beta isn't actually a single probability. It is usually formulated as follows: beta = -k log(1-c) , where k is the average number of contacts per unit time, and c is the probability of successful transmission (Keeling and Rohani, 2008). Most models that don't assume homogeneous mixing - like the ones you are currently talking about - don't bother with beta, and just directly estimate k and c, and compute whether or not an individual has been infected from that (i.e. Did node come in contact with an infected node? If yes, was transmission successful? If yes, node is infected). Note that you can tinker with these numbers until you get an estimated beta that is equal to the beta of your compartmental model, but because of stochasticity, it will never be quite the same.
