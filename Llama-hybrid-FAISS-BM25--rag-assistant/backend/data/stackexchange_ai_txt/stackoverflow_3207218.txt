I can't say much about coupling Java and C++, but I suggest you have a look at Qt . It's a C++ library for a lot of things, like file and network access, but it's most famous for GUI development. It also has a nice IDE were you can build your GUI with drag-and-drop. I would also say that Qt is as OS-agnostic as it gets for GUI libraries.
