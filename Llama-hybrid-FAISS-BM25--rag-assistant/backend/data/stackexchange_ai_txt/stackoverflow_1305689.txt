How to use hudson to track a single metric

We use the Hudson continuous integration engine to build and test our Python software Projects. This involves a Makefile which generates various output files like pylint reports and then various hudson plugins analyze and graph the output. Im now looking for a way to track a single value with hudson without any specialized plugins. Be it coverage percentage or pylint sore or something els which can be written by the Makefile in a file. Any suggestion on how to do that?
