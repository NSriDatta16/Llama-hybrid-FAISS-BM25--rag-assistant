Regression to remove consecutive effects

Suppose I want to know how my observable X depends on Y and on Z. But Y itself depends on Z (e.g. they are correlated). I want to know the effect of Y on X after removing the effect of Z on both X and Y. What is the right regression procedure for that? - Should I regress Z on X, take the residuals, and regress those on Y? Like, X = a * Z + e1 e1 = b * Y + e2 I know I could do PCA, but I want the first order effect to be coming from Z exactly, the second order effect e2 to be orthogonal to e1.
