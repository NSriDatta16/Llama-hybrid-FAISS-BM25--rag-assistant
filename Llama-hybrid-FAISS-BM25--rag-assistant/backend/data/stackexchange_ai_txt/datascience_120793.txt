Use a "ChatGPT like" engine really locally without exposing sensitive data

I was recently playing around with llama_index and llama Hub and found it very easy to be used on my own data set. While this is nice, I cannot expose sensitive data of my organization to external resources (such as OpenAI). I read there's a new local port called GPT4All, but wasn't able to find how (if any) to introduce a new data into its model. Can someone please recommend of a suitable alternative that can be used really locally?
