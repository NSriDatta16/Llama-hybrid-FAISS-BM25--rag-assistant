The answer is the same as the answer to "Why do I need to specify an int when I can store all numbers as strings?" - because it aids: efficiency of speed. efficiency of storage. the author/architect's intention. cuts down on data error, since only a certain kind of data will fit. But it won't cause any obvious "problems" immediately because nvarchar(10) is a subset of nvarchar(max).
