Geo input - how to input, store and display locations

I would like to store a user enter location and could do with some pointers on how to go about it. Input - I wish to allow the user to enter a location using either a map (eg Google maps) or text input. Storage - I believe it would make sense to store the location as the longitude and latitude. Manipulation and Display - I'd like to display a name for a given longitude and latitude. I'd also like to search for all inputs from an arbitrary region eg London. What libraries or packages (preferably Java, preferably free) can be used to help with this process?
