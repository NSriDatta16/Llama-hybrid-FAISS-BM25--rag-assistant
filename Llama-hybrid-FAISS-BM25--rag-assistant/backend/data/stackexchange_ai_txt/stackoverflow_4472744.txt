How to fix "Compile Error: Object Required" error?

This is my very first time with VBA. For the following code fragment: Dim i As Integer Set i = 0 For Each v In dictDT.Keys Cells(10, 5 + i) = dictDT.Item(v) i = i + 1 Next I keep getting this error: Compile Error: Object Required What am I doing wrong?
