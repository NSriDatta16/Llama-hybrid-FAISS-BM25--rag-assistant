Convert XML attributes to a Dictionary in Linq to XML

I've got a program that needs to convert two attributes of a particular tag to the key and value of an Dictionary . The XML looks like this: (fragment) and so far my LINQ looks something like this: XNamespace ns = "http://the_namespace"; var startingpoints = from sp in xml.Elements(ns+"startingPoint") from el in sp.Attributes() select el.Value; Which gets me a nice IEnumerable full of things like "1,1" and "1", but there should be a way to adapt something like this answer to do attributes instead of elements. Little help please? Thank you!
