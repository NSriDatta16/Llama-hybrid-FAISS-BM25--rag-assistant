I'm not sure how you've had different recommendations. The answer is simple: you'll need to buy an SSL certificate for each of your domains that you want secured. Sharing a Magento installation, talking about the DNS, etc, is not relevant. Buy the SSL certificates, get your webhost (it looks like you're using SimpleHelix for hosting all of the websites) to install them all for you, then change the secure URL in the Magento admin for each of your stores (use the dropdown in the configuration area to change the configuration scope from Global to each store in turn) to the appropriate URL, presumably https://www.website{1,2,3}.com from http://www.website{1,2,3}.com . Easy :)
