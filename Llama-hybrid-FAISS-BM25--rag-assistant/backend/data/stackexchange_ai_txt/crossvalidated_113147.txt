Based on your description you could use a plethora of methods, any classification methods would do (Random Forest, PLS-DA, LDA, QDA, SVM), as long as your model is validated. You might also want to look in ANOVA like methods (or rather MANOVA). if the difference between patients and controls is really large exploratory methods like PCa would probably also show you something useful
