Yes, you can. Make a SmartPart that hosts the WebBrowser control, add some buttons for forward and backward navigation, and a url textbox; then point the WebBrowser control at your web application's URL. It is sensible. We used CAB/SCSF to create an application we called "The Integrated Desktop". This application serves as the platform for all internal apps for the company; everything is integrated into this one desktop application. We added a foundational module, basically a beefy version of what I described in the above paragraph, to facilitate web browsing since a few pre-existing apps were web-based and our users wanted access to those at the same place they were doing all their other work. One cool thing was the use of the WebBrowser's ObjectForScripting property that allowed for somewhat seamless integration between the desktop app and the web app being hosted inside.
