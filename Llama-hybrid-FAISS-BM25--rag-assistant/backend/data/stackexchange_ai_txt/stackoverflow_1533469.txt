There's a lot of good advice here, i recommend going through some best practices: http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/ http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2009/01/ruby-best-practices-mini-interview-2.html (and read Greg Brown's book, it's superb) You talk about large scripts. A lot of my workflow is working out logic in irb or the python shell, then capturing them into a cascade of small, single-task focused methods, with appropriate tests (not 100% coverage, more focus on edge and corner cases). http://binstock.blogspot.com/2008/04/perfecting-oos-small-classes-and-short.html
