Can you try adding a delay:500 to the sortable parameters list, perhaps that delay might make the double click bubble properly ? Similarly, you can use distance:30 which will tell sortable not to start working until the drag has gone on for 30 pixels or more. this can be used to make sure that 'click' events work.
