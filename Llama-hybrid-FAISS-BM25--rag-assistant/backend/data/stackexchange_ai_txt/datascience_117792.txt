How is weight matrix calculated in a neural network?

Context: I am a pure mathematician trying to understand machine learning. I am studying it from various sources, now focusing on NLP and word embeddings. My question : What is the weight matrix for a neural network? How is it calculated, in layman terms? (Or even in more complicated terms, I will appreciate any good resources for beginners.) Motivation : I was reading aneesh joshiÂ´s answer to this question and I dont understand it. I think my problem is I dont understand sufficiently, how a neural network is trained. I am new on DataScience stackexchange, so feel free to give me tips to improve my question. (I am usually posting on Math.Stackexchange). Thank you very much!
