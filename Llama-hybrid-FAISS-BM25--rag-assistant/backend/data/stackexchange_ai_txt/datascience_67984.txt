Pretrained Models for Keyword-Based Text Generation

I'm looking for an implementation that allows me to generate text based on a pre-trained model (e.g. GPT-2). An example would be gpt-2-keyword-generation ( click here for demo ). As the author notes, there is [...] no explicit mathematical/theoetical basis behind the keywords aside from the typical debiasing of the text [...] Hence my question: Are there more sophisticated ways of keyword-based text generation or at least any other alternatives ? Thank you
