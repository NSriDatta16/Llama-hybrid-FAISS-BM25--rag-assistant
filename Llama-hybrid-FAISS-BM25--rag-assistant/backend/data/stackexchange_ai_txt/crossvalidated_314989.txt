The answers to this kind of question are likely to be primarily opinion-based. My suggestion would be keep reading this book and skip the part you familiar with. For example, for linear method, you may know a lot and this book is too easy. On the other hand, tree based model, support vector machine, and unsupervised method (PCA) you may not know too much. This book is still good for you to learn those topics. In addition, the PRML book may be another good resource for you.
