In Bayesian statistics, what do mu, eta, and tau tend to represent?

In the eight schools example from Gelman, he sets his parameters as mu, eta, and tau. // saved as 8schools.stan data { int J; // number of schools real y[J]; // estimated treatment effects real sigma[J]; // s.e. of effect estimates } parameters { real mu; real tau; real eta[J]; } transformed parameters { real theta[J]; for (j in 1:J) theta[j] = mu + tau * eta[j]; } model { target += normal_lpdf(eta | 0, 1); target += normal_lpdf(y | theta, sigma); } I see these parameter names often used in Bayesian statistics. Can someone provide a general intuition for what they'll tend to mean? Also why is mu modeled as unique to every school but the other two parameters are not?
