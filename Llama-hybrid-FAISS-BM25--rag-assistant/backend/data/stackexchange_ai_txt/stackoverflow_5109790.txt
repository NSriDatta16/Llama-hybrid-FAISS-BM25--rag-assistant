Desktop Application for Document Generator from Word Template (keeping photos, writing information to documents)

I want to develop a Java desktop application . This appliation will generate word documents about patients. There will be some fixed and variable fields, columns at some templates. System will be like that: I will keep the patients information(these are variables) There will be some messages, question at different templates(fixed variables) Patients will answer the questions and they will be stored too. After patients answer questions, give their information, appliation will generate form/s (this forms has fixed alignments, borders etc.) Patients will give their photos too and they will be stored at database. System users will be able to print it and will have an ability to search documents, user, etc.. I will ask you how to develop that application, I mean how to keep templates , write the information to the form at correct places, organise a better database , organise photos etc. I am open for other advises too about developing program(database side, Java desktop application side, better gui advices etc.)
