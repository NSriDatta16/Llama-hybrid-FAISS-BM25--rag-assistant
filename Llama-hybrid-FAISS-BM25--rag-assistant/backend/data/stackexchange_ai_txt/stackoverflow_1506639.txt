Nall's answer is good, but you should know that in Snow Leopard XCode you can set the Organization name (the name used by the templates) in the General tab of project settings. If you are working on only your own stuff, you should set it once via the other means. If you are working for clients you should use the per-project setting so a file always gets the right name as you switch between projects.
