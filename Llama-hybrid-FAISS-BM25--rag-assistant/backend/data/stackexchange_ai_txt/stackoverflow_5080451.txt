How should I use EditorFor() in MVC for a currency/money type?

In my view I have the following call. x.Cost) %> I have a ViewModel with the following code to define Cost. public decimal Cost { get; set; } However this displays a decimal value with four digits after the decimal (e.g. 0.0000). I am aware of Decimal.toString("G") ( MSDN ) which appears to solve this issue, but I'm uncertain of where to apply it. One solution seems to be create a partial view "Currency.aspx". " %> And a [UIHint("Currency")] in my ViewModel. This seems inelegant. I assume that this problem has been solved tidily somewhere in the MVC framework or C# but I am unaware of cleaner solutions. What is the appropriate way to handle editing currency values in MVC?
