Question about eligibility trace

Question 1: for eligibility formula: $G_t^\lambda = (1-\lambda)\sum^{T-t-1}_{n=1}\lambda^{n-1}G^{(n)}_t+\lambda^{T-t-1}G_t$ I wonder why it is identical to TD(0) when $\lambda=0$, isn't the outcome 0? Question 2: It is said that with $\lambda \in(0,1)$,agent would learn better than either extremely way(0 or 1). But why? Is it theoretically proved?
