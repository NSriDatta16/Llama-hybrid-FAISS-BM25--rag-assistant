As @jld has says, independence is important to the maths. It's not always an assumption , however. In some EM-algorithm settings the latent variables are real variables that we just didn't measure, but in other settings they are convenient fictions that let us build up models. For example, the latent variables when phasing genotype data into haplotype data in genomics are real physical things that we would be able to observe with more expensive technology, but the latent variables in a typical variational autoencoder are just modelling fictions. When the latent variables are real things, independence might be true or false. When independence is a modelling choice it's not something that can be true or false, only effective or ineffective.
