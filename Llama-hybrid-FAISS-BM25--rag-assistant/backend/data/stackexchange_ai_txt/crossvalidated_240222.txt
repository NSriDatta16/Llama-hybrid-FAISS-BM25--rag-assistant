Multivariable logistic regression analysis and EPV (events per variable) in clinical journals?

Need guidance, I am not new to reading and appraising articles in clinical journals but I do feel am very new to understanding regression (if at all) after sifting through discussions here! EPV is very important in modeling but many clinical papers published, perform (mostly) logistic regression analyses using multiple predictor variables with EPV Edit: (Taking Scortchi's advice to elaborate) A good EPV is important as shown in the article quoted below (Villinghof & McCullough) and this (I am sure I miss many others): Modern modeling techniques are data hungry: a simulation study for predicting dichotomous endpoints, by: Tjeerd van der Ploeg, Peter C. Austin, Ewout W. Steyerberg BMC medical research methodology, Vol. 14, No. 1. (22 December 2014), 137, doi:10.1186/1471-2288-14-137.
