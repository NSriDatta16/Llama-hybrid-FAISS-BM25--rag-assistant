Machine Learning for hedging/ portfolio optimization?

With increasingly sophisticated methods that work on large scale datasets, financial applications are obvious. I am aware of machine learning being employed on financial services to detect fraud and flag fraudulent activities but I have a lesser understanding of how it helps to predict the price of the stock the next day and how many stocks of a particular company to buy. Do the hedge funds still employ portfolio optimization techniques that are right out of the mathematical finance literature or have they started to use machine learning to hedge their bets? More importantly, what are the features that are used by these hedge funds and what is a representative problem set up?
