Does incorporation of prior expert opinions with Bayesian analysis actually work in practise or is it too much to ask of non-statisticians?

Suppose we have a sample from some population of people and we want to perform Bayesian regression of height vs weight using this sample. Suppose the true relationship between height $y$ and weight $x$ is: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^2 = 3 + 2x^2. $$ The plot of the sample data is: To implement a Bayesian linear regression model on this data I assume Gaussian priors $\beta_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\sigma_0)$ and $\beta_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ and that the error is normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance. Now it remains to choose the parameters of the priors. Suppose I know a doctor who is an expert on the height/weight relationship so I visit him to obtain his expert knowledge. Here is where I am having issues: The parameter $\mu_1$ represents the expected value of a variable that indicates how much a person's height increases as their weight squared goes up by one unit. Is a doctor really going to be able to give a good answer to this equation? We are dealing with a medical professional here, not a statistician/mathematician. I am taking a simplified example for the sake of convenience here, in practise we could have a multiple regression model with many predictors and be asking a field expert for their opinion on the mean of the several coefficients. The variable $\sigma_1$ is worse again. Are we really expected to believe that a medical professional will not just be able to provide a good guess for $\mu_1$ but that they can also give a good guess for the standard deviation of how much a person's height increases as their weight squared goes up by one unit? It seems way too complicated to ask this of statistician/mathematician? We also require the doctor to give an estimate for the covariance of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ . A doctor will know this? Suppose we extend our model to multiple regression of height $y$ vs weight $x$ and age $w$ (and assume a linear relationship for age): $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^2 + \beta_2 w. $$ To incorporate the expert opinion of the doctor we now require him to to give us entries for the covariance matrix of $\beta_0,\beta_1$ , and $\beta_2$ . This seems to be a completely ridiculous proposition. So how does it work in practise when a Bayesian statistican wants to generate priors for the regression coefficients based the opinion of some expert in a particular field? It seems to me that an expert could only be realistically be expected to give a decent estimate of $\mu_0$ and $\sigma_0$ . Asking for the other information seems like a lost cause. Yet incorporating expert information is often highlighted as one of the advantages of Bayesian over Frequentist statistics. Is it truly only a theoretical advantage, or can we actually make use of it in the real world? If the difficulty is because I have somehow overcomplicated matters, can you explain to me what questions I should ask the doctor to get good parameters for the priors in the model for height vs weight? How exactly should I phrase the questions?
