In many ways, "independent variable" is an unfortunate choice. The variables need not be independent of each other, and of course need not be independent of the dependent variable $Y$. In teaching and in my book Regression Modeling Strategies I use the word predictor . In some situations that word is not strong enough, but it works well on the average. A full description of the role of the $X$ (right hand side) variables in a statistical model might be too long to use each time: the set of variables or measurements upon which the distribution of $Y$ is conditioned. This is another way of saying the set of variables whose distributions we are currently not interested in, but whose values we treat as constants.
