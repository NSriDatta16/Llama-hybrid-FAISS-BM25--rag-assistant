How to provide the fold change value of a group of biological replicates?

I want to visualize relative gene expression with barplot + error bars after qPCR analysis. I was asked to use the log2FoldChange values for the barplots, where each bar should summarize 3 values (the biological replicates). I calculate the delta delta CT (ddCT) as dCT(treated) - dCT(control). The fold change is calculated as 2^ddCT. From which value can I calculate the mean for the representative value of all three replicates (and should I take arithmetic or geometric mean)? Should I take the average of the ddCTs first and then exponentiate it for Fold change? Or can I take the average of the 3 fold changes? condition ddCT Fold change untreated 0 1 treatment1 -0.4997 0.7072 treatment2 -3.8894 0.0674 untreated 0 1 treatment1 1.00437 2.0060 treatment2 -1.485 0.3570 untreated 0 1 treatment1 -2.0324 0.2444 treatment2 -0.4631 0.7253
