No, you can't do this ( see the 2nd paragraph of the Activity 'Class Overview' ). However... If you want to do this to prevent people launching sub-activities directly, you can put logic in to detect the launching activity (via Activity.getCallingActivity / Activity.getCallingPackage ) - you'll need to use StartActivityForResult to do this You might be able to achieve what you want through a ClassLoader - more details on what you're doing (and why) would be useful. If you're trying to launch an activity defined in a different package, then it only needs to be declared in the other package's manifest - you can then specify it with Intent.setClassName Hope this helps, Phil Lello
