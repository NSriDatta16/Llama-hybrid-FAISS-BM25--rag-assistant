eclipse ganymede erroneous red underlining

i'm finding suddenly that eclipse, in a java project, is underlining references to uses of other class uses ive created in the same package. for another reason i reinstalled it today and the red underlinings went away. about an hour later, they popped up again. all classes have the package membership declaration. anyone seen this before?
