Do you have any s with both class="fancybox" and rel="fancyvideo" ? If you do then you'll be binding Fancybox to those elements twice and Fancybox might not like that. Try taking out this one: $("a.fancybox").fancybox({ 'hideOnContentClick': true }); And see what happens with just the second one in place. UPDATE : Strange. The demo (http://chadly.net/demos/video-lightbox.html) is producing different HTML than your page, the demo builds an but yours builds a thing. You're saying: type: 'swf' in your Fancybox binding, that's where the ... stuff comes from. However, the href points at a plain old YouTube video viewing HTML page and that href ends up as the src attribute for the . The URL for embedding a YouTube video isn't the same as the video's HTML page and that's probably the source of your problem. Try replacing the href that looks like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmVvgSfdmJQ with one like this: http://www.youtube.com/embed/QmVvgSfdmJQ The first is the plain HTML page for YouTube, the second is the embeddable SWF. UPDATE 2 : The example you're working from is for Fancybox 1.0.0 but you're using 1.3.4, 1.0.0 has some special checks for YouTube that aren't present in later versions: //... } else if (url.match(/youtube\.com\/watch/i)) { //... That's from 1.0.0 and the code after that else if rewrites the HTML page URL (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmVvgSfdmJQ ) to the older embeddable SWF URL (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/v/QmVvgSfdmJQ ). This version problem also explains why the demo was producing different HTML than your's. So, you have some version problems on top of everything else.
