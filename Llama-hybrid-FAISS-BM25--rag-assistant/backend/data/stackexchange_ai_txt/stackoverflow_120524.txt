Have you seen constant_cache ? It's sort of the combination of the best of 1 and 2 - lookup data is stored in the DB, but it's exposed as class constants on the lookup model and only loaded at application start, so you don't suffer the join penalties constantly. The following example comes from the README: migration: create_table :account_statuses do |t| t.string :name, :description end AccountStatus.create!(:name => 'Active', :description => 'Active user account') AccountStatus.create!(:name => 'Pending', :description => 'Pending user account') AccountStatus.create!(:name => 'Disabled', :description => 'Disabled user account') model: class AccountStatus using it: Account.new(:username => 'preagan', :status => AccountStatus::PENDING)
