Multivariate mcmcGLMM - pMCMC for interaction

I want to test my linear mixed effect model for interactions using MCMCglmm: MCMCglmm(cbind(dv1, dv2, dv3, dv4) ~ time*treat*gen*age, + family=c("poisson","gaussian","poisson","gaussian"), + random=~individual, data=mydata) Giving the following error: Error in MCMCglmm(cbind(dv1, dv2, dv3, dv4) ~ time * treat * : R-structure miss-specified: each residual must be unique to a data point Using just one dependent variable, the MCMCglmm works just fine. dv1 is count data, dv2 is continous numeric, dv3 is count data, dv4 is continous numeric, individual is a group of 20 individuals with repeated measures time is a fixed effect with 7 timepoints per individual gen is a factor of 2 treat is a factor of 2 age is a factor of 2 (old and young) Anybody got an idea?
