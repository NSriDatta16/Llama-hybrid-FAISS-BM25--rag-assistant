XtraGrid - Databinding two-dimensional data?

I have a two-dimensional data that needs to be displayed on a grid. Each cell contains a double value identified by row and column. I can use DataTable to display the data, but I need more flexibility (an editable grid that allows user to insert/delete row or column, as well as fire cell-level value change event). I've been trying to find a way to databind two-dimensional data to gridview. I tried databinding double[,] and BindingList > . Is there a way to achieve this using XtraGrid?
