We always used to do our alpha testing in house in a very methodical way. I've worked in organisations that actually have specialised alpha testers through to developers alpha testing their own work. So far, I've found no difference in the quality of output between a dedicated alpha tester vs a developer. Alpha testing is usually very methodical. But you're asking about beta testers. They tend to be less methodical. Personally I think the best beta testers are the people that use the software and not their managers. Although, the project managers often have a better understanding of what it should do. The people that use it will find the bugs more quickly. Who's going to use it in the end? Provided they can tell you the steps that led up to the problem then they would be the best. Often thats not possible... so build into your system detailed logging that tells you what they were doing at the time.
