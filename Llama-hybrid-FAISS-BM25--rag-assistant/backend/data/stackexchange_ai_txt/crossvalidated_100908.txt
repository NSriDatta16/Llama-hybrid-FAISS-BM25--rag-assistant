what if I know my time series are cointegrated over a long period but not over a short period?

I am regressing time series on time series. I have tested for cointegration on the entire time sample (3 years) and the series are cointegrated. I need to make a rolling window of regressions (to get a time series of betas) over this entire time sample. My rolling window will probably be 50 or 100 days. What if my time series on this short period will not be cointegrated (even if I know it's cointegrated over the entire period)? Can I use a specific estimator (GMM or other) to estimate this regression? What is the bias on my estimated beta if I would regress using OLS?
