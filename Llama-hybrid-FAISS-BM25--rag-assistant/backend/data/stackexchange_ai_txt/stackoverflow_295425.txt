Can you specify the folder VS will use when debugging mobile apps?

Hitting debug will deploy the application to \program files\AppNamespace\AppName.exe and attach to it. However, my app runs on the storage card \SD-MMC Card. This means I'm debugging and running in different places, so I have a slight maintenance headache. Therefore the question is, anyone know if you can specify the folder VS will use when debugging?
