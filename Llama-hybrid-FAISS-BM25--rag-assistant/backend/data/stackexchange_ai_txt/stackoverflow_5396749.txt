Pass command line Params in mvn exec:exec

I am amazed that what should have been a very easy job is turning into a very annoying task for me. All i need is to pass few command line parameters to my maven exec:exec plugin. unfortunately hours of googling has not helped at all. Here is my plugin org.codehaus.mojo exec-maven-plugin 1.2 org.springframework spring-instrument ${spring.version} java -classpath -javaagent:${settings.localRepository}/org/springframework/spring-instrument/${spring.version}/spring-instrument-${spring.version}.jar -Xmx256m com.myPackage.Myclass exec Now from the command prompt i am typing in: mvn exec:exec -Dexec.args=-Dmy.property=myProperty I also tried: mvn exec:exec -Dexec.arguments=-Dmy.property=myProperty And many other things. However nothing seems to be working. I know that exec:exec runs in a separate VM but as per the documentation -Dexec.args should work for me. Can someone please suggest where i am going wrong?
