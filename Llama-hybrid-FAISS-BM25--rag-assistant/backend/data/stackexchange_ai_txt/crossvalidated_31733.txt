If you have a large number of variables, there is uncertainty regarding the choice of predictors. I think this is root of OP's problem. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) helps take this uncertainty into account. Check out Adrian Raftery's page on BMA. Through BMA, you can select a subset of potentially helpful predictors. R packages exist for most of these methods. http://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/bma.html I found Raftery's paper on BMA modeling economic growth to be particularly interesting http://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Eicher2010.pdf
