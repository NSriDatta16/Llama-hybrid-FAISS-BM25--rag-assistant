Converting a CFG to IL

I build a CFG out of an arbitrary IL and want to convert that CFG back to IL. The order of the vertices in the CFG is of course not equal to the order of the original IL instructions. This is fine but overcomplicates some stuff. Imagine: Jump 'B' 'C': Return 'B': Jump 'C' This would result in a flow graph like this: (Jump B) -> (Jump C) -> (Return) This is of course a simplified example but it shows the problem when converting out of the CFG. Is there any information available on this topic in academia? I thought traversing the graph bottom-up would be very elegant but that does not work in more complicated cases. A solution might be to walk top-down and search for a CF merge but in that case I would not be able to handle loops correct. So the only way to get this right seems to be to search for a possible CF merge if it occurs. If not, we have to have a loop, which means the loop is preferred and the continuing path is evaluated afterwards. This sounds like a solveable problem but it is also very expensive and there might exist a more elegant solution to the problem. Besides a loop could also result in a CF merge when thinking about a "break" statement.
