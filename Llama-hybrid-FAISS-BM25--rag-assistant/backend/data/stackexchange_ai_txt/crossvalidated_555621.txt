Everything works better when you specify a full model that leads to a full likelihood. If you have exchangeability, add random effects. If you have serial correlation, use a serial correlation structure through the use of a Markov model or generalized least squares. Advantages of full models include statistical efficiency better fit more accurate confidence intervals ability to handle wildly varying cluster sizes The cluster bootstrap is an approximate method that can yield disappointing confidence interval coverage and will not handle large clusters or varying cluster sizes well.
