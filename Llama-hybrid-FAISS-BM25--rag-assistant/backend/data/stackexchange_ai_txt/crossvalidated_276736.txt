"The number $A$ must be some multiple of the number $B$." is true because the number $A/B$ exists, unless $B=0$. So Cochran's meaning may take some effort to discern. Suppose $N=5$ and $n=3$. Then the possible samples (assuming it's without replacement) are these: \begin{align} & y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \\[3pt] & y_1 + y_2 + y_4 \\[3pt] & y_1 + y_2 + y_5 \\[3pt] & y_1 + y_3 + y_4 \\[3pt] & y_1 + y_3 + y_5 \\[3pt] & y_1 + y_4 + y_5 \\[3pt] & y_2 + y_3 + y_4 \\[3pt] & y_2 + y_3 + y_5 \\[3pt] & y_2 + y_4 + y_5 \\[3pt] & y_3 + y_4 + y_5 \end{align} There are $10$ of these, so the average value of the sum is the average of these $10$ sums. The number $y_1$ appears in six of these sums, and $y_2$ appears in six of them, and so one. Thus "every unit appears in the same number of samples", since in this case, that "same number" is $6$. Thus the sum of the ten numbers is $6y_1+6y_2+6y_3+6y_4+6y_5.$ Dividing by $10$ gives the average, or expected value, of the random sample of size $3$. Hence \begin{gather} \text{expected value of the sample sum} = \frac{6y_1+6y_2+6y_3+6y_4+6y_5}{10} \\[10pt] = \frac 6 {10} (y_1+y_2+y_3+y_4+y_5) = \frac 3 5 (y_1+y_2+y_3+y_4+y_5) \end{gather} This ratio, $\dfrac 3 5,$ is the ratio of the sample size to the population size. That is the "multiplier". I expect there is a short elegant combinatorial argument showing that that will happen in general, i.e. with other numbers than $3$ and $5$, and also making Cochran's argument precise, but I'm not sure how best to express that right now.
