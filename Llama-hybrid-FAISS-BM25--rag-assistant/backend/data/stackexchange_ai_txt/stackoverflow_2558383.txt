Bongiorno, Luciano! La domanda di Lei non Ã¨ troppo chiara. Eh... I'd rather use English, my Italian is somewhat poor. Your question is not very clear. It could help if I knew more of the context of your problem. What kind of software are you developing? Why do you need many instances of the 'Drawer' (or Painter) class? Based on what I was able to guess now, I'd suppose you need some variant of Interpreter pattern. The "Gang of Four" book (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) is a must-read for each and every programmer. For Smalltalkers I highly recommend "The Design Patterns Smalltalk Companion" by Sherman Alpert, Kyle Brown and Bobby Woolf as an everyday reference. Sorry, this is all advice I can give regarding your problem as it is currently formulated.
