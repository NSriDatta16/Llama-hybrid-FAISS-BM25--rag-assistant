Make sure to guard your bitmap creation from out of memory errors! With most platforms, android doesn't have much memory to play with and it runs out quickly with bitmaps. Also, make sure to manually recycle your bitmaps as much as possible, I've noticed that the garbage collection can be rather slow. try{ Bitmap myFragileBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(500, 500, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888); } catch(IllegalArgumentException e){ Log.e(TAG,"Illegal argument exception."); } catch(OutOfMemoryError e){ Log.e(TAG,"Out of memory error :("); }
