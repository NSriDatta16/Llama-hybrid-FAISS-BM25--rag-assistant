Have you tinkered with Rel?

I would like to hear opinions or peoples experiences regarding Rel . Is it destined for the dustbin, or is it the next big thing in programming? I haven't tried doing anything with it yet (and it looks like you really can't at this point), but I'm intrigued by a few of the concepts discussed in it. Notably: Removal of nulls completely from the data handling part of the language. No need for mapping types between the language and the data storage. Nesting tables Complete separation of design and implementation. Thoughts?
