Prepared statements: MySQLi or PDO?

I'm using mySQL database and found out that using Prepared statements offer lots of benefits. However by browsing Stackoverflow I noticed that every expert encourages to use PDO, but no one talks about MySQLi. As far I have understood, PDO supports multiple databases, if thats not the concern, why PDO is preferred over mySQLi? Thanks
