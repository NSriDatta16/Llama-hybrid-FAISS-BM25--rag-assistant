There are a number of ways to plot high dimensional data. Matplotlib supports 3D plotting, so I assume you won't be having a problem plotting the 3 dimensions on x, y, and z-axis of the graph. However, for higher dimensions, you can use colors and symbols. For instance, if you plot normalized full-time students along x-axis, total endowment as along y-axis, and tuition revenue as z-axis on a 3D plot, then you can plot, for instance, a colored triangle for the %ge of your first column, and the color can be a heat map value, where blue shows low percentage, red shows a high percentage. Similarly, you can use a color-map square, or a circle to show plots of your second column. This is, no doubt, one idea to do it. But other techniques can be, that you perform some dimensionality reduction and visualize meaningful information, or you can divide a high-dimensional data into several occurrences of a lower dimensional data, and plot all of them as subplots of a single large plot.
