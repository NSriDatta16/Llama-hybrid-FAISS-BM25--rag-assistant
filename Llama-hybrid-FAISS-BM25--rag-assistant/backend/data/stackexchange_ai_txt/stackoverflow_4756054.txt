I have had similar problems with a list returned from a service not including the child elements in the list. I have found that BlazeDS can return a typed list. The two things that fixed this for me were: a) Ensure that the returned list is of type java.util.List (not java.util.ArrayList for example). b) Ensure that the class for the elements in the list have both public setters and getters for all entities to be returned. For example - the following code works for me: public class OrganisationService { ... public List getOrganisations() { List list = new ArrayList (); ... return list; } ... }
