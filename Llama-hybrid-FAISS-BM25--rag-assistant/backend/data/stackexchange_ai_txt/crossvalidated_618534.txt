Pearson chi-squared vs. logistic regression?

I have a dataset with calf serum BHB concentration expressed as low ( 150). I want to know if there is a difference in BHB between age categories (weeks). I tested two analysis: Pearson Chi-squared test. Here is the script with the results: t $BHB_gr, file$ stade3) chisq.posthoc.test(t, method = "bonferroni") pairwise_prop_test(t) Logistic regression. Here is the script with the results: bhb_m The issue is that I get very different results, but I cannot figure out why and which method is the most appropriate. I also tested mixed effect logistic regression to control for the farm effect (farm as random effect) and the results were similar to the logistic regression. Here is a plot of the data. We can clearly see no difference between the 3 first age categories (low BHB) and the last category stands out with high BHB.
