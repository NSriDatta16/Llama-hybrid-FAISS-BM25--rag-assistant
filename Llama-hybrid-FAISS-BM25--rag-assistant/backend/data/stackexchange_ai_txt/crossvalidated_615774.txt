The answer to your question is yes: you'd find useful connections still. Setting $W_Q \triangleq W_K$ is one of the suggestions for parameter efficiency from Kitaev et al. (2020 at ICLR) . It has the effect of making the queries and keys identical. The authors call this "shared-QK attention" and note in ยง5 that this parameter-tying approach is not worse than the standard attention mechanism: A shared query-key space does not perform worse than regular attention; in fact, for enwik8 it appears to train slightly faster. In other words, we are not sacrificing accuracy by switching to shared-QK attention.
