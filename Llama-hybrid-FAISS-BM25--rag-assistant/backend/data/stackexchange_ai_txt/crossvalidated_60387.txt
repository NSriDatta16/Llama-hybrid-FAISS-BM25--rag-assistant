Yes, it is possible. You have to be somewhat careful about how to define the residuals. To be concrete, suppose we have a time series. Let the binary outcome be $y_t$ and the vector of regressors be $x_t$. An obvious thing is to take $\hat{\epsilon}_t = y_t - \frac{e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} } {1+e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} }$. However, these residuals are heteroskedastic, which makes their asymptotic distribution under the null slightly more complicated. It's easier to work with $\tilde{\epsilon}_t = \frac{\hat{\epsilon}_t}{ \sqrt{ (\frac{e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} } {1+e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} })(1 - \frac{e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} } {1+e^{x_t \hat{\beta}} }) } } $. Hsiao, Pesaran, and Pick (2007) discuss this approach for testing independence in panel data. Alternatively, you can work with what Gorieroux, Monfort, and Trognon (1985) call generalized residuals, $\hat{\varepsilon}_t = \mathrm{E}[y_t^\ast - x_t \beta | y_t, x_t] = y_t - \frac{1}{1+e^{-x_t\beta}}$. They show that $S_1 = \frac{(\sum_{t=2}^T \hat{\varepsilon}_t \hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=2}^T \hat{\varepsilon}_t^2 \hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}^2} \overset{d}{\rightarrow} \chi^2_1$. They also discuss how $S_1$ relates to the usual Durbin-Watson test statistic.
