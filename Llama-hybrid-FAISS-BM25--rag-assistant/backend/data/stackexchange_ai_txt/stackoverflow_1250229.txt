A more easy to understand version of sagar's answer: Open a Finder window to where your images are stored and the iPhone Simulator. Then drag the images from the Finder window into the simulator. The simulator will open Safari with your image. Click and hold to save the image to the iPhone camera roll. You can now use those images as you normally would.
