Since you want to incorporate an eye-level variable (inflamation in a particular eye), then either you can average the inflamation variable for both eyes and proceed with a similar model, or you can use a mixed effects / multilevel model with a level-2 outcome (and person-level covariates), and level 1 covariates (eye inflamation).
