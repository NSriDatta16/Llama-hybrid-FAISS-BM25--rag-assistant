It shouldn't matter much for memory usage, but you'll get increased modularity, easier testability with mock objects, and the aesthetic ugliness of having to write out dependencies explicity will encourage programmers to make each class more orthogonal and independent. It's easier to gloss over dependencies when your class is calling globals, which a singleton basically is, and it can make your life harder later.
