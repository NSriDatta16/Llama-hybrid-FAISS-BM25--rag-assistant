How to Use Generative AI for Time Series Forecasting?

What I have A time series dataset of time stamps (hourly resolution), some covariates (like store foot-traffic) and items sold. What to forecast Number of items sold for next 24 hours, i.e. 24 forecasts. Requirement Have to use generative AI for modelling and benchmark against non-generative methods. My question I have used models like TFT, N-beats etc. for time-series forecasting using Gluon, Darts, but are they considered generative ? If not, any tutorial or sample code with generative time series forecasting (preferably implemented with tensorflow, python) will be helpful. Or else, if I do not want to dig into the implementation detail, just is there any readily available python framework with simple interface to get forecasts using generative algorithms? I am looking for something akin to Huggingface models for natural language understanding.
