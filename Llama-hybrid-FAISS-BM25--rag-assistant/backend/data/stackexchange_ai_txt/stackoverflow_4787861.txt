Use call_user_func('func', list, of, args) or call_user_func_array('func', array(containing, arguments)) . As you want to call a class method, you'll have to pass 'func' not a a string but as an array: array($instance, 'func') - in your case: array($irc, 'say_something') Fyi, $array("action" => $irc->say_something()) makes no sense. But you probably wanted to write array("action" => $irc->say_something()) . However, this assigns 'action' to the result of the method call - not what you want. See the last paragraph on how the 'action' value should look like to use it as a method pointer.
