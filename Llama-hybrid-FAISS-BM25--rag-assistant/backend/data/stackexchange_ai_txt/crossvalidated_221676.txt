Parameter Estimation for intractable Likelihoods / Alternatives to approximate Bayesian computation

Suppose that I have a stochastic model with some parameters that I want to fit to some observed data. Let's assume the Likelihood intractable, i.e. for some reason I cannot work with the analytical formula for the Likelihood (e.g. it's not elusive or computationally very costly to evaluate). But I can run Monte Carlo simulations of the model. What methods exist to to estimate my parameters? One option would be approximate Bayesian computation. Are there others?
