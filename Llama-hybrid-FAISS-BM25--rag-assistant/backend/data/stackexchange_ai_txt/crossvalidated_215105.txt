simulate sub group data for logistic regression

I want to simulate a data set for logistic regression in which my $Y_i \sim Bin(n_i, p_i)$ and $n_i >1 ~ \forall i$. I want something like: In another question , data has been generated for a logistic in which $n_i = 1$. I am confused as to whether it would be correct to follow this method and then bin the $x$ variables and call that a population. I'm not quite sure how to do this without creating some sort of bias in the data that I won't account for in the logistic regression. I'm looking for an explicit description of how to account for $n_i>1$, if possible using R. EDIT : Using the code in the question which I've tweaked, here is what I have: set.seed(1) x1 Are there any reasons this is not a reasonable way of doing things?
