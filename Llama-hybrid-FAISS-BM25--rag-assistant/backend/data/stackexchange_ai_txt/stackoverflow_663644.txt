Gesture recognition, as I've seen it anyway, is usually implemented using machine learning techniques similar to image recognition software. Here's a cool project on codeproject about doing mouse gesture recognition in c# . I'm sure the concepts are quite similar since you can likely reduce the problem down to 2D space. If you get something working with this, I'd love to see it. Great project idea!
