1.One table to manage departments (like electronics, books...) 2.One table to manage categories of the departments, this table will be a child of the previous. If the department is electronics, here will be audio, tv and video, games... (each category belongs to one department, the relationship is one department to many categories) Why? One table, categories, forming a hierarchy. More flexible. 3.One table to manage the products (each product belongs to one category, the relationship is one category to many products) Why? Allow m:n here. A product in many categorries. Im not sure if this is the best way, the database will be huge Ah - no. Sorry. Nontrivial, yes. Hugh? No. Just to get you an idea of hugh - I have a db I am adding 1.2 billion rows PER DAY to a specific table. On average. THIS is big. YOu end up with what - 100.000 items? not even worth mentioning.
