Is there a statistically sound method of smoothing a data series without removing the edges?

Recently I've been plotting a lot of data, and often I find myself using a moving average to smooth out values that oscillate or otherwise fluctuate a lot. However, the problem with this is that it removes the edges of the series, so in case of e.g. up-to-date time-series data I no longer have a view of the most recent development (say I do a 30-day smoothing, and now ~2 weeks are gone from the beginning and end of the series). Here's some data I'm looking at, for example: Here there's a very clear ~monthly oscillation that I'd like to smooth out, but preferably without losing the last weeks or month of data. So, as the question says, are there any good methods of doing this? And if so, what are they and how do they work?
