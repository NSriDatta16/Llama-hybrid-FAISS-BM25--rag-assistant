The quota is for the user to set, how much space he wishes to allow to each website. Therefore since the purpose is to restrict the web pages, the web pages cannot change the restriction. If storage is low, you can prompt the user to increase local storage. To find out if storage is low, you could probe the local storage size by saving an object then deleting it.
