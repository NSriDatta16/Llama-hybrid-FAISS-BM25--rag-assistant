Average of estimators

Given $X_1,...,X_n$ i.i.d. samples from some unknown distribution, assume that we are given a consistent estimator $\phi_n$ for some R.V. $\phi$. As $n$ gets larger, what can we say about the distance of the following quantities $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi_n(X_i) $$ and $$ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi (X_i)$$
