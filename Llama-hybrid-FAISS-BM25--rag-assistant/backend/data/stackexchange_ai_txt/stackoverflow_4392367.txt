What design-pattern do you use, and what is it good for?

I know about the Gang of Four and some of their patterns such as the Fa√ßade , the Factory , the Singleton and some others. Besides, it happened that I see multiple patterns which I don't know of, neither for what are they good, or their purpose. I would like to have your cues about the design patterns that you know. It would be much appreciated for you to provide a code sample explaning its use, and when it would be accurate to use it over another pattern. Please, only one pattern per answer, and one example per pattern. See if the pattern you would like to share is already discussed. If not, please feel free to share with the community! =)
