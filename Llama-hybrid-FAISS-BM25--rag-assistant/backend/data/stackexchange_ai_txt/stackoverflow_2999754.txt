Do you just want to create movie files or do you want to display them on the phone? If you just want to display the post-processed annotated images as a movie then it's possible. What is the format of your images ? Currently, I'm able to display to MJPEG video on a Nexus One (running 2.1) without any noticeable lag without using the NDK. In my case the images are coming from the network. On the other hand, if you just want to create movie files and store is on the phone or some other place then CommonsWave's idea of "delegating" this to a server makes more sense since you will have more processing power and storage on the server. This will require that you have access to a network and don't mind sending all the images from the phone to the server and then download the movie file back to the phone.
