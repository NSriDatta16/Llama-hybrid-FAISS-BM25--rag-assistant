Using R's aov() for two-way repeated-measurement ANOVA

We analyze blood vessel samples of patients in an organ bath which gives us force values. Each subject (patient) donates two types of blood vessels (pulmonary vein and pulmonary artery). The organ bath measurements include dose-response curves with a pharmaceutical, i.e. different concentrations are applied. From what I understand, this should be analyzed using a two-way RM ANOVA test. There are two variables (vessel type and concentration), and all levels of both are applied to each subject. The data table looks like this: subject vessel conc force 20110818 PA -12 0 20110818 PV -12 0 20110818 PA -11 0.09 20110818 PV -11 0.15 ... There are no missing values or anything like that to consider. Perusing several R tutorials, I came up with the following query: aov.ex2=aov(force~(vessel*conc)+Error(subject/(vessel*conc)),data=data.ex2) However, the results are somewhat unclear to me: > summary(aov.ex2) Error: subject Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Residuals 1 15.370 15.370 Error: subject:vessel Df Sum Sq Mean Sq vessel 1 166.72 166.72 Error: subject:concentration Df Sum Sq Mean Sq concentration 1 3134.3 3134.3 Error: subject:vessel:concentration Df Sum Sq Mean Sq vessel:concentration 1 148.32 148.32 Error: Within Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Residuals 219 3031 13.840 This is quite a lot of information, but in contrast to the nice examples on the web I can't seem to find the useful part of the information: p values and whether or not there are significant differences. Is there something wrong with my input, or does the result simply mean there is nothing interesting to see in these data?
