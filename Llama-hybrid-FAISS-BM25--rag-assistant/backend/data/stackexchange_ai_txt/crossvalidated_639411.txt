Parallel Tempering and Bayesian Non-Parametrics

In parallel tempering, we run multiple MCMC chains in an ascending temperature ladder, where the posterior density of the $i$ th chain is exponentiated to the reciprocal of the temperature of the $i$ th chain. $$ f(x,\theta\mid T_i) := f(x,\theta)^{\frac{1}{T_i}} $$ Then chain states are swapped at intervals with probability $$ \alpha_{1,2} = \min\left[ 1, \exp\lbrace (T_2^{-1} - T_1^{-1}) \times (E_2 - E_1)\rbrace\right] $$ Where $E_t$ is the "energy", or log-posterior-density, of the distribution for chain $t$ . Consider a stick-breaking representation of the infinite mixture model. Then $$ f(x\mid\pi,\theta) = \sum_{j = 1}^J\pi_j f_0(x\mid\theta_j). $$ Obviously truncating the mixture at $J$ . Under the stick-breaking model, $\pi = S(\nu)$ , the stick-breaking function. Whether it's Dirichlet process or GEM, say the prior for $\nu$ is $f(\nu)$ . Finally, the cluster parameters have their centering distribution and associated hyperpriors, $f(\theta)$ . So the posterior is proportional to $$ f(y,\theta) \propto \sum_{j = 1}^J \pi_j f_0(y\mid\theta) \times f(\nu) \times f(\theta) $$ Finally, say I want to do parallel tempering on this model. Is $f(y,\theta)$ as described here the quantity I exponentiate to the reciprocal of the temperature? Does that not induce a lot of noise, as I include information for clusters with no data?
