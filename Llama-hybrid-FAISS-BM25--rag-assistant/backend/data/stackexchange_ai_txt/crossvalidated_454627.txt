How Parzen window density estimate $f_n$ converges to f

I am trying to understand how Parzen window density estimate converges to actual density function f(x).[Actually i am trying to learn machine learning on my own using available free resources. Please help me in the below] Let $f_n(x)$ be the Parzen window density estimate of actual density f(x). Given $x_1,x_2....x_n $ are iid sample (given training data). Let h be parameter. $V_n$ be volume (say hypercube). Now in Parzen, we take estimate for density function to be linear sum of kernel functions at sample points. To show that estimate converges to actual f(x), i did in following way(for each sample size n, $V_n, h_n$ , varies and also as $n \to \infty, h_n \to 0, V_n \to 0, $ but $n V_n \to 0$ ) $E(\hat f_n(x)) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E(\frac{1}{V_n} \phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n})) \\ = E(\frac{1}{V_n} \phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n})) \\= \int \frac{1}{V_n} \phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n}) f(z) dz$ (as each term expectation is same and $\phi $ be some kernel function, f be density ) Above Last integral be (1) After that how to proceed? I am following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esoVuEG-X1I&list=PLbMVogVj5nJSlpmy0ni_5-RgbseafOViy&index=13&t=2617s ( At 26.01 ) Here sir says this integral (1) goes to f(x) as $n \to \infty$ but i did not understand how. I know $\int \frac{1}{V_n}\phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n}) dz = 1$ (since $\phi$ is kernel function) Also, i tried to expand on final integral(1) using integration by parts then $f(z)\int \frac{1}{V_n}\phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n}) dz - \int f'(z) \int \frac{1}{V_n}\phi(\frac{x-x_i}{h_n}) dz dz = f(z) - f(z)=0$ (as integral of kernel function sums to 1) Please explain where i did it wrongly or understood wrongly.
