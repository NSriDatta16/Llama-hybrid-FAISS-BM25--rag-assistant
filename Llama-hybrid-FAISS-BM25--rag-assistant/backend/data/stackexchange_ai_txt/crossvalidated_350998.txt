Statistical difference of machine learning predictions

I am applying a machine learning classification method to two difference scenarios for my boss (in this context, I am using a random forest). Due to the nature of the problem, there is high class imbalance; most points are expected to be labeled 0, while only about 5% are labeled 1.The classifer will generate predictions probabilities (between 0 and 1) for each point. I have generated predictions for the two scenarios. It looks something like this In this plot each dot is a prediction, while the x and y axes are the scenarios. My Question I want to quantify the difference between the two methods in a fair way. However, due to the class imbalance using correlation (either spearman or pearson) is not fair: since most predictions are low confidence in both methods, it is correlation coefficients will always be high. In previous analysis like this, I have picked a threshold (e.g. 50%) and quantified similarity above that threshold. Is there a more principled way to do this?
