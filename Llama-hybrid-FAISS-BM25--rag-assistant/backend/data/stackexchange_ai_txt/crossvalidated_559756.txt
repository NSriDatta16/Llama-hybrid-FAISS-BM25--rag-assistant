Is it a good practice to collect different numbers of data (randomly picked) per class?

I am totally new to data science and neural networks. So I want to make a simple chord recognition neural network using chroma data from audio. I collected some recordings and songs, and then divide their slices/trims by chords given in the dataset. Is it good for each chord class not having same amount of training audio data?
