Kernel SVM has a training complexity above quadratic in terms of the number of training samples. For low misclassification penalties (C) the complexity is close to quadratic, for high values it approaches cubic. When you see people use SVM on very large datasets it is almost always linear SVM, which can be trained with sublinear complexity. For more details, please refer to LIBLINEAR and Pegasos . If you really want a nonlinear model, it is recommended to use ensemble models, for instance as is available in EnsembleSVM . The latter is mainly used when you have a lot of training instances (standard SVM is slow) in few dimensions (linear SVM is inaccurate).
