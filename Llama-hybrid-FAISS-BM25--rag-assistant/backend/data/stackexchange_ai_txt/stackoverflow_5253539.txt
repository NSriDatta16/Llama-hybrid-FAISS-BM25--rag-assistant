As long as you rotate every object around the same point (and by the same angle, of course), you can pick any point you want as the center. Common choices are the center of the union of the bounding boxes, the average of the individual object centers, the area-weighted average of the centers, and so on. You can even rotate around an arbitrary point outside the group of objects. It depends more on what you want to achieve than anything else.
