First, many PKI-enabled DOD sites should support hardware tokens issued through commercial CAs that participate in the DOD's ECA program (Verisign, IdenTrust, ORC). These ECA-issued certificates don't even include this "number", the DOD EDI PN. As I understand it, there is supposed to be some effort made to keep the number stable for a particular person. For example even if I quit my civilian job at the DOD and go to work for a contractor, get married and change my name, quit my job and enlist in the Coast Guard, my DOD EDI PN should be the same. However, in practice, I doubt it works like that. And even if it did, I probably shouldn't have the same access to an application. Each time my employment changes, the certificate on my CAC should be revoked. If an application is only looking at the common name or subject alternative name of the certificate, it will miss changes in the organization that probably affect the authorization of that subject. Basing authentication on a particular certificate (issuer and serial number) is a pain for users, but it does make sense from a standpoint of security and robustness.
