If you're only running the code "thousands" of times on a pretty quick function, the occasional longer time could easily be due to transient events on the system (maybe Windows decided it was time to cache something). That being said, I would suggest the following: Run the function many many more times, and take an average. In the code that uses the function, determine if the function in question actually is a bottleneck. Use a profiler for this.
