Handling the Callback from animoto videos

I am using Animoto API to create all the images into video. As per the animoto documentation I have used " job = Animoto::Jobs::DirectingAndRendering.load(JSON.parse(request.body))" for handling the call back from anomoto API but it is throwing error called "uninitialized constant Animoto::Jobs" Anybody has any idea about his. Please help me
