Starting Game dev on iPhone:iPad - learning path?

I'm beginning in iPhone/iPad game dev and I'm searching to set up my learning path. The basic features I would like to learn (after the basic SDK iphone components programming) are : using a board like interface where I can move pawn with my fingers detect where the pawn was moved and triggers events in the game The board will be constitute by 6 tiles that may be organised randomly when starting the game : may i use an sdk component with a delegate and datasource to determine where the pawn was left and on which tile ? need to use dices (which kind of library may I use ?) ... Do you have any idea about where to start ? ;-) Many thanks, Tib.
