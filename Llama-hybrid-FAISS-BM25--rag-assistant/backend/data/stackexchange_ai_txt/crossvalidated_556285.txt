I see a number of entries that look suspiciously close to fractions like $\frac{1}{2}$ , $\frac{1}{3}$ , $\frac{2}{3}$ and so on. It seems like you have very little data, so little that some categories only have two or three entries. Your random forest just can't do much with this little data. And neither can any other model. How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Also note that accuracy, precision, recall, F1 etc. have major problems, especially for "unbalanced" data, but also in general. Every criticism at the following threads applies equally to all of these, and indeed to all evaluation metrics that rely on hard classifications: Why is accuracy not the best measure for assessing classification models? Is accuracy an improper scoring rule in a binary classification setting? Classification probability threshold Instead, use probabilistic classifications, and evaluate these using proper scoring rules .
