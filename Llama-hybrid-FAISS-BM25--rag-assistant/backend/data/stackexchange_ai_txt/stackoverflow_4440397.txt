To update everything: You can organize your inputs like this (1,2,3,4 - are record id's in database): Then, in your PHP script: $data){ mysql_query("UPDATE table SET data = '".mysql_escape_string($data)."' WHERE id = ".intval($id)); } ?> This way there will be one UPDATE statement for every record To update only those that changed: You can use javascript's onChange() event to see what fields were changed and submit only those. Just be carefull, if a user has javascript disabled, he well never be able to change any record.
