...The most interpretable definition of the Partial Autocovariance of a $(L^2)$ time series $\{X_t\}$ that I have seen is the following... "Interpretability" is somewhat subjective (not necessarily disagreeing that the conditional variance expression is empirically more interpretable). However, in the $L^2$ covariance-stationary setting, clearly the natural definition is the one defined by a population linear regression, not the conditional covariance. $L^2$ is a Hilbert space. Autocovariances and partial autocovariances are defined naturally via Hilbert space projections. The sample ACF and PACF are defined analogously, by corresponding sample regressions. Indeed, without additional assumptions besides covariance-stationarity, your conditional covariance expression is not even deterministic. It's a random variable; in particular, it's not a parameter that can be estimated. (In the special Gaussian case, it would reduce to the standard PACF, defined via linear regressions.) Does it only apply for models we assume are linear (ARMA)? No, it's well-defined for any covariance-stationary time series. (It's the conditional covariance expression that is problematic as a definition of PACF.)
