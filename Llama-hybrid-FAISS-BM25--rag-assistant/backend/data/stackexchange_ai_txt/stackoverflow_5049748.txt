Magento - Autocomplete Suggest Search Not Working

I have incorporated a new theme in Magento v1.4.2.0, and have completed all the necessary changes, but only following true Magento way of overriding the Magento modules & methods. My only problem is that the auto complete suggest search functionality in the front-end is not working at all. The AJAX is running as I can view the calls in " Firebug " (with the status showing as "200 OK"), but the search result dropdown isnâ€™t coming. Some more info: Checked the method of the form and it is set as " get ". Name of the text field in the " form.mini.phtml " is " q ". Checked both the Log Files ( exception.log & system.log ), but nothing is printed here regarding auto complete search. Checked the settings of Minimal Query Length (from " System > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog Search > Minimal Query Length ") and it is set to " 1 ". Incorporated all the HTML in the " form.mini.phtml " page as precisely as possible, along with including all the required JS files without any errors in them. As a result, the Firebug is reporting the blank / NULL AJAX responses, without any errors. Edit:- I am also getting another problem. Say I have 4 products, each starting with a name " Test ". Also let's assume that the name of these 4 Products are " Test 1 ", " Test 2 ", " Test 3 ", " Test 4 ". Now if I do a simple search with query " Test ", in the router " catalogsearch/index ", then result is showing that there are 4 Products available, which is correct. But if I do a search with query as " Test 1 ", then no results are showing, which is very much weird. Also I am using " jQuery ", with no conflict condition. However, there are also 6 plugins of " jQuery ", all of which are not following the no conflict condition perfectly. This is because the code in some of those plugins are huge, & it is impossible for me to change each & every " $ " sign to " jQuery ", making it no conflict compatible. Can anybody suggest for this sort of problem too? And whether it is affecting the Auto Suggest Search in any way?
