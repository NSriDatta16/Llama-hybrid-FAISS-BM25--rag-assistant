In case anyone is paying attention, or comes across this page, the resolution is simple: it is a mistake! As explained on the Errata page for the second edition here: http://socweb.soc.jhu.edu/faculty/morgan/papers/Errata_2nd_Edition.pdf the first cell of the second row should be 10. The other cells then change in that panel in response to this change, which results in an example that actually follows what is claimed in the panel label: an example where bias is restricted only to baseline bias. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you find other things that appear to you to be mistakes. You may be correct! (In this case, thanks to Dave Harding and his students for noticing this one.)
