Tensors in neural network literature: what's the simplest definition out there?

In the neural network literature, often we encounter the word "tensor". Is it different from a vector? And from a matrix? Have you got any specific example that clarifies its definition? I'm a bit confused about its definition. Wikipedia doesn't help and sometimes I have the impression that its definition depends on the specific machine learning environment used (TensorFlow, Caffee, Theano).
