What kind of information does PCA preserve?

I was reading up on Non-linear dimensionality reduction. On the Wikipedia article it says that PCA does not preserve the intrinsic geometry of the data. What kind of information is it preserving? It is interesting, because we are currently working on a problem dealing with supervised learning on images. We don't know what model best suits it, yet. If applying PCA doesn't take into consideration the intrinsic geometry, then is it worthwhile to apply PCA to the data before passing it to a classifier? For instance, the images contain overlapping objects that might be crucial to the classifier. But an argument could be made that we can use PCA to find a basis that has lower noise (in the sense that we may believe that noise correlates with large patches of pixels).
