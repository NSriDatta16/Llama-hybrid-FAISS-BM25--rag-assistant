Emre Meric on the Microsoft forums managed to answer my question: The default merge option for DataServiceContext is AppendOnly, meaning that if an entity returned by a query is already being tracked by the context, no changes will be made to it. You can set the MergeOption to OverwriteChanges if you want the entity to be updated from the persisted storage at all times. MSDN Reference
