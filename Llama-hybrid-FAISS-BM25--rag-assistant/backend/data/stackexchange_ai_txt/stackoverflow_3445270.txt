jQuery Ajax returning 404 Error, but correct Response

I'm posting some data to a PHP script via jQuery AJAX, and everything executes correctly, but it returns a 404 error. In my Firebug console the response from the PHP script is correct. I don't understand how the script can respond, and it is still throwing a 404 error. The jQuery "error" callback method triggers, and the "success" method doesn't. All statements performed by the PHP script work accurately, because I can see the database being updated, etc. I'm using jQuery 1.4.2, on a WordPress 3.x website hosted by Dreamhost. -----------MORE INFO----------- OK, I've figured out that when I include WordPress's wp-blog-header.php file in the Ajax script, I get the error. Also, once upon a time these scripts work, and I am 90% sure they stopped working after the WP 3.0 update. I'll paste in the Response headers from Firebug. This header response from PHP that includes the wp-blog-header.php and returns a 404 error in Firebug...
