Likely related to http://www.phpunit.de/ticket/740 and http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=440 Sebastian marked it as wontfix in PHPUnit and Derick say it's not a bug. This is not a bug. Xdebug can only scans items (files, functions, methods) when they are loaded and code coverage is enabled. The class file is loaded before code coverage is enabled, and is therefore not picked up in the coverage report. The methods are scanned when they are run as well, so it works there.
