Deep learning models should not be considered parametric. Parametric models are defined as models based off an a priori assumption about the distributions that generate the data. Deep nets do not make assumptions about the data generating process, rather they use large amounts of data to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs. Deep learning is non-parametric by any reasonable definition.
