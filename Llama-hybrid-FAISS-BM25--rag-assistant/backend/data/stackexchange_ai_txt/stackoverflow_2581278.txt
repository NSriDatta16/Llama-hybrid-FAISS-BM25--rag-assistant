jQuery Fade Out an and Fade In Info From DB

On my portfolio page I have this setup: MotorSomethin We tried going for a very dark but flashy look for this website. Hence the reason we used flash.

MotorSomethin We tried going for a very dark but flashy look for this website. Hence the reason we used flash. So imagine a grid, 2 sites per line. I want to use jQuery so that when I click the H3, the image, or the paragraph inside the LIE(which are all information about a certain site), it would fade out the entire UL, then grab info about that site from our database. I think this requires AJAX but I don't have much experience with it. I'm also confused on how to use jQuery to write the new HTML after the information is grabbed.
