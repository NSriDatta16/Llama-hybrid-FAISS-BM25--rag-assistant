How to display a blank div element?

I have a blank div class that is called spacer ... it has a blue background and a width of 100% of the container (the body) ... What I have found is that the spacer will not DISPLAY unless I toss some character in it. I can color the character blue so it is hidden, but that is so inelegant. What is the CORRECT way to do this.
