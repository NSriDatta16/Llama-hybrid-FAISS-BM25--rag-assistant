Recommending products to buy

I have the following dataset where each row represents a customer, and each column is a product. So for example, the first customer (row 0) buys product 2 and product 7. The second customer (row 1) buys products 3,6 and 7. And so on... Basically I want to recommend customers who are already buying certain products, some other products. Here is an example: Let's say I choose all customers who are buying products 1 and 4. How would I recommend them the next best...let's say 3... products based on what other 1 and 4 customers are buying? I'd like to use keras neural networks or random forests for this kind of task. Thanks :) product 1.......product 2.........product 3....... product 4...... product 5........ product 6..... product 7
