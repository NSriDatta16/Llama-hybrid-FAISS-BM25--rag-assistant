Yes. The use of dynamic URL generation ( link_to , url_for ) makes rails look up the routes table and that may consume time. Having said that, these comes handy while generating a link that needs to send a delete / put request as it takes care of a lot of things internally. So I would say, use them but use them wisely, only when you know they save a lot of maintenance or some other reason for that matter. Also, when it comes to performance, there are several techniques to enhance it. Rails caching (page, fragment, action) is one. Also, you might want to take a look at this question I had asked in the past.
