This is an old and stale issue, but I happened to stumble on this first now. There are two kind of constrained row scores in vegan::rda: the WA scores which are found from the response data, and the LC (linear combination scores) that are the linear combinations of your constraints. The LC scores are the PCA of (scaled) fitted values of your response variables, and WA scores are the values that you get when you use response variables to predict the values of constraints. You had only one constraint ("type" in your data), and the LC score is only that one constraint rescaled. You can plot the ordination with LC scores by requesting them, or with your example: plot(ord, display="lc") You can also see that the LC scores of RDA1 are uncorrelated with residual unconstrained axes PC1 to PC3: zapsmall(cor(scores(ord, display="lc", choices=1:4))) RDA1 PC1 PC2 PC3 RDA1 1 0 0 0 PC1 0 1 0 0 PC2 0 0 1 0 PC3 0 0 0 1
