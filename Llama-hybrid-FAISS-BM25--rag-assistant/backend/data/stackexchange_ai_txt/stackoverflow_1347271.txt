Simple sip based client interaction... Any Ideas

I am tring to do the following: I want a SIP User Agent to perform the following steps on receiving an inbound call (call set up request). 1) Read the caller ID from the SIP request and Log the details to file 2) Drop the call (terminate the call without picking up the call) I have not been able to find a high level api that will let me script this interaction. I have taken a look at Jain but it seems to be a very low level API and I imagine will require a lot of work to get the above interaction coded up and working. Can anyone suggest an apropriate API to implement the above. NOTE: I have tried ROXEO.com and their CCXML based apps are great but their pricing is aimed at big companies, so Voxeo is not an option.
