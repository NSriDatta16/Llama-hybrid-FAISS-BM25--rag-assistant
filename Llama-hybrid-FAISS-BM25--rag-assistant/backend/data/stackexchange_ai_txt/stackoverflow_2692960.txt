I guess one way to do it is to add a temporal component to the input (recurrent neural net) and stream the input to the net a chunk at a time (basically creating the neural network equivalent of a lexer and parser) this would allow the input to be quite large but would have the disadvantage that there would not necessarily be a stop symbol to seperate different sequences of input from each other (the equivalent of a period in sentances)
