I don't think there is a way to build your graph from raw data without using at least basic programming skills. I'm not aware of a drag-and-drop interface for importing and displaying data. Graphs are just a bit too complex. Imagine trying to find the profit of selling a product if all you had was CSVs of receipts dropped into Excel. You'd need labels of the columns, some basic calculations, and so on before you had anything intelligible. Graphs are similar in this regard. Thankfully, there are open source solutions, with some elbow grease and a few days of work, you can probably get a nice visualization. Cypher queries are relatively simple to write. Using Neo4j and Cypher, you can create a basic visualization of your graph, which is displayed using D3.js GraphAlchemist recently open-sourced their project Alchemy.js which specializes in graph visualization. https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy
