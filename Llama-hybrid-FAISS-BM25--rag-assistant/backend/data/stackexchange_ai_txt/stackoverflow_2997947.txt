Bugs in scroll-follow with Google map (Firefox and Safari)

A scroll follow effect is when a part of the web design is always visible, even when the window is scrolled. There are animated and static versions of this. The animated is ok http://robertomartinez.info/cobra/index.html But I prefer the fixed version, however I have some bugs: http://robertomartinez.info/cobra/index_fixed.html -In Firefox, when you scroll the page, you will see a kind of vertical cut in the lorem ipsum text (below the HERE indication). This is caused by the image tiles of the map, then if you drag and drop the map, the cut will appear in another side. -In Safari, when you scroll the page, the div follows, but the map images stay in the same position. Do you have solutions for these issues? Thanks.
