How to find the $(a_n,b_n)$ for extreme value theory

In the solution to this question (Extreme Value Theory - Show: Normal to Gumbel), the OP asked for the sequence $(a_n, b_n)$ such that $\Phi(a_nx+b_n)$ converges to the Gumbel CDF. Not only did I not able to understand the derivation in the accepted answer (I don't see the derivation for the last paragraph), I am also curious to know how one would go about deriving the sequence for distributions other than the standard normal. For example, the sequences in examples 7.5 and 7.6 in this document (page 6) seems to be pulled out of thin air.
