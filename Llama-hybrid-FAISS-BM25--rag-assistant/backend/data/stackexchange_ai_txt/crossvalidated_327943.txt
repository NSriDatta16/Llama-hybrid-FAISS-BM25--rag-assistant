A NN does not necessarily use logistic regression as the activation function (ie, how a neuron activate and what output value it produces), but if you choose a logistic regression, then yes, it's like having as many logistic regressions as neurons. However, what makes the ANN "magical", is the possibility of combining these functions by weighting the connections, and the ability to learn "automatically" these weights from a training dataset. So yes in your case, you can see your ANN as a combination of logistic regressions. If you add more layers, you get a combination of combinations of logistic regressions, which can potentially derive more complex features. In the end, this is this combination of multiple functions that allow for the generation of a non-linear output, which is part of what makes ANN powerful (and sometimes difficult to deal with...).
