Are there any alternatives to using a MySQL table for "likes" ? There are, but what are you afraid of? A mySQL table is one of the most optimal forms to store lots of data in. You could look at noSQL databases and other forms of data storage, but my bet is you can easily stick with mySQL at the moment, and switch storage engines later if the project starts growing so massively that you need to go beyond relational databases.
