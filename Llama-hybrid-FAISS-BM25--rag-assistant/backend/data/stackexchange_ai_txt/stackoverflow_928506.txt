This is pretty much exactly what SSIS is designed for, however it's not as "generic" as your current system, but it's very easy to set up what you've described. You have a control flow and a data flow. Your control flow can contain many data flows (e.g. sync table A, then B, then C) and other tasks (e.g. move files, iterate, custom scripts). In your data flow you define your source, destination and transformations. Your source can be pretty much anything. Then, you can do derived columns and change data type tranformations to do what you've described. Then your destination takes the transformed data (e.g. SQL table, SQL insert statement, SQL update statement) This is done using Visual Studio, and I reckon you could knock out a simple package to sync two tables in 5 minutes. Then, you can schedule it using SQL agent. This is called ETL btw (extract, transform, load) in case you wanted to evaluate other options, but I think SSIS would fit nicely.
