browser cache bypassed in firefox?

Consider the following html page, which can load in many large png files: function hide( ) { document.getElementById("here").innerHTML = "hidden"; } function show( ) { var loadMe = ""; for (var i=1; i "; loadMe += " "; } document.getElementById("here").innerHTML = loadMe; } hide show In IE, Safari & Opera on a windows machine, the images on this page are only loaded once (monitored with FreeMeter) when the show and hide buttons are toggled. However, in Firefox (freshly installed), some images are loaded from the server multiple times (we never match the initial peak in network requests... a few things are loaded from the cache). The response headers of the images read: Date Wed, 18 Mar 2009 11:42:02 GMT Server Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat) Last-Modified Mon, 27 Oct 2008 19:19:47 GMT Etag "1abb7d7-292-45a41039f7ac0" Accept-Ranges bytes Content-Length 658 Cache-Control max-age=7257600 Expires Thu, 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT Connection close Content-Type image/png Looking into about:cache , most of the images loaded appear to be listed there (although inspecting the cache between hide / show clicks, there appear to be missing images): Number of entries: 462 Maximum storage size: 50000 KiB Storage in use: 5593 KiB ... Key: http://example.com/23_a.png Data size: 16139 bytes Fetch count: 13 Last modified: 2009-03-18 07:40:14 Expires: 2009-06-10 07:40:00 What's firefox expecting from me to reload these images from the cache so we can go easy on the network calls? Thank you! Update If I open this page in a new tab after showing / hiding in the first tab, the second tab makes no network requests. The first tab continues to make network requests.
