Flash and SEO: what am I missing?

We're trying to get our company website to be better indexed by Google and other search engines, and at this point I'm not quite sure what's missing. All of our text content is loaded in by our flash application via XML files. In summer, we wrote a PHP script that reads out all the XML files, and generates google friendly index.html files in subdirectories. The files include navigatable links to other sections in the site, and HTML content of the XML files. For example, for our 'work' section in the flash site, there will be an index.html file generated in the following directory: site.com/work/index.html This file contains links to other sections of the site (site.com/overview, site.com/contact) which all have appropriate index.html files. So people who hit those links can see the site properly, that page actually loads in the site swf from the root directory and goes to the appropriate section of the site automatically. Ie, if you hit site.com/work/ in your browser, you will see the Flash application and be directed to the 'work' section within it. However, if you browse the site without javascript/flash enabled, you can actually see a series of html links and some paragraphs/text content. This was all done before Google's announcement in June of being able to index external content loaded into SWFs ( http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/flash-indexing-with-external-resource.html ). Unfortunately, google seems to only have indexed the main page at site.com (even though they say they are capable of indexing flash sites as a user sees them, as above, but I don't even see that working.) A couple days ago, I figured a few things may have been missing, so I did the following: - submitted a sitemap.xml file to google. It sees 49 URLs, but has only indexed 1. How long would google take to index those files? - our main site.com/index.html only had the swf embedded, it didn't have any HTML links to the subsections, so I added those in swfobjects no flash content area - I gathered google wasn't seeing the generated HTML files and instead seeing the embedded SWF, so I disallowed the swf file and the swfobject.js file in the robots.txt file Do the last 3 changes make sense? If so, how long after implementing them should I expect to see some results? Any help would be appreciated!
