No question is stupid. If you're worried about memory fragmentation you will need to rework how you allocate memory so you can track it. Perhaps you should overload the new operator in those classes where you feel fragmentation would cause the most harm. Use some sort of logging functionality to write to you where it all is going. That should suffice as a first exercise. Then if you find that it really is harming you, you can create chunks of memory of the right size to guarantee your items are aligned in the manner you wish them to be.
