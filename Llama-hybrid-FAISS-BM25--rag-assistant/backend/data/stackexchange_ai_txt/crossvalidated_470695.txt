Would you say my understanding is correct in that the models in Shumway and Tsay have limited scope in real life applications? Every model has limited applicability; classical time series models such as ARIMA and GARCH are no exception. However, their use has been extensive for decades and continues to be so. It is not because they are correct -- none of the models are -- but because they are useful, mainly in allowing to simulate future values of time series processes and delivering accurate point and density forecasts. There are numerous solid academic journals within economics and finance who focus on time series analysis, and you will find plenty of ARIMA and GARCH models there. A couple of titles: "Journal of Time Series Analysis" and "Journal of Financial Econometrics" . Practitioners in finance use ARIMA-GARCH models extensively for risk modeling in financial markets (stock, derivative, commodity, foreign exchange markets). The popular software packages rugarch and rmgarch for R are built for that by someone who is a finance practitioner himself. The applicability of classical time series models is not limited to finance, however. The popular software package forecast for R contains automated functions such as ets , auto.arima and other developed for predicting objects as diverse as expenditures on drugs by the Australian government, numbers of tourist visiting the country, electricity prices and loads, etc. From the studying I have done so far, it seems like time series models are only applicable to model residuals for very specific other models, like linear regression. The ubiquitous modeling of prices in financial markets with pure ARIMA-GARCH models should answer the question regarding whether classical time series models are only applicable for residuals from other models (the answer is no). Besides, there is no technical reason for not using time series models on residuals of models other than linear regression. The models described in Tsay and Shumway, from my understanding, seem to only be applicable if your original model makes strict assumptions like normality and iid. This is not an accurate representation of reality. As Chris Haug points out in his comment, It's not particularly surprising that an introductory textbook is limited to linear Gaussian models but the statistical literature on time series models is vastly more complete than that. E.g. the broad class of GARCH models produces nonnormal, non-i.i.d. outcomes. Otherwise I don't see how they could be of any use in real life - unless you just have some process that is 100% explained by lagged values of the same process. As I hinted above, this is often the best approximation of reality that is very challenging to improve upon wihtout overfitting and reducing forecast quality. Now to address your title question : Are time series models limited in real life application and are primarily used to model the residuals of another model? It depends on the area of application. For logarithmic returns on stock prices, you would use ARIMA-GARCH directly. For numbers of tourists or price of electricity, you would include seasonal and perhaps other factors and specify an ARIMA-GARCH structure for the residual.
