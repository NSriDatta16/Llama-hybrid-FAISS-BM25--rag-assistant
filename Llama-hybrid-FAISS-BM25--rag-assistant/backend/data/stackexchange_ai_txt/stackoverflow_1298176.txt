It's a little bit of a simplification to say the class browser only shows one method. It actually shows a lot of methods in a much more organized way than raw source code usually does. Consider in which of these you think you'd have an easier time finding what you wanted: class Thing def foo blah blah blah blah.each do |blah| blah blah blah blah blah.collect {|blah, blah| blah blah blah} end end def bar(blah) blah blah blah blah.each do |blah| blah blah blah blah blah.collect {|blah, blah| blah blah blah} end end end class Fob def foo blah blah blah blah.each do |blah| blah blah blah blah blah.collect {|blah, blah| blah blah blah} end end def bar(blah) blah blah blah blah.each do |blah| blah blah blah blah blah.collect {|blah, blah| blah blah blah} end end end Or: Classes Methods Thing -> foo -> blah blah blah Fob bar blah.each do |blah| blah blah blah blah blah.collect {|blah, blah| blah blah blah} end And an actual Smalltalk class browser is a lot more powerful than my silly little plaintext mockup, whereas Ruby source actually looks a lot like that. A class browser encourages you to think of classes as actual entities with autonomous behaviors rather than a bunch of abstract text.
