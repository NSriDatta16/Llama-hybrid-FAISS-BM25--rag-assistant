This 'method' then should tell you how well a model predicts out of sample Yes, and that is its original purpose, and also part of why it is called cross validation . Depending on the figure of merit you use, that is in itself a proper statement about about a certain kind of generalization error. In my field (chemometrics), e.g. $RMSE_{CV}$ (root mean squared error estimated via cross validation) is widely used as estimate of the model's performance. IMHO, there are a few common but rather unfortunate misunderstandings around cross validation and machine learning. One of them is "cross validation provides model optimzation" - which is IMHO better explained by saying that cross validation is a scheme to generate tests to measure generalization performance of a given model, and that information can then be used as target function for model optimization. (Or alternatively, as generalization performance estimate)
