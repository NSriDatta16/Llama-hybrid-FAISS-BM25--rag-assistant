On the Mac, I know of Task-Specific Storage in the Multiprocessing Services API: MPAllocateTaskStorageIndex MPDeallocateTaskStorageIndex MPGetTaskStorageValue MPSetTaskStorageValue This looks very similar to Windows thread local storage. I'm not sure if this API is currently recommended for thread local storage on the Mac. Perhaps there is something newer.
