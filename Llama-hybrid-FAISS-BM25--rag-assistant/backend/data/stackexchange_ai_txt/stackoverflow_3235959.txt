If you declare checkbox name like (p_id[]), it's like telling PHP "I'm adding element to an array, enumerate it for me". Like in php $array[] = 't'; If you have several form elements with different names and you want to have synchronised IDs you HAVE to add index because otherwise browser will/may send only selected ones and PHP will enumerate it continuously. You can specify indexes by using p_id[INDEX] and so on, where index is anything (I suggest numeric or alphanumeric). Also, checkbox value can be altered and I encourage you to do it. value="1" helps, then you're sure that you get it. In PHP you'll receive $_POST['p_id'] ===> array(0 => 1); et caetera.
