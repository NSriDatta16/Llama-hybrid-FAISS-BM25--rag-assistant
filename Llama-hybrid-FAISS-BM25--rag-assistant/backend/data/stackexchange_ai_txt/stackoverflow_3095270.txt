There is DataNucleus , a Java persistence provider. It is little too heavy for this case, but it supports JPA and JDO java standards with different datastores (RDBMS, object storage, XML, JSON, Excel, etc.). If the product is already using JPA or JDO, it might be worth considering using NataNucleus, as saving data into different datastores should be transparent. I suppose DataNucleus supports splitting the data into several files, creating the sensible directory/file structure I wanted (in my question), but this is just a guess. Support for XML and JSON seems to be experimental.
