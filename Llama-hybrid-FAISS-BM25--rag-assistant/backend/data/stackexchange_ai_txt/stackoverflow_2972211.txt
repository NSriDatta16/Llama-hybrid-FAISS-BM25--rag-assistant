In Qt, can I QWebFrame::print() supply additional rendering layers?

I am leveraging WebKit from QWebFrame to convert HTML pages to PDF. Is it possible to apply some additional rendering logic before the page is sent to the QPrinter? What I want to do is to be able to convert links and form controls in HTML to interactive counterparts in PDF, instead of just a vector graphic dump? Thanks a lot for any guidance!
