Creating custom exceptions by extending System.Exception is THE way to go. Why dont you want to do that? Advantages: You could catch all your custom exceptions by class type (rather than using that ugly .contains) You could add the ErrorNumber property you want to handle error after catching It is the most clean, direct, elegant solution. Any strong reason not to use this approach?
