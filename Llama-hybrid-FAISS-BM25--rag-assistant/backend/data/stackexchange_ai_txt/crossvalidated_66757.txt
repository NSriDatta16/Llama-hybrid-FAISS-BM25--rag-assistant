Random forest vs regression

I ran an OLS regression model on data set with 5 independent variables. The independent variables and dependent variable are both continuous and are linearly related. The R Square is about 99.3%. But when I run the same using random forest in R my result is '% Var explained: 88.42'. Why would random forest result be so inferior to regression? My assumption was that random forest would be at least as good as OLS regression.
