Paperclip DB storage: Attachments go in, but don't come out

irb(main):001:0> e = Event.last => # irb(main):002:0> e.poster.url => "/posters/original/missing.png?1297262984" I am using a fork of the paperclip gem from Pat Shaughnessy . I have also tried, and gotten the same problem with another fork found here , so I am pretty sure this is just me doing something stupid. My app is hosted on heroku. I followed the instructions of the person who originally forked paperclip and tried to adapt them to Rails 3. My route for the poster looks like this: resources :events do member do get :poster end end and in the controller I have: class EventsController and the model: class Event :database, :styles => {:thumb => { :geometry => "100x100>", :column => 'poster_thumb_file'}} end I can't figure out what I am missing to get these images to display. Any advice would be appreciated!
