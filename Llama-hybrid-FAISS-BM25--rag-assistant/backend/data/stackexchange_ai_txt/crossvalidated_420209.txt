Clustering might be a good approach (e.g. KNN, but e.g. UMAP might also be an option), but only if your theory that all things sound "good" if they have peaks at the same frequencies as other good sounding things (and "bad" if they in this sense resemble other "bad" sounding things). However, this does not exclude the possibility that you could feed these features into some other kind of model (e.g. some kind of time series model, e.g. a recurrent neural network - whether that's feasible really depends on how much data you have and how much is labelled). Obvious parameter space reduction techniques could be to use the final embedding layers of some pre-trained neural network as your features (e.g. VGGish pre-trained on AudioSet), a lot of features constructed by human insights (e.g. certain extremely high frequency sounds might be unpleasant and you might be able to define features in terms of certain amplitudes at certain frequencies or certain peak to trough ratios that pick this up pretty well when used as a feature in a model) or a mixture of these.
