UpdatePanel with browser caching

I recently learned that the UpdatePanel uses HTTP requests with the "no-cache" header added. This causes images inside it to be downloaded on every UpdatePanel update. I do not want this. So how do I prevent this? I've thought about extending the UpdatePanel control and try scraping out the "no-cache"-part of the requests, but surely there must be a more elegant solution.
