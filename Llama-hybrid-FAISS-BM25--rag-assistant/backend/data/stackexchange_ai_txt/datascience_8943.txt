What's the most robust way to predict the value of some noisy time series data?

I have some time series data (time, value) such as: 281,97.0 284,98.0 287,98.0 290,98.0 293,98.0 297,99.0 309,100.0 320,101.0 333,101.0 346,103.0 359,104.0 372,105.0 385,107.0 396,108.0 405,108.0 I am trying to predict when the value will be 160. The data is somewhat noisy. The values go mostly up, but could go down sharply every now and then, or stay the same for a short time. When these distortions occur, the prediction is far off for a period of time. What algorithms or heuristics would work the best to deliver a robust prediction that doesn't vary to much? I am currently using a linear fit over a time window of 60 data points. The results are not stable enough.
