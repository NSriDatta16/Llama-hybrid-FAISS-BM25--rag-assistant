I actually encourage delegating this task to the IDE/editor you use. No, I'm not actually talking about naming variables, that is still best done by a human. But the underlying task of such naming strategies is to show you which type of variable any one name represents. Pretty much every IDE worth its salt can define different styles (colors, fonts, font types, ...) to different variable types (instance member, static member, argument, local variable, ...) so letting the IDE tell you what type of variable it is actually frees you from having to type those (otherwise useless) pre- or suffixes every time. So my suggestion: use meaningful names without any prefix or suffix.
