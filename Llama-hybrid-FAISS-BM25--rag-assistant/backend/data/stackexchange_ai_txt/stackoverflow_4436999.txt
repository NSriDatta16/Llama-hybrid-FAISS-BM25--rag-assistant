How to swap keys and values in a Map elegantly

I already know how to do it the hard way and got it working - iterating over entries and swapping "manually". But i wonder if, like so many tasks, this one can be solved in a more elegant way. I have read this post , unfortunately it does not feature elegant solutions. I also have no possibility to use any fancy Guava BiMaps or anything outside the jdk (project stack is already defined). I can assume that my map is bijective, btw :)
