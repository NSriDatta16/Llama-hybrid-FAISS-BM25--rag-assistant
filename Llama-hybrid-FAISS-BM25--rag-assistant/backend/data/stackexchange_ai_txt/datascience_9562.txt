Using R and Python together

I'm new in this field and I started working with data by using R. Because of that, I find R much easier to approach a data project. However, apparently an employer wants you to know an object-oriented programing language (a language like Python). So it would be smart to think I can use Python just when I need to deal with a complex programming process, like replacing the na's in Titanic/kaggle project with the average based on name and to use R for anything else? So use them both interchangeably? Beside the fact that Python is more programming oriented I don't see why somebody would use it over R...
