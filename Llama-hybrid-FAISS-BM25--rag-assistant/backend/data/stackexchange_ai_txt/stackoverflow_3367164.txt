Ruby: Is there a more elegant way of doing this loop & array?

Okay, this code gives me exactly what I want but it seems that it could be cleaner, so here is the code: colour = ["red", "white", "orange", "black"] x=[] colour.each_with_index do |c, i| x[i] = " #{c} " end tags2 = x.join(", ") p "The code ==>#{tags2} Any takers?
