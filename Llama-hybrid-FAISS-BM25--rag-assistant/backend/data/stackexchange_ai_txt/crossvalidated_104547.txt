Also, for practical reasons, it is advantageous to center the data, for example, when training neural networks. The idea is that to train a neural network one needs to solve a non-convex optimization problem using some gradient based approach. The gradients are calculated by means of backpropagation. Now, these gradients depend on the inputs, and centering the data removes possible bias in the gradients. Concretely, a non-zero mean is reflected a in large eigenvalue which means that the gradients tend to be bigger in one direction than others (bias) thus slowing the convergence process, eventually leading to worse solutions.
