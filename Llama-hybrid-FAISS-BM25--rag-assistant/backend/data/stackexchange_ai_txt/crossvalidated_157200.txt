Rolling samples, choosing a number of observations

I want to estimate a forecasting equation for monthly data. I'm essentially trying to find out how to balance the stability of using a longer time series to estimate the equation versus the fact that the relationship is likely changing over time and older observations could be more of a hindrance than a help. Can anyone recommend a good paper on this or let me know how they proceed for this situation? Thanks
