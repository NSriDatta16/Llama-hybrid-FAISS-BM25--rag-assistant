There are a couple of common ways, depending on how you want to organize your code/projects: Place the class in a class library project and reference that project in your other projects. Place the class in a class library, compile it, reference the resulting DLL in your other projects. Copy the class file to another project. (This results in duplicating the class across projects, but there do exist situations that call for this.) Reference the project which contains the class in another project. (If the project being referenced is an application, this is unfavorable. It would work, but it's poor code organization.) (1) is my personal preference, I like to have many projects in my solutions which reference each other's code directly rather than referencing compiled DLLs. A lot of people prefer (2) for their own code, not wanting to keep so many projects open all over the place and rather deal with a one-time compiled DLL. It's a matter of personal preference.
