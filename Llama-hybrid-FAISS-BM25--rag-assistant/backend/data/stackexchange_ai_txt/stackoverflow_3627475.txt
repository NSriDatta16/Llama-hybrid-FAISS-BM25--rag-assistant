The answer is right in the link you cited. Configuring replication and database mirroring involves five steps. Each step is described in more detail in the following section. Configure the Publisher. Configure database mirroring. Configure the mirror to use the same Distributor as the principal. Configure replication agents for failover. Add the principal and mirror to Replication Monitor. Steps 1 and 2 can also be performed in the opposite order. [emphasis added]
