PHP - Read dynamically generated (and echoed) HTML into a string?

I have a file that pulls some information from the database and creates some relatively simple dynamic HTML. The file can then be used by DOMPDF to turn it into a PDF document. DOMDPF uses GET variables to achieve the basic implementation. ob_start(); include_once("report.php?id=1249642977"); require_once("dompdf/dompdf_config.inc.php"); $dompdf = new DOMPDF(); $dompdf->load_html(ob_get_contents()); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("sample.pdf", array('Attachment'=>'0')); ob_end_clean(); I thought I might be able to use something ilke that to achieve the aim but unsurprisingly it didn't work. So how can I read the HTML that gets output to the browser if you were to load the file directly, into a string for use with the DOMPDF class?
