WordPress: Using custom field to define posts to display in loop

I'm trying to use a custom field in which I input the post ID numbers of the posts I want to show, seperated by commas. For some reason though, only the first post of the series of the post IDs are displaying. Can someone help? The value of $nlPostIds is (minus the quotes): "1542,1534,1546". Here's the code... the most important part is the 4th line 'post__in' => array($nlPostIds) ID, 'nlPostIds', true); $args=array( 'post__in' => array($nlPostIds) ); query_posts($args); if ( $wp_query->have_posts() ) : while ( $wp_query->have_posts() ) : $wp_query->the_post(); ?> "> " rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to "> | | Posted in --> Thanks!
