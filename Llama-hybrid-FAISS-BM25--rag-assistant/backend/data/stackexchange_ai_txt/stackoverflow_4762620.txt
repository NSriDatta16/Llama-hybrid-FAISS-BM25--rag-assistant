Sending simple commands from Android through USB

I am a completely new at programming, and must get this task completed for a demonstration. I have a Samsung Captivate that I need to send simple messages to a device over USB. I'm not worried about having the droid act as host, not the issue here. I just need to find the proper code to access the USB functions in Android 2.1. I need to send simple on/off commands and audio level changes. It would seem to me that this shouldn't be that hard, as the droid will communicate with my laptop and act as a storage device, so I know the two can talk. Can anybody help me find these resources? I have been looking extensively, to no avail. Thanks! Bill
