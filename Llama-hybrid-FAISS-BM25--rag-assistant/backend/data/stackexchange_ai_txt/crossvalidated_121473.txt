First, your data are not categorical - you have ratings for musical genres and ratings on personality factors, both of which can be treated as continuous or perhaps ordinal, depending on how many levels each rating can have. The easy thing to do is to run a separate regression for each musical preference score with the personality scores as independent variables. If the music scores are something like 0 to 100, then you can use regular regression at least as a start; if they are 1 to 5, you should probably use ordinal logistic regression. A more difficult method (but one that may get you more of what you want) would be multivariate regression with all the music scores as DVs and all the personality scores as IVs. But you may not have enough data to get good estimates of all the parameters.
