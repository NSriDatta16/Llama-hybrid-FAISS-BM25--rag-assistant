MySQL VARCHAR fields store the contents, plus 2 bytes for length. So empty VARCHAR fields will use up space to mark their lengths. Also, if this is the only VARCHAR field in your table, and your storage engine is MyISAM, it would force dynamic row format which may yield a performance hit (testing will confirm). http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/column-count-limit.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/dynamic-format.html
