Does Sharepoint 2010 out of the box have rich right click context menus

All my googling returned only information related to how to add additional right click features. I swear somewhere I saw screenshots of MSS2010 being used where right clicking provided the menu to do various operations, versus having to use the ribbon, or worse that awful menu pictured here. I was expecting this to all be drag drop... :( I'm really disappointed with the lack of ajaxy-ness built into mss2010. I can't believe every save/apply reloads the whole page.
