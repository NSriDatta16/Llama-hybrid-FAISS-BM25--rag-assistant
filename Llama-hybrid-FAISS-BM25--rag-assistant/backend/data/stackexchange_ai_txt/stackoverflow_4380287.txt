Try multiple tables with links table_products id name table_product_sales id product_id quantity price_per transaction_time AS DATETIME SELECT table_product_sales.*, table_product.name FROM table_product JOIN table_product_sales ON table_product_sales.product_id = table_product.id GROUP BY DATE(transaction_time) Haven't tried it but will something like that work? That allows you to keep each transactions separate so you can query things like average number sold per sale, total sold per date, total sales each day, etc.
