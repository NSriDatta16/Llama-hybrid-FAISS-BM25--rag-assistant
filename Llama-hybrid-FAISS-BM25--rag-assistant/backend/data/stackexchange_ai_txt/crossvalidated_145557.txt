Is there a regression method (machine learning or otherwise) that gives ranges of expected values as opposed to one forecast?

say you are looking at a time period and you want get a max value that the function is expected to take on in the time frame along with the min value, or perhaps an even more detailed look at different percentiles of expected values (I say expected values because it would be even better if you knew the probability associated with each value), does such a regression exist that can accommodate this Would this all be done with a regression model such as linear regression then further analysis conducted using variance or std? I am a complete self taught novice at statistics, but am more than willing to read up on any links provided, and do not need to be spoon fed. Thanks in advance
