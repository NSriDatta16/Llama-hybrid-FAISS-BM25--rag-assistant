Relaxed parallel lines (proportional odds) assumption of ordered logistic regression in multilevel setting in Stata

I am desperately looking for a way to build a multilevel ordered regression for variables which showed to violate the proportional odds (parallel lines) assumption in a single level model variant. For single level model building I used the gologit2 package in Stata, which relaxes the assumptions. The author says there is no multilevel support for this package. I found a very old package called gllamm that looked promising. However, a) it is not suported anymore that leads to b) factor variables cannot be used. Does anyone know a package preferrably in Stata that can be used to solve my problem? If not Stata, maybe something in R? Thanks a lot!
