Correct way to calculate an average

If I have the cost and number of days for several trips to Italy and I want to calculate how much an average trip costs to Italy per day. So my data would look like this: Trip | Cost | Number of days 1 | 140 | 3 2 | 40 | 1 Would I do (total cost of all trips to Italy)/(total number of days in Italy), or would I take an average of all (cost of trip B)/(total number of days of trip B) ?
