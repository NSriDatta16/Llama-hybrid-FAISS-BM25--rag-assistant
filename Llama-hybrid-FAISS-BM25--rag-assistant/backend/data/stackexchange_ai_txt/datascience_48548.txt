What are some good books on Machine Learning and AI like Krugman, Wells and Graddy's "Essentials of Economics"

I am a Logistics student. I like the book "Essentials of Economics" by Krugman, Wells and Graddy in that it is concise, easygoing and not only a beginners book (it gradually approaches advanced subjects thus paving the way for further rigorous Economics course) so any one interested in Economics can learn it even if he/she never studied the subject before. Also, I am very interested in AI and Machine Learning and acknowledge their importance in this our postmodern era and I am self learning Real Analysis and web site development. What are some good introductory books on Machine Learning and AI like Krugman, Wells and Graddy's "Essentials of Economics"?
