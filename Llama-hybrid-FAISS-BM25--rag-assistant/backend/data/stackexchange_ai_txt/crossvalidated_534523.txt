Do the terms multi-task and multi-output refer to the same thing in the context of deep learning?

Do the terms multi-task and multi-output refer to the same thing in the context of deep learning (with neural networks)? For example, do neural networks for multi-task learning use multiple outputs? If not , what is the difference between them? It would be helpful if you can also give examples. When I went to study this term on the Internet, I found it very convoluted, as different authors are found to be mixing up those terms.
