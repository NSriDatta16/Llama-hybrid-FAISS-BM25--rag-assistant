What is the difference between "equivariant to translation" and "invariant to translation"

I'm having trouble understanding the difference between equivariant to translation and invariant to translation . In the book Deep Learning . MIT Press, 2016 (I. Goodfellow, A. Courville, and Y. Bengio), one can find on the convolutional networks: [...] the particular form of parameter sharing causes the layer to have a property called equivariance to translation [...] pooling helps to make the representation become approximately invariant to small translations of the input Is there any difference between them or are the terms interchangeably used?
