WPF Drag-and-Drop between ListBoxes in different UserControls

This is the structure of my application: Main Window has two ContentControls Each ContentControl has a UserControl Each UserControl has a ListBox So graphically speaking, the user is presented with a Window with two ListBoxes: one with products and the other a shopping cart. I want to enable drag-and-drop functionality among these two ListBoxes; i.e products can be dragged into the shopping cart. I have seen examples of drag-and-drop between ListBoxes on the same window. But is it possible to drag and drop between UserControls? I have looked at an example ; is there a simpler way? I came across a simple drag drop solution in Expression Blend; I tried searching for it, but in vain.
