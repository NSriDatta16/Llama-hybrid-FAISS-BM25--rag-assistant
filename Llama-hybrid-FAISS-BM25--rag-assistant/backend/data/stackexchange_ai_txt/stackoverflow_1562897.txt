Java Web Start window title problem

I've written a JavaFX application that uses Java Web Start. For some reason, the window title is always "Java" (on Linux) or blank (on Windows). However, the desktop icon has the correct application title and image. From what I've found so far, the important bit here is the information > title element in the JNLP file. What am I missing? NOTE: I'm happy to post my JNLP content if someone says it would be of use.
