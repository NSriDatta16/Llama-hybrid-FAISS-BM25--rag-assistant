In fact, there are some works related to using regularization on decision tree splitting. For example, in [1], the author proposes a cost function to penalize redundant features, and thus get a more succinct feature set. The experimental results reveal that it can effectively get a more concise feature subset without loss of accuracy. [1]. Deng H, Runger G.
