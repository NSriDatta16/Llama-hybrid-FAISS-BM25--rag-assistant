With strict reading RFC2616 does not allow fragments in Location header values, since they are not part of absolute URIs. However, with the IETF's HTTP rewrite draft this was fixed . Recently Julian put up a comparison how browsers handle URI fragments (that's what the HTML anchor tags deal with) in the Location header: http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/redirects.html So the answer ist: Yes, you can put fragments in Location header URIs.
