This article discusses browser support about mid-way in. Here's the most relevant bit, though the whole thing is worth a read: CSS3 (and even drafts of CSS2 in 1997 and 1998) have long promised a standardized way of font embedding, using the @font-face rule. What many folks probably donâ€™t know is that this rule is already supported in Opera 9.5, shipping versions of Safari for the Mac, Windows and iPhone OS, and is promised for Firefox 3.1., and well as IE6 and later. Sadly, while support for @font-face was hinted at for Opera 9.5 and Firefox 3.1 (see my comments at #4 below) this is in fact not the case sadly. There is a catch though. All the browsers other than IE support linking to TrueType font files. Microsoft supports only the proprietary EOT file format. EDIT: Including this update from Ric Tokyo 's answer. [Update 2] Opera 10, and Firefox 3.1 now support linking to TrueType and OpenType (but not EOT) in currently shipping alphas or betas.
