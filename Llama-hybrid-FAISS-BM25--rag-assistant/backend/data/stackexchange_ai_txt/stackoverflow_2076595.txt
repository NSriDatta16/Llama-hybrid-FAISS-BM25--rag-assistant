There was a plugin in 2004 introduced at IBM alphaworks , but removed since then. The closest one still active would be OLEJA - OLE for JAva (OLEJA) , another Java COM bridge based on OLE automation. Otherwise, you need to come up with your own wrapper (based on the JACOB project ), or, like SWT used by eclipse, look at MSA MicroSoft Active Accessibility , since leveraged by IBM with its IAccessible2 project .
