I believe this reference may help; note, in particular, that Although blocking operations on sockets are supported under Windows Sockets, their use is strongly discouraged. Programmers who are constrained to use blocking mode -- for example, as part of an existing application which is to be ported -- should be aware of the semantics of blocking operations in Windows Sockets. If you're fully aware of the zillion issues listed here , and find dealing with all of them preferable to designing your program to fit in well with Windows rather than being a half- beep ed port from Unix, go right ahead with a ioctlsocket call with the cmd argument set to FIONBIO and the third argument pointing to a longword worth 0. But, don't say you weren't warned;-).
