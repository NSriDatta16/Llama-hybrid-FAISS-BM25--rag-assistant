Nope. Think of it like this: if $diag(C)$ has sometimes positive, sometimes negative values, but always <> 0, it's $E(diag(C))$ can (let's imagine one such case) be equal to 0, when you do the averaging over all samples. But when you square $diag(C)$ - it's $E(diag^2(C))$ will always be >= 0, while $diag^2(D)$ will remain == 0. Hope that helped.
