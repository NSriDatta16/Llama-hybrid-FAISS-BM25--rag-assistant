I've seen a few approaches to this: Use string buffers to assemble the sql dynamically using PL/SQL or in your programming language. Use a framework such as IBATIS which let's you reuse and extend fragments of SQL that are stored in XML files. Using an ORM framework circumvents this issue by working with objects rather than directly with the SQL. Depending on your language and problem at hand using a framework may be the best approach and then extending it to do what you want it to do.
