I think it's a bad idea to do this. It will corrupt the data your users enter even before it hits the database. This approach will also encourage you to use lazy coding where you consistently don't escape data because you believe that all your data is already "clean". This will come back to bite you one day when you do need to output some unsafe characters and you either forget to escape them or you aren't really sure which function you need to call so you just try something and hope that it works. To do it properly you should ensure that magic quotes is disabled and only escape data when necessary, using precisely the correct escaping method - no more, no less.
