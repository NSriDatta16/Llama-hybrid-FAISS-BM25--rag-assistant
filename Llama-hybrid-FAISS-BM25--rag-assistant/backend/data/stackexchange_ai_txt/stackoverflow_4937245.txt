Why is javascript backwards compatible to a fault?

In Coders at work , Douglas Crockford discusses how bugs in browsers cause Javascript to be a complex, clunky language and fixing it is a catch-22. In Beginning JavaScript with DOM scripting and Ajax Christian Heilmann says something similar "[The] large variety of user agents, of different technical finesse [...] is a great danger to JavaScript." Why doesn't JS have a breaking new version? Is there something inherent n the language design where backwards compatibility becomes a must ? Update Why can't javascript run with multiple engines in parallel? Similar to how .NET runs versions 2, 3 and 4 on the same machine.
