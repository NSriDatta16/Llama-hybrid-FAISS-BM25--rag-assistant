I am a big fan of Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis . I have read Agresti's Intro book but found it missing key interpretations for how generalized linear model is built and how it works. For example, you may not need to know how the binomial distribution and logit link work if you only want to fit a logistic regression. However it is annoying when you have read the chapter and started to wonder about it but couldn't find it in the book. The McCullagh and Nelder GLM book is hard to read. It contains everything you need to know but lacks the derivation for the key results. Luckily Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis presents a good balance.
