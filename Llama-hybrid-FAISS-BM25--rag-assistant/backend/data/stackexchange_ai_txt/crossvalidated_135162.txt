Comparing data that has been recorded on two devices

I have two data loggers which are recording a physiological signal. Device A is a system that has been in place for many years, and records data ~once/minute. Device B is a prototype device which collects data ~40 times as often. The devices don't necessarily record synchronised data. Also, Device B does not record data on a regular time base. I was intending to compare the two recordings using a t-test, but a colleague pointed out that as the two devices are recording the same data they are not truly independent. However, as the data points were not collected simultaneously on both devices it's not possible to perform a paired t-test. Is there any other test that could be carried out to check the similarity of the two data sets? EDIT: I'm not necessarily interested in the fact that it is a time series. Looking at the distribution of values recorded can be enough. Edit2: The data is analysed in 2 different ways currently. A clinician will look at the trace itself, making conclusions simply by 'eyeballing' it. They will also look at a histogram of the values recorded.
