You can go as further or specific you want with this kind of data. I would suggest first to analyze the data thoroughly before deciding which algorithms to apply. Evaluate the mean, quartiles, max and min of each parameter (such as in a box plot), verify if you have missing values and in that case decide a way of dealing with that (removing data, imputating - predicting missing value from data - or average, as common techniques). Also verify if is possible to create a new representative feature from the information you have, or even mix a set of features to reduce (a priori feature selection; just ok if it makes a lot of sense from your knowledge on the context - NBA). For example, a player position can be considerably representative, in the sense of giving context to data (e.g. it will come up that defensive players steal more balls than attacking players but score less). Afterwards I would suggest some simple algorithms such as: Hierarchical clustering : can help you to build a genealogy of players, so you see which ones cluster together directly and which others influence this cluster (so they are similar in certain more general aspects but not so much so to be clustered together). K-Means : Well, its always good to try it; it won't be that expensive in computational terms. The thing is that determining K will be rather complicated, but it can give you hints from a Visualization point of view, while not actually helping directly the task of information retrieval. K-Nearest-Neighbors : Also determining K is complex (but not that much) it can give a first hint for retrieving similar players based on their distance in the space. This is a form of case-based reasoning, but actually is quite practical for your purposes. The key thing here is determining the right distance measure. Start with Euclidean as a typical approach. Then you can try some other distance measures such as the Malahanobis Distance, which takes into account the covariance of features. You can have a first glance and even a functional solution following these approaches. Once observing the results you can get deeper (if necessary). Remember to normalize or standarize the data previously. You could also visualize the first principal components after applying PCA or LDA (this last if you have a target variable) so to observe how well the data distributes. The same methods can be applied after refining the data through feature selection and/or extraction techniques; which in some cases produces very interesting results.
