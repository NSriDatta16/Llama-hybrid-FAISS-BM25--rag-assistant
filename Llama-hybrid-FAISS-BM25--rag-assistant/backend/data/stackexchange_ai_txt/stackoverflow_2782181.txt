If you have a javascript error in your page, you will see these do not always get removed by the sizzle engine. For instance, if you put a reference to a method/function in the window opener pages javascript function, and you did not open the page from that opener, you will see these. for instance in this code, the opener is not present: if (self.opener.panelNotes) { self.opener.__doPostBack("panelNotes", ""); }; because I directly opened the window, and it was not opened by another window so no opener exists.
