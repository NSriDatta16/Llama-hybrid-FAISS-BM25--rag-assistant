It all depends on how the project is organized. Some ideas off the top of my head: Look for the core / domain knowledge : See if domain knowledge is isolated and start from understanding it. See how the code is split into projects, modules (e.g. jars) and packages. If there is at least some organization, look for the "core" and start learning from there. Look for other traces of this knowledge: diagrams, tests, documents, samples. Try running the application . Analyze what happens from the entry points down. Learn the basic architecture . Look for the familiar ground (frameworks and solutions you know) and see how it is used.
