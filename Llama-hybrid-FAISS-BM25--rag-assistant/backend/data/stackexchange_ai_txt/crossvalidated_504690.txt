Including knowledge about structural breaks in forecast

I have a timeseries, where I know the volume will be about 20% lower in the future (because of a sudden policy change). I want my time series model (ETS) to pick up this change reliably, but I'm not sure how to structure this problem. I've thought about including a covariate (which is 1 before the break and 0.8 after) or just shrinking the forecasts to 80%, but I doubt, that these are useful solutions. What other useful approaches would be possible?
