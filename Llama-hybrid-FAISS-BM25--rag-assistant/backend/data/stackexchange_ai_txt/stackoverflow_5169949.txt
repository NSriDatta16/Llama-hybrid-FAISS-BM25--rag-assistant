EDIT1: id -> class give each option the class of the number it is 15 16 etc. Then jquery can remove() an item by class $('.15').remove(); obviously have to do an on change and get the value just set. "remove()" is nice in this instance because I believe it will yank every instance of that class. EDIT3: upon further consideration the above method would be further complicated by the need to not remove the "selected" option. Not going to figure out the exact method but I think changing the class from "15" to "selected15" with a $(this).append() or something of the sort before calling the remove would get the job done fairly safely. EDIT2: As noted by casblanca below this is not an ideal user interface at all for this type of input. You may want to look into this: http://www.utdallas.edu/~jrb048000/ListReorder/ Allows user to drag and drop items in a list to reorder them. Much more natural.
