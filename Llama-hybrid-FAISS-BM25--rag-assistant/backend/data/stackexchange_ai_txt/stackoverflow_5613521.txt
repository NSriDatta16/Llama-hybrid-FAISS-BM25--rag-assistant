displaying message from console application

How do I pop up message in window from java console application?If I use JOptionPane , then I need to pass component which is visible.But if I want to show some warning or error from console application(which does not have any window visible), Then I cant use JOptionPane. Also I want the displayed message to be shown on top of any other application(To get the attention of user ). Thanks in advance.
