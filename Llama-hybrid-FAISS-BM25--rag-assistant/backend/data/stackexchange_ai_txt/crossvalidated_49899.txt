Comparing change in average in two groups: Z-test?

I'm about to start up a project (as a high school teacher) that involves comparing the change in average between two different groups. It's an experiment, and the setup is the following: Obtain a population of respondents, Have each respondent answer a questionnaire that scores them on an index, Divide the respondents randomly into two groups, Subject them to different information, Let them answer the questionnaire again and see if there is any difference in the change between the two groups. I'm thinking of using the z-test to compare the averages, but I'm not sure exactly how. Any ideas or other suggestions are welcome! Cheers EDIT: The statistical approach needs to be as simple as possible, as it's for high school students. The z-test looks implementable in Excel, that's part of the reason why I like that for this study. There are probably numerous issues with that approach - but think along the lines of the weightless ropes and frictionless surfaces often used in high school physics ;-)
