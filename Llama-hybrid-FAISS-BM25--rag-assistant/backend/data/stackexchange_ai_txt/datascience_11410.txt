Noisy behavior in deep learning feed-forward net

I am a bit unsure about optimizing a neural net with 3 or more layers. The input data is quite noisy and I seem to project the noise into the learning (strong bias in the data, 90% belong to one class out of five). However, I would like to get some feedback on the interpretation (I use 50/25/8/8/8neurons with dropout (keep_prob=0,9 after first hidden layer):
