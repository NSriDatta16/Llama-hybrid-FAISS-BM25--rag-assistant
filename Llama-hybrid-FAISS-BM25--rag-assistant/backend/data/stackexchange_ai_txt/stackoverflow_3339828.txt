Is it possible to run GTK+ apps without GNOME, or the likes?

I was wondering if this was possible. Mostly I want to understand what GNOME does exactly? Couldn't one just run applications, given the availability of GTK+, and of course X11? Of course, I'm not sure (which is why I'm asking the question), but it looks to me that GNOME just "organizes" the GUI to make it more of a desktop, and offers some tools and utilities and such. Is this correct or is there something more to it? Thanks!
