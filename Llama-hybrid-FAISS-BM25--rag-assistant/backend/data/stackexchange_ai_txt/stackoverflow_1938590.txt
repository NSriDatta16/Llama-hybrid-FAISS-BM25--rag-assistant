That specific error code from the GLSL compiler in the Nvidia driver means that it couldn't find a function called 'main' in your shader (either vertex or fragment in this case) The most common reason for this is that you're not actually getting the program in to the driver when you think you are -- either the string you are passing in has not been initialized, or you're passing in a length of 0, and you're not actually compiling anything. Edit My best guess is there's something subtly wrong with the glCreateShader or glSetShaderSource calls. Much of the time, errors only show up when you try to link the shaders (rather than compile), as that's the first time the driver knows it has complete shaders and not just partial, incomplete shaders that need another shader linked in to be complete.
