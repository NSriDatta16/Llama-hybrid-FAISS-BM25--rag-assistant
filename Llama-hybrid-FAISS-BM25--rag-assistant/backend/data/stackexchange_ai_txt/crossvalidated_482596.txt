Short answer: you can't report results on data you don't have a ground truth for. You can obviously report the predictions for this data, but you cannot say if they are right or wrong. Training on the Test set is a bad idea, this data should be reserved for a final evaluation at the end (You may want to look into Train / Validate / Test split if you are doing any hyperparameter tuning). -- However -- Your unlabeled data can still be useful. If you want to take advantage of it, you should investigate self-supervised pretraining. The actual implementation will depend on your application, but the general idea of it is: Use a self-supervised model which does not require labels. The model type will depend on your application, but for inspiration I would look into Autoencoders, Word2Vec. All or part of the model used in step 1 can now be used as a component of your classification model. The idea is that the self-supervised model will have learnt useful features which can aid with classification.
