You're not going wrong. It simply isn't possible to construct a confidence interval for a binomial proportion which always has coverage of exactly 95% due to the discrete nature of the outcome. The Clopper-Pearson ('exact') interval is guaranteed to have coverage of at least 95%. Other intervals have coverage closer to 95% on average , when averaged over the true proportion. I tend to favour the Jeffreys interval myself, as it has coverage close to 95% on average and (unlike the Wilson score interval) approximately equal coverage in both tails. With only a small change in the code in the question, we can compute the exact coverage without simulation. p This yields the following output. > coverage.pr [1] 0.9508569 > coverage.cp [1] 0.9546087
