How to apply MultiOutputClassifier to a dataset for Naive-Bayes algorithm

I have a dataset which is as follows, (it's taken from an article online and I have been trying to Naive Bayesian algorithm on it) Original Dataset y attribute After having done some manipulations (following the article), these are my new datasets for training and testing, X Train y Train Now, it contains a multilabel and I have been asked to look at Multioutput classification for the problem. I have been trying to understand this classification and tried to implement it myself too, but I couldn't get it to done. First of all, I tried following this sample code given on the website, from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.utils import shuffle import numpy as np X, y1 = make_classification(n_samples=10, n_features=100, n_informative=30, n_classes=3, random_state=1) y2 = shuffle(y1, random_state=1) y3 = shuffle(y1, random_state=2) Y = np.vstack((y1, y2, y3)).T n_samples, n_features = X.shape # 10,100 n_outputs = Y.shape[1] # 3 n_classes = 3 forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=1) multi_target_forest = MultiOutputClassifier(forest, n_jobs=-1) multi_target_forest.fit(X, Y).predict(X) But, since, I am new to all this, I didn't understand anything at all.. I didn't understand why he did the make_classification call, and then shuffled the data and etc. I tried to implement it on my y_train variable and then placed it in my model.fit for Naive-Baysen algorithm, from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB model = GaussianNB() Yt = np.vstack(y_train).T n_samples, n_features = X_train.shape # 10,100 n_outputs = Yt.shape[1] # 3 n_classes = 3 forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=1) multi_target_forest = MultiOutputClassifier(forest, n_jobs=-1) model.fit(X_train, multi_target_forest) But it gave the same error which I was receiving previously, which meant that I didn't do the multioutputclassification properly, ValueError: y should be a 1d array, got an array of shape () instead. Can anyone help me in telling how to actually implement this classification, so that the Y variable can be used for the Naive Baysen?
