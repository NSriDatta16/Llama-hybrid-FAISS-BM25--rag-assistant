Transferring percentage scores to raw scores

I have a question ranging from 1 to 5. I have 10 subjects, 6 persons select 4 and 4 persons select 5, So the average question is 4.4. If I calculate percentage for response modes ( 1 to 5), I get the following result 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 60 40 How I can get the values of 4.4 based on these percentages. Is that possible? Thank you for your help
