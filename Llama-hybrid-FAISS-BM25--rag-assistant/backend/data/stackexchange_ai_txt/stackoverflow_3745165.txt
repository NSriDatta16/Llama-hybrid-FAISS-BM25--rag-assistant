SELECT page, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, MIN(date), MAX(date)) / (COUNT(*)-1) FROM hits WHERE agent like '%Googlebot%' GROUP BY page; TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, a, b) returns the difference in seconds between the date expressions a and b. For each page, the query finds the date of the first and last visit and the total count of visits, and calculates the arithmetic average.
