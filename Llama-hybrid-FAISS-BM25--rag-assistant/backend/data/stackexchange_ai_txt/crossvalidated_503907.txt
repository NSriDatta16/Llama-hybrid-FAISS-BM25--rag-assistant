How to use Hyperopt or perform hyperparamter tuning on a GAN?

I am creating a Generative Adversarial Network, and I want to run Hyperopt on the GAN. However, I am confused about how to do this in Python in Keras because the GAN is essentially 2 models, with the output of one model, going into the next model. Any other method to run Bayesian Optimization or performing HP tuning on a GAN would be helpful.
