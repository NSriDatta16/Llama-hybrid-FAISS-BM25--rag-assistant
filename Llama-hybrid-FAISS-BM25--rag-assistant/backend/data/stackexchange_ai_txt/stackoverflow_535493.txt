We're using Crowd with about 80 users and expect that number to climb into the hundred when we roll it out for client access. Crowd is important to us because it allows us to integrate Jira and Confluence (the Atlassian wiki) with SSO, which is critical. Crowd works well for us but it does have some quirks. We are using it to draw authentications from Active Directory. There are some things that are a little inelegant. We need to do some more digging to troubleshoot those. But that aside, Crowd is a big win for us, for these two reasons: SSO across Atlassian apps Ability to have our internal users drawn from Active Directory, and add clients directly to Crowd and not bog down AD We're very happy with all the Atlassian tools.
