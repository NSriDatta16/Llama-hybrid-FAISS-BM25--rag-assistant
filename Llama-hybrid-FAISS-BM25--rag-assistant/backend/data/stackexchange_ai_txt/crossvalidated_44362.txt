Did you instruct regsubsets to do a forward selection? The default is "exhaustive", I believe. In any case, the collinearities will still cause trouble. Any time regsubsets considers a collection of variables that are too collinear (i.e. the design matrix is practically singular), it will fail. "Best subset" methods can be unstable with multiple regression, especially when there are a lot of variables. You might want to try a random forest approach.
