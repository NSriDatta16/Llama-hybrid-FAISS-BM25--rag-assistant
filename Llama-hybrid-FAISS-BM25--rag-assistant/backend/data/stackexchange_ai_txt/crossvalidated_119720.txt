At least in R, only two algorithms provide the probabilities in LiblineaR interface. Here is the FAQ of the actual library: Q: How do I choose the solver? Should I use logistic regression or linear SVM? How about L1/L2 regularization? Generally we recommend linear SVM as its training is faster and the accuracy is competitive. However, if you would like to have probability outputs, you may consider logistic regression. Moreover, try L2 regularization first unless you need a sparse model. For most cases, L1 regularization does not give higher accuracy but may be slightly slower in training. Among L2-regularized SVM solvers, try the default one (L2-loss SVC dual) first. If it is too slow, use the option -s 2 to solve the primal problem. It seems the svm algorithms don't provide probabilities as output.
