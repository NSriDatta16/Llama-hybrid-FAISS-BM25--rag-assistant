Color is a bad idea as (a) its very easy for a computer to detect; (b) very hard for some humans — the color blind — to detect. Even if you're OK with denying access to the disabled, you'd have to worry about different monitors, systems, lighting conditions, etc. giving rise to different color perceptions. How hard do you think it is for a computer to compare the red component and blue component in a pixel (or averaged over several pixels)? Trivial. So this isn't a problem for a computer. Similarly, it isn't that hard to program the difference between a square and a circle. One has strait lines, one doesn't!
