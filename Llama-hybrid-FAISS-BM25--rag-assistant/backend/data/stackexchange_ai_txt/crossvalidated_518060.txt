@whuber is right - plants need a pH above 4.6 to grow, so this "toy" data set appears to contain implausible pH values for some of the plants. It's disappointing to see the book author didn't pay closer attention to this. It also makes it harder for you to learn statistical modelling when relying on an implausible dataset. The dataset you are using is also not ideal for learning how to formulate linear regression models because it contains "pre" and "post" observations on plant height from the same tomato plant. We can expect these observations to be related for each plant, rather than independent. Linear regression modelling relies on the assumption of independence of observations (i.e., knowing something about one observation will tell you nothing about the other observations), which will clearly be invalidated in the type of model you are trying to formulate. With these two caveats in place - implausible pH values and within-plant dependence of heights - you can still formulate a linear regression model just so that you learn how to formulate it (though meaning of model results would be suspect). In practice, if the data were plausible, you would need to correct the standard errors reported for each regression coefficient so they account for the grouping of height values by plant. This would allow you to report cluster-robust standard errors (where "cluster" refers to "plant"). Models you can fit include: $height_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 period_{ij} + \beta_2 pH_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$ $height_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 period_{ij} + \beta_2 pH_{ij} + \beta_3 period_{ij} * pH_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$ Here, the index $i$ denotes the plant and the index $j$ denotes the time period for each plant. So $i$ runs from 1 to 20 and $j$ runs from 1 to 2. The star symbol denotes multiplication. Both of these models, if you fit them using standard software, assume independence of height observations both within and across plants (something we know does NOT happen here, where we likely have dependence of height observations within plants). For example, in R, you can fit these two models with the commands: model1 and summarize them with the commands: summary(model1) summary(model2) The first model postulates that the relationship between plant height and pH is the same in each of the two periods. The second model postulates that the relationship between plant height and pH is different across periods. Neither of these two models gets at what you want, which is to compare plant heights across periods within plants. For that, you can expand on these models by including a random effect of plant . The models would become linear mixed effects regression models rather than just linear regression models .
