Best way to organize a complex iPhone project file structure?

When working on an iPhone project, it can get really messy and many files are created (libraries, view controllers, interfaces...) What's the best way to organize your project files? What group structure do you use? Should I follow the MVC paradigm into groups? Thanks!
