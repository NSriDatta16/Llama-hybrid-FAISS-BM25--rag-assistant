Chapter 2.6 of the EJB3 specs: To support web service interoperability, the EJB speciﬁcation requires compliant implementations to support XML-based web service invocations using WSDL and SOAP or plain XML over HTTP incon- formance with the requirements of the JAX-WS[32], JAX-RPC[25], Web Services for JavaEE[31], and Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform [30] speciﬁcations. In other words: EJB3 can be exposed only as SOAP web service.
