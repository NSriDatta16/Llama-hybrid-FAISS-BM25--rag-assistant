It is possible to use native-sql and to use stored procedure for querying (with limiations/rules ). But, as written in the documentation: Stored procedures currently only return scalars and entities. and are not supported. So if you want to work with non-managed entities (i.e. not scalars in an Object[] ), you'll have to apply a ResultTransformer in the code. But at the end, if you want to hide the database to developers, if you don't want to map objects to tables, if you don't want to work with associations, if you don't want to use HQL, if you don't want to use an OO approach, then I really wonder why you want to use Hibernate. You'd better use raw JDBC (with Spring for example) or maybe a data-mapper like iBATIS.
