From your description, I've made a couple of assumptions, but here is how I would handle it: interfaceMouse() determines what needs to occur from the mouse interaction, but does not process that actual interaction (or, processes the interaction but wants to explicitly return what was done). What I would do is have interfaceMouse() return a struct defined similar to: struct { int event_type; /* Enumerated type */ void* element; /* Pointer to the element, however it's defined in the code */ void* event_data; /* Pointer to the data about the event */ } event_result; You can define the calls by accessing the element based on type (say, another struct with function pointers, or have event_data hold the function pointer and element be passed to it, etc.). C is one of those languages where it requires a lot more thought of your data modeling, but can end up being as elegant or convoluted as you'd like.
