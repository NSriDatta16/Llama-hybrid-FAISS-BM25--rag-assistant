All three layers are needed, for multiple reasons: IP does not always run over ethernet (imagine IP over RS-232 serial, something every Cisco and Unix box can do) IP does not checksum the data TCP packets can be reassembled incorrectly from IP packets and fragments that each have perfect checksums Even if reassembled correctly, software or other errors could be introduced in the layers between IP and TCP Even if all software functions correctly, and TCP/IP is over ethernet, the limited size of the checksums can be accidently correct (and will be at some point, given enough packets) in the face of persistent errors, so having more than one checksum is helpful. Every time a new header is introduced there is more to checksum, and the new layer can't see the header bits of the layer below.
