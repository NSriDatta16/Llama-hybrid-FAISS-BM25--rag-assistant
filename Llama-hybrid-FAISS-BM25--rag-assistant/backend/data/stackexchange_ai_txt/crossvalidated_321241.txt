How to conduct significance testing for percent outcome based on summary statistics only?

I have three groups A, B, and C, with corresponding sample size. I have gender variable as a binary variable, with M vs. F. For each group, it's summarized into "percentage woman". I only have the following summary statistics: Group A Group B Group C N 1000 1020 100 Percentage woman 57% 20% 40% Based only on this information, is it possible to conduct significance test to see if the "percentage women" is statistically different between the three groups. My understanding is ANOVA is not a good test since it's dealing with percentage, and I can't conduct the supposed logistic regression since I don't have the raw data. I wonder if this is the case for beta-regression? Also, I am wondering if I can re-calculate the figures into count of M and count of F for each group, and then perform a chi-squared test?
