Building an autoencoder in Tensorflow to surpass PCA

Hinton and Salakhutdinov in Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks, Science 2006 proposed a non-linear PCA through the use of a deep autoencoder. I have tried to build and train a PCA autoencoder with Tensorflow several times but I have never been able to obtain better result than linear PCA. How can I efficiently train an autoencoder? (Later edit by @amoeba: the original version of this question contained Python Tensorflow code that did not work correctly. One can find it in the edit history.)
