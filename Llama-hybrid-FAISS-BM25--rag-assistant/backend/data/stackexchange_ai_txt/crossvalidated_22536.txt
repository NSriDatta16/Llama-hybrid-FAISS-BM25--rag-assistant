If the points are truly uniformly distributed, i.e. in a fixed known pattern, then for any distance d, you can simply loop over all pairs and count the ones within the distance. Your probability is (that number / n). If you have the additional freedom to pick how the n points are distributed/picked, then this is the rectangular version of the Bertrand paradox . That page shows a number of ways of answering this question based on how you distribute your points.
