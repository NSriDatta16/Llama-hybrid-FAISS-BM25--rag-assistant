Modelling probability over window of a time series

I have a binary time series $ [A, B, B, A, A, A, B, B, A, B, A, B, A] $ I am trying to answer questions like: - What is the probability of B occurring if previous day was A? - What is the probability of B occurring if there were two A in previous 3 days? In general what is the probability of B occurring if there were $m$ number of A in a window of previous $n$ days. While I understand that the forum requires the question poster to demonstrate what have they attempted, in this case, I don't even know how to approach the problem.
