Learning curve - train error increases test error decreases

I get a learning curve as below Y - R2 what does it mean? Do I need to just add data? Or the problem in algoritm? The dataset has 1 000 rows and 10 categorical and 3 numeric variables. I used xgboost Strategy of cross validation ShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=0.20)
