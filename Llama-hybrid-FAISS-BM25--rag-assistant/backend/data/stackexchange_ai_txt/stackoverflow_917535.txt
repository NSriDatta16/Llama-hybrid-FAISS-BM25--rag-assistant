should embedding video in home page slow down the page?

If I embed a video demonstrating my application in my home page, will it slow down the page to a considerable amount? I tried, and checked that it takes almost 1 sec, to load the preview of the video. And as the video stream will not be downloaded until, the video is clicked, the total video do not have to get downloaded. Is it recommended to embed a video in the home page? Or should I just keep it in a different page and put a link in the home page.
