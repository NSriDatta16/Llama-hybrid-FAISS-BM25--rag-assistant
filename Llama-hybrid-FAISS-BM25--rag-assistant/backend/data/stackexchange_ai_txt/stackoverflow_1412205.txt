Why does Visual Studio say "Code Coverage is not enabled for this test run" when it's enabled?

In Visual Studio, I just created a simple Unit Test to test a method I wrote. I wanted to check the code coverage, but the Code Coverage window only ever states that "Code Coverage is not enabled for this test run". Why? Note: I've already followed the instructions on this page , i.e. the test configuration does have the relevant assemblies checked on the Code Coverage options page. I've clicked "Run test", not "Debug test", which some sources claim causes this. I've tried running the test with the current build configuration set to either "Debug" or "Release"; neither works. I've also followed the suggestions on this page (re-select the testrunconfig file by selecting Test => Select Active Test Run Configuration), to no avail. Yet I still get the message "Code Coverage is not enabled for this test run" every time I run the relevant test. How do I enable Code Coverage once and for all?
