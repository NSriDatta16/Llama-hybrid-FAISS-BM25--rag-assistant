May we categorize independent varibles per outcomes of dependent variables in logistic regression?

The question is rather theoretical than practical. Suppose, we want to evaluate one's chances of non-paying back a loan. We assume, that these chances depend on some set of covariates. One of the covariates is first two digits of ZIP code, let's call it zip2. We have a set of observations (loans) for some period of time, where for each loan we observe target variable y = 1, if loan is paid back, and y = 0 otherwise. Also, we have values of independent variable x = zip2. Let's say that # of observation is satisfactory, for example, 2000. Now, we are building a logit model in order to be able to predict the chances for the incoming loans to be (or not to be) paid back. Suppose, we run some software package, like R or Stata to estimate the model with our dataset. In the result we see, that our independent variable zip2 is not significant in the model. Then, we try to analyze our dataset more closely. We see that percentage of "bad" outcomes for zip2 = "11" and zip2 = "73" is virtually the same, say 15%. So, we decide to make one category out of these 2. We also examine the other values of the independent variables, and categorize them in a similar fashion, so, in total, we end up with 6-7 categories. Now, when we run estimation for the model with "categorized" variable zip2, we see that it becomes significant! So, my question is: Is this correct to do such categorization? I mean, we group independent variable by outcomes of dependent variable, and then we try to predict the outcome. It seems like a vicious circle, and I feel that it is not correct at all. This example is taken from a real situation, existing in a risk department of one company. If this is wrong, I just want to point out that such approach to model building is not acceptable and they're simply making wrong decisions. I already consulted a professor in statistics, and he said that this was wrong to group independent variables with respect to outcomes of dependent variable. But, I want to find some theoretical proofs, why such grouping is wrong. Is there any book or article, which explains inconsistency of such approach? Or, maybe it is consistent?
