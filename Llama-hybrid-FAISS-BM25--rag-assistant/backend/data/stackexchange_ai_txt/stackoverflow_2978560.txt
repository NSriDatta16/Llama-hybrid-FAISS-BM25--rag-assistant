"After I get the data in a variable" - unless this variable is holding a string, which it probably isn't, it's not really JSON at that point - your question is a bit vague. JSON is an encoded form of data, usually used for sending information over a network or for storage on disk. It's a way to serialize information. It could be used as the backend storage for a small "database". This kinda depends on your definition of "database" - if you're thinking generic relational database, yes, it can, inefficiently. Your post however, makes it sound like you got some data and loaded it into a variable, which isn't really "using JSON as a database".
