I think you are trying to see which original (not PCA) features contribute to which cluster users fall into, yes? First, be aware that you just reduced the dimensionality of a 5d dataset down to 2d. You need to be careful of how much variance of the data you just threw away by projecting it into 2d. You can easily calculate this . If your 2d features account for 95% of the variance of the data, then great! You've got some valid insights about which features are important. If lower, like say 40%, then not so much. (From a qualitative standpoint, just plot the clusters with different colors. That will give you some idea of how much variance you threw away - if the clusters look contiguous and not a lot of mixing, then qualitatively, you didn't throw away too much variance.) Second, realize that in order to intuit on which original feature values contribute to which clusters, you'll need to use the original features. The real answer to your question is that after that you should 1) cluster in 5d, 2) use a classifier, and 3) see the important features using 5d feature vectors. This is critical because in 2d, just because you might have kept most of the variance doesn't mean that last bit might have contained very discriminatory (read: important) information that might improve your underlying clustering error and give you a much more accurate answer. Most importantly, the feature importance will be computed on the actual features, not the PCA linear-combination features which don't translate directly to single site visit histories. Hope that helps.
