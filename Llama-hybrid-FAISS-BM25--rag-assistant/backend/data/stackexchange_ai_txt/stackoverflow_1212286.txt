IMHO I would go with your 2nd data model. (A row per day of data) Breaking up the data into separate columns makes more sense and will allow you to do better data validation, indexing, efficiency, etc. This looks like a good situation to use partitioning based on a date, where you can roll partitions off the back of your main data table and store them either in lower cost storage or export them to a file as Italy suggested. This should keep your table at a manageable size and allow for better query performance. I recommend reading up on the different storage engine options you have for MySQL as their implementation aspects can change the performance greatly depending on the throughput you need.
