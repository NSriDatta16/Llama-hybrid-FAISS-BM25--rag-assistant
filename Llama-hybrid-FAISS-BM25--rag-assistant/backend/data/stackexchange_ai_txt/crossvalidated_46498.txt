One difference I noted was that PCA can only give you either the term-term or Document-Document similarity (depending on how you multiplied the coreference matrix $AA^*$ or $A^*A$) but SVD/LSA can deliver both since you have eigenvectors of both $AA^*$ and $A^*A$. Actually I don't see a reason to use PCA ever over SVD.
