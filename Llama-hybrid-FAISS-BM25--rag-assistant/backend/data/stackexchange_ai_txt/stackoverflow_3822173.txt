Ajax reorder list not dragable

I have the same problem as Simon in this post . He found out some sort of a solution, but it does not work for me. Please, could someone explain me what is going on in this answer or advice me something else. PS: there is an example on the asp.net site which doesn't work exactly the same way as my reorder list... (click view a demo) The solution that is suggested here adds these few lines to web.config: Perhaps I just need to change something to make it work... but I don't know what. For example I have no idea what the ScriptResource.axd is supposed to be. My code: .aspx file &raquo; LinkButton " />' style="cursor:move; width:35px;" /> ' ValidationGroup="add" /> ' ValidationGroup="edit" /> ' ValidationGroup="edit" /> ' ValidationGroup="edit" /> LinkButton and the code behind using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.UI; using System.Web.UI.WebControls; using System.IO; namespace WebPageEditor.editor { public class MenuSourceManager { public static List menuItems; #region DataBindMethods //[System.ComponentModel.DataObjectMethod(System.ComponentModel.DataObjectMethodType.Select)] public List SelectMenu() { return menuItems; } public void UpdateMenu(int ID, string name, string url, int order) { menuItems[ID].Name = name; menuItems[ID].Url = url; menuItems[ID].Order = order; } public void InsertMenu(string name, string url, int order) { menuItems.Add(new MenuItem(name, url, order, menuItems.Count)); } public void DeleteMenu(int ID) { menuItems.RemoveAt(ID); } #endregion } public class MenuItem { public MenuItem(string name, string url, int order, int ID) { Name = name; Url = url; Order = order; this.ID = ID; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Url { get; set; } public int Order { get; set; } public int ID { get; set; } } } I load the data to the List collection from the page_load event but that works fine. The data binding works as well. The problem is in that the items cannot be reordered -- during the reordering, the sort value doesn't change and the list doesn't update.
