Site Owner not able to move or copy Pages between two subsites?

I have users in the Site Owners group of a root site, trying to copy (or move) pages between Pages Libraries in two subwebs. The permissions of the subwebs are inherited from the parent, with no changes, so the Site Owners of the root are the Site Owners of the subwebs as well. When a member of the owners group tries to move or copy a page, it fails. 12-Hive logs show an Access Denied error being thrown. Is there any way to allow this to happen without giving these users Site Collection Admin access? EDIT: This is via the Manage Site Content link in the Site Actions, on a Publishing Site. Copy/Paste or drag/drop between two explorer windows works correctly.
