Why use ln-ln plot in proportional hazard test?

I recently began studying survival analysis and there is something I am curious about. Why do we prefer to use the ln-ln survival curve rather than the survival curve in a proportional hazard test? As you know, the $\hat{S}$ we use in ln-ln formula is the survival function based on Kaplan-Meier curves, so why we don't use the untransformed KM survival function?
