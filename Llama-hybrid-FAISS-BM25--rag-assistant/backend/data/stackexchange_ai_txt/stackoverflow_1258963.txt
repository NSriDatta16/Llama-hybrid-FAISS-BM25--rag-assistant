SQL: SELECT n% with pictures, (100-n)% without pictures

we have a DB which stores users who may have pictures. I am looking for an elegant way in SQL to get the following results: Select n users. Of those n users e.g. 60% should have an associated picture and 40% should not have a picture. If there are less than 60% users having a picture the result should be filled up with users wihtout an image. Is there some elegant way in SQL without firing multiple SELECTs to the DB? Thank you very much.
