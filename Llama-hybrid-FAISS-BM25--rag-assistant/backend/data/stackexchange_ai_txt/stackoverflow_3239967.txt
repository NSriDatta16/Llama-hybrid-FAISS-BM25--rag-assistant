You can count the contents of the variables using an expression like this: count($var1 | $var2 | $var3 | ...) That's assuming each of your variables is a possibly-empty set. If your variables are true/false values instead then you can take advantage of the fact that false is 0 and true is 1 in XSL (at least with the interpreter I'm using): $var1 + $var2 + $var3 + ... If the values aren't node sets and aren't booleans either, convert them to booleans first: boolean($var1) + boolean($var2) + boolean($var3) + ... Not really a very elegant way of handling it but it works. According to the XPath spec , booleans are indeed supposed to behave this way when cast to numerics. Good to know!
