There is no elbow in this plot. This drop-off is the expected behavior from random data, and clearly indicates that k-means completely failed on this data . I'd at least try without PCA, because you have much too few observations to do a stable PCA with so many dimensions. Recommendations range from n>3p to n>3pÂ², much more if you have redundancies in your data or even binary attributes. Most likely, PCA also worked very poor.
