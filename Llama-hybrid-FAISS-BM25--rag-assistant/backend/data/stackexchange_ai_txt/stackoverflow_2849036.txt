Configure JBOss cache to run on JBoss server 4.2.3.GA

Our commercial application used to run on different application server and letely we started adjust it to run on JBoss server. The problem is that that application runs JBoss cache and as part of the integration with this framework, the web-inf\lib contains the follwing jars: jboss-aop.jar, jbosscache-core.jar, jboss-common.jar, jboss-common-core.jar, jboss-j2ee.jar, jboss-jmx.jar, jboss-logging-spi.jar This causes a problem to use JNDI through the application because the jboss-common-core.jar contain naming package that cause JBoss JNDI to work incorrect. So I need to find a way to organise my jars that on one hand jboss cache will keep working and on the other hand not to interfere to the work of JNDI Perhaps it include moving the some or all those jars from the web-inf\lib to the /server/default/lib Looking for someone who is familiar in this subject (continue of this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2847375/problem-configure-jboss-to-work-with-jndi3 )
