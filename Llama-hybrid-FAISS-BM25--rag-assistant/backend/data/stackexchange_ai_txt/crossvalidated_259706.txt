I tried to replicate your results and here is what happened. I think I guessed the mixture distribution almost correctly: $$.3* N(0, 2) + .7*N(10, 2)\,. $$ I implemented the scenarios that you demonstrate. Here are my various settings: Monte Carlo samples of $N = 10^4$ and $N = 10^6$ Four $\sigma$s: .1, 1, 10, 100 Two starting values: 0 and 10 Here are the results from $N = 10^4$. Black line is the true density. Things are a little crazy here, but I don't see what you see. Now here is the more stable $N = 10^6$. Again, I don't see what you see, and rather at $\sigma = .1$ things are a little weird, rest are all ok. So I am not sure why you are seeing a weird behavior. It may be a starting value issue, but I doubt it. Your algorithm looks correct, so there might be a problem with how you're storing the Markov chain (maybe?). Here is the R code for these plots (that is the only language I know). set.seed(100) ## Evaluates the mixture density eval_dense
