Depending on how cooperative the sub-projects are, you can either manage the features and the backlog in a single order of priority (thus, the most important task to the organization comes first - transparent, but the decision makers must be able to converge on the priorities), or splitting the time / team and then managing the priorities with each client within the time or resource slice allocated to the client. Organization-wide this is not the most efficient way, but once this hard decision is taken you are free to manage each project independently. Exactly the same goes with the emergency requests. An enlightened organization would be able to prioritize this across different divisions - i.e. an urgent security fix ranks any feature regardless of ownership, but more likely the "emergency" stuff will either be done as a part of the "slice" allocated to the client, or according to how much pressure the "emergency requester" can produce. It looks like you have a lot of change going on. If you are not yet using an agile process, such as XP, you should try - at least the managing requirements/features and delivering often parts. Delivering changes often can also relieve some of the pressure on you as the progress from task to task becomes more visible.
