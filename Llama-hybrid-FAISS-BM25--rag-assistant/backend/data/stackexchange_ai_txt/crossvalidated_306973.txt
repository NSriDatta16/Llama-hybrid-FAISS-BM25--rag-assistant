How to predict using Spatial temporal hierarchical bayesian models

I am using the R package CARBayesST to fit a Spatial-temporal Bayesian models. I want to use piece-wise ST model proposed by Lee and Lawson, 2017 . The package does not have a built-in predict function. I saw this post , how to predict for new data points using posterior probability distribution, but I am not able to construct the same for Spatial temporal Bayesian models. Any suggestion would be really appreciated. There is even a github page for CARBayesST created by @Spacedman, but I couldn't figure out how to predict using the code. In case that helps in finding a solution.
