The w3c describes the document as: "The Document interface represents the entire HTML or XML document. Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides the primary access to the document's data." ( http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#i-Document ) and window as: "...defines the Window object, which provides the global namespace for web scripting languages, access to other documents in a compound document by reference, navigation to other locations, and timers. The Window object is a long-standing de facto standard for HTML user agents. However, it should not be assumed based on this or the name "Window" that it is limited to HTML or to visual user agents." ( http://www.w3.org/TR/Window/ ) So to answer your question, depending on the browser there might not be any issue. But some browser vendors might implement them differently.
