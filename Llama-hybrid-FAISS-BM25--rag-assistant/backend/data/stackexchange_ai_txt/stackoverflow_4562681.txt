I've been using addJSONData with jqgrid, but it was 1 year ago, a lot of things have change since that time in jqGrid. Anyway, I needed heavy & complex gui manipulation on the client side (bank share things), my Json data was local only and sent to the server as some jkey point (job finished). I had several jqgrid (some of them inside others jqgrids :-) ) and some sort of local browser storage of data which was small enough to stay in the browser and complex and moving enough to be unusable in a reasonnable time via ajax IO. First version were using Ajax IO, when I've been hit by the locks and wait problems and by the amount of new complex GUI things coming I've been really happy to find this addJSONData hook and have my own ajax timeline outside of jQgrid.
