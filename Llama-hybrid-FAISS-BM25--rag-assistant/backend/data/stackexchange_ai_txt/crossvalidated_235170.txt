So let's say that you have split your data into train (development) and test, chosen some optimum bins for your variables, and created your logistic regression model, and your target is "loan going bad" (credit to @Wayne). The model will give you the probability of a loan going bad. You can of course multiply this by a 1000 to create more of "score feeling", which is also good when you're presenting to people not from a statistics background (it just makes it a bit more simpler). Now when you wanna choose a cut off point (on the score) for taking action, this becomes a very subjective process, and I would not recommend taking the KS statistic as your cut-off. What I usually do is that I split my data into equal tiles, 10 tiles most of the time, you can go to 20 as well if you wanna get a more refined look at your model. By tiling, you will get your data split equally, and you will be able to plot your predicted probabilities against your observed probabilities which can also be used to check how good your model is. If there is a cash element (for e.g. if you looking at whether someone is going to pay back their loan, and you have a cash variable that tells you how much they have paid) you can also look at the cash distribution in the tiles. I have already created a function that creates your tile table and outputs the graph which I will paste at the end of this answer. But the tiles can be used as a great guideline for choosing your cut-off points, because it creates a set of groups and you can choose which groups you would like to focus on. Obviously make sure to perform the same thing on your test data as well to make sure your results are robust! If I have not been clear enough, do ask away! Hope this helped! where model is the name of your model y is your target variable cash is your cash variable df is your dataset / dataframe mt and st are main title and sub title respectively tile
