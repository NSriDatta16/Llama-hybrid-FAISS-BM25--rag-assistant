Time series prediction: Neural Network (nnetar) vs. exponential smoothing (ets)

When I make a forecast for the univariate time series $x_1=1, x_2=2, \dots, x_{14} = 14$, why does the nnetar() function in R (which uses a neural network) not calculate correct results, whereas ets() (which uses exponential smoothing) does? library(forecast) df Result: 14.75729410 15.37348413 15.85274344 16.21147877 16.47188350 16.65653700 16.78524210 16.87385438 16.93433975 16.97538111 fit2 Result: 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Which is the appropriate neuronal network / function for time series prediction? Please consider that the above example is just a simplified data-example.
