ordered logistic regression unequal sample sizes

carried out an ordered logistic regression but sample sizes were not equal, one is much larger than the other (490) compared to 224 and 219, the result for this group was non-significant could this be the result of a larger sample size? If not, are there other negatives to having such big differences in cohort sizes; in terms of validity or reliability etc
