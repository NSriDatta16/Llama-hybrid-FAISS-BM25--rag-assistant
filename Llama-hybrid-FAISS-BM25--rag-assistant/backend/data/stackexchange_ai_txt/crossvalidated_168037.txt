General question on the analysis design

I have the following problem. Three hospitals of similar structure have the very different mortality rate on one certain disease. I would like to analyse the data, whether the location as a factor has an influence on the mortality after adjusting for age, gender, urgencies etc. My plan is to try logistic regression for this. If a location would show a significant OR, this would mean that the parameters that we cannot measure now (say, the real qualification of the staff) should be investigated further. Does it make sense? I have some experience with R including several Coursera courses. I have no formal computer science qualification however and I hesitate to just use the "gun" I have on my computer without some advice. Thank you very much!
