Statistical uncertainty in average of continuous variable, where values are not expected to be the same

I have been trying to understand statistical uncertainties on measurements made, I have found many partial sources, but they seem to either deal with simply counting whether something happened or not dealing with repeated measurements of the same quantity, therefore assuming that any variation is due only to uncertainties or statistical fluctuations. Neither of the above is my case ... My current requirement is to take the results of some blood tests and find an average for particular blood markers. Let's say cholesterol. I have a group of 100 people, I measure their cholesterol. I will get 100 different results with continuous values. There will be a distribution due to the fact that people can have different values rather than due only to uncertainty. I would probably assume (not sure if correctly) this would still be normally distributed. I want to extract the average value and the uncertainty. Questions: What would you suggest as the best approach? How would I need to modify this approach if I had a million people to test, or if I only had one?
