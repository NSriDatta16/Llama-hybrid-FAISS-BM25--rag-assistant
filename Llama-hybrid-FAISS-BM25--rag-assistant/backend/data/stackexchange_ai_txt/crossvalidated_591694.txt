How to interpret confidence interval for multiple logistic regression

I am currently learning linear regression for binomial data and I am a bit confused in some things since this type of regression is new to me. I am mostly confused how to interpret the confidence interval for a predictor variable in multiple logistic regression. I did logistic regression on my data using this code in R: gml(Y~., family="binomial", data=data_train) . One of the predictor variables (b4) for which I am trying to interpret the confidence interval got a value of -0.304 which i transformed to odds e^(-0.304) = 0.73786. This I enterpret as: b4 has a 26% (1 â€“ 0.73786 = 0.26214) reduction on the response variable. Did I enterpret this right? Next I calculated a confidence interval for b4: $$e^{\beta_j \pm z^* S E\left(\beta_j\right)}$$ and this gave me the following 90 % confidence interval: [0.168 : 8.904]. This I would interpret as: I am 90% confident that the odds ratio for b4 would be between 0-168 - 8.904. This seems as a lazy and also wrong interpretation of the confidence interval. How would you interpret this confidence interval?
