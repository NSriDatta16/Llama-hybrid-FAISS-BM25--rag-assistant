I think you might just have a misunderstanding. I created a class similar to what you described: @interface MyViewController : UIViewController { UIPickerView *pickerView; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIPickerView *pickerView; Then I opened up the xib. I right-clicked on the File's Owner (or cmd-click if you don't have a two button mouse), which brought up a list of all of the Outlets on MyViewController. I find this a lot easier than the ctrl-clicking that most of the tutorials suggest you do. Then I clicked and dragged from the circle next to pickerView down to the pickerView. Let go of the mouse button and it connects just fine.
