Once we observe that both sides of the inequality are scale invariant, it follows immediately by combining two simple, well-known inequalities, of which the most notable is that correlation coefficients cannot be less than $\newcommand{\e}{\mathbb{E}}-1$. The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality guarantees that the correlation coefficient $\rho(X,Y)$ of any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ lies between $-1$ and $1$. Using the definition of correlation and focusing on the lower bound of $-1$ allows us to express this inequality in the form $$-\text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(Y) \le \rho(X,Y)\text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(Y) = \text{Cov}(X,Y) = \e[XY] - \e[X]\e[Y].$$ If we let $Y=1/X$, the product $\e[X]\e[1/X]$ is recognizable right there at the very end (which of course is what inspired this approach). Using the simplification $\e[XY]=\e[X/X]=\e[1]=1$, isolate the last term algebraically to obtain $$\e[X]\e[1/X] \le 1 + \text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(1/X).$$ When a variable's values are confined to an interval $[a,b]$, its variance is limited by the value $(b-a)^2/4$. This is proven in several elegant, elementary, and informative ways at Variance of a bounded random variable ; it comes down to the fact that variances cannot be negative. Consequently $$\text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(1/X) \le (b-a)^2/4.$$ We may freely rescale $X$ because the left side of this inequality does not thereby change. Select a scale in which $ab=1$ (which is possible because both $a$ and $b$ are positive). This allows us to rewrite the preceding in a form where the right hand side is obviously scale invariant, too: $$\text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(1/X) \le \frac{(b-a)^2}{4} = \frac{1}{ab}\frac{(b-a)^2}{4}=\frac{(b-a)^2}{4ab}.$$ These two inequalities finish the job: $$\e[X]\e[1/X] \le 1 + \text{sd}(X)\text{sd}(1/X) \le 1 + \frac{(b-a)^2}{4ab} = \frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab}.$$
