How to name train + validation set

Usually in machine learning pipelines, we use a train set, a validation set and a test set. Quite often, we first split the test set from the rest, and then we split the "rest" into train and validation sets (possibly multiple times if using cross-validation). What would be the proper way to name the "rest" (the set that contains data dedicated for training and validation)? Train_val_set? Education_set?
