It appears development has stopped on Jpcap. Their last release was 2007. In contrast, jNetPcap has had very recent releases. The underlying libpcap C library that they both wrap has continued to evolve, so I would go with jNetPcap for that reason. On the other hand, libpcap is a fairly simple API. If you are comfortable with C, then you may gain performance advantages by using the library directly instead of going through a Java wrapper. Something to consider, anyway.
