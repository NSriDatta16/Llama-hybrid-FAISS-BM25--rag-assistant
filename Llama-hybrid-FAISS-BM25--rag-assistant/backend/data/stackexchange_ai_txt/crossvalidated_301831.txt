Is there a machine learning algorithm that can be trained with pairs of integer sets?

Like, the training set is composed of positive examples (s1, s2) where s1 is an integer set and s2 another integer set. s1 and s2 may have different cardinality. Negative examples are similar: pairs (s3, s4) of integer sets. The biggest integer in any set is known in advance and the same for all sets (s1, s2, ...). All integers are positive. Positive examples will be extracted from a dataset. Out of the dataset for positive examples, negative examples will be constructed by some randomization that will avoid producing any of the known positive examples.
