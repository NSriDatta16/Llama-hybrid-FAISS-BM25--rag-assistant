I'm using the clover-report along with the automated site generation by maven. For that you just have to add the clover plugin to your POMs reporting section as describes here . That way you can also get a historical report about your code coverage. Calling/starting the maven process is done via the m2eclipse plugin and that's it. But you could also use all 3 plugins. So for example install the clover plugin for eclipse so that you don't have to generate the whole site again and again when you only want the code coverage (with the clover plugin for eclipse you can see the coverage right inside eclipse) and use the clover maven plugin to generate a "final" code coverage for any released piece of code. The m2eclipse plugin is not really needed for neither clover-maven nor clover-eclipse but it's nice when working with eclipse and maven.
