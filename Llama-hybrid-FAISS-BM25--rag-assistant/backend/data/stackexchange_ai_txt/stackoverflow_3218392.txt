Qooxdoo can be used embeded in a normal webpage, BUT the development methodology is radically different from what you are used to in ordinary web ui toolkits. With qooxdoo it is all about programming javascript, without HTML or CSS in the mix ... so transforming a HTML table element into a qooxdoo table is not something for starters ... you may be better served using something simple for this task ... This is not to discourage you from using qooxdoo, best is probably to work thorough the hello world app to get a feel for things.
