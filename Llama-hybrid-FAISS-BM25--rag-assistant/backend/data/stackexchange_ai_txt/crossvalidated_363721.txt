How to demonstrate RMSE for time series in percentages

I am doing forecasting for a time-series problem, and have ended up with a RMSE of 3793.86. I then took the mean of all the rows available to me, saw that it was 275007.975. Is it correct to say that my RMSE percentage error is (3793.96 / 275007.975 * 100) = 1.38%? This is mainly for reporting purposes, as RMSE by itself doesn't seem intuitive to management, for example. Or would a better metric to use be MAE ?
