VARCHAR(MAX) should be used for Large Objects.It uses the normal datapages until the content actually fills 8k of data. When overflow happens, data is stored as old TEXT, IMAGE and a pointer is replacing the old content. Varchar is for Variable-length, non-Unicode character data. n can be a value from 1 through 8,000. Max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes. Hope it helps.
