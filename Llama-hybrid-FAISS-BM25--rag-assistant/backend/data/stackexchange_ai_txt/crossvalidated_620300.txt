You don't want to model these data as if they were counts. It is easy to demonstrate why. In the negative binomial model, the expected value of the outcome is modelled as $$ \log(E(y)) = \mathbf{x}^T \beta $$ The expected value is thus supported on the positive reals and there may be a combination of covariates such that, when one extrapolates, $E(y)$ is outside the bounds of the data. How could the expected value be >3 when the data are at the very most 3? Your data are ordinal so its probably better to model them as such. A technique like ordinal logistic regression is likely better because then you can estimate $ P(y \leq 1)$ and $P(y \leq 2)$ (end through some algebra, $P(y = 1)$ , $P(y = 2)$ , and $P(y = 3)$ .
