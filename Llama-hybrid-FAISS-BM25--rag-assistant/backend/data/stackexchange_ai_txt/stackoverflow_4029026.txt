James makes a good point, essentially use pre-calculating to minimize the inefficiencies during retrieval time. Of course this requires you to know the dependent properties when you change a value in your class. I would look into implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged or IObservable interface for those properties that others depend on, this would be the Observer/Observable or Publish/Subscribe design pattern.
