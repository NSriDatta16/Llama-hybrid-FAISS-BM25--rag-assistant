A random variable is described by numbered tickets in a box . For instance, the values on the sides of a fair die correspond to a box with six tickets bearing the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,$ and $6.$ The expectation of a random variable is the (usual arithmetic) average of the numbers on its tickets. From this it follows that The expected value for the sum of draws made at random with replacement from a box equals $$(\text{number of draws})\times(\text{average of box}).$$ [Freedman et al. section 17.1, "The Expected Value."] This explicitly connects a definite mathematical property (the average of a box of tickets) with the possible random behavior of a quantity.
