As Nikos said, the dataset is not linearly separable: one cannot draw a single straight line which has all the red points on one side and all the green points on the other. There is an obvious repetition pattern on $x_2$ . Let's assume that $x_2$ ranges from 0 to 100 on this graph, the value $x_2$ modulo 50 would make it linearly separable. That would be feature engineering. Notice that $x_1$ doesn't have any impact on the class. So imho the best algorithm in this case is to just map $x_2$ intervals to the class.
