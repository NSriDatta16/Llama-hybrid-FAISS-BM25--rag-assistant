I think any procedure which is "iterative" can be considered a case of machine learning. Regression can be considered machine learning. We could do it by hand, but it would take a long time, if at all possible. So now we have these programs, machines, which do the iterations for us. It gets closer and closer to a solution, or to the best solution or best fit. Thus, "machine learning". Of course things like neural networks get most of the attention in regard to machine learning, so we usually associate machine learning to these sexy procedures. Also, the difference between "supervised" and "unsupervised" machine learning is relevant here
