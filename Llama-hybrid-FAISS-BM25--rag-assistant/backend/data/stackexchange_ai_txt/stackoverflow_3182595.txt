Are you positive that the news property (I am guessing it is a property on your detail view controller) is not nil ? Are you confirming your assumptions that both newsDetailController and newsDetailController.news are not nil ? iOS4 has brought with it proper non-fragile iVars. If you were doing something incorrect in your @property declarations before that "worked" then the changes to iOS4 may now be catching that mistake. Step one, walk the code in the debugger and make sure everything has a value that you expect to have a value.
