Magento layout override!

I'm kind of new to the Magento, so forgive me for my stupid question! As I understand the whole concept of Magento is base on overriding the basic components that's are available with in the Magento. So based on my understanding I've decided to update the layout of onepage checkout in Magento. I've created my own layout and in the config file set that my layout updates the checkout module layout. But the problem is it's actually does not update the base layout, it replaces it self with base layout! Should it be act like this or am I wrong?!
