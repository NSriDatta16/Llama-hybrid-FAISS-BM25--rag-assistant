In my opinion, the get prefix is really only mandatory if you're writing a bean. There are lots of examples of where get is not used. not only String.length() . You find it in the primitive wrapper classes ( intValue() , doubleValue() , booleanValue() , ...), enums ( name() and ordinal() ) and collections ( size() ), and the way annotations were design also seems to encourage the get -less style. (Josh Bloch covers the subject in Effective Java, and advocates the more readable get -less style unless you're actually writing a bean.) So: Use the get prefix and your object can be used as a bean. Ditch it, and your code gets easier to read. It's up to you to decide what you think is more important.
