How to choose cut off for winsorization/ flooring- capping? What is the impact of variable distribution on the decision

To perform logistic regression I wish to winsorize outliers in independent/ explanatory variables by flooring and capping independent variables. Can you suggest how I should choose cut-off for winsorization, i.e 1 & 99th or something else. Also is there any impact on decision if the distribution of variable is left/ right skewed and not normal. Please assume we don't have common knowledge of the variable to choose cut off intuitively.
