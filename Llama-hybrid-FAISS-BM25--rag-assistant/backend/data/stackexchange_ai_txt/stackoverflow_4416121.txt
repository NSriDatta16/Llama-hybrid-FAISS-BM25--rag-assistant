What .net framework are you using. .net 4 introduced the cachemode property to uielememts. Setting this property to an instance of bitmapcache will rasterise your the element and it's children to a cache and does not re-rasterize until the tree is changed. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.bitmapcache(v=VS.100).aspx Consider also using bitmaprendertarget to active the same with a little more flexibility.
