What Image format should I use for barcodes created on the fly

I'm creating barcodes on the fly, and embedding them in web pages. What format should I use? I'm wavering between JPG and PNG, and I don't really understand the advantages of both. Size matters in this, as does readability (better a clear barcode than a blurry one). Is there another format that would be better yet?
