Main usage of IndexedDB API is to store data locally on browser side, so that offline mode is supported, for eg. you should be able to read your already downloaded mails. This will make things faster and reduce network latency. If I understand correctly what you want is a portable storage for quizzing. You do not want students to know the correct answer is till they answer a question. Now if you want them to answer and then evaluate the answer, then indexedDB is not a solution. It will make students write code/scripts to get the data from DB and cheat.
