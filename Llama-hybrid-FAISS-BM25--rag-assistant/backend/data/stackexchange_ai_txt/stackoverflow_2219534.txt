should an organization delete data (wiki, sharepoint, etc)

There was a similar question discussed around collaboration tools but one point wasn't fully agreed upon. As we now have all of these collaboration and documentation tools (WIKIs, sharepoints, blogs, etc) to keep track of project plans, busienss requirements, technical documentation, etc, the question is "should we ever delete this data". As organizations evolve and reorganize and people come and go, a lot of this data is out of date or no longer relavant or correct. One thought is that there maybe useful stuff inside this data so keep it around and preserve the info at that time and it would be good to have historic context. An opposing argument is that this data provides too much noise and can lead to people finding it hard to get the up to date latest data Thoughts?
