Should "Library path" point to the source files of packages?

Should "Library path" point to the source files of packages? Delphi 7 documentation says yes. But other people say no: "The "Library" path should lead to compiled files (.dcp, .dcu) and (if needed) resource files (.res, .dfm) only". Update: The thing is that if you DON'T add the path to your packages in the "Library path" then every single time you create a new DPR project you have to manually collect the path to your packages (many) and enter them into the Project's Option "Browse" box, else you will get "file xxx.dcu not found". This doesn't sound that nice. For years I used to add all my paths in Library and never had to manually add the paths every time I created a new project. My packages are universal/global (not specific to a single project but to many projects). I use one single computer for programming so I don't care about sharing the code. I have the PAS and DCU files in the same folder. I don't mind recompiling the PAS files often. Compile takes 1-2 seconds, build takes 3-4 seconds. Relative paths ARE OUT OF QUESTION because "Delphi (all versions) seems to change the working directory sometimes on opening files, which in turn messes up relative paths (they are relative to the working dir, not the .dpr(oj) apparently). If I notice this, I open a file (using file->Open) in the working dir, and all is fine again." I use to edit most of the packages a lot in a single day. Delphi 7 is such a mess when about setting the paths and official documentation is 0. :( UPDATE: I have done the change. It works, but it not even by far perfect (or at least elegant): How to remove duplicate resources (RES, DFM) while using Delphi with non specific Library paths?
