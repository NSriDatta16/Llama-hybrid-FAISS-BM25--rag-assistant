I can take a person that has never seen Ant - its build.xml s are reasonably well-written - and they can understand what is going on. I can take that same person and show them a Maven POM and they will not have any idea what is going on. In an engineering organization that is huge, people write about Ant files becoming large and unmanageable. I've written those types and clean Ant scripts. It's really understanding upfront what you need to do going forward and designing a set of templates that can respond to change and scale over a 3+ year period. Unless you have a simple project, learning the Maven conventions and the Maven way about getting things done is quite a bit of work. At the end of the day you cannot consider project startup with Ant or Maven a factor: it's really the total cost of ownership. What it takes for the organization to maintain and extend its build system over a few years is one of the main factors that must be considered. The most important aspects of a build system are dependency management and flexibility in expressing the build recipe. It must be somewhat intuitive when done well.
