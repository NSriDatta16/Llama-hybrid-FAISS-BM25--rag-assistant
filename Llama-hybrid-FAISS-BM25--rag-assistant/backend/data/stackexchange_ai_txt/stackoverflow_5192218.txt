Adding different thumnail sizes to products in magento

I have a magento store that sells glasses, clothing etc. The problem is that i would like my glasses to have thumbnails that are say 300px X 100px and the clothes to have thumbnails that are 300px X 300px. I can think of a few different routes I might take but I am unsure of the implications each route would have on the upgradeablity of my store. (currently using Magento 1.4.2 as i dont yet have faith in 1.5.x) Route 1) Adding Extra image sizes to products So this route I would somehow add an extra image to my products in the admin area and each product would have a glasses size thumb and a clothing size thumb. Route 2) Altering the thumbnail size depending on attribute set I would put some sort of a case statement in the image resizing script to change the size of the thumnail depending on the attribute set the product is using. If anyone has any other ideas on how this might be accomplished it would be greatly appreciated!
