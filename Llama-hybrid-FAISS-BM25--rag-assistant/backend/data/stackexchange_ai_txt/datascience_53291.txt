Tensorflow F-RCNN first stage input and output strides

Trying to optimize performances on Tensorflow's faster_rcnn_resnet50 (from the model zoo ), I'm currently working on understanding the full .config file they provide, and I'm having a hard time with the strides. Here's the relevant part of the file, with bolded parts being things I'm unsure about: image_resizer { keep_aspect_ratio_resizer { min_dimension: 1134 max_dimension: 2016 } } feature_extractor { type: "faster_rcnn_resnet50" first_stage_features_stride: 16 } first_stage_anchor_generator { grid_anchor_generator { height: 28 width: 31 height_stride: 14 width_stride: 15 scales: 0.242 scales: 0.621 scales: 1.0 scales: 1.739 scales: 2.478 aspect_ratios: 0.386 aspect_ratios: 0.693 aspect_ratios: 1.0 aspect_ratios: 1.464 aspect_ratios: 1.929 } } What I would like to know is if I should be computing the feature map stride according to the anchors' dimensions and strides or if they're completely unrelated ? Also is there any restriction on the strides themselves, for example keeping them in powers of 2 like the original f-rcnn ?
