Performance evaluation of two models by bayesian forecasting

Suppose I have a model f(y|r) which I estimate by two datasets (dataset A and dataset B) where "r" is the parameter(s) . In Bayesian framework, we can sample the parameters from the whole posterior distribution P(r|y). Now suppose for each case (case 1: model estimated using dataset A; case 2: model estimated using dataset B), we take 1000 sample of parameters from the posterior distribution P(r|y). To forecast from future, we simulate events from the posterior predictive distribution using each of the 1000 parameter samples from posterior distribution and finally average over them. The plot of the events forecasted by case 1 (model A) and case 2 (model B) along with true values is like: But this is only graphical way to see which model gives closer values to actual true values, that is, which model forecasted better. I want to know if there is any evaluation technique to find which model gives better forecasting?
