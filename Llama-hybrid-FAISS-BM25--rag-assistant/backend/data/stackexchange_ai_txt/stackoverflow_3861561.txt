As the previous poster said, configure a local queueing smtp server, if you have shell access to the server. Postfix is a good candidate, it's lightweight and easy to configure. Sending a thousand emails should not take more than a few seconds. You could use the pear package Mail::Factory as well to specify a lot of options and use various methods of calling the MTA (Mail Transport Agent, i.e. Postfix).
