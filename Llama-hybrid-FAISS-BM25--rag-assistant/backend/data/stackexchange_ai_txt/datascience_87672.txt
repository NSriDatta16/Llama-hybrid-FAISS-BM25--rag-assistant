Looking more, the coursera article and proposed architecture is excellent, i would start with it as-is. The tensorflow dataset is also valuable (impressed by its public existence). Summary: The GRU network should be fed with sequencial 1D vectors (row-by-row capturing the event evolving in time t,t+1,t+2) but the tensorflow's classical CNN with whole 2D snapshots from the spectra. That's the difference. Not familiar with tensorflow's "model = models.Sequential" way of feeding i use pytorch / mxnet and always feed networks with own routines (including needed little preprocessing) as a good way of exercise avoiding "smart single line" data-feeders exposed in many modern DL framework.
