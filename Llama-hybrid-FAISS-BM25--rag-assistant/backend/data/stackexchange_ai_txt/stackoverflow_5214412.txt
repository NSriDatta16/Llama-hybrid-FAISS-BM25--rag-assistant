3 starting tables: contributors, supporters, organizations. -> An organization has many contributors means that if a contributor has one organization, you just set an organization_id to the contributors table. If it can have many organizations, you need a third table, say organization_contributors that has (organization_id, contributor_id). -> An organization has many supporters is exactly the same as above :)
