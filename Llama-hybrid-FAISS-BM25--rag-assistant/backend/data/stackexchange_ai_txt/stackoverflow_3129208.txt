I can't just time myself writing one then time myself writing the other, because I will almost inevitably write the second one faster having experienced pitfalls and fixes while writing the first one. You can compensate for this by having two test subjects. Let test subject A code in framework 1 first, framework 2 second; let test subject B first use framework 2 then framework 1. Scale the values by the total development time of the developer to compensate for difference in skill, then average for each framework. This is more of a science methodology answer than a programming answer though... :)
