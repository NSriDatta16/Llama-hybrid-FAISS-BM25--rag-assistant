You function can be represented as: $$f(x,y) = \lim_{n\to+\infty}(\sigma(1/|x-y|))^n$$ A good approximation can be obtained with a large $n$ . A neural network can approximate further that function. In fact, depending on what you consider a neural network to be, the function itself is already a neural network with special activation functions.
