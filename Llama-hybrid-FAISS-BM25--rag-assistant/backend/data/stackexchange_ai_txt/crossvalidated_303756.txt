thanks for all the help. One of the reasons I was having problems was because deriving the MLE for the beta-exponential distribution was really hard. I thought I could derive it and solve it with matrices but my method was really hard to implement. Instead, I used a pre-programmed function in SAS called NLP in order to find my parameters and fit the distribution. This is the code I wrote. Note1: The data set was in a CSV file. Note2: The question Let (,)=∫^(−1)*(1−)^(−1). A random variable is said to follow a beta-exponential distribution with parameters >0, >0, >0 if it has density ()= (exp((−)/)(1−exp(−/))^(−1))/(,) >0, 0 ≤0. I had to find parameters alpha, beta, lambda by fitting a given dataset to this distribution. PROC iml; use WORK.BETA; read all into x; close; start F_BETTS(param) global(x); / Calculates MLE / y= param[1];/* y is lambda*/ a= param[2];/* a is alpha*/ b= param[3];/* b is beta*/ n= nrow(x); F_BETTS = j(n,1,.); do i=1 to n; F_BETTS[i]=(exp(-b*x[i]/y)*(1-exp(-x[i]/y))**(a-1))/(y*beta(a,b)); /*Beta-exponential distribution*/ end; f = sum(log(F_BETTS)); return(f); finish; con ={0.01 0.01 0.01, . . .}; / Sets min constraints to barely over 1 and max constraints to infinity / Initial={4 2 10}; /* Initial parameter / opt={1 4}; / finds maximum with lots of output*/ call nlpnra(rc, xres, "F_BETTS", Initial, opt, con); run; quit;
