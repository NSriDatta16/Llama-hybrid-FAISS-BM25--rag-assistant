Machine learning concepts confusion

Can someone explain following four machine learning problems: binary classification, regression, multiple independent binary classification, and 1-of-K multiclass classification. Please use set and numerical domain notation to denote the input and output spaces of each problem. Quite confused at these concepts. When I try to search that in Wikipedia, I think the answers are not what I am looking for.
