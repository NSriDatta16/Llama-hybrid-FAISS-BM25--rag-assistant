I understand that the majority of database professionals will cross their fingers and hiss at you if you store images in the database (or even mention it). Yes, there are definitely performance and storage implications when using the database as the repository for large blocks of binary data of any kind (images just tend to be the most common bits of data that can't be normalized). However, there are most certainly circumstances where database storage of images is not only allowable but advisable . For instance, in my old job we had an application where users would attach images to several different points of a report that they were writing, and those images had to be printed out when it was done. These reports were moved about via SQL Server replication, and it would have introduced a HUGE headache to try to manage these images and file paths across multiple systems and servers with any sort of reliability. Storing them in the database gave us all of that "for free," and the reporting tool didn't have to go out to the file system to retrieve the image.
