Logistic regression when most of variables are strongly correlated

As one of my assignments for uni I need to create a logistic regression model using the breast cancer dataset which is available here: data I've looking through the data and I see that I have an issue that most of my variables are strongly correlated: > correlation::correlation(cancer[-c(1)], + include_factors=TRUE, + method='auto') Parameter1 | Parameter2 | r | 95% CI | t(567) | p | Method | n_Obs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ V3 | V4 | 0.32 | [ 0.25, 0.40] | 8.15 | At the same time, one of the key assumptions of logistic regression is the independence of variables, which is obviously not met here. I couldn't find any good sources online or in the course text book of what to do in this case. My best guess is to start removing correlated variables until I get to the state where only independent variables remain. Is this the way to do it? EDIT: I've also checked the Variance Inflation Factor and most of them look very high too: > VIF(glm_fit) V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 911.907192 1.794580 730.245703 118.862196 4.116100 15.913750 5.457273 6.868455 1.776696 9.183906
