It is true that Javascript was at one point notoriously hard to deal with but the web development community has come a long way since. Instead, I would encourage you to have a look at jQuery . It's easy and abstracts away all the various problems. And there really are no alternatives that work across the board. Flash comes to mind but that too is ECMA script and it's probably over kill for most things.
