Mixture model with covariance matrix with varying variances and equal covariances

In some illustrations of mixture models, the covariance matrix is structured to have varying variances and equal covariances between mixture components. For example, Pastor et al. (2007) (I'm sorry I can't find a freely-available version of this) write about a model with two mixture components and eight variables, or indicators: "This specification results in Model D and in our example eight variances and six covariances would be estimated." My understanding is that two of the variances are uniquely associated with each of the four mixture components, whereas the same six covariances are estimated for all four components. They describe in their article a covariance matrix like the one below: $$ \left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma }_{ 1m }^{ 2 } & { \sigma }_{ 21 } & { \sigma }_{ 31 } & { \sigma }_{ 41 } \\ { \sigma }_{ 12 } & { \sigma }_{ 2m }^{ 2 } & { \sigma }_{ 23 } & { \sigma }_{ 24 } \\ { \sigma }_{ 13 } & { \sigma }_{ 12 } & { \sigma }_{ 3m }^{ 2 } & { \sigma }_{ 33 } \\ { \sigma }_{ 14 } & { \sigma }_{ 12 } & { \sigma }_{ 12 } & { \sigma }_{ 4m }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] $$ The authors use the software MPlus to estimate this model. In trying to estimate similar models in the R packages mclust and Rmixmod , I found that this model does not seem to be available. Upon thinking about it more, I began to wonder how a covariance matrix can specify different variances but equal covariances. Would not changing the variances always change the covariances, too? More generally: Is it possible to specify a mixture model with covariance matrix with varying variances and equal covariances?
