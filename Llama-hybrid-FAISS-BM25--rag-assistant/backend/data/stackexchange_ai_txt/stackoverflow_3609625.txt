Is it safe to use one standard compliant STL in a library, and another in a project that uses that library? No. Some parts of STL for reusability are put into a shared library. It is impossible to guarantee that the internal structure of classes would match in the different STLs thus leading to sporadic crashes if both are used by a program interchangeably. Also note that STLs from different vendors might have different organization of internal namespaces and classes. That has the effect that public symbol std::basic_string might have different internal names and would be mangled differently, making void Foo(std::string& str_mingw); and void Foo(std::string& str_vstudio); from linker perspective two different functions.
