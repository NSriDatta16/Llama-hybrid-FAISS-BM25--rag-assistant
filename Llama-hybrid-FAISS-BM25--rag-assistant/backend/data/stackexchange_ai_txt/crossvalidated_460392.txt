Jeffreys' prior for Bernoulli sampling

I am learning Bayesian Statistics and I don't understand the Jeffreys' prior for Bernoulli sampling below: If I understood well s is the number of observations when x=1 and f=n-s , where n is the number total of observations. But what I misunderstood is that I wonder why Ex|θ(s)= nθ and Ex|θ(f)= n(1-θ). Any clear explanation for this would be much appreciated.
