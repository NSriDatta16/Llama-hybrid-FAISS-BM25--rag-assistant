Here one's example. Suppose you run a regression of $AC$ on $Q$ and you find that the coefficient is negative (not the case with your data). This tells you average cost falls with output, so your technology has returns to scale. If all firms have similar technology, it would be more efficient to have only one firm serve the market. This would be an example of a natural monopoly.
