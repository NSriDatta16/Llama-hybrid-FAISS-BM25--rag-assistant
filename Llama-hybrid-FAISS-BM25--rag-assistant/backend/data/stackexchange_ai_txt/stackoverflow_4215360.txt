how to increase camera resolution when using IMAGE_CAPTURE intent

I run my android application with camera functionality implemented in an android-powered phone, but the camera image I got always has small resolution. It seems by default, the android camera resolution is small (e.g. 640*480), how to increase the resolution?? I use the following code to implement the camera part: Intent i = new Intent("android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE"); File photo=new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "123.jpg"); i.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(photo)); startActivityForResult(i, 1); any suggestions on this???
