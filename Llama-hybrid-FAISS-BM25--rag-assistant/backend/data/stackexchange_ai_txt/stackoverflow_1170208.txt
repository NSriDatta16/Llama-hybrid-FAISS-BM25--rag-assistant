The standard does not mention specific size requirements, only that each integral type must provide at least as much storage as the type before it. So int must hold as much as a short , and so on. You're better off specifying what you need them for. If you're looking for integers that do not change size based on the operating environment, take a look at the Boost Integer Library , or the C99/C++11 header . This contains types such as uint32_t / int32_t and uintmax_t / intmax_t . Most importantly, based off your question, it has: uintptr_t / intptr_t . These are guaranteed to have the correct size to hold a pointer on your platform.
