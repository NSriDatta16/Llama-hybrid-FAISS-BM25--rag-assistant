The getty process is usually started on serial ports to provide a login prompt by /sbin/init , which is configured in /etc/inittab . init has the concept of "runlevels". Each runlevel defines a separate set of processes that init will keep running. One elegant way to implement this would be to design your "protocol" process so that it is started by init , in the same way as getty . You can then tell init to run your process in some runlevels, and getty in others, and have the pushbutton switch between runlevels. For example, your /etc/inittab might include: T0:2:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100 P0:345:respawn:/sbin/protocol ttyS0 9600 This will run your protocol command on the first serial port in runlevels 3, 4 and 5; but getty in runlevel 2.
