How to make htaccess redirect on direct image access while allowing embedding

The scenario looks like this, say that I have a website that contains some images. I want to allow people to embed them on their site, but I also want to redirect when anybody tries to access the image directly. One option is this RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www\.)?imgzzz.com/.*$ [NC] RewriteRule i/image_(\d+)\.(jpg|gif) - [F] which would deny any access from anywhere else than the site, but that doesn't allow embedding the image. The second option is to ommit the second RewriteCond leaving only RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ RewriteRule i/image_(\d+)\.(jpg|gif) - [F] Which allows embedding, but the user can still access the image if he's comming from anywhere else than a bookmark. Is there any way to make embedding available and at the same time doing redirect on direct access to the image?
