You can experiment with drag-and-drop using the examples of jQuery UI Sortables . To make it obvious for the non-technical or new users you could use visual cues such as handles or arrows and maybe a tooltip on hover to suggest dragging the element. You could even provide an animated gif demonstrating the gesture. As soon as a user learns how to do this I think it's the easiest method of ordering a list.
