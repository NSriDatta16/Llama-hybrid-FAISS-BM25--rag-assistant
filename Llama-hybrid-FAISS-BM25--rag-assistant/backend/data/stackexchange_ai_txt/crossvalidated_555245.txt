I don't see any major violations of a regression model when using percentage change as an endpoint. I think the ultimate reason for choosing one of these endpoints over another should be interpretation. As user0123456789 demonstrated (+1), a common approach particularly in clinical drug development is to model the post-baseline measurements longitudinally. This allows for the comparison of the mean endpoint between treatments at each time point, i.e. the average disease activity score at week 52 when treated with the active therapy is 20 units lower than when treated with placebo. Without the luxury of randomization one might be interested in adjusting for the baseline measurement. If percentage change is the endpoint this allows for the comparison of mean percentage change in the endpoint between treatments at each time point. For the purposes of comparative effectiveness this works just fine. For the purposes of providing an interpretable treatment effect, it is not very helpful, i.e. the average percentage change in disease activity score at week 52 when treated with the active therapy is 30 percentage change points lower than when treated with placebo. Here we are not comparing mean scores between groups, we are comparing mean rates of change between groups. There are other options such as modeling change from baseline in clinical score or modeling the clinical score longitudinally with baseline scores as a dependent variable. These approaches allow for the comparison between treatments of mean differences, but can lead to slightly different results depending on missing data.
