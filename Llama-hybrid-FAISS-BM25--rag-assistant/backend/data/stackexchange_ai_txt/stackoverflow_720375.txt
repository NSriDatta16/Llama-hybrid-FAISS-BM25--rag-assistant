WPF GridSplitter visiblity

I have a problem regarding GridSplitter visiblity. In this, whatever I am hosting a Winform DataGridView. The GridSplitter, when dragged is properly visible on other controls. But not on this grid. In fact, whatever I host instead of Datagridview, becomes the topmost control, which makes the GridSplitter hide behind it.
