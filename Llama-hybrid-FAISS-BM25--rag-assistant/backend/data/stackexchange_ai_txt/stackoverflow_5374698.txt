Not most appropriate but worth a thought you can try embedding a silverlight element.. In silverlight you can import the audio file to project and then can just drag and drop "media element" set source. drag and drop buttons play and pause.. play : mediasource.play(); pause : mediasource.pause(); voila done.. Its easy to do all this in sileverlight..
