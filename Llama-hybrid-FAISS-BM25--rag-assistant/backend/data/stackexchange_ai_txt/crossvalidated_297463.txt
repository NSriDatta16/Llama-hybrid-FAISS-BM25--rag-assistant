Is it possible to do a 2sls with linear regression in the 1st stage and logistic regression in the 2nd stage?

I'm working on a a bivariate logistic regression. But I have an endogeneity problem and I want solve it through 2sls with 2 instrumental variables. My thought was to regress (OLS) in first stage and later a bilogit in second stage. Is this a suitable analysis? Is it a "forbidden regression"? What would be the best option that helps to solve it?
