That's not how it works. There is a given number of weights given by the architecture you chose. Those weights are then updated on each iteration of the learning process. Depending on your method of learning, your weights may be updated once on 1000 observations, or for groups of observations (even groups of 1). May I suggest you to read an introduction to statistical learning http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ ? or to join the machine learning course on coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ?
