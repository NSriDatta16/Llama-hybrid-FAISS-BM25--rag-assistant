How to test whether one cohort is a mixture of two other cohorts for a set of binary variables?

I'll illustrate my question with an example. Suppose I have 25 observations for 3 binary variables. The observations belong to 3 pre-labelled cohorts 1, 2, and 3. Let's say: n1 are the n's for each cohort. Each cohort has a set of parameters determining the probability of each variable being 1 or 0. So for cohort 1: p1 Note that the values don't need to sum to 1; x1 and x2 can both equal 1 for the same observation; I'm just using a simple example where they tend not to. The data for the three cohorts might thus looks like: m1 My question is, in essence, how might I design a test to ascertain whether m3 is in fact a mixture of members of m1 and m2? Or, put more mathematically, how to determine if p3 is a linear combination of p1 and p2, given the observed data (obviously in this case it isn't, but this is of course a toy example)? My first thought was to just use a Bayesian model and determine the probability of observing the data given a bunch of sets of vectors chosen for p1, p2, and p3 (either random or using a grid), then take all vectors for which p3 = a*p1 + (1 - a)*p2, across all values for a between 0 and 1, and divide by the sum across all sets of vectors to get an estimate of the likelihood of observing the data given p3 being a linear combination of p1 and p2. The problem is that parameter sets for which p3 is indeed exactly a linear combination are unlikely to occur via either sampling method. I also thought (but am not certain) that this question may be simplified by taking the column sums of each cohort, then treating each as an observation derived from a multinomial distribution. s1 But wasn't sure where to go from there.
