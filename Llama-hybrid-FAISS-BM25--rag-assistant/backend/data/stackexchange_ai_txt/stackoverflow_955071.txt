How do I clear the isolated storage of another application?

Application1 uses Microsoft Enterprise Library Caching Application Block with IsolatedStorageBackingStore to cache data from a database accessed by Internet. The task is to create another Application2 (helper application like "Adobe Flash Player uninstaller") which will be able to clear the cache of Application1 (this will be one of many features of Application2). The question is - how can Application2 get the caching folder path of Application1 (in order to clear it)? The path will be something like " \Documents and Settings\ \Local Settings\Application Data\IsolatedStorage\tqli5mdv.xa5\htccao3l.ksb\StrongName.1r3fiexsbrusebdd0maaohl2i5cz4lhq\StrongName.mwjgo5cc1qomwe5tbepbfnyucq0obm3f\Files\ "? It's a pity, but the User has several applications with the same and this can't be changed, so Application2 can't find this path by string (course there will be several folders - one for each application - and I don't know how Application2 can choose which folder belongs to Application1). I was Googled a lot but with no result. Please help.
