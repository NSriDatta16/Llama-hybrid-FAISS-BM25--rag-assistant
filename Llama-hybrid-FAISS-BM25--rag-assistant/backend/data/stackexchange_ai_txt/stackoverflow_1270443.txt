Avoid caching after image update for Paperclip

I am uploading images to S3 storage using paperclip gem. It uploads successfully. In my application, an user can change his profile photo. If user do the profile photo change, the new image will get uploaded successfully. The problem is the browser will show previous photo only after the upload. Only after a force refresh by the hitting ctrl + F5 will the new image display. Note: image is uploaded using form post. I guess it's related with caching but I don't have clue where I can change my code. Please help me this out. Thanks.
