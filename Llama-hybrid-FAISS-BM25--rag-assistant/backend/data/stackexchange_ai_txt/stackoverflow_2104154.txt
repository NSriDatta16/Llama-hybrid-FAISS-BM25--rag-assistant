Measure transaction log throughput?

After reading Kim Tripp's article on transaction log throughput and discovering that I have gazillions of VLFs, I'm planning to restructure the logs as she outlined. I want to measure the resulting increase in log throughput to see if the fragmentation makes a difference on my servers, but I'm at a loss as to how to do so. I couldn't find anything in the BOL or Google on measuring log throughput, and the best strategy I've been able to cobble together is to see if the average wait time per task for LOGBUFFER and WRITELOG waits decreases. SELECT wait_type, (wait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms) * 1. / waiting_tasks_count AS [Wait (ms) per Task] FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats WHERE wait_type IN ('LOGBUFFER', 'WRITELOG') Is there something more definitive, perhaps akin to the perfmon database throughput counters ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189883.aspx )?
