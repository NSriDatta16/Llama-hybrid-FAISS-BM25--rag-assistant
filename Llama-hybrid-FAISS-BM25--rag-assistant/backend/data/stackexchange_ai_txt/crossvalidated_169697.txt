How many sides does a die have? Bayesian inference in JAGS

Problem I would like to do some inference on a system analogous to die with an unknown number of sides. The die is rolled several times, after which I would like to infer a probability distribution over a parameter corresponding to the number of sides the die has, θ. Intuition If after 40 rolls you had observed 10 red's, 10 blues's, 10 greens's and 10 yellows's, it seems that θ should peak at 4, and the biases of rolling each side are distributions centred on 1/4. θ has a trivial lower bound, being the number of different sides observed in the data. The upper bound is still unknown. There could be a fifth side which would probably have a low bias. The more data you observe lacking a fifth category, the higher the posterior probability of θ = 4. Approach I've used JAGS for similar problems (via R and rjags) which seems appropriate here. With respect to the data, lets say obs to correspond to the observations in the example above. I think the observations should be modelled with a multinomial distribution obs ~ dmulti(p, n) , where p ~ ddirch(alpha) and n . θ is linked to the number of categories implied by alpha , so how can I model alpha to encompass different possible numbers of categories? Alternatives? I'm pretty new to Bayesian analyses so might be barking up the wrong tree entirely, are there alternative models which might provide different insights on this problem? Many thanks!
