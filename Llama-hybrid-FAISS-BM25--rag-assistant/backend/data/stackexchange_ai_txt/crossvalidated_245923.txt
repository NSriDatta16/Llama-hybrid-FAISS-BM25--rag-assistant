How to run regression diagnostics in big data setting

Many statistical software has powerful tools to help us to run regression diagnostics. For example, in R, we have many diagnostic plots for regression model (residuals vs fitted, QQ plot on residuals, Leverage vs residuals etc.) How can we do this if we have millions of data points (The plots will not be readable by human.)?
