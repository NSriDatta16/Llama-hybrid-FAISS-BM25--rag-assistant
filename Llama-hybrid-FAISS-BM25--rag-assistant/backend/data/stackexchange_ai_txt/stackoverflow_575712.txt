Note that if you use global variables then you should check if any of them need to get cleaned up. If so you should have a CleanUp method of your module and call that during the unload event of your main form. Another gotcha is sometimes the ORDER of how you unload things is important. By doing an explicit cleanup you can control that. In VB6 you should rarely use END. If you have any circular references the program will remain as a process chewing up resource causing various strange bugs when you fire it up again. With COM objects is very easy to in inadvertently setup a chain of object thats is circularly linked. End exists as a compatibility holdover from previous version of QuickBASIC and Visual BASIC. It did not start causing major problems until VB 4.X introduced the ability to create classes. It started gaining attention in 5.X. Prior to this one of the only ways to make this happen in VB 3.X is to have two forms set references to each other.
