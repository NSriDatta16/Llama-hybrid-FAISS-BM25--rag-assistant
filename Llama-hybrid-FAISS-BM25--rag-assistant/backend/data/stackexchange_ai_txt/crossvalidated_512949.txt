In the setting of logistic regression, though not in general, you can optimise with different penalties for the two possible errors simply by adjusting the intercept ('bias') term or equivalently by adjusting the decision threshold. That is, if $$\mathrm{logit}\, {P(Y=1|X=x)}= \alpha+\beta x$$ with a threshold of $p$ is optimal for equal loss, and you want losses of $a$ for false positives and $b$ for false negatives, you can set $ \alpha\mapsto \alpha+\log(b/a)$ , or make the equivalent change to $p$ . Strictly speaking, this is only true if the logistic regression model is correctly specified, but it's a good approximation.
