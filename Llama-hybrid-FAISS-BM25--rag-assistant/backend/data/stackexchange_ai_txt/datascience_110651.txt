Why should MLE be considered in Logistic Regression when it cannot give a definite solution?

If MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) cannot give a proper closed-form solution for the parameters in Logistic Regression, why is this method discussed so much? Why not just stick to Gradient Descent for estimating parameters?
