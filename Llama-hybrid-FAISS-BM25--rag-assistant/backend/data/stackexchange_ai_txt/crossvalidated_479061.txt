Mean-centering variables in glmer

I have the following model in r that compares the differences between dives where whales fed and dives where whales didn't fed (distribution is binomial: presence of feeding (foraging) = 1, abscence = 0). Whale (18 individuals) is used as random factor. I included several metrics in the model: dive duration, maximum depth, descent/ascent rate, etc... and used scale on all numerical metrics (scale()) g_model |z|) (Intercept) 0.5621 0.1600 3.514 0.000441 *** max_depths 1.9123 0.1863 10.266 Two of the values do not make sense at all: duration and pd_times (post-dive duration). Feeding dives are usually longer and since they have a high energetic cost whales usually rest for a while after at surface. Nevertheless, estimates are negative for both metrics. I know that just because that's common knowledge it doesn't mean my data will follow those assumptions but when I make boxplots of the data, duration is quite higher in feeding dives, contrary to what the model says (graph below). The post-dive duration graph is just weird (I suppose it is because of the outliers) and I can't really figure out anything out of it (also if you know what I should do to correct this boxplot it would be awesome! Graph below as well). It was suggested that I should mean-center the variables, how can I do it? Or did I already did that by scaling? I already looked for correlation between variables and found nothing. Looked at differences between individuals (only one individual in 18 performed longer non-feeding dives than feeding dives, and thats because it only had 2 long non-feeding dives). I can't really figure it out. F = feeding dives/ NF = non-feeding dives DURATION PD_TIMES Thank you!
