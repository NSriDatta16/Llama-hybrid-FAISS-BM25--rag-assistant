You got the correct answer (HTTP content-type header mandating XML parsing) and it seems it's fixed. I'll just add a minor hint on how you can figure out what's wrong from within Opera itself. Two possible ways: 1) Info panel This is not visible by default, but if you open the panel bar on the left (press F4 to toggle if you don't see it), then click the small plus sign at the bottom, you can enable "Info" in the menu. The info panel shows some assorted information about the page currently open, including encoding and MIME type. 2) Opera Dragonfly Press Ctrl-Shift-I to open developer tools (or go through menus to Tools > Advanced > Opera Dragonfly) Go to "Network" tab, then re-load site. You will see the request and can review the headers. Comparing this with corresponding information from Firebug would have shown you the difference in Content-type headers. (Here you will also see that Opera sends an "Accept" header that contains "application/xhtml+xml". This means "Hi server, if you happen to have this file in real XHTML format I would understand that just fine.". Perhaps your server-side framework saw that header and wrongly responded with the XHTML content-type even though the content was invalid?)
