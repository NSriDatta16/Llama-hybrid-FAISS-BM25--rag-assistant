Quadratic programming and Lagrange multiplier in SVM

I am a little confused because for some simple functions and constraints, using the Lagrange multiplier will be able to solve for the variables. However, in the SVM Lagrange expression, I learned that we had to use quadratic programming to solve for the maximum AFTER we express it in terms of Lagrange expression with some constraints: Does that mean this problem can't be solved only using the Lagrange method? I'm not familiar with quadratic programming or the Lagrange multiplier. Could someone please kindly explain the relationship between the two? Preferably in the context of Support Vector Machines. Thank you so much!
