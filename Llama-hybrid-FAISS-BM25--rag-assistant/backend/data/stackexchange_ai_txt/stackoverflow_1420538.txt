Excel can be used. There is an AVERAGEIF function but nothing similar for STDEV , so an alternate two step method is required. The data can be 'transposed' by adding two columns with formulas to the right. Assuming your data is in column A and B, the formula in column C would be; =IF(A2=0,B2,"") In column D it would be; =IF(A2=1,B2,"") Then the new columns can have formulas added to the bottom for Average =AVERAGE(C2:C7) And for StdDev =STDEV(C2:C7)
