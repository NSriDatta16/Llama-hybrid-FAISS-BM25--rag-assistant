I'm not aware of a simple way to compare. I've more read that you want a diverse set across different types of algorithms to reduce "group think", so you would choose an SVM, a NN, a decision tree, etc. If at layer 2 they tend to vote together, that either means they were all fooled for the same reason, or you found predictable data.
