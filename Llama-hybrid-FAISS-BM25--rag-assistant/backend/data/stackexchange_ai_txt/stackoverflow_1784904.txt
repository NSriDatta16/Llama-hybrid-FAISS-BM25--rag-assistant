SMTP is a message transfer agent (MTA), responsible only for handling the transfer of mail from one point (the client, perhaps) to another (the mailbox server, such as a POP or IMAP server). SMTP servers aren't the right tool for ultimately handling mail coming INTO a domain -- they only handle transferring the mail coming into a domain to another app, such as the aforementioned POP or IMAP server, which then know how to sort and store that mail. In short, the Default SMTP Virtual Server isn't the tool you're looking for for your project. From this other StackOverflow question , it looks like there are a few SMTP servers which are intended for development use but which might serve the purpose you seek -- they accept incoming messages and then write them to files (in some manner, and with some tweaking).
