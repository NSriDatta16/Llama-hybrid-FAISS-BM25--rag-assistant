You can use: java.io.File for that it may not contain all the information you need ( like the information of the physical storage ) but it will help you to create most of the logic you need. You may take a look at muucommander which is an open source file manager. They've already done a lot of work to make this kind of stuff, and the code is very clean and accesible. Here's a working sample: import java.io.File; public class FileWalkTest { public static void main(String[] args) { File file = new File("/Users/oscarreyes/code/"); printInfo( file ); } public static void printInfo( File dir ) { for( File child : dir.listFiles() ) { if( child.isDirectory() ) { System.out.println( "\n"+child.getAbsolutePath()); printInfo( child ); } else { System.out.printf("%s read:%s write:%s xecute:%s, size:%d lastModified:%d %n", child.getName(), child.canRead(), child.canWrite(), child.canExecute(), child.length(), child.lastModified()); } } System.out.println(); } }
