Java: Converting a char to a string

I have just done this in eclipse: String firstInput = removeSpaces(myIn.readLine()); String first = new String(firstInput.charAt(0)); However, eclipse complains that: The constructor String(char) is undefined How do I convert a char to a string then?? Thanks EDIT I tried the substring method but it didn't work for some reason but gandalf's way works for me just fine! Very straightforward!
