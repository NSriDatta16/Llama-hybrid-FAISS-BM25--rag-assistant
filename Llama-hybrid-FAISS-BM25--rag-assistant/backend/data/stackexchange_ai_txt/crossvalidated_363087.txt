Can I use Hamiltionian Monte Carlo when my likelihood is not a direct function of my parameters?

By "not a direct function of my parameters" I mean the following. I have some observed K-dimensional data and a model that can generate synthetic data based on 6 free parameters. I use this model to generate synthetic data sets (by setting the 6 free parameters) and compare them with my observed data using the (log) Poisson likelihood rate as my likelihood: $$Lkl = 2 \sum_i m_i - n_i + n_l ln\frac{n_i}{m_i}$$ where $i$ is the ith K-dimensional bin, $n_i$ is the number of observed data points in that bin, and $m_i$ is the number of synthetic data points in that bin. Each model generated by setting the 6-parameters to some value, will have its own $m_i$ distribution. This is what I mean with "my likelihood is not a direct function of my parameters" . I've been using Bayesian MCMC with some success but the convergence is really slow. I learned about Hamiltonian Monte Carlo , but this method requires the gradient of the log posterior, which means obtaining the gradient of my likelihood. Can this method be applied to my problem at all?
