I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to achieve, but amsmath's align* environment might do what you want (without resorting to minipages): \documentclass{article} \usepackage{amsmath} \begin{document} \begin{align*} x&=y & X&=Y & a&=b+c & mn&=ab\\ x’&=y’ & X’&=Y’ & a’&=b & m'n'&=a'b'\\ x+x’&=y+y’ & X+X’&=Y+Y’ & a’b&=c’b & m'&=a' \end{align*} \end{document} As to your minipage question: it requires a width because TeX needs to know where to break the lines. If you don't want the line-breaking algorithm to be used, you probably don't want a minipage. Edit: If you want multiple columns and don't care about the vertical alignment of material across the columns, that can be obtained easily enough with the multicols package: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{multicols} \usepackage{lipsum}% just for some example text \begin{document} % The * version allows the columns to have ragged bottoms. % The argument 2 is the number of columns. \begin{multicols*}{2} \lipsum[1]% one paragraph of Lorem ipsum.. filler text \vfil% fills the remainder of the column with white space \columnbreak% force a column break \lipsum[2]% another paragraph of text \vfil% fills the remainder of the column with white space \end{multicols*} \end{document}
