There are no hard, exact figure for .NET code. If you run on 32 bit Windows; your process can address up to 2 GB, 3 GB if the /3GB switch is used on Windows Server 2003. If you run a 64 bit process on a 64 bit box your process can address up to 8 TB of address space, if that much RAM is present. This is not the whole story however, since the CLR takes some overhead for each process. At the same time, .NET will try to allocate new memory in chunks; and if the address space is fragmented, that might mean that you cannot allocate more memory, even though some are available.
