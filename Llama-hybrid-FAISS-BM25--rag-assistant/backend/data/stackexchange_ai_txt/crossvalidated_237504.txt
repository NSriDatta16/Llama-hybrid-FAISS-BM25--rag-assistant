That's not quite right.... The effect of having a single kid would be a weighted average of the two (depending on the probabilities of each event occurring). Let $y$ be some outcome variable. Let $x_1$ be an indicator variable for category 1 and $x_2$ be an indicator variable for category 2. So the linear regression gives you a conditional expectation function: $$ E[y \mid x_1, x_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 $$ Let $p_1 = P(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0)$ and $p_2 = P(x_1 = 0, x_2 = 1)$. We can alway condition down: $$ \begin{align*} E[y \mid x_1 + x_2 = 1] &= E[E[y \mid x_1, x_2] \mid \ x_1 + x_2 = 1] \quad \quad \text{by law of iterated expectations}\\ &=\beta_0 + \frac{p_1}{p_1 + p_2} \beta_1 + \frac{p_2}{p_1 + p_2} \beta_2 \end{align*}$$
