Stationarity is a theoretical concept which is then modified to other forms like Weak Sense Stationarity which can be tested easily. Most of the tests like adf test as you have mentioned test for linear conditions only. the ARCH effects are made for series which do not have autocorrelation in the first order but there is dependence in the squared series. The ARMA-GARCH process you talk about, here the second order dependence is removed using the GARCH part and then any dependence in the linear terms is captured by the ARMA process. The way to go about is to check for the autocorrelation of the squared series, if there is dependence, then apply the GARCH models and check the residuals for any linear time series properties which can then be modelled using ARMA processes.
