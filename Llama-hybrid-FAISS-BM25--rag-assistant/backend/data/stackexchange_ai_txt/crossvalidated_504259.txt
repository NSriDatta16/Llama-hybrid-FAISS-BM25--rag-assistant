Can we do sampling with different periods for time series data?

Briefly, I want to estimate the effects of average annual advertising spending on sales of $n$ listed companies (say $C_1, C_2, \cdots, C_n$ ) on a particular stock market. My question is that can I select different periods for different stocks? For example can I use a dataset with a stock $C_1$ in $2010-2017$ period but for stock $C_2$ in $2013-2019$ , both are annual data? I guess that I don't need to choose all stocks with THE SAME periods, right? If possible, can you tell me what results in statistics or probability (e.g theorems) might explain why I am correct/incorrect? Any comments or suggestions are highly appreciated! Thanks!
