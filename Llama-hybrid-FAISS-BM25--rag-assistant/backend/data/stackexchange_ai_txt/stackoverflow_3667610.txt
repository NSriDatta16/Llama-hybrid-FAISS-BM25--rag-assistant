I would add some other reasons these things evolve, and I have seen this in more than one place: - Developer lock-in. Once you have the devs coding in a non-transferable skill set, it's harder for them to leave. - Author lock-in. Once you have several apps under maintenance dependent on the framework, you have the organisation dependent on the administrative group. - Political control. The centralisation allows the framework to become a channel for political control.
