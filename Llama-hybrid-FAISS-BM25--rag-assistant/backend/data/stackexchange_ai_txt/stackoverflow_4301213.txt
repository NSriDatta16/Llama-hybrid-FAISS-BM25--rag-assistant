If you are talking about changing the database connection to switch between SQL Server then that works fine. If you want to switch between different database systems - e.g. Oracle, MySQL etc. then you'll need a provider... and you'll need to modify the storage types for each field to match the constraints of the underlying system. You might want to check out the EF CTP for Code First which is capable of regenerating the storage layer at runtime by talking to the provider to find the best storage type match given the CLR type.
