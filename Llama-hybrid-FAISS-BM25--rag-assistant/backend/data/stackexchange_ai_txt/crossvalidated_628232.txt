@Ben is correct that you don't have enough information. However, you can approximate the mean and standard deviation of a transformed variable using the delta method . The delta method for the mean says that $\overline{f(x)} \approx f(\bar x) + \frac{1}{2} f^{''}(\bar x) \cdot \textrm{Var}(x)$ (see here ); in your case $f(x) = \exp(x)$ , so if $M$ and $S$ are the mean and standard deviation on the log scale, then the mean on the original scale should be $\exp(M) + \frac{1}{2} \exp(M) S^2 = (1+S^2/2) \exp(M)$ . The standard deviation on the transformed scale is approximately $f'(\bar x) \sigma(x)$ , so your original-scale SD should be approximately $S \exp(M)$ . The information in @Glen_b's answer gives you some information about the likely accuracy of the approximations: for example, their expression translates to $\exp(M)(1 + S^2/2 + \textrm{skew}/6 + ...)$ (where "skew" is estimated as the mean of $(x - \bar x)^3$ on the log scale, not normalized in any way). If you have some guess about the magnitude of the skew of the log-scale data you can use this to decide whether the approximation for the mean is likely to be OK ... I'd encourage you to do some experiments with made-up data (e.g. using rlnorm() in R) to confirm that I didn't make any mathematical errors.
