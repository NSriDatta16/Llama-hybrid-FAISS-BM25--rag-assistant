In the onet.xml file for your site definition be sure to include your feature under the SiteFeatures/WebFeatures section like below: If your feature is a site collection feature, then it goes under SiteFeatures. If it is a site feature then it goes under WebFeatures. Now, to automatically add an instance of your webpart to your webpart page you will be editing the elements.xml (elements manifest file) for your webpart deployment feature and embedding markup for the webpart instance within a tag like so: Microsoft.SharePoint, Version=12.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71e9bce111e9429c Microsoft.SharePoint.WebPartPages.ImageWebPart None $Resources:wp_SiteImage; /_layouts/images/homepage.gif $Resources:core,sitelogo_wss; ]]> The above markup was graciously borrowed from Using Features to Deploy Web Part Pages in WSS . I hope this helps.
