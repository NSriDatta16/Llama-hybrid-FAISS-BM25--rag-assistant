Should I run my regression testing programs on both AMD and Intel chips?

Right now I plan to test on 32-bit, 64-bit, Windows XP Home, Windows XP Pro, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Home Basic, and Windows 7 Ultimate ... all with the latest service pack. However, now I'm wondering if it's worthwhile to test on both AMD and Intel for all the listed scenarios above or would it be a waste of time? Note: this is a security application for everyday average users.
