Is this really a good idea to save battery life ? Probably not. AFAIK, the GPS radio will be on the whole time, and that is the biggest battery drain in what you're describing. The way to save battery is to remove updates, so the GPS radio shuts off. However, the next time you request location updates, it will take some time for GPS to acquire its initial fix. If the user is indoors (no GPS coverage), increase both If you cannot get a GPS fix, turn the radio off, and try again some number of minutes later (or based on a UI event or something). There is no sense leaving the GPS on if it is not doing you any good. If the battery is too low, increase both If the battery is too low, turn off GPS. Either switch to a low-power provider (use Criteria to find one) or go without location data. Let the user decide what is "too low" via a preference.
