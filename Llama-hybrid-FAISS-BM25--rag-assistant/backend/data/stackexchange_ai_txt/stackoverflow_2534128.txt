You can run cgacutil , which is in the Windows folder. It should give you a version number of the compact framework installed onto the device. It's likely you dont have the correct compact framework installed. If you dont have cgacutil, its likely that compact framework isnt installed to the device at all. In this case download the latest version of the framework (currently 3.5, available here ). The install may take around 7MB of space from your main memory. If storage space is tight, it can be installed to external memory, with some potential consequences as discussed here
