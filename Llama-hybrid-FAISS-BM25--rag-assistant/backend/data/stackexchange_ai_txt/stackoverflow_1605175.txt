Performing operations on (specifically how to add a List of) Long in Scala

I've tried a number of techniques, but I keep bumping into (fragment of wtf.scala):3: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives (Int)Int (Char)Int (Short)Int (Byte)Int cannot be applied to (Long) in one way or another. As an example, here are two functions to reproduce the problem. sumInt works fine... but sumLong errors. I don't get it. // compiles (and works) fine def sumInt(list: List[Int]): Int = list.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) // compile time error. no + define on Long? I don't get it def sumLong(list: List[Long]): Long = list.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)
