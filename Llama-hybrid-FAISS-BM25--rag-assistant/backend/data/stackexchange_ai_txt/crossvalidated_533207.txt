Assessing the performance of a model that has a policy that makes it worse

Assuming that a churn model will be used to prevent customer churn using policies that encourage customers with higher churn score (higher likelihood of churn probability) to stay loyal to a company. How should I asses the quality, like AUC score, of my model over time? For customers with a low churn score where nothing is supposed to be done, the model validation does not change. As for customers that a higher score (biggest chance of churn) the company will act in such a way that they remain loyal therefore when I'll be looking at the model performance in that group it will probably be affected and not be as good as it would without intervention. I've already seen an approach where a control group is made out of some customers however no real company in the world will be willing to sacrifice some customers in order to make a rigorous statistical validation of their model. In another words, is there any statistical way to validate the model's performance over time that takes into account policies that would worsen its performance? Or what should I be doing in this situation to asses my model performance?
