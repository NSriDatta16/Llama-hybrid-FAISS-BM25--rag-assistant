Making jquery tmpl without a lot of extra script tags

I've been reading about the jQuery template plugin http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/ as a means of binding data to markup. All the examples seem to show that you define the template in a script new script tag. I'd actually prefer not to clutter my html with all those script tags. Is there a better way to organize this? Maybe with a templates folder full of scripts that get loaded dynamically?
