Please help me understand mobile Safari's text resizing

Mobile Safari resizes some of the text by default, including and elements. I searched SO to see how I could prevent that and found questions such as these: Font size issue with iPhone Preventing iPhone scaling when rotated font size change after orientation screen change to horizontal Notice that the answer to all of those is the CSS property: -webkit-text-size-adjust:none; This works great for maintaining relative text size between header and paragraph elements on mobile Safari. However, I stumbled across a blog post just now titled Beware of -webkit-text-size-adjust:none : What that does is prevent WebKit-based browsers from resizing text. Not even full page zoom resizes the text. Now, how can preventing your users from resizing text be a good idea? According to Apple’s Safari CSS Reference (JavaScript required) , -webkit-text-size-adjust "Specifies a size adjustment for displaying text content in Safari on iOS". When given a value of “none”, the documentation specifies that "The text size is not adjusted". Now, I took the property description to mean that the relative text size will not be automatically adjusted, not that the text size can't be adjusted by the user, but the author says that his testing shows that text indeed cannot be adjusted in WebKit-based browsers when a value of 'none' is specified. (I am currently in a position where I am unable to verify this at all, but I am going to assume he and others who make the claim are correct.) So my question is this: how can one gain control over the relative text size between headers and paragraphs in mobile Safari without sacrificing accessibility?
