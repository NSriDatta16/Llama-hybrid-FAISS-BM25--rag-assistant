A large p -value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis, in this case the null hypothesis is that the data is MCAR, no patterns exists in the missing data. Proving the existence of MAR data is difficult but you can try if data is related between them. The package Hmisc in R has some graphical tools to see the relationship between each variable. Another idea could be to do a logistic regression with the outcome being missing vs no missing for each variable and see if any other predictor is associated with the missingness of the variable. As a final note, I would say to think about your data and the definition of MCAR. Do you think it's plausible for the data to be MCAR? If so, then I would say there is evidence that the data is MCAR. Hope this helps.
