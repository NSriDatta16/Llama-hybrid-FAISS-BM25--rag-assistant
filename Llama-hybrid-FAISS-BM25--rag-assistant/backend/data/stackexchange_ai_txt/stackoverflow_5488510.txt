Check if music has ended, OnStopped?

Is it possible to make SFML 1.6 handle end of music by itself? Currently I have this: //in music.cpp music.Play() //in main.cpp //on every frame check for end of music if(music.getStatus() == Sound::Stopped) loadNextMusicFile(); Isn't there a way in SFML to just say, "Play until music stopped, then load the next," without implementing this yourself? Or at least a more "elegant" way of noticing when the music stopped (like an OnStopped event)?
