I can see the reasoning behind not wanting to have hyperlink styles which strongly clash with the regular text, as they can be distracting while reading. But I think that's rarely a problem. If you look at a site like Wikipedia , the links are very visually distinct from regular text, but it doesn't at all make the text harder to read So the only real reason to only subtly differentiate inline links from standard text is for aesthetic purposes. I think that's what the SFGate designer has done. The link colors they use are easily differentiable when they are not inline (e.g. the Recent Entries or Categories panes), but they are perhaps harder to pick out in the text. Since they've already carefully chosen a good color scheme that works aesthetically, and you generally don't want to employ too many different colors in a design or use different-colored links in different places, there's not a lot of options. They could have: bolded the links underlined them used dotted underlines (a nice compromise) or use rollovers All of which would help to differentiate links from text without needing to give the links a brighter color. But you also have to take into account the type of page it is and the usage pattern of visitors. If you have a lot of inline links, or if users are mainly there to read an article, not follow embedded links, then you don't want the links to draw so much attention. The SFGate blog is more akin to a digital newspaper. It's not a standard news blog where links are the primary content, or Wikipedia, where the embedded links are also a major focus of the site. Basically, the few links in the blog posts are only there to provide a little supplementary info for the curious but are expected to be ignored by most readers. And they do stand out enough so that while reading the article, you will see the links as you come across them.
