If you have the java source files you just need to add the directory to you .gwt.xml file. For instance if you had a subdirectory called shared you would add the following line: The folder called shared would have to be one level under your main package. So if you project .gwt.xml file is at com.yourdomain.project the shared folder.package would be com.yourdomain.project.shared. Refer to the Source Path section at http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideModules If you dont have the source and only have the classes you have to import a module as Hilbrand has stated.
