MySQL can import CSV files very quickly onto tables using the LOAD DATA INFILE command. It can also read from CSV files directly, bypassing any import procedures, by using the CSV storage engine . Importing it onto native tables with LOAD DATA INFILE has a start up cost, but after that you can INSERT/UPDATE much faster, as well as index fields. Using the CSV storage engine is almost instantaneous at first, but only sequential scan will be fast. Update : This article (scroll down to the section titled Instant Data Loads ) talks about using both approaches to loading CSV data onto MySQL, and gives examples.
