I think you could use time series modeling algorithm as @Student_T said. Also you can make window time to find relation between new donate and previous donate and you can use amount, may be people with high payment and low payment have different behavior. first of all you should change your data in a way that fill gaps. I mean you should add data about month that a person have not any payment. after that you should make a table like this: person_id / month(or day or week or 3month) / count of payment / count of payment last month/ sum of amount that paid last month/ Is paid last month?/ then you should find whether your filed is useful and independent or not. and try to add other filed. and then build your model. good luck.
