Java Scanner Headache

I have a text file which looks like: name1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 name2 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 i.e., a plaintext label followed by a few rows with 1/0 separated by spaces. The number of rows of 1/0 is variable, but each row between any two particular labels should have the same number of 1/0s (though might potentially not). How do I grab each name+rows chunk with a scanner? Is there any elegant way to enforce the consistency on the number of rows (and provide some sort of feedback if they aren't consistent)? I'm thinking there might be a convenient way with clever delimiter specification, but I can't seem to get that working.
