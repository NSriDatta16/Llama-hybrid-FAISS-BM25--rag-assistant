jQuery drag-and-drop DIV selection with images and text

I'm using the jQuery tableDnD plugin to make a drag-and-drop list out of a table displaying a list of images for the user to rearrange. The plugin uses an ID on the tag of the formatting table to rearrange the cells. When I drag and drop specifically clicking on a spot inside the table cell with no images/content, it works fine. However, when I click on the image (or inside a div containing text) withgin the table cell and try to drag+drop, the text/image gets selected and the rearrange script is not triggered. Neither blocking the select function with css or javascript has worked - any idea? Example tableDnD code: http://tablednd.googlecode.com/svn-history/r12/trunk/index.html Sample rows from the table in question: images/6/PICT0001.JPG [Delete Image] images/6/PICT0006.JPG [Delete Image]
