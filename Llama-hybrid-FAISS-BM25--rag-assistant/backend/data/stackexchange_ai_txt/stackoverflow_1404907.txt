If he installs SP1 of Visual Studio 2008 he'll find it much easier to use. SP1 includes things like drag-drop into Source Control Explorer to add files, easier local folder mapping and links to open the local folder in windows explorer from the source control explorer. You might also want him to install the TFS 2008 Power Tools - especially the Windows Shell Extensions (not selected by default in the installer) as they make it easier to deal with files outside of Visual Studio. This is very handy for word docs etc.
