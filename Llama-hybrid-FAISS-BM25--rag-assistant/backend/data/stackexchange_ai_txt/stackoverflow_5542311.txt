Maybe the Priority property might help? http://help.infragistics.com/Help/NetAdvantage/NET/2008.2/CLR2.0/html/Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinToolbars.v8.2~Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars.SharedProps~Priority.html If there's not enough room to show all the tools then some will have to be hidden, but that lets you pick which ones are more likely to be shown. Otherwise I'd suggest docking the toolbar on a separate line to the other tool bars or break things up a little with some PopUpMenu tools.
