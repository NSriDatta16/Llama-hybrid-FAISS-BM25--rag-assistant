I use SIFR in a number of sites, CMSs and web apps. SIFR's fallback behaviour is quite good, so you don't need to worry much about compatibility. It works fine with all major flash-enabled browsers. Due to the replacement of "native" HTML tags it's perfect for SEO, too. Setting sIFR up is tricky, be prepared for some initial debugging, changing relative paths, and so on. I tend to forget how to set it up every time, it's not very intuitive. But when it works, it works all right. On older machines, you will notice the split second SIFR needs to do the actual replacement. It can be notable and is not nice. On modern, fast machines you will notice nothing, as long as you just replace a few headlines and such. Sifr is not suitable for replacing entire paragraphs of text. An alternative I have been meaning to check out some time is Cufon . While many people here like it, I can't say much about it myself. It's definitely also worth a look before you commit yourself to a solution.
