Personally, I think the next great web development framework will be "functional" in nature, i.e. it will use a functional language, and all of the views, controllers and such will be functional equivalents. We've already moved in this direction with Linq. See Beating the Averages by Paul Graham, in which he describes how he was able to outsmart his competitors by building his web applications in Lisp: http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html
