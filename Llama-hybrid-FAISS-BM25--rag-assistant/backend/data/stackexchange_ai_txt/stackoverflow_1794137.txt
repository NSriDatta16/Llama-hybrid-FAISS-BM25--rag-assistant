How do I do this in Jquery? It's about classes and adding something to the tag

var Average_rating = a number between 1 and 5 Not so great Quite good Good Great! Excellent! I am building a rating system. How do I use JQuery to add "selected = selected" to one of the option values, depending on the average_rating? How can I say... Add "selected = selected" to anything with class "p_rating_star" where average_rating = that class's value (1-5)?
