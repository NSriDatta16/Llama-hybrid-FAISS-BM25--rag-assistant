Having 1 drawable folder instead of 3 in eclipse

Hey all, right now I have a drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-ldpi folder inside my res directory... I hear that android now filters out applications based on screen size and density. All of my images are inside the drawable-hdpi folder. Should I make just 1 folder called "drawable" and delete the other 3? Or should I convert all the images to the proper size and place them inside all three folders?
