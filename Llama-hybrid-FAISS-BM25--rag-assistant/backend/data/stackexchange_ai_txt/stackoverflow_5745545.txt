iPhone: Recognize the human voice accurately

I am developing an application where I need to recognize human(to be precise baby crying) voice. I referred following articles for recording sound on iPhone microphone and sample it. http://mobileorchard.com/tutorial-detecting-when-a-user-blows-into-the-mic/ http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/aurioTouch/Introduction/Intro.html http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/SpeakHere/Introduction/Intro.html ...but I didn't get how can I accurately distinguish the human voice from any other voice. Any help or sample code on this would be really helpful. So far I wrote following code: -(void)levelTimerCallback:(NSTimer *)timer { [recorder updateMeters]; const double ALPHA = 0.05; double peakPowerForChannel = pow(10, (0.05 * [recorder peakPowerForChannel:0])); lowPassResults = ALPHA * peakPowerForChannel + (1.0 - ALPHA) * lowPassResults; NSLog(@"frequency: %f", lowPassResults); NSLog(@"Average input: %f Peak input: %f", [recorder averagePowerForChannel:0], [recorder peakPowerForChannel:0]); if (lowPassResults Thanks.
