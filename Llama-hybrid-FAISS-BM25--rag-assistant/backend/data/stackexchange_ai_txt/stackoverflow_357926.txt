Use Wireshark . Look into the file format for its dumps and convert your dump to it. Its very simple. Its called the pcap file format . Then you can open it in Wireshark no problem and it should be able to recognize the contents. Wireshark supports many dozens if not many hundred communication formats at various OSI layers (including TCP/IP/HTTP) and is great for this kind of debugging.
