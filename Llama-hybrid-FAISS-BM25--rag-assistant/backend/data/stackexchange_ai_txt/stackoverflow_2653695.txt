Flex 3 - Full unicode support fonts and CSS

I'm developping a web application that will be used either in Europe or in Asia (specially Japan -Hiragana, Kanji and Katana-, China and Korea). I'm using the following fonts: - ericssonga628.TTF - HelveticaNeueLTStd-Lt.otf - HelveticaNeueLTStd-LtEx.otf - HelveticaNeueLTStd-Bd.otf - HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdEx.otf When I tried to display Japanese characters, I don't get anything. I guess these fonts don't support East Asian characters... Do you know of any equivalent fonts? Also, I was thinking of creating a CSS for each language (or pack of languages) when the user changes the display language. For example, if the user selects "japanese", I'll use the japanese stylesheet. However, how do I switch from a CSS to another? Thanks in advance for your answers. Regards,
