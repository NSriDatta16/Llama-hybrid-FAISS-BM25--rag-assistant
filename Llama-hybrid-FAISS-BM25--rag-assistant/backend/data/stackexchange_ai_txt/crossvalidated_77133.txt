Firstly, this is a very small sample size (4 observations), hopefully you have more, or at least have the same four observations for many different patients. If not, it will be difficult to find a model. Generally it is good to have a sample size greater than 100, or at a bare minimum, 20. Secondly, the survey (6 questions) is also small. Does the patient receive the same questions each time? If so, they can be more prepared next time. But, this doesn't answer your question, but tell your sibling to seriously consider the set-up of the survey. That being said, if this is the only data you have, there are a couple quick hacks. First, just regress the survey data on the index (you can make it just 1:4 as long as the surveys were taken at regular intervals): > summary(lm(c(4,5,5,6)~c(1,2,3,4))) Call: lm(formula = c(4, 5, 5, 6) ~ c(1, 2, 3, 4)) Residuals: 1 2 3 4 -0.1 0.3 -0.3 0.1 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.5000 0.3873 9.037 0.0120 * c(1, 2, 3, 4) 0.6000 0.1414 4.243 0.0513 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.3162 on 2 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9, Adjusted R-squared: 0.85 F-statistic: 18 on 1 and 2 DF, p-value: 0.05132 Here we see that the slope has a p-value of .0513, making it significant with 94.87% confidence. On average, at each step, the patient improves by .6 points. It seems obvious that there is a significant increase over time based on the sample size. However, the next question would be why does the increase occur?
