Here's what you need to do. Start by never reading javascript tutorials from a Java site again. Different monsters entirely, plus the tutorials on the site you're referencing are horrible. Second, get a copy of Javascript the Good Parts, http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742/ This book is perhaps the most useful book ever written (in my opinion) about the language itself. It doesn't say anything about dealing with DOM API's. I encourage you to learn the language itself before getting too deep into javascript libraries like jQuery. It'll do you a load of good sooner rather than later. Once you're at least somewhat familiar with the proper ways to use javascript as a language, start investing your time into one library or another. jQuery is probably the most used, well loved, and kindest library out there. It will make dealing with cross-browser crap SO much easier for you.
