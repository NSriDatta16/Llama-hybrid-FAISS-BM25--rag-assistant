I had this headache a few months ago. I was trying to get a shell script running with admin privileges that shutdown my computer at a certain time. I feel your pain. I used the BetterAuthorizationSample which was a total nightmare to wade through. But I took the most pragmatic route - I didn't bother trying to understand everything that was going on, I just grabbed the guts of the code. It didn't take me that long to get it doing what I wanted. I can't remember exactly what I altered, but you're welcome to check out my code: http://github.com/johngallagher/TurnItOff I hope this helps on your quest for a secure application!
