How to learn Machine Learning

I want to get into machine learning. I've been in information security for the last 10 years so i have an IT background. Where is the best place to start: Can anyone recommend a good book? And also a platform i can use to practice (preferably free) Also if there are any online courses someone could recommend that would be great. I looked into AWS's offering of machine learning but that is not included in the free tier. Any help/advice would be much appreciated. Thank You.
