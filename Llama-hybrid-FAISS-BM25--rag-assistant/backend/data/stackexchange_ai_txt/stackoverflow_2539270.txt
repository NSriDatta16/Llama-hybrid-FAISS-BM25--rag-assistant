Git is a version control system with an attitude of collaboration and sharing. There is practically no way you can enforce a specific pattern of access and sharing. If the people who're using git don't want to follow your rules, the tool is not going to help you much. Although I personally think this kind of organizational behaviour is stupid, I'm sure somewhere someone thinks it's a good idea. Maybe you're concerned that your unruly employees work on the wrong projects, or you're desperate to keep changes out of the code.
