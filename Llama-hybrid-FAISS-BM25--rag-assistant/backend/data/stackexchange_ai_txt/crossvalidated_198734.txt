comparing averages of different sized groups

I want to look at the number of arrests per head of population in some counties. What I am doing is taking the census for each period and using 10 year periods (so dividing by 10). For 1810-19 I divide by 10 and compare with the 1811 census; for 1820-29 I divide by 10 and compare with the 1821 census, The problem I have is that the data only begin in 1805 so for 1805-9 I have 6 years to compare with the 1801 census. Is this OK? OK, sorry for being vague, I want to look at the number of persons indicted per head of population per year. So, i am taking the number dividing it by the population given in the census for that decade, times 100,000 and then divide by 10. This is ok for the actual decades (for 1810-19 I am using the 1811 census and for 1820-29 I am using the 1821 census). The problem is for the period 1805-1809. If i do the above but divide by 5 for the 5 years, can i still compare the 3 periods?
