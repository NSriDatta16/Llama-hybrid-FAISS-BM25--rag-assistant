In .NET, when a WeakReference is created, the GC is asked for a handle/opaque token representing the reference. Then, when needed, WeakReference uses this handle to ask the GC if that handle is still valid (i.e. the original object still exists) - and if so, it can get the actual object reference. So this is building a list of tokens/handles against object addresses (and presumably maintaining that list during defragmentation etc) I'm not sure I 100% understand the three bullets, so I hesitate to guess which (if any) that is closest to.
