Firefox: "Error loading script"

"Error loading script" occurs under FireFox 3 if I "quickly click" different links on my web site (Asp.Net MVC + jQuery, full postbacks). It is rather easy task to reproduce this bug. But I cannot understand why it occurs? Every time it shows different failed script file. All JavaScript files are included before closing tag. Errors are trapped in window.onerror handler. If I simply ignore errors with message 'Error loading script' everything works fine. But this seems to be not the best solution, there must be some reason. It's a pity but this post was not helpful for me: Firefox ‘Error loading script’ loading Google Analytics in FF2 Another resources that describe similar problem: Browser Scripting Errors ... Firefox 'Error loading script ' issue when implementing GA scripts. There is error log entry: Error message: "Error loading script" Location.href: http://blah-blah-blah/General Url: http://blah-blah-blah/Scripts/localization/locale-uk.js Line: 1 UserAgent: mozilla, 1.9.0.11 Can you help me with this annoying bug? Thanks.
