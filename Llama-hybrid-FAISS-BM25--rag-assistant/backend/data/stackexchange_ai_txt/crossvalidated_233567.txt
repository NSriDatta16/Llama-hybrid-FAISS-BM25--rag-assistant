Let's take a look at what information you have: Whether the customer purchased anything $(Y_K)$. This is binary. If the customer made a purchase, which incentive threshold the they were willing to buy at $(Y_L)$. This is ordinal, and ranges from 0 to 3. The value of this is meaningless when $Y_K=0$. The amount of money the customer spent ($Y_M$). This is a continuous, positive value, and does not include customers for whom $Y_K=0$. The test treatment $(X)$, which could plausibly affect the above $Y$ values. I's often helpful to try to model the process that generated the data you're analyzing. The amount of money a person spends $(Y_M)$ appears to be influenced by the incentive they desire ($Y_L$), which is contingent on whether they decide to purchase anything at all ($Y_K$). This suggests something like the following model: $$\begin{align} Y_{K} & \sim\text{Bernoulli}(p_{x})\\ Y_{L} & \sim\text{Ordered-Logistic}(\eta_{x},c)\\ Y_{M} & \sim\text{LogNormal}(\alpha_{L}+\beta_{x}, \sigma)\end{align}$$ $p_x$ is probability of making a purchase for group $X$. You can either put a prior on the $p$ parameters directly or use a logistic regression. The ordered logistic regression has $\eta_x$ as the predictor for which incentive group the customer would choose given their A/B group membership. $c$ is a vector of cutpoint parameters that determine what values of $Y_L$ $\eta$ refers over its range. These parameters can be transformed to calculate the posterior probability of a given treatment selecting each incentive level. For more details, I'd recommend reading up on ordered logit regression. $\alpha_L$ is the intercept for $Y_M$, and it depends on the value of $Y_L$. This should (in theory) take care of the multimodality. Given that you know what the incentive thresholds are, you should use informed priors for this parameter. $\beta_x$ is the effect of one of your treatment groups. I suggested a log-normal distribution since it is easily parameterized and is often used for positive data with a skew, but you should feel free to try other options. You may also wish to consider investigating whether $\beta_x$ or $\sigma$ should vary among levels of $Y_L$. You should then be able to a loss function to the posterior distribution of the parameters to determine when you should stop the test. The whole model (including posterior transformations and loss function calculation) could be implemented in Stan .
