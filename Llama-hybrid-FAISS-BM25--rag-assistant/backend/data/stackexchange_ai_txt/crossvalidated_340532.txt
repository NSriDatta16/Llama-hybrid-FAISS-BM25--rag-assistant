Wide vs. Narrow datasets - Machine Learning question

Machine Learning questions here. Suppose I have a dataset of labeled 1,000 records, and 200 features - and I use R to test out a neural net or random forest's abilities to predict a certain feature. What, if anything, should change if I instead have 1,000 features, and 200 records? Is feature selection my only option?
