"Most influential" is a very different notion from "everyone should read". I am not qualified to answer the first - you'd need someone who is an historian of statistics - but for the second, here are some: Statistics as Principled Argument by Robert Abelson should be read by anyone doing or using statistics in the pursuit of science, humanities, etc. William S. Cleveland's two books on graphics: The elements of graphing data and Visualizing Data . For statisticians, I'd put these ahead of even Tufte's work, not because Tufte isn't worthwhile but because a) Cleveland wrote with statisticians as his intended audience and b) Cleveland based his recommendations on experimental data about how people look at graphs, rather than intuition. Exploratory Data Analysis by John Tukey. It's dated but valuable - you can do a lot with a pencil and paper and a brain (at least, if your brain is as good as Tukey's!)
