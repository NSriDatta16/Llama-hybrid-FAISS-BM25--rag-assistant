Does a Linear Regression with Residuals not normally distributed useful somehow?

I have a linear regression with two independent variables. After running the regression, both coefficients got p-value Here's what they look like: My question is: is this regression still useful? How much can I trust the coefficients? I read somewhere that the residuals not being normal is actually not a problem, but I still don't get it. Well, just so you know, my dependent variable goes from 0 to 1. The variables I have are: (I) the price of the product; (II) how many buyers per product we have; (III) the selling rate. For instance, we have 100 products A, the average price of it is 50 and there are 120 subscribers to our store. So the variable (I) is 50 and the variable (II) is 1.2. If we sold 50 products, variable (III), our dependent variable, is 0.5. I have this data for several products, monthly, for one year of sales.
