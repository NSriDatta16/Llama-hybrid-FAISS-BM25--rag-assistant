NSTableView not refreshing

I have a table view that gets refreshed two different ways. Both are through a button, and as a matter of fact, both are through the same IBAction in the same class! Here's my problem: The buttons are in two different .xib files, the button in the same xib as the table view works perfectly, while the one in the different xib does the method to get the new data, but it DOES NOT refresh the table. Same exact method, different results. To get the IBAction for the other button I simply dragged out an NSObject in IB and set its class to the class of my table view, which contains the IBAction, then hooked it up to my button. How can I fix this?
