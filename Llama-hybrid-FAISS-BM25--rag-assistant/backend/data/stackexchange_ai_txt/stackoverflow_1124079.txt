Have you employed any strategies or techniques to overcome user resistance when implementing a new system?

We have been trying now for a while to assist the management (of a customer) with the implementation of a a new system that is custom developed by ourselves, to their requirements. Their old system is text based (DOS) and their employees have been using it for years. The new system is Windows GUI and have many advanced features which will make their lives easier and their organisation more efficient. The problem is that the staff do not want to adapt to the new GUI environment and they are now resorting to be unfriendly and as unhelpful as possible, often placing serious obstacles in our way. The management is adamant that implementation must proceed. The system runs trouble free. We have been consistently friendly and helpful with all parties. Any advise would be greatly appreciated! Have you encountered something like this before and did you manage to turn it round? Note:This question is intended to help Programmers etc. with implementation difficulties by sharing experiences and factual solutions that worked. It is not intended to be subjective and indeed Programming techniques may help to solve the problem.
