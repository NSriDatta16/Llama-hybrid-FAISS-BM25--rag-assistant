I would start by determining if you are going to have a fixed, predetrmined number of levels in your tree or if you need to dynamically add levels. In the former case then one structure might be a simple set of tables such as 'product _superclass', 'product_class & 'product'. product_class could havae a foreign key to product_class, and product could have a foreign key referencing product_class. If you don't know the number of levels then you may only need a single table (assuming any product only has a single parent). In this case each row could optionally refer to a parent in the same table. A fixed number of levels may make for easier, more readable queries with obvisouly reduced flexibility.
