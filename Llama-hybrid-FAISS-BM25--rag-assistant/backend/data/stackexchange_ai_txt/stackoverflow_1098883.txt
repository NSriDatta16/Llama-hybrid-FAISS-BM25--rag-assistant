Another way of doing it using Intersect: from i in qry where i.Organs.Intersect(organs).Count == organs.Count select i ETA: From your comment, you mention you are getting a WhereListIterator back. I believe that the WhereListIterator implements IEnumerable, so you are getting back exactly what you should be getting. If you are finding that the results are empty when they shouldn't be, you might want to check to make sure your Image class implements Equals() and GetHashCode() properly so that they can be effectively compared.
