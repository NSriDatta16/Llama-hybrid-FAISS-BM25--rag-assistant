How to average days until completion when some items haven't completed the cycle?

I am attempting to calculate the average number of days it takes for an order to go through our process - from receipt of order to delivery. When calculating the average days, how should I handle those orders that have not yet completed the cycle? Do I remove those entirely or apply today's date as the completed date?
