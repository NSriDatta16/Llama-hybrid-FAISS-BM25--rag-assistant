Name of algorithm (or paper) that scikit-learn cluster.estimate_bandwidth() function implements for meanshift bandwidth selection

Can someone tell me the name of the algorithm (or paper) that sklearn.cluster.estimate_bandwidth implements and is used by the meanshift algorithm implemented in Scikit-Learn to automatically select its bandwidth parameter? Thanks. EDIT : From the link to the code given by Franck, it seems that the bandwidth sigma is estimated for a set of feature vectors X using the average of the furthest distance between vectors in X to their k nearest neighbors. These vectors (whose pairwise distance we are considering) are either sampled randomly or computed using all the vectors in X in batches, depending on the parameters given.
