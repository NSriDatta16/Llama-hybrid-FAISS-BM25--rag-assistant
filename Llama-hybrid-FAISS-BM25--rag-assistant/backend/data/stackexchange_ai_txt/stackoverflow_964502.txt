What's more efficient will depend on the amount of data you want to store and what do you plan to do with the temporary data. I've sometimes stored 5 megs in session data in file storage and it was an awful performance killer. But 5 megs of state is an awful lot and you really shouldn't get there. Anyhow you can configure PHP's sessions to be stored in a database table and get the best of both worlds. Still, if the data is not properly characteristic of a user session, then you should not use sessions and use some model object instead.
