As the other answers say, in most cases everything just restarts, and most users who did not have a pending request at the time will not notice much more than a delay. However, if your application uses session variables with In-Proc session state, all session variables for all users will be lost when the app pool restarts. This may or may not have a negative effect on the users, depending on what you're doing with the session variables. You can avoid this by switching to StateServer or SQL Server session storage.
