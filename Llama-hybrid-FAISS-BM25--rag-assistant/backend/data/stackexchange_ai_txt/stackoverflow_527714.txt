Copy half of an HTML child nodes array

I have an HTML element (let's say a div ision) that contains a set titles ( h2 ) and paragraphs ( p ) with other element inside (some links for example, a ). My goal is to cut my HTML element in 2 same size element. Constrains : paragraphs, titles, and block should not be cut My idea asbout this was to browse inside the child nodes list and copy childNodes of each paragraphs. Each time I copy a paragraph, i compute the size in ordre to know if I reached the half size of the division. Here is some code to explain it: var elm = document.getElementById('article_colonnes'); // I want to cut this into 2 parts var paragraphesNumber = paragraphes.length; var halfSize = elm.innerHTML.length / 2 ; var col1 = document.getElementById('col1'); var col2 = document.getElementById('col2'); var i=0; do { var node = createNodeFromParagraphe(paragraphes[i]); if(node) { col1.appendChild(node); // update the size of the 1st column by updating inner HTML col1String = col1String + paragraphes[i].innerHTML; } i++; // compute the size of the 1st column col1Size = col1String.length; } while(col1Size And I do the same for the 2nd column. Thanks for your help.
