According to the HIG, you aren't supposed to leave table view cells in a selected state. You are encouraged (strongly) to deselect the row as soon as you perform whatever action the tap requires. For persistent selections, you are supposed to use the accessory, and you can set a cell's accessory to a checkmark to indicate "Selected"
