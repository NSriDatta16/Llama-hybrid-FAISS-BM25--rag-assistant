The model that fits the data doesn't have to be a time series model; I would advise thinking outside the box a little. If you have multiple variables (e.g. age, gender, diet, ethnicity, illness, medication) you can use these for a different model. Maybe having certain patients in the same room is an important predictor? Or perhaps it has to do with the attending staff? Or consider using a multi-variate time series model (e.g. VECM) if you have other variables that you can use. Look at the relationships between violence across patients: do certain patients act out together? The time series model is useful if time has some important role in the behavior. For instance, there might be a clustering of violence. Look at the volatility clustering literature. As @Jonas suggests, with a lag order of 2, you may need to be on higher alert on the day following a burst in violence. But that doesn't help you prevent the first day: there may be other information that you can link into the analysis to actually understand the cause of the violence, rather than simply forcasting it in a time series fashion. Lastly, as a technical suggestion: if you're using R for the analysis, you might have a look at the forecast package from Rob Hyndman (the creator of this site). This has many very nice features; see the paper "Automatic Time Series Forecasting: The forecast Package for R" in the Journal of Statistical Software.
