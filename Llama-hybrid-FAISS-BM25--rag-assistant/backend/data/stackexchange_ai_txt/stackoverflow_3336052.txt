Is while True: a suitable way to repeat a block until an accepted case is reached?

Is while True an accepted method for looping over a block of code until an accepted case is reached as below? Is there a more elegant way to do this? while True: value = input() if value == condition: break else: pass # Continue code here. Thank you for any input.
