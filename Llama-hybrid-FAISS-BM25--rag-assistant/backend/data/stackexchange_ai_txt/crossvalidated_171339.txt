The fact that you consider the process you observe / model to be "not really random" is not an obstacle. Probability theory is often used to described processes as stochastic even if there might be an underlying deterministic process in the case that this deterministic process is very complex / high dimensional and therefore cannot be modeled in detail. In fact, one of the schools in the interpretation of statistics (Bayesianism) holds that there is not necessarily such thing as "really random", and that probability theory deals with situations where we have insufficient information to reach definite conclusions. Therefore I don't see a problem in using a stochastic process model in your case. The question whether a Markov model is appropriate is more complex. Markov chains are the first thing that comes to mind when dealing with transitions between discrete states, and human behavior in a certain conceptualization fits that bill. However, a Markov process also possesses the property that it is only the current state that has a (stochastic) influence on the next state, but none of the previous states does (the so-called Markov property ). If this is not the case, but the dependence only goes back over a fixed finite number of previous states, one can consider a Markov chain of $n$th order , where $n$ is the number of previous states that exert an influence. If you don't have a good theoretical argument that your process possesses the Markov property, you can test for it or you can estimate the order, but this may necessitate a large amount of data to work properly. For testing the Markov property, see e.g. Kullback, Kupperman, Ku (1962), "Tests for Contingency Tables and Markov Chains", Technometrics 4(4), 573-608, http://www.jstor.org/stable/1266291 . For estimating the Markov order, see e.g. Csisz√°r and Shields (2000), "The consistency of the BIC Markov order estimator", The Annals of Statistics 28(6), 1601-1619, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2673999 .
