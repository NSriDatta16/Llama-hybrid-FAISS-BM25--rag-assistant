How to avoid sql server page fragmentation in this scenario?

I want to order SQL Inserts into a table to optimize page use by avoiding fragmentation as much as possible. I will be running a .net Windows Service, which every 2 hours will take some data from a database and optimize it for future queries. A varchar(6000) column is involved, though I estimate it will rarely go beyond 4000 bytes. In fact, this column can vary normally between 600 and 2400. It's 6000 to help avoiding truncating errors. Still I can control that column size through .net. There won't ever be updates nor delete. Just selects (and inserts every 2 hours). There will be around 1000 inserts every 2 hours. I'm using Sql Server 2005. Page size are said to be 8096 bytes. I need to insert rows in a table. Given the size of rows, between 4 and 12 rows could fit in a page. So from .net I will read data from database, store it in memory, (use some clustering algorithm maybe?), and the insert around 1000 rows. I was wondering if there is a way to avoid or minimize page fragmentation in this scenario.
