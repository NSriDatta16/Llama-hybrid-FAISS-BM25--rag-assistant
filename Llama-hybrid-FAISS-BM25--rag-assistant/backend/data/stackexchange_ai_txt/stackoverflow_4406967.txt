Image to display while dragging

I am implementing drag and drop of button on windows application.During dragging I want to display some dragging effect. I think image of the button would be appropriate to display during dragging. Also I think cursor should be changed during dragging. My doubts are: How to capture the image of button and display while dragging. What type of cursor should be displayed during dragging. Application is in C++, win32.
