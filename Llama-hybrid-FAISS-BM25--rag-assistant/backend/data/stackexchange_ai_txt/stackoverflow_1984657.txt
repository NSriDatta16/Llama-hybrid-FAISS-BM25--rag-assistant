how to know whether disk is basic or dynamic?

In windows is it possible to know what kind of disk we are dealing with from a c/c++ program? forget about gpt or mbr, how to know whether it is basic or dynamic? Program input can be drive letter or any info related to disk, output should be dynamic or basic. No need of a direct way of doing, even if it is lengthy process, its okay. I couldn't find much in msdn. Please help me out.
