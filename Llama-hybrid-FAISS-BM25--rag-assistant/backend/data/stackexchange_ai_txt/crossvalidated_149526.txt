In general, you don't watch the test as it is performed. It's not that people ignore it but constantly testing leads to an increase in type I errors. If you repeatedly test you need adjust for multiple testing. If you're doing this in a bayesian framework (like with BEST) then the strength of your priors and the uncertainty in your effect size measurement will help deal with the "delay to conversion" problem. To be safe, you should just set a time frame before which you won't calculate results. In the NHST paradigm this is usually decided by your sample size calculation. That'd be a good place to estimate this time window even in your bayesian case.
