The largest character data type in MySql is LONGTEXT (see Storage Requirements for String Types ), that is capable to hold 2^32-1 bytes. SQLite does not impose any length restrictions (other than the large global SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH limit) on the length of strings, BLOBs or numeric values. The default limit for that is 1 billion, but you can change it at compile time to a maximum of 2^31-1 (see Maximum length of a string or BLOB ).
