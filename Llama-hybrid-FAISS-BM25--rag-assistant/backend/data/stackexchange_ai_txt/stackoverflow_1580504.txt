Facebook Connect help

According to the Facebook API documentation, most of the work is handled through javascript. That means that all the processing is done, and then the front end checks if the user is connected to Facebook/authorized. right? My question is: Suppose a user goes to my site for the first time ever. He clicks on "facebook connect". The javascript verifies him as authentic, and it "redirects" to another page on my server. From then on, how do I know that the user is actually authenticated to my website, since everything is done on frontend? I think this is correct, but aren't there some security issues..: -After user clicks Login, Facebook redirects to a page on my site. AND they also create a cookie with a specific "Facebook ID" that is retrieved only from this user. My backened will "read" the cookie and grab that ID...and then associate it to my userID. If that is correct...then it doesn't make sense. What if people steal other people's "facebook ID" and then forge the cookie? And then my backend sees the cookie and thinks it's the real user...? Am I confused? If I am confused, please help me re-organize and tell me how it's like.
