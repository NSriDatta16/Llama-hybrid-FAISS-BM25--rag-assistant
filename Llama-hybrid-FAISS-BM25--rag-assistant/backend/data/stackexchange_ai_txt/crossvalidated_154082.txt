MATLAB will apply Variable Weights multipliers to the variables before running PCA on them. A typical usage of this input is to compute PCA on the correlation matrix instead of the covariance. In this case you set 'Centered' true and supply inverse variances as weights vector or simply set it to 'variance'.
