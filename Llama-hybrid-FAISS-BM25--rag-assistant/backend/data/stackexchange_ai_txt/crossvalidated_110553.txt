This at least gives some pointers for - and a partial answer to - this question. In the case of sample quantiles, the standard error depends on which definition of sample quantiles you actually use. I believe R, for example, includes 9 different definitions of quantiles in its quantile function. For cases where the sample quantile is an exact order statistic, the standard error of the sample quantile follows from the standard error of that order statistic. If a quantile is based on some weighted average of two order statistics, then the standard error can be obtained from their variances, their covariance and the weights. As a result, confidence intervals can be formed; in the case of a quantile being an order statistic, a binomial distribution can be used to form a nonparametric interval directly from order statistics.
