Model overspecification. [P]rediction equations [...] may suffer from overspecification. Too many predictor variables in the model can create problems when the goal of the investigation is to make inferences on the model parameters. This is because there is a great danger of redundancy among the predictor variables. If several predictor variables repeat information, it is difficult to determine which of the redundant variables should be retained in the model and which should be eliminated.
