Is there a reason you can't create a mount a new FS on the fly? You definitely do not want an empty squashFS image. If you want temporary writeable storage you can use something like a tmpfs volume. If you need to support a system reboot, you can use JFFS on a raw flash device. You should be able to format/mount the MTD devices just like any other block device.
