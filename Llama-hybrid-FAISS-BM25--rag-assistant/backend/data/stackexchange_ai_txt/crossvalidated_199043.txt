Why is the law of large numbers used in Bayesian statistics?

Bayesians believe that we should hold a belief of values and NOT focus on the long-term frequency of some value. If this premise is true, why do Bayesians insist use MCMC to approximate the posterior using an infinity number of MCMC samples if they don't believe in the law of large numbers? Why don't they hold a belief of the number of iterations to use?
