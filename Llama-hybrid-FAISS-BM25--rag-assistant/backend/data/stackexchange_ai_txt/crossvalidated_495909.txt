How to calculate CI for Median Odds Ratio?

According to Austin et al (2016) the median odds ratio (MOR) is defined by $\exp(\sqrt{2\sigma^2} \times \Phi^{-1}(0.75))$ , where $\Phi^{-1}$ denotes the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the random effects. I am doing a multilevel logistic regression with random intercepts. My data is copy-pastable from here and the following code should run everything. library(lme4) m1 I get a MOR of 1.233264. However, I don't understand how to compute a confidence interval on this MOR. Edit: @user2957945 kindly points out a question that is similar . Although it refers to a 95% Credible Interval rather than a Confidence Interval, a bootstrapping approach is suggested. However, aside from not being competent to assess whether the approach there is valid, I also wasn't sure how to adapt the code for my data. Austin, P. C., Wagner, P., & Merlo, J. (2017).
