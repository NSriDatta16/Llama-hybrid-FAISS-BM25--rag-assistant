Sharing on Facebook for site with location based redirection shows unwanted name & description

I have a website that redirects the user to a particular local subsite when you visit the index page. For example, when you visit www.abc.com, I run a 'redirectCity()' function on the server side. If a city is detected, it directs the user to www.abc.com/newyork. If no city is detected, it directs the user to www.abc.com/city_picker. The meta data for www.abc.com/newyork is set for New York users, and the meta data for www.abc.com/city_picker is designed to be generic. When I share the link 'www.abc.com' on Facebook, it's throwing me back the title, description and thumbnail for the 'www.abc.com/newyork' site. Is there an elegant solution to have Facebook pick up the meta data from 'www.abc.com/city_picker' site instead? Thanks in advance.
