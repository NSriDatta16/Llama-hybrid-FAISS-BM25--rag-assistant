Does overfitting show that the model has reached its best performance?

Let's say you design a CNN model and it starts overfitting at e.g 70% accuracy during training. Does that mean that 70% is the best accuracy that I can get out of that model design even if I add regularization? Or in other words, can regularization improve the performance of a model?
