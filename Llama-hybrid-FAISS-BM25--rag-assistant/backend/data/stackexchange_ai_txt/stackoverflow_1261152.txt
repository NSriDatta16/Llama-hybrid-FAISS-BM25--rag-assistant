I found my reson for why this file will not load. This was a permissions error. The account trying to access the JAR file didnt have windows permissions. I had created the JAR from Eclipse and exported it to my Desktop, then copied it over into the JNLP directory. Those permissions were not changed for the JAR after the copy/paste.
