What is probably happening is that the URL connection attaches a default user agent header to the HTTP request. The mobile web site receives this and redirects you to the mobile web site. I believe that it won't be possible to change this behaviour with Android's version of URL class. A solution would be to use HttpClient , which you should be doing already anyhow.
