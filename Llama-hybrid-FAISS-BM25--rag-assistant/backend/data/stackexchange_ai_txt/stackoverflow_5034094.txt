The Role of the Training & Tests Sets in Building a Decision Tree and Using it to Classify

I've been working weka for couple of months now. Currently, I'm working on my machine learning course here in Ostfold University College. I need a better way to construct a decision tree based on separated training and test sets. Anybody come up with good idea can be of very great relief. Thanx in advance. -Neo
