Thinking of REST over HTTP, caching is a big leverage. Even if the inside is "semantically" the same, if it differs structurally then you could end up with a lot of Cache misses (e.g. done with ETags ). Of course it depends "how" the comparison is done, but imho most Cache implementations use simple hashing of the returned payload as comparing-entity. So if Caching is important, I would tend to spit out also same structure for "semantically" same documents.
