For simple material coverage the online MySQL docs or the MySQL 5 Certification Study Guide book are pretty good. Can practice on a sample database like Employee (4 million records in total) from MySQL. For advanced subjects (performance optimization) I suggest High Performance MySQL book. Chapter 4 of this book deals with Query Performance Optimization, with examples using Sakila database from MySQL as well.
