Confusing output?

I fail to understand is why does the code print '3' in VS2010 (release build), whether I leave the declaration of 'r' or comment it out. int main(){ int arr1[2]; int &r = arr1[0]; int arr2[2]; cout So, three questions: a. why does the code print 3? b. why does it print 3 even if the declaration of 'r' is present? (Is it because that in C++ whether a reference occupies storage or not is implementation defined?) c. Does this code have undefined behavior or implementation defined behavior?
