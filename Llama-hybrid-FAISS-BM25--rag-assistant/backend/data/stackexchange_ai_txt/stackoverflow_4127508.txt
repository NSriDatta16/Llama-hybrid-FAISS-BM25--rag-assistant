Well, yeah, if you have: var s= ' '; How is the browser supposed to know that the first isn't a real end of the script element? Every browser, not just Firefox, will read that as: var s= ' // uh-oh! string literal left open! '; // script element closed. Then some trailing text content // close-tag for a script that isn't open, ignore To avoid a premature end to a string literal containing the (ETAGO) sequence, you must escape it in some way. You could say ' ' , or '\x3C/script>' or even ' ' (that one is popular, though I find it quite inelegant).
