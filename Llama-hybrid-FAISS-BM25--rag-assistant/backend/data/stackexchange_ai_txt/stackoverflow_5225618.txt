What strikes me is that you don't send any validator (Last-Modified or ETag). While they are not mandatory, I strongly encourage you to send one, to enable browsers to do conditional requests. RFC 2616 says "HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD send Last-Modified whenever feasible." This must not be the root cause of your problem, but it could well be. So I suggest to remove the line "Header Unset Last-Modified" and check again. Note that your Expires is access time plus 36000s while your max-age time is 7200s, which doesn't make sense. Browsers understanding the new Cache-Control directive (all new browsers do) will go for max-age. If adding Last-Modified does not work, can you please post the full response headers your server sends? For example, go to http://redbot.org/ and run this checker against your server and post the results. This will further help to identify your problem.
