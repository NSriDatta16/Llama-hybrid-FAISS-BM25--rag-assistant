I assume that the default in SAS is not predictive mean matching (PMM). I recommend using PMM here as it will result in real values of imputed variables, i.e., zeros and ones if a variable is binary. By doing multiple imputation the proportion of ones in the long run will be the probability of being in that category. But you stick with 0/1 in combining analyses. Note that for PMM it doesnâ€™t matter very much whether you use logistic regression or OLS for predicting the binary variable, as PMM just uses ranks of predicted values.
