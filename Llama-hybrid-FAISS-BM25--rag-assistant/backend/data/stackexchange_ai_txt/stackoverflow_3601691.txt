Amorphous - I noticed Gert edited your post. Are the two code fragments exactly as you posted them? So even though the original code was designed for highlighting, I understand you're trying to repurpose it for generating links - it should, and does work fine for that (tested as posted). HOWEVER escaping in the first code fragment could be an issue. $text=Text->highlight($text,$tags,' \1 ',1); Works fine... but if you use speach marks rather than quote marks the backslashes disappear as escape marks - you need to escape them. If you don't you get %01 links. The correct way with speach marks is: $text=Text->highlight($text,$tags," \\1 ",1); (Notice the use of \1 instead of \1)
