Just tried it using Mozenda ( http://www.mozenda.com ). After roughly 10 minutes and I had an agent that could scrape the data as you describe. You may be able to get all of this data just using their free trial. Coding is fun, if you have time, but it looks like you may already have a solution coded for you. Nice job Drew.
