Pages 3 and 4 of BDA by Gelman et al., 3rd ed., are illuminating. Bayesian statistics aims to make inference from data using probability models for observables and unobservable quantities. We refer to the unobservable quantities as parameters, even if the distinction is not always clear-cut. In Bayesian statistics all uncertainty about the variables involved in the model is represented using probability. Thus we need to setup a full probability model, i.e., a joint probability among all variables involved in our problem, both observable and unobservable, i.e., parameters. This means that we use random variables to represent both. It doesn't mean that we believe the parameter to be random: it means simply that our knowledge of the real value of the parameters is limited, and we represent whatever limited knowledge we have before observing data through the prior probability distribution. We then observe data and condition on the observed data using a model for the data generating process (which gives rise to a certain likelihood function) and Bayes' rule, to obtain a posterior probability distribution, which quantifies the remaining uncertainty in our knowledge about the unobservable quantities. In other words we use random variables for parameters not because we believe that there are no true parameters, but because we have a limited knowledge of them, which improves after observing data for the measurable variables, but it doesn't disappear completely. As a matter of fact, there are technical conditions under which the posterior distribution tends to a Dirac delta (thus the random variable used to represent the parameter becomes degenerate) in the limit for the number of observations which goes to 0. If there was no "true" value for the parameter, this wouldn't make a lot of sense. Now, surely these conditions are not always valid, but in many standard Bayesian analyses (even if not all) we do not doubt the existence of a true model, and of true or fixed values for the unobservables.
