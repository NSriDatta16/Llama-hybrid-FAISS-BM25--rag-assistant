I would have posted a comment but my rep score won't grant me that distinction. All I wanted to point out was that even though the Log(10) is a very elegant (read: very few lines of code) solution, it is probably the one most taxing on the processor. I think jherico's answer is probably the most efficient solution and therefore should be rewarded as such. Especially if you are going to be doing this for a lot of numbers..
