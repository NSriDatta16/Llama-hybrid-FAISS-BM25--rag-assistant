I have a premonition that this could be related to "tcp broken pipe" scenario. I.e. the other peer at some moment closes the connection, but our peer somehow ignores the event. You will need to use some kind of keep-alives to deel with this. The "right", elegant solution of the problem may require some actions from twitter itself. This is rather common issue; my friend have used the streaming api and encountered the same problem.
