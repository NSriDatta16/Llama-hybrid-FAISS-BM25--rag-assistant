Flow of influence in a v-structure for Probabilistic Graphical Models

I'm not very sure I understand why an observed v-structure have different flow of influence behaviour for a directed and an undirected graph. What is the intuition behind the actual definition for this specific case of d-separation ? So far I've been studying the directed graphs , or Bayesian networks . The "logic" behind the fact that two parents become dependent to each other once the children ( grad-children , grand-grand-children or grand-...-grand-children ) is observed is pretty straightforward. Now I am wondering why this does not hold true anymore for the case of undirected graphs , or hidden Markov models . Is this "just because" there is no parent-children relation? If so, how does this affect the all?
