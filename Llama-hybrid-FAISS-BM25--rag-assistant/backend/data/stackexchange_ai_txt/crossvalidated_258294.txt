Distance between two clusters

I have this distances: install.packages("HSAUR");library(HSAUR) b=round(scale(pottery[1:6,1:5], center=FALSE),2) b1=round(dist(b),2) > round(dist(b,method="euclidean"),2) 1 2 3 4 5 2 0.34 3 0.24 0.14 4 0.36 0.10 0.16 5 0.33 0.15 0.19 0.24 6 0.45 0.43 0.40 0.47 0.45 Considering the clusters $A=\{1,4\}$ and $B=\{2,3\}$ What is a correct approach for doing this with complete linkage distances? How do I merge the cases into a cluster and how can I compute the average distances between these two clusters? For the complete linkage maximum distance, I have first to merge the cases into clusters and put their distances based on the formula: $d(A,B) = max |x-y|$ So I have this example to follow: http://tx.shu.edu.tw/~PurpleWoo/Literature/!DataAnalysis/Methods%20of%20Multivariate%20Analysis.pdf It starts on page 460, the example 14.3.3(a). The process it follows leads to a nonsymmetric table of distances starting from the fourth step and on. Following the first steps I get to the conclusion that the complete linkage distance for this two clusters could be 0.34, but I am not sure and also I wouldn't be able to finish the process to know how a dendrogram would look like all by myself, and also I would be completely lost when doing so for the average linkage process.
