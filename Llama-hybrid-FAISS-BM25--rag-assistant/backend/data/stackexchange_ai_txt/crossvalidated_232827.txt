Basic Linear Regression problem

I am a total beginner in Machine Learning but I would say that I have kind of strong mathematical background. I have started learning Machine Learning algorithims and I have the following question. Thank you for your help in advance. As we know, our basic linear regression algorithm is $\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y.$ I have tried this algorithim for $y = 2x + 5$ For example, (the first column is ones vector and imagine that we give $1, 2, 3, 4$ numbers each for $x$ and get $7, 9, 11, 13$ for $y$ values) x = [[1, 1]; [1, 2]; [1, 3]; [1, 4]] y = [[7]; [9]; [11]; [13]] When I solve the algorithm, it gives $2$ and $5$ which are the parameters of $y=2x + 5$. There is no problem till here. My question starts when I use this algorithm for, lets say $y=X_1 + X_2 + 5$. When I use this algorithm for this equation, I cannot get $1, 1, 5 $ parameters as a solution. The inputs I use as following: (I give $1, 2, 3, 4$ for $X_1$ and $2, 3, 4, 5$ for $X_2$ and get $8, 10, 12, 14$ for $Y$) (Again, the first column is ones vector) X = [[1, 1, 2]; [1, 2 , 3]; [1, 3 , 4]; [1, 4 , 5]] y = [[8]; [10]; [12]; [14]]
