How to Auto-resize font size to fit text box height / width?

I am trying to have text automatically size its font to fill an entire text component. My current approach is to set font size as a function of the number of text characters and the text components height and width but I can't find the right coefficients to make this work nicely. Is there a simpler or more elegant way? Does truncateToFit work on Text? I read somewhere that it doesn't work well. Edit: I forgot to mention that I would like it to scale beyond the max font size (which is 127 i believe). How is this done? scaleX?
