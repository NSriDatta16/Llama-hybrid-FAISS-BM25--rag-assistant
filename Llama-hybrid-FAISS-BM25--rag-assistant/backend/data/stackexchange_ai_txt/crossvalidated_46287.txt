You may want to give random forests a try or bagging/boosting methods (I'm assuming you haven't tried these yet at this stage). Usually these techniques work well for these kinds of problems. It will depend, if the classes are imbalanced but if they differ in characteristics then a classification method should have no problem distinguishing between them. In some cases however the classifier might be the cause of the imbalance. You can scale the predictions however based on the confusion matrix. The main idea is listed here: http://www.creatapreneur.com/2012/07/ .
