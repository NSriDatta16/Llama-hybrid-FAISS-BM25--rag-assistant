CurrentState of itemrenderer refreshes on dragDrop Event

I have a simple drag and drop, and wanted to change the state of the drop target on a match. It works as expected, but then there the state changes back to normal (or the itemrenderer is refreshing). I am guessing there is either an override that i need to do, or in need to flag it to not refresh, but having no luck. Any idea? MXML Drag Initiator Item Renderer @namespace s "library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"; @namespace mx "library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx"; @font-face { src: url("../assets/HelveticaLight.ttf"); fontFamily: "myMyriadFont"; embedAsCFF: true; } .italicFontStyle { fontFamily: myMyriadFont; fontLookup: embeddedCFF; fontSize: 34; } DropTargets Item Renderer
