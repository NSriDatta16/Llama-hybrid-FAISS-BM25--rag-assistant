Panel data or time series regression? | using R

I have data for n variables (external funding, staff,...) for m objects (e.g. Universities) for 5 years each. I want to estimate some models being external funding the dependent variable. For each year there are about 400 observations for each variable, e.g. in 2010 there are 400 universities. For each universities there are data of external funding, number of staff, share of staff in different scientific fields,.... I have some hypotheses I want to test. Most are simple, e.g. "Higher share of engineer = higher external funding". My intended goal is to make projections of future change in external funding for universities depending on an changing number of staff, increased federal funding and so on. Right now I am wondering what the best approach is. A time series regression (using dnylm) is my favorite (as I can use lagged variables, ect) but I am not sure how to prepare the data or set up the code in R to make it work. As I am not sure on how to do this I was thinking about setting it up as an panel data model, but I would lose all the features a time series regression comes with. Does anybody have a tip or some hints for me?
