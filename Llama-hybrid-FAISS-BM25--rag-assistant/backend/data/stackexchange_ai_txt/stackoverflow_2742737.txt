You may organize the rendering work in chunks and after processing each chunk, give back control to the system. There are many possible implementations, for instance start a timer that fires event each 500 ms and process a small chunk of the dataset in the event handler. As a bonus, processing a large dataset in chunks will enable you to provide the user the option to cancel rendering easily.
