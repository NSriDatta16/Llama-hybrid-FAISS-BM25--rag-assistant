Pick a large number of trees, say 100. From what I have read on the Internet, pick $\sqrt{250}$ randomly selected features. However, in the original paper , Breiman used about the closest integer to $\frac{\log{M}}{\log{2}}$. I would say cross-validation is usually the key to finding optimal parameters, but I do not know enough about random forests.
