Java Transaction API (JTA) Overview Help

Can someone give me a good explanation on the motivation and application of JTA in modern Java applications? I don't want overly technical details. But just a paragraph on why do we need JTA, what does JTA accomplish, and maybe a piece of pseudo code showing how JTA is being used?
