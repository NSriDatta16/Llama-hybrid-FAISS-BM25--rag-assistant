Simple floating w/ opposite source order just can't be done (w/o CSS3 draft specs). The pragmatic approach is to first build a nice layout that supports your desired source order. HTML: Lorem ipsum .... Pellentesque .... content CSS: #content {position:relative;} #sidebar {width:150px; position:absolute; top:0; right:0;} .noJs {padding-right:150px;} .noJs #floatSpace {display:none;} .js #floatSpace {float:right; width:150px;} This satisfies all but 1 and 2. Now, we add the JS: $(function () { // make floatSpace the same height as sidebar $('#floatSpace').height($('#sidebar').height()); // trigger alternate layout $('#content')[0].className = 'js'; }); This will make the contents float around #floatSpace, and #sidebar will remain positioned on top of it. This is better than moving #sidebar because source order remains the same (for screenreaders that support Javascript, etc.). Here's a JSFiddle of this in action . This layout does come with the unfortunate requirement of keeping the floatSpace height in sync with the sidebar height. If the sidebar is dynamic or has lazy-loading content, you must re-sync.
