Django - How to use URLconfs with an apps folder?

I'm following the tutorial on the Django website but I'm trying to expand upon it. I like the organizational scheme of putting all of your apps in an "apps" folder. I'm trying to figure out the proper way to include urls.py in order to get everything to link together. Here's my root urls.py: from django.conf.urls.defaults import * from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover() urlpatterns = patterns('', (r'^polls/', include('apps.polls.urls')), (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), ) Here's my urls.py at apps/polls/urls.py: from django.conf.urls.defaults import * urlpatterns=patterns('polls.views', (r'^polls/$', 'index'), (r'^polls/(?P \d+)/$', 'detail'), (r'^polls/(?P \d+)/results/$', 'results'), (r'^polls/(?P \d+)/vote/$', 'vote'), ) What's the correct way to do this? Thanks!
