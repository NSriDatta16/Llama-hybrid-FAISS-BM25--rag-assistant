Essentially, by swapping the labels 1 and 0 of the Stage 1 dependent variable during Stage 2, you fitted the following binary logistic regression models: Stage 1: log(p/(1-p)) = linear function of your predictors Stage 2: log((1-p)/p) = linear function of your predictors where p denotes the probability that your dependent variable in Stage 1 takes the value 1 and 1-p denotes the probability that it takes the value 1. Since you can show algebraically that log((1-p)/p) = - log(p/(1-p)), the coefficients in the two models will be identical in absolute value but have opposite signs. Not clear why you would want to proceed with Stage 2 - Stage 1 already provides all the information that you need.
