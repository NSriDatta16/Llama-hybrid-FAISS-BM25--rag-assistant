For normality testing, should biological replicates be averaged or should all values of each subgroup be evaluated as independent data points?

I have performed an in vivo study evaluating splenic white:red pulp ratio as determined by AI on histopathologic slides (neural network trained and validated per published guidelines). The questions being posed are what impacts do radiation source and/or dose have on splenic lymphodepletion as measured by white:red pulp ratio. The experimental design is four sources of radiation, each with four different doses. Each source/dose combination has 3-5 biological replicates (individual mice). When assessing for normality, should these biological replicates be averaged, then assessed for normality (4 values for each source or dose) or should all values of each subgroup (source and dose) be tested for normality as independent data points (resulting in 14-20 values for each source or dose)? Ultimately I’m trying to decide if parametric testing (two way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons) should be used or no parametric testing (Krystal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons).
