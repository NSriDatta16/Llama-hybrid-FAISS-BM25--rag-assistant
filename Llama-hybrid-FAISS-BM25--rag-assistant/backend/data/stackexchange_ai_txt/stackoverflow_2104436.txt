Aside from storage, a certain datatype is also a type of constraint If you know for instance a certain account number will hold exactly 8 chars, defining that in the type is the most logical and performant thing you can do. (nchar(8) for example) You are setting the domain (or a part of it, it can be further refined by other constraints) immediately in the field's type that way.
