I really like "Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial" by Sivia (the second addition is also co-authored by Skilling). It doesn't go into a huge amount of depth but is very hands on and explains the core concepts and basic implementations very clearly without any fuss. At the other end of the spectrum is "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science" by Jaynes. This polemic gives you a great explanation of the logic behind the Bayesian approach and a firm theoretical basis without going into too much mathematical detail. It does not however provide much in the way of practical details about implementing algorithms for solving practical problems. Reading those two books (in either order) provide a nice complementary introduction to Bayesian statistics.
