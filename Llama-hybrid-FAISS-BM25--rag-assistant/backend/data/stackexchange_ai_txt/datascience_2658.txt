Using NLP to automate the categorization of user description

I have a huge file of customer complaints about the products my company owns and I would like to do a data analysis on those descriptions and tag a category to each of them. For example: I need to figure out the number of complaints on Software and Hardware side of my product from the customer complaints. Currently, I am using excel to do the data analysis which do seek a significant amount of manual work to get a tag name to the complaints. Is there a way in NLP to build and train a model to automate this process? I have been reading stuffs about NLP for the past couple of days and it looks like NLP has a lot of good features to get a head start in addressing this issue. Could someone please guide me with the way I should use NLP to address this issue?
