If you got all the missing data experts in a room, they probably wouldn't agree on which method is best, although they might agree that what is best depends very much on the precise goal and on what underlies your data. While you are waiting for a missing data expert to answer, here is one amateur answer, although it draws on some experience with environmental data. With your data you could try (a) to fill in missings spatially or you could try (b) to fill in using relationships between variables or you could try (c) a combination. In principle, using all the information you have sounds a good idea; in practice even (a) or (b) could be a lot of work and (c) could be a nightmare. My own tendency would be to consider estimating missings as weighted combinations of neighbouring values, weights depending on distances between sampling points. Although it is not obvious from your listing, I guess you have a latitude and longitude or some equivalent somewhere. In principle that is a one-line equation for each variable; in practice it could still be a lot of work, dependent possibly on access to, and skills with, GIS software. The set-up of counties seems, possibly, a red herring here. The streams don't know which county they are in. It's possible that being in a county is meaningful if there is something dependent on policy or efficiency, e.g. how lax or tough a county is in controlling pollution or other abuse of the rivers. Otherwise being in a county is just a proxy for spatial variation for other reasons (climate, soils, biota, geology, topography, land use, population pressure, etc., etc.) and distance-weighting will capture that as well as anything else. You'd still need to compare anything you got with a run on the dataset trimmed of missings. The problem with imputing weighted averages is necessarily that you understate the real variability. There are non-spatial methods (multiple imputation etc.) that people are more likely to recommend. I thought I'd speak up for a spatial interpolation method. It is interesting sociologically, if immaterial statistically, that you talk about "the country" as if we knew what it was. That leads to a guess that you are from the United States.
