To your core questions: The covariate coefficient of 66.99 represents the average increase in the outcome for each unit increase in the covariate within the (baseline) control group. (Significant) Mathematically, when the data is not transformed, the coefficient represents the associated increase in the outcome with every unit increase in the predictor after controlling for the other predictors. But you are right that this represents the slope for the control group, whereas the interaction shows the slope for the treatment group. With each unit increase in the covariate, the outcome is, on average, 14.14 units higher for the treatment group compared to the control group. (Not significant) As noted above, this is the increase in the slope for the treatment group for this covariate (it would be negative if the slope decreased). This seems to indicate that for the treatment group, the covariate has a stronger magnitude in increasing the outcome variable. However, considering the coefficient and its corresponding p-value of the group variable, I am unsure whether it would be appropriate to conclude that there is no significant difference between the groups. The $p$ value should not really weight interpretation of the raw effects. It only states the probability of the point estimate having a null effect on the outcome. This doesn't actually say if or how much the estimate actually increases or decreases the outcome variable. Its still clear to me that there is a $\beta = 20.95$ increase in the outcome variable on average for the treatment group over and above the control group. If I cannot draw such a conclusion based on this model, which model or which number should I examine to determine if there is a significant difference between the control and treatment groups? Do not determine the model post-hoc because of statistical significance. Your model and your data speak plainly about what is going on. Simply report what you have found here and move on. Statistical significance on it's own is rubbish anyway.
