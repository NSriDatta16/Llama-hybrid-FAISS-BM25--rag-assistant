xtlogit: panel data transformation's recast to double makes model incomputable (STATA)

I am experiencing a very peculiar problem in STATA. I have a panel dataset with 8000 groups and 4 million observations. I want to run a fixed effects panel binary logistic regression (xtlogit). As you can read in my original question , STATA's maximization algorithm cannot compute a solution when using xtlogit . I have reduced this problem to occurring when transforming the data to panel data, because: running logit depvar indepvars works just fine logit depvar indepvars does not maximize when first running xtdata indepvars, fe clear Therefore xtdata does something that causes the maximizer to fail. It turns out that when I run xtdata indepvars, fe clear nodouble it does compute. This means that stata's panel function cause the data to be recast to the double format (from float ), and this increased precision causes the maximization process to fail. However, I cannot use logit after xtdata .., nodouble because it is not the same as running xtlogit ( xtdata is meant for OLS). Therefore I need to run xtlogit , but it does not seem to have a nodouble option, causing STATA to recast the "hidden background panel" data to the double format with higher precision, and therefore the function fails to converge. So, is it possible to somehow tell STATA to not recast my float s to double s when running xtlogit , such that the function will converge? Is there any other solution to this increased precision issue causing the function to fail to converge?
