A "simple model solution based on statistics" may give you the best predictive performance. You can evaluate and compare different approaches. It's a good idea to start with na√Øve baselines , then try out "statistical" models (e.g. Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA or Theta), and finally see if more complicated machine learning models help improve predictive performance.
