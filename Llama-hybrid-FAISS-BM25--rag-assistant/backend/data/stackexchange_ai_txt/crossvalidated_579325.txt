Some quick thoughts: my guess it that the multiple extractions and measurements (replicates) are technical replicates , i.e. they're there to improve precision and make sure that the process is working reasonably well. It might make sense to quantify the variability at this level (researchers in your area might be interested), but you can do this directly rather than as part of your mixed model analysis. It will make your analysis easier/less error-prone if you simply average all four extraction/replicate combinations within each (enzyme × temperature × method × solution × plant) combination — your technical replication will still be serving its purposes of reducing the variation at the level of these means (see Murtaugh 2007 for an analogous argument). You're still going to have trouble with the resulting random-effects term (1 + enzym + temp + solution|plant) , because (while it is the technically correct maximal model), it allows not just for the variation in effects across plants, but also in covariation between any pair of effects, for example: "do plants which have a higher-than-average yield in the (OE/20/MJ) condition tend to have a lower-than-average yield in the (PL/35/VW) condition?". This means you'll have to estimate the elements of an 8×8 covariance matrix (a total of (8+1)*8/2 = 36 parameters) from measurements of only 24 plants ... This is a difficult problem, and is why you're getting singular fits. Singular fits aren't inherently bad, but suggest that your model may be too complex for the data (!) (There is more discussion in the help page that the message points to, as well as in the GLMM FAQ .) One possible shortcut: fit a nested model (1|plant/enzym/temp/solution) : this estimates only four variance parameters, but makes two stronger assumptions, (1) compound symmetry (all the correlations between pairs at the same level, e.g. between different enzyme and temperature combinations, are identical) and (2) nestedness (i.e. the only variation in temperature effects is within enzyme treatments) Another (different but equally parsimonious) shortcut: (1|plant) + (1|plant:enzym) + (1|plant:temp) + (1|plant:solution) . This assumes independent variation across plants for each effect. Because there are only two distinct values, treating temp as numeric or factor shouldn't make any difference to the overall fit of the model, but it will change the units of the estimate (from "difference between levels" to "difference per degree C") and, more importantly, it will change the reference level for the other effects to 0°C — probably not sensible. It is probably easiest to treat temperature as categorical and divide the estimate by 5 if you want effects per degree. (If you are going to try to estimate main effects or compute 'type 3' sums of squares/p-values, you should also set options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")) to get sum-to-zero rather than treatment contrasts). More on randomized complete block designs here and here , but they don't go much beyond the case with a single treatment evaluated within a block.
