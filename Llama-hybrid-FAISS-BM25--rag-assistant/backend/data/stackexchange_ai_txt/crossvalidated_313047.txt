Model specification in the Bayesian paradigm is just as important and potentially just has harmful as in frequentist statistics. The main difference with Bayes is that you can incorporate uncertainties instead of picking a simple model and hoping you're right. Examples: Instead of assuming normality, include a non-normality parameter in the model (indicating skewness, excess kurtosis, etc.) Instead of choosing whether an interaction term is in or out of the model, put it "half in" by having a prior for the interaction that favors "no interaction" but allows larger samples to override this.
