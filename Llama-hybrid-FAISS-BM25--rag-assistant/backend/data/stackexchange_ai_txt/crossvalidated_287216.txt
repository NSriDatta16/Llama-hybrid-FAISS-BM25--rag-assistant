Of course you should use the 1st approach. The classical way to do it is multinomial logistic regression (note that it is a synonym of softmax regression see : http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/softmax-regression-related-logistic-regression.html ). The 2nd approach would be several binary logistic regressions. As you said the sum would not be 1. This is not recommended. As far as I know, nobody does it. Note : there are other forms of multinomial regression other than logistic, but logistic is perfect for a start.
