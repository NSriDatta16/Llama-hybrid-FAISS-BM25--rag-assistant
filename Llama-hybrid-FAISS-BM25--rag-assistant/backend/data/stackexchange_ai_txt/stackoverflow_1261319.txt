Drag and drop files into VS 2008 in Win 7

I installed VS 2008 Team System on a brand new Windows 7 installation, and I can't drag and drop files to it to open them (ie: .config files) I could do this on Windows XP I can open them from the File -> Open menu Do you know of any setting I might be missing? I already had a lot of fun with UAC and having to run VS as an administrator (even though I am one on the local machine) and a lot of other small stuff that's new on windows 7.
