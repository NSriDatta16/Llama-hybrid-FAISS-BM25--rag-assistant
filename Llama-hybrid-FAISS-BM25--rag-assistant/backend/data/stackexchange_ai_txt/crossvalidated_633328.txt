If your goal is to infer whether a treatment has an effect on an outcome of interest, you need a randomized control trial (RCT); if this is not possible, in some use-cases, causal inference algorithms, such as synthetic control, can be of use, but I do not believe that your situation is applicable. If certain factors prevent a person from exposure to the treatment, then ideally these factors would be missing from both treatment and control groups. (One strategy is to recruit and give the control group placebos.) However, if you’re unable to ensure that a certain factor is orthogonal to treatment exposure then the factor becomes correlated with the treatment; in consequence, you’re estimating the interaction of treatment and factor, not the treatment, in isolation. Suppose that comparing surgery methods, a new proposed method against the established method. And you’re interested in whether the new method has a faster recovery time. If antibiotics suppresses the immune system, and antibiotics is removed from treatment group but not control group, then there’s a negative correlation between treatment and antibiotics, confounding your conclusions about recovery times. If antibiotics is completely removed the study, then you cannot condition on it in your logistic regression model (always zero.) I would be interested in the effect of antibiotics on recovery times and would want to randomize such that antibiotics was equally prevalent in treatment and control groups (orthogonal to treatment exposure.) this way you could infer the effects of both antibiotics and treatment effect, decoupled from one another. But if the risk to safety is too high, you must remove it from both groups and cannot condition on it in your model. On the topic of synthetic control, the idea is to synthesize Frankenstein samples from your “control” group for comparison with your treatment group. Suppose that height is a factor of interest and in your treatment group, you have an individual of 5’ tall but no such member in the control group; however, there are individuals that are 4’ and 6’ tall. If height is the only factor, synthetic control would average these two response variable observations for to synthesize what would have happened if the 5’ individual in the treatment group did not receive the treatment (the counterfactual.) All this to say, synthetic control cannot help you if your treatment group has zero antibiotics and your control group has some non-zero antibiotics. (To give more context, Synthetic Control is used heavily on economics where it's impractical or unethical to execute an RCT.)
