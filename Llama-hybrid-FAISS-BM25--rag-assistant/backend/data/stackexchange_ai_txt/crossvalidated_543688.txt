First of all, regarding terminology, you are taking about using multiple two -class classifiers, rather than one-class classifiers. One class classifiers are a class of models used for anomaly or novelty detection, where you have data coming only from a single class. If you have two classes, it's a two-class classifier. What you want to do is one-vs-rest strategy in multiclass classification. Scikit-learn has nice documentation on such classifiers and API that allows for fitting such classifiers out of the box. You don't need to do weighted averaging, each of the individual classifiers will return some kind of score (often a probability) so for each class you would have the score for this class vs other classes, to make a prediction, you pick the class that has the highest score.
