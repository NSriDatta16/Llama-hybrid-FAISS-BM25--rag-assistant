Training error of SVM in small n large p case

There are n data points in R^p space, where p>n. We perform binary classification using linear SVM. As the VC dimension of linear SVM is p+1, it is capable to shatter n points with any label arrangement. Does that mean we should get a 0 training error? However, I rarely get such training error from my experience working with high dimensional data. Does that suggest an under-fitting?
