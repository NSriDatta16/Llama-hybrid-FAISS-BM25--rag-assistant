It sounds like you are really just looking for a way to strip HTML tags from a string which is not something specific to Qt widgets (unless you want a solution that can take advantage of the rest of the Qt library). Anyway, there seems to be no shortage of hits when searching for "strip html from string". There seems to be 2 general approaches: Use a regular expression ( here there be dragons ) Use an html parser You may find a regex that is good enough for your purposes but you will need a proper html parser to do it right. This stackoverflow question has alot of discussion about the regex option (although the question is looking to strip all tags except links). Since you are using Qt, this question has an answer with examples of using a parser from that library.
