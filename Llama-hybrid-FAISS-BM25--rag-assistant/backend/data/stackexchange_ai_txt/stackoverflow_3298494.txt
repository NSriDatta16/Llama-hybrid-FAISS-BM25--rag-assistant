on the menu set menuChangedMessagesEnabled to YES when you want to update the menu: [menu setMenuChangedMessagesEnabled:NO]; // change the menu [menu setMenuChangedMessagesEnabled:YES]; The second invocation causes the menu to apply changes. The first one is so that you can batch a group of changes together. That said, Apple guidelines discourages changing menus while they're open as users are not used to this and can be confusing. If it's feasible try to redesign your app so you can use something else, say a table or matrix, instead of a menu.
