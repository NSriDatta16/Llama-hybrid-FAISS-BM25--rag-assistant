Modal dialogs from within a tabbed UI (Improved example)

(I have tightened up my original example) I'm trying to invoke modal dialogs from within a tabbed UI, and I'm confused about the behavior I'm seeing. The first time I display the UI, my dialog behaves as expected, I can pull the data out of the fields, everything's wonderful. tabtest2.html: Tabtest 2 jQuery(document).ready(function() { var tabs = $('#tabs').tabs({ load: function(event, ui) { initializeUI(); } }); }); function initializeUI() { jQuery("#button1").click(function() { $(initializeUI.win).dialog("open"); }); $(initializeUI.win) = jQuery("#window1"); //instantiate the dialog $(initializeUI.win).dialog({ height: 350, width: 400, modal: true, position: 'center', autoOpen:false, title:'Create Agent', overlay: { opacity: 0.5, background: 'black'}, buttons: { "Check Text 1": function() { var t1 = $("#text1"); alert("text 1 = " + t1.val()); }, "Close": function() { $(initializeUI.win).dialog("close"); } } }); } Tab1 Google And tab1.html Tab 1 Button 1 Text 1 This allows the dialog to (apparently) work on repeated tab selections, but when I try to change the contents of the text field and examine it, I get the old value (the value from the first invocation)!! It's as if I have created a new copy of the dialog and it's fields, but the original text field is sitting there unseen in the original dialog window, returning it's old results. Obviously, there's a paradigm for handling these dialogs, divs and tabs that I haven't grasped yet. Anyone care to point out my errors?
