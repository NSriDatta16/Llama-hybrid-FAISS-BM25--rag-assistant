The way I've 'solved' this in the end is by putting everything into a data transfer object, which is almost exactly the same as the object I was trying to convert to JSON, but it has allowed me to solve circular issues and also give a little more flexibility elsewhere. I'm sure it's not the best solution, but it works and as it happens solves a bunch of other problems. I just did something like this public object GetDTO() { object data = new { pageData = new { Id = Post.Id, pageUrl = Post.URL, title = Post.PageTitle, description = Post.PageDescription, user = Post.User.Name } }; return data; } Solved the problem albeit not elegantly.
