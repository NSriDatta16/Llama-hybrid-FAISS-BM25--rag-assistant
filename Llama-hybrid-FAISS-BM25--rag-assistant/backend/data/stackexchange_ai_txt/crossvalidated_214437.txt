Is K-Means used the right way?

I have this model where I have a count of a word. Every day I do a count of the word and then calculate a simple ratio for this word by saying: Ratio = Current day count / Past day count So I now have a lot of counted words and the variables Ratio and Count. I now wan't to find the words that are trending, those that are trending but going down, The average words, the suddenly words, the never mind words. I will explain those: The trending words are those words with a high Ratio and a high count. Those that trending, but going down is the words that have a high count but getting lower on the ratio. The average words are like the words with a mean value of the ratio and counts. The suddenly words are the words with a high ratio but low count. The never mind words are those with low ratio and low count. I am not a master in statistics (never done any classes) but I was thinking of using a K-Means algorithm on the data set to split it into 5 clusters, where each cluster represents one of the categories. Is this a way to use K-Means or am I completely off track?
