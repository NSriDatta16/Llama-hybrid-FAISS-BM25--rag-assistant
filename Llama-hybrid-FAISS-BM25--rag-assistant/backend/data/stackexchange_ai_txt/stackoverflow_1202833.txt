But all these queries give back both ids from column id1! I think Robert meant that as a result he just wants "1" from column id1: id1 id2 1 | 1 1 | 2 1 | 3 1 | 4 --> id1s that have id2 with 3 and 4 1 | 5 2 | 1 2 | 2 2 | 3 Because id1=2 does not have 3 AND 4 it should not be a result. Please correct me if I misunderstood... I was trying to do a statement but I could not get just the id1=1 back, but I am as well very interested in an efficient solution to this!
