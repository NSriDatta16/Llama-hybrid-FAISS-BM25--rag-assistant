The question isn't "if" but "when". That it will end is already guaranteed. http://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations.html I take umbrage with the use of the SIR model. It comes with assumptions. One of the assumptions is that eventually everyone is "recovered". Infections are not perpetual, while technology adoption can be (consider the automobile for example). If the business is doomed to eventually die, then when going through death throes the relationships between susceptible, infected, and recovered might be adequately modeled by a particular SIR model. This does not mean the model is descriptive of any of the seasons before end-of-life. It does not take into account other forces - the context. Facebook was part of the context of end of "Myspace" and so while an SIR was appropriate for Myspace-only use, it was not for Social-Network use because many users had accounts on both, and switched to FB-dominant usage. I dug through the zombie-model, and even through some non-zombie SIR fits, and a time and population punctuated-windowed SIR is more appropriate there. It is not a universal model, and it has strengths and weaknesses. That means that the SIR is imperfect even for the systems that it was engineered to model. Such fundamental imperfection for its target suggests that without careful use, application outside the target area can be, ceteris paribus, more problematic than other model.
