Too many predictors to manually check linearity

Say I have 1000 potential predictors in a logistic regression. I don't have time to check each predictor manually for linearity. I could wait till after variable selection, but in that case I wonder if some predictors that have strongly non-linear relationship with the mean may not be selected because their non-linear relationship confounds their significance. suppose logit(P(Y=1))=B_0+B_1X_1+B_2g(X_2) for some unknown g, but I regress logit(P(Y=1))=b_0+b_1X_1+b_2X_2, could it be the case that B_2<>0 but b_2 is not significant? Prhaps because SE(b_2) is too large due to the poor assumption that g(x)= x? Or what if there is collinearity between X_1 and X_2 enough that b_2 appears not significant but there is less collinearity between X_1 and g(X_2)? If this happens I would not know that some of the rejected predictors are actually useful, and then I would be back to needing to find some way to check for appropriate transformations automatically. Is there a good way to automatically check for tranformations when there are hundreds of predictors?
