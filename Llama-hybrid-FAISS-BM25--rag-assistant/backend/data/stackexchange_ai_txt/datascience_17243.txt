PCA will not change the order of your points. The first point will still be the first point. As for the second, this is too unclear to answer. There is no obvious relationship between the number of clusters and the number of PCs. If you use too few PCs, your data approximation is too crude. If you use too many, then you will be working with random deviations too much, and the results will usually be worse, independent of the number of clusters.
