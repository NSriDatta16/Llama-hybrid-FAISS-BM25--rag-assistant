Convert object to byte[]

I am trying to convert a retrieved registry value from object to byte[] . It is stored as REG_BINARY . I tried using BinaryFormatter with MemoryStream . However, it adds overhead information that I do not want. I observed this when I then converted the byte array to a string by performing the function Convert.ToBase64String(..) . I am performing these functions because I am testing the storing and retrieval of an encrypted key in the registry.
