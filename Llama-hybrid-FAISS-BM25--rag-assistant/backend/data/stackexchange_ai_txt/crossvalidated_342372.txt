Interpreting mediation analysis results with non signiciant p-values, when individual tests were significant

I am running a mediation analysis like so: model.M The lmer of Enjoyment ~ Stimlus + (1|P_ID) shows a significant effect of stimlus. The lmer of Flow ~ Stimlus + (1|P_ID) also shows a significant effect of stimlus. I find it therefore a bit stange that there is no direct effect below. Am I correct interpreting that there is no mediation effect from the Enjoyment variable? Both Stimlus and P_ID are categorical variables (is.factor = TRUE). Mediation analysis: Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals Mediator Groups: P_ID Outcome Groups: P_ID Output Based on Overall Averages Across Groups Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME 0.160 -0.314 0.660 0.56 ADE -0.618 -1.052 -0.193 0.00 Total Effect -0.458 -1.064 0.142 0.15 Prop.

Strangely also, during the mediation analysis I get the following warning: Warning message: In mediate(model.M, model.Y, treat = "Stimulus.f", mediator = "Enjoyment", : treatment and control values do not match factor levels; using BmBmGG-BmBmGG and BmGDA-BmGDA as control and treatment, respectively
