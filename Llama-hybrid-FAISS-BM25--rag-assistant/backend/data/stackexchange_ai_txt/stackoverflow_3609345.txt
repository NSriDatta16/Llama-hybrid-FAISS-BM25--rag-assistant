This framework cannot be suitable for large scale project?

I have developed a project using Symfony that on average takes circa 500ms to load one page on my laptop locally. I am worried. This laptop is at the minute only serving me, but what happens when this becomes a large scale project same size as facebook and mySpace? Surely, Symfony cannot be suitable for a large scale project like youTube for a number of reasons? Thank you for your time. Marius
