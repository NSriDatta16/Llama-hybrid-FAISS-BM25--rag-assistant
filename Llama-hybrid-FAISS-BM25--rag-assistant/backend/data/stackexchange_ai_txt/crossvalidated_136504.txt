How to properly state the average of a discrete number in a report?

I'm wording a report on the averages of a discrete variable, and am trying to get the most appropriate sounding wording. Consider the able below: Average pets per household by income Income ($) | Cats | Dogs -----------+------+------ 50k | 2.0 | 1.9 Is it right to say: The average number of dogs in low income households is 1.1. While that's what the table states, its seems odd to talk about fractions of dogs. Contrast this with: The average number of dogs in low income households was about 1. This is right, but doesn't convey that it is above one, just near it. Lastly: The average number of dogs in low income households was between 1 and 2. This again seems odd as there isn't anything between 1 and 2. Which of these is the most neutral and factual with respect to the data? Is there a better to way to word this accurately?
