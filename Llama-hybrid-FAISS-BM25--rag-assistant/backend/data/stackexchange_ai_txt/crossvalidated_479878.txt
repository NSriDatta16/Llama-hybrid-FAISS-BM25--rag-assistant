You can try performing a nonlinear regression prediction using a neural network. Common practice is to let the output node (the $y$ your predict) not use a nonlinear activation function. You can use as bootstrap estimates (1 $-$ the historic saving rate) as fraction of expected income. Later on, you may adapt your model when its predictions are too linear.
