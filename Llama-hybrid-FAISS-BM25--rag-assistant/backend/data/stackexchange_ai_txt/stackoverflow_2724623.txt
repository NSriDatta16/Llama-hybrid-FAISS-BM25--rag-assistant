You know the mvn command line well! To put this command line into IDEA, right click on your root project, one of the options will be "Create ... [package]". Make these edits: set the name to something like "Make Model [install]" In the goals box, enter your command line, i.e. "-am -pl model install" I know these aren't strictly goals, but it seems they are passed directly to maven. (Tested in IDEA 9.0.1) When you run this command, it will now make Model - and the modules it depends on. Equally useful is the "-amd" to make all dependent moduels to verify that changes to Model haven't broken other modules. Having to create Run commands is not quite as elegant as the built-in UI, but you can associate these commands with hotkeys for quick access. Hope this helps! mdma PS: A small aside. Package is currently your default build goal - this may not work as intended with multi-module builds, since the latest built classes are not accessible to dependent modules - using install as the default goal is recommended to ensure the most recently built versions of artefacts are used by dependents. If you're concerned that installing might add a broken artefact to the local repo and break all your local builds, use a separate local repo for each project (use a custom settings.xml.)
