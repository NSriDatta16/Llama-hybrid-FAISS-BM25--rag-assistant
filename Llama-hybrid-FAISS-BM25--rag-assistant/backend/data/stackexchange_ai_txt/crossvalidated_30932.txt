What do you think would cause the change? Is it a change in the mean, the variance or something else? The type of change you expect should determine the parameter you should test for change. Is this a sudden change? If so this could be done using intervention analysis for time series such as is done with Box Jenkins models for statiomary Gaussian time series. The autobox software can handle this for you.
