You should be able to use the volume id paired with total disk size and volume name to determine if a disk is the same or not, although volume id by itself should be sufficient. The only problem might be mass produced media. In some instances the volume id, disk size and volume name would match for all copies. EDIT I'm not sure if you can absolutely get around it for all devices generically. Hardware from each vendor is different, and the specifications are up for interpretation, which is why serial number for some devices is null, for some its not. Your only hope would be to either supply the hardware yourself or to require specific hardware which behaves in a predictable manner. If you can write to the device, and it would be acceptable to the user, you could create a read only system hidden file containing a unique identifier (such as a guid) and use that file for comparison. This would only stop average users who run windows with the defaults (hide system files, and don't have show hidden files checked) from copying the file, and including the volume id, disk size and volume name also in your check would insist that it is only allowed to a mirrored device. It might not get all instances, but it might get enough.
