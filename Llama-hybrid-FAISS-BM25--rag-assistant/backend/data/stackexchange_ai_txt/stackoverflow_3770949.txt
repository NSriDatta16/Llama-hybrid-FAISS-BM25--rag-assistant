XSLT Escaping Characters

I have the following fragment in XSLT. Is there a way to rewrite it without escaping the characters and > with the ASCII equivalent? ... ... I have a string of space delimited numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and I would like to convert each one of them in XML tags like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 My code above does that, but I don't want to use the ASCII escape chars.
