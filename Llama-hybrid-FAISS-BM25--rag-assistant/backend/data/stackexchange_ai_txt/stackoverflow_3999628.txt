TFS 2010 Build Service

Consider a TFS 2010 server with "Build Service", "Build Controller" and "Build Agent" running on the same system. Things work 'most of the time', however occasionally I have to restart the 'Build Service'. Few questions: What is the Build Service? Do the build agents talk to anything other than the build controller (for example TFS)? I ask because I want to put the agents in another network which doesn't have access to TFS but a quick test shows that they are still looking for TFS, any ideas why? My Build Service shows 3350 errors (!) in the last 24 hours. Looking at the event log I see a LOT of Controller or Agent "Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local\Temp\BuildController\1\System.Core.dll'". Any ideas what its problem is? I can just feed it the files but I would like to know why it doesn't know where to find them. Exact error from the event log: Service 'Default Agent - thakur' had an exception: Exception Message: Problem with loading custom assemblies: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local\Temp\BuildAgent\1\System.Core.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. (type Exception) Exception Stack Trace: Service 'Default Controller - thakur' had an exception: Exception Message: Problem with loading custom assemblies: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local\Temp\BuildController\1\System.Core.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. (type Exception) Exception Stack Trace: There is nothing in the logs after 'Exception Stack Trace:'.
