If you choose a very bad starting state then it will take longer (perhaps a very long time) to converge to the limiting distribution, but as long as your chain is ergodic it will converge eventually. In MCMC we typically throw away some portion at the beginning of the chain as "burn-in," so having a very bad starting point might mean you need a longer burn-in. I'm not sure what you want exactly one sample point from each run for--if you're going to go the second way you might as well keep all the draws from each run and use them to estimate the density. Draws from a single run generally aren't independent of each other (which is one reason you might want multiple runs), but there's no reason to just throw away all that information.
