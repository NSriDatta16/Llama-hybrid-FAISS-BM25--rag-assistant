Yes, this really works, under certain conditions, with a couple of caveats Random selection: You can't just ask any 5 people. It would need to be randomly selected from the population whose median you wanted an interval for. Understanding what a confidence interval means. The interval for a parameter will have a certain coverage ... but that doesn't necessarily correspond to how confident you personally are about it ... personal confidence is not the same thing as coverage. Specifically, that 93.75 percent is a frequentist probability - a long run proportion. Loosely, if you use the same methodology many, many times, about 93.75 percent of those intervals will include the population median. The calculation of the coverage is based on assuming continuous responses. It's not necessarily very useful; the range of 5 values will tend to be quite wide. The calculation of the coverage is mathematically straightforward (see the last paragraph below) but it's also easy to see via simulation. e.g. here's a quick simulation in R: mean(replicate(1000000,between(range(runif(5)),0.5))) [1] 0.937464 (where between is just: function(x, m) x[1] m ; if you were doing it for a discrete variable you'd want = and to define your interval to be closed; it doesn't matter in the continuous case) It doesn't really matter how big the population was; this calculation effectively uses infinite population. A small population would not have a lower chance. I used the uniform distribution as a source of continuous random numbers but the same result would apply for any other continuous distribution, since the order relationships are unaltered by any monotonic transformation. With a continuous variable, the probability that all the values lay to the left of the population median would be $\frac12^5 = \frac{1}{32}$ . Similarly for them all to be to the right. Consequently the coverage of the range of 5 randomly selected values is $\frac{15}{16} = 0.9375$ .
