When should train and test data be merged?

I am very new to data science and machine learning. I am following courses on datacamp, and then trying to solve problems on kaggle/drivendata. Very often, I try to use the sklearn.model_selection train_test_split()-method, but because my training (X) and test (y) data is not same shape, I get the error: ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [913000, 45000] When I look at other people's solution, it looks like they very often combine training and test data (datasets in this case: train & test), like this: all_data = train.append(test, sort = False) Then later, they split this up again into variables X and y, which they can use on the train_test_split method. (You can probably hear I am very new and don't quite understand what's happening yet). Can anyone explain me, why I need to combine my training and test data, when I already have them in separate .csv files? Maybe share some resources that explain it? Thanks a lot
