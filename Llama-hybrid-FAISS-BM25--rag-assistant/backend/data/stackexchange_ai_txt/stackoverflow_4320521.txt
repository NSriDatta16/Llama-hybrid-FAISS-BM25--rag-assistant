How to draw a line on top of an image when finger moves on iPhone

I am trying to draw a line on top of a background image in my UIView tracing the movements of the user's finger. I can accomplish this by drawing the UIImage as my background and then doing my line drawing in drawRect but I have to load the image each time drawRect is called and it makes performance sluggish. Alternatively, if I use a UIImageView as my background image (just adding it to the view in IB or programatically) the lines disappear when it is dragged over the image. Is there a way to tell the lines to draw on top of the UIImageView. Thanks for your help. Here is my code using the UIImage method: - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { UIImage *imageField = [UIImage imageNamed:@"field.jpg"]; CGRect rectForImage=CGRectMake(0,0,200,200); [imageField drawInRect:rectForImage]; CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); CGContextMoveToPoint(context, x1, y1); CGContextAddLineToPoint(context, x2, y2); CGContextStrokePath(context); }
