I'm new to C++, but I think that your class declaration only declares that those static members exist, you still need to define them somewhere: class MagicNumbers { public: static const int BIG; static const int SMALL; }; const int MagicNumbers::BIG = 100; const int MagicNumbers::SMALL = 10; The higher optimisation levels probably include a level of static analysis thorough enough to determine that BIG and SMALL can be exchanged with their actual values and not to give them any actual storage (the semantics will be the same), so defining these variables in this circumstance would be redundant, hence it links OK.
