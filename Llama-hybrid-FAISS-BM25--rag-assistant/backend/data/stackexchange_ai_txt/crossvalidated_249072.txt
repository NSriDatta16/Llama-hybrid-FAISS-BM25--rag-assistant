I do not believe that the residual deviance statistic has a $\chi^2$ distribution. I think it is a degenerate distribution because asymptotic theory does not apply when the degrees of freedom increases at the same speed as the sample size. At any rate I doubt that the test has sufficient power, and encourage directed tests such as tests of linearity using regression splines and tests of interaction.
