The server must check the User-Agent header that the browser sends with its request. The server uses iframe if it looks like an Internet Explorer user-agent, and object for everything else (including Firefox, Chrome, and wget). I confirmed that the browsers weren't somehow changing the code themselves by using wget and altering only its --user-agent argument. As for exactly where or why the server is doing this, I can't say.
