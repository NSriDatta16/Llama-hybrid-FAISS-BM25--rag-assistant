how to use logistic regression for this scenario

I want to know if depending on country will an individuals response to 6 different questions which predicts an outcome variable scored as (yes/no) differ. E.g someone from country X may score higher on the 6 questions which in turn predicts whether they answered yes/no to my outcome variable. I'm confused on how to analyze this because if i include country as another IV it wont tell me whether being from a particular country influenced the way respondents answered the 6 questions which in turn affected their outcome response- it simply tell me if country as another IV along with the 6 i already have predicts the outcome. Could i use the selection variable box on SPSS and run a log.reg. for each country separately? I.e so i would report the logistic model results for each country individually by selecting those cases for country x and again do this for country Y.
