Scaling matters. The y values will be ignored because of the x axis. Parameters matter. You probably used DBSCAN with the sklearn default parameter values which are utter nonsense for anything but 2d normalized toy data. Asking the right question matters. What are clusters here supposed to be anyway? I don't see any clusters. You show a time series with plenty of missing data, but there are no clusters. You seem to want to split your time series where you have missing values, but that is not clustering. You likely can abuse clustering such as DBSCAN here (just try minpts=1, epsilon=100 or similar) but that is an incredibly inefficient way to solve this, because you abuse a multivariate approach for a trivial one-dimensional problem. Sort by time. If the next timestamp is much larger than the previous, this is the end of a subintervals (I wouldn't call these clusters). That is easily done with a for loop.
