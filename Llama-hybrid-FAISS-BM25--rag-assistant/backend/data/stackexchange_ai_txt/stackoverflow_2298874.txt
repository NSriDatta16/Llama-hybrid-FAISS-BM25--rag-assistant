One option that just occurred to me is to have the .jar file write some Preference value for which file to open, then just open the JNLP URL without any arguments. When the JNLP launches, it can check for the Preference value and load the appropriate file. This seems nicer than trying to hack a dynamic JNLP definition file on the server.
