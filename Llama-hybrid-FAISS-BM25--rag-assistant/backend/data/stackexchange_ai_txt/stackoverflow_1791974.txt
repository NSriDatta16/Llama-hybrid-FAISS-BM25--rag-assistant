Best Practices for how to include unit tests in a library

I'm working on a general code library for ActionScript 3.0 called as3lib which includes several extensions to the core API and some useful functions. I've written several unit tests (using FlexUnit) to make sure everything is working correctly. What is the best way to organize these tests in the library? Currently, I have all my code in src/ and my tests in test/ but I've set up a secondary Flex project to run the unit tests. I am also manually adding and removing the test files from the library when I want to run the tests. What I'm doing doesn't seem right. Is there a better way? Preferably one where the compiled library doesn't include the test files but I don't need two separate projects to test them.
