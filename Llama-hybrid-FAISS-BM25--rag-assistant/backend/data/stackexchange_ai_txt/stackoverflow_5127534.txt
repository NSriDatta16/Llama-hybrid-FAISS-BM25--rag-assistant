log4j Log Indexing using Solr

We are finding it very hard to monitor the logs spread over a cluster of four managed servers. So, I am trying to build a simple log4j appender which uses solrj api to store the logs in the solr server. The idea is to use leverage REST of solr to build a better GUI which could help us search the logs and the display the previous and the next 50 lines or so and tail the logs Being awful on front ends, I am trying to cookup something with GWT (a prototype version). I am planning to host the project on googlecode under ASL. Greatly appreciate if you could throw some insights on Whether it makes sense to create a project like this ? Is using Solr for this an overkill? Any suggestions on web framework/tool which will help me build a tab-based front end for tailing.
