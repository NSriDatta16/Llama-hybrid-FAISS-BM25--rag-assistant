div element flashes when adjusting visibility

I would like to hide a div when a button is clicked and show it when a link is clicked, but what is happening is it simply blinks, whether showing it or hiding it. It does this no matter what way I try to change its visibility on the page: changing top:-1000px; to top:0px; or visibility: hidden to visibility: visible or using the display "" vs "none" attributes. All these cause it to appear (if making visible) for a flash, or disappear (if making hidden) for a flash. I'm calling a JS function when clicking a link to show the div, and calling a JS function when submitting the form in the div to hide the div again. Any clue why this could happen? A few points about the page that might be relevant: -some elements are drawn via Javascript during onLoad for the Body{}, but not those containing this element, or this element itself. -this ...is called in the head section, and includes the below functions -I've also tried putting the hide/show functions directly following the relevant div in the html code, but no change. .css for the div: div#userRegistration{ text-align: center; width: 100%; height: 150%; position: absolute; background-color: white; z-index: 20; top: -1000px; } JS function to show - updated per below: function userRegistration(){ document.getElementById("userRegistration").style.top = '0px'; return true; } JS function to hide (note this never gets used unless I can get the div to show up and stay in the first place) - updated: function validateUserRegistration(){ document.getElementById("userRegistration").style.display = 'none'; return true; } the updated HTML (per 2 suggestions below): New User Registration: Email: User Name: Password: Repeat Password: &nbsp;&nbsp; EDIT: The empty href="" below reloading the page is what was causing the "flash". Thanks to techtheatre for bringing this to my attention. /EDIT HTML that initially shows the div (does the same flashy-thing as when trying to hide the div if it is already visible on page load): New User?
