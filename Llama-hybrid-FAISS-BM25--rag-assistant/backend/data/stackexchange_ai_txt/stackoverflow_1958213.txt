The best choice for Person table primary key

What is your choice for primary key in tables that represent a person (like Client, User, Customer, Employee etc.)? My first choice would be an social security number (SSN). However, using SSN has been discouraged because of privacy concerns and different regulations. SSN can change during person lifetime, so that is another reason against it. I guess that one of the functions of well chosen natural primary key is to avoid duplication. I do not want a person to be registered twice in the database. Some surrogate or generated primary key does not help in avoiding duplicate entries. What is the best way to approach this? What is the best way to guarantee uniqueness in your application for person entity and can this be handled on database level with primary key or uniqueness constraint?
