header - like files in C#

Is there a way to 'fake' header files in C# using namespaces? From what I've heard, there is no way to get the preprocessing that they provided in C++; but I'd like the organization aspect of it rather than wrapping classes in namespaces and relying on an IDE to tell me whats in what . for example (note the incorrect syntax) suppose ns1.cs iamaclass.cs iamanotherclass.cs yaclass.cs yaaclass.cs where ns1.cs 's contents are: namespace ns1 { extern class iamaclass; extern class iamanotherclass; namespace ns1-nested { extern class yaclass extern class yaaclass } }
