Passing complex parameter to jsp include

In my main jsp I am including another jsp to display a fragment of the page. I need to pass a parameter to this include: I know about: My problem is that the value needs to be a complicated string (which probably needs to be escaped) (e.g. .. ). In other words, the value needs to be a bit of markup itself. What is the proper way to get the string over to the include without breaking the markup?
