When can I use $XX^\top/n$ as covariance matrix for PCA?

Given a data matrix $\mathbf X$, can I always obtain its covariance matrix (to use in PCA) by centering (subtracting the column means) and then computing $\mathbf X \mathbf X^\top/n$? Is this always valid? Can I always center the data by subtracting the mean? Are there any restrictions when this cannot be applied? I am working on quantum algorithms for principal component analysis (PCA). There exists a quantum algorithm which can calculate the PCA exponentially faster (at least in theory), but it works only if the covariance matrix is given in the Gram form, i.e. in the $\mathbf X\mathbf X^\top$ form. That is why I am wondering if there are any restrictions for this form? The relationship between SVD and PCA is explained in this excellent post but it couldn't answer my question.
