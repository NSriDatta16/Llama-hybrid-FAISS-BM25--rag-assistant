It is usually obvious in python which variables are local and which are global, since to modify a global variable you have to declare it using the the global keyword at the start of a function. However I sometimes add a global declaration even if it is not necessary for python to compile it, in order to emphasize that an object is global - e.g. modifying a mutable global data-structure. Arguments should be obvious because they are in the function declaration. As others have said constants should be in UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, which is a convention shared by many languages. If you find that you are having trouble keeping track of which are global, local and parameter variables I suggest that the problem may be your functions are too long and doing too much. Functions & methods should be short and do exactly one thing. I start to get the refactoring itch if my functions go over about 10-20 lines of code. I recommend reading the book Clean Code by Robert Martin. The examples are in Java, but the principles apply to all languages.
