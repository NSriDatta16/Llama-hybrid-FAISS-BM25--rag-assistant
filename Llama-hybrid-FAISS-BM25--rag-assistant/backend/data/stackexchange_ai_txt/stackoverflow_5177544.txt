CakePHP Media Plugin - Upload Folder

I am using the Media Plugin (http://www.ohloh.net/p/cakephp-media). I wanna define custom folder for all the uplaods. i am a little confused where it has to be done. This is the folder structure i want to achieve webroot/media/image/original (for the original file storage) webroot/media/image/large (for the large image filter) webroot/media/image/medium (for the medium image filter) webroot/media/image/small (for the small image filter) also i want to use a random name that i want to generate using the following sript. //UUID generator function _imgName() { return time() . substr(md5(microtime()), 0, 12); }
