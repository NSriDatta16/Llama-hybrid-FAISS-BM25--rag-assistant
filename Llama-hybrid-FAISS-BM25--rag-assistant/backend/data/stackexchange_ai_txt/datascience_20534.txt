Basically, this is selecting a sample from the true distribution which consists of the true class and some other noisy class labels. Then taking the softmax over it. This is based on sampling words from true distribution and noise distribution. Here the basic Idea is to train logistic regression classifier which can separate the samples obtained from true distribution and sample obtained from noise distribution. Remember When we are talking about the samples obtained from the true distribution we are talking about only one sample which is the true class obtained from the model distribution. Here I have explained about NCE loss and how it differ from the NCE loss . Noise Contrastive Estimation : Solution for expensive Softmax .
