Unfortunately, after a quick Googling I don't think the parsing mechanism for InitParams follows any sort of encoding scheme. It'd actually be better if it were a URL Query String fragment, which has a fairly standard encoding and rules and is comma friendly. So I think your only option is to use a different delimeter, such as the pipe symbol |. E.g.: key1=value1,key2=two|values If that had to be a comma in the value for whatever reason, you could always do String.Replace...
