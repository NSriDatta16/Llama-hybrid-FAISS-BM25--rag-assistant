vsConsole FileView may help if you prefer to monitor your logs via a web application. See the demo at http://demo.vamonossoftware.com/ Requires you run a java app server, deploy vsConsole to it, and run agents on the server containing the logs - so I'm guessing its a more heavy weight solution than what you need here. (Its good for dev/testing teams who just want to click on a log file to see it rather than ssh, cd, tail etc)
