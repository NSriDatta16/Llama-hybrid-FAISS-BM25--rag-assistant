I don't know about a circle, but you can selectively put a square border around any field by going into the Format Editor, then under the Border tab. Then, under Color put in a formula like: if {YourField} = "Y" then crBlack else crNoColor My personal opinion is that if you just want to draw more attention to these fields, a conditional formatting of font color/style might be a more visually appealing way to go.
