I don't think that cursors, temporary tables or other SQL practices are inherently bad or that their usage is a clear sign of how good a database programmer is. I think there is the right tool for every type of problem. Sure, if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I think a great SQL programmer or database developer is a person who knows which tool is the right one in a specific situation. IMHO you can't generalize excluding specific patterns. But a rule of thumb may be: a great database developer will find a more short and elegant solution for complex situations than the average programmer.
