Besides what Bert F said , many commands, including log has the -r (or --revision ) option. The following are some practical examples using this option to show ranges of revisions: To list everything in ascending order: svn log -r 1:HEAD To list everything in descending order: svn log -r HEAD:1 To list everything from the thirteenth to the base of the currently checked-out revision in ascending order: svn log -r 13:BASE To get everything between the given dates: svn log -r {2011-02-02}:{2011-02-03} You can combine all the above expressions with the --limit option, so that can you have a quite granular control over what is printed. For more info about these -r expressions refer to svn help log or the relevant chapter in the book Version Control with Subversion
