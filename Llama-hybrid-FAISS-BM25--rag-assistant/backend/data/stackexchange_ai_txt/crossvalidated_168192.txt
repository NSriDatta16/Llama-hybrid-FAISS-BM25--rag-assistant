Just to take up your last question (so I'm not after a prize!), about a link between a Bayesian/Frequentist approach and one's epistemological position, the most interesting author I've come upon is Deborah Mayo. A good starting point is this 2010 exchange between Mayo and Andrew Gelman (who emerges here as a somewhat heretical Bayesian). Mayo later published a detailed response to the Gelman & Shalizi paper here .
