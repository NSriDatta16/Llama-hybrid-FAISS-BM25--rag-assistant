LibSVM - interpreting model output

I am using libSVM on a subset of the MNIST, and I am struggling to interpret the output. I have learned that rho is the bias term, and that sv_coef is the multiplier used to get to the weight term. What is confusing me is the dimensions of the outputs: Parameters: [5×1 double] nr_class: 10 totalSV: 4282 rho: [45×1 double] Label: [10×1 double] sv_indices: [] ProbA: [45×1 double] ProbB: [45×1 double] nSV: [10×1 double] sv_coef: [4282×9 double] SVs: [4282×784 double] Why do we end up with dimensions of 45 for rho and 9 for the second dimension of sv_coef ?
