It is C++ syntax and equivalent to this: class texmacs_input_rep : public concrete_struct { public: ... }; This is the normal syntax for inheritance of classes, here texmacs_input_rep is inherited from concrete_struct . About that syntax in C: The C-Standard you linked to defines (6.7.2.1): struct-or-union-speciﬁer: struct-or-union identiﬁer opt { struct-declaration-list } struct-or-union identiﬁer struct-or-union: struct union So according to C it must be struct , followed by an optional identifer, followed by { . Or only struct followed by an identifer (a forward declaration). In neither case there is room for an additional : ... in there. The : mentioned later in that paragraph of the standard is about bit-field widths, like this; struct foo { unsigned a : 4; unsigned b : 3; }; Here a and b are only 4 and 3 bits wide, but that's different syntax than in the question.
