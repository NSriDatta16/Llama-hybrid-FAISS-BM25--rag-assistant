How can I access informations about connected storage devices on Mac OS X?

I'm looking for a way to list all connected storage devices, like Disk Utility does. That means also for not mounted volumes. The second thing I'm looking for is more detailed information, to what port a device is connected, the size of it and the block size of it. Is there an API to do this? I prefer Cocoa, but a unix API is also ok. What I've found so far diskutil can be used on the command line. getmntinfo and getfsstat return information about mounted devices.
