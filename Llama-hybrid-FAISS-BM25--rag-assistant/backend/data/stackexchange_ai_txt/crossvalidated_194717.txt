A measure for level of experience

For a survey about mountain bike injuries I would like to obtain some information to allow me to quantify the level of experience of the rider. Ideally I would want to end up with some kind of ordinal variable in my analysis to indicate this. However in the survey I was considering to ask something along the line of "How many years have you been riding MTB" and "During those years, how many hours a week (or month) have you been riding on average". So sort of a variation of the package years measure for smoking exposure . Based on that I would then bin it somehow to get an ordinal variable. Does any one know of any other, perhaps validated ways of quantifying experience?
