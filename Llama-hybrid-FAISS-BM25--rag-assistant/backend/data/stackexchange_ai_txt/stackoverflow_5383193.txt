Android, array question

I am working on a storage handling application(real storage). My app. is calling on button push the ZXing barcode reader, after scaning the code, a new activity(window) pops up. Where i can read the scanned code, and i can put in an amount(how much i want from that product). I got there a next and a finish button, on the finish button i go back to the main window. On the next button, the ZXing is called again, i scan the result window pops up , amount input and so on so on... Now to the question, i am going to store the scannedcode+amount in an array. So i can display them in a ListView. I got this: String[] names = new String[] { "Linux", "Windows7", "Eclipse", "Suse", "Ubuntu", "Solaris", "Android", "iPhone"}; so i know thats how i make an array with data and thats how i display it: this.setListAdapter(new ArrayAdapter (this,android.R.layout.simple_list_item_checked, product)); I would like to know how i do an empty array, and how i can add new string to it when ever i push the Next button, i will pass the array with bundle between the activitys. So thats it. Uhm and yea is it possible to edit a specific part of the array, cause thats the reason of the list where i show the array to the user, so he can go for example on the Eclipse row, click it and he can write in Android and save. I hope some one can help or give me some hint on both problems. Thank you in front.
