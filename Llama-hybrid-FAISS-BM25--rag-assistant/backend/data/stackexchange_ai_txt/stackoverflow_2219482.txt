The short answer is that yes, this is possible in Flash/Flex, and the key things you need to do in your code are: Enable Accessibility in your application. Give your components a specified tabIndex value . There is a wealth of information about Accessibility in the Adobe documentation, and while it isn't often well-organized or up-to-date, a healthy dose of googling around the related community sites will produce the practical techniques you need. Note, however, that the target screen reader for the Flex framework is JAWS, the flawed-but-market-dominant Windows screen reading software implementing the MSAA standard . Flex has no built-in support for any other accessibility standards or software.
