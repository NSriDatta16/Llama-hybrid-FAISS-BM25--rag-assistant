Setting the thread /proc/PID/cmdline?

On Linux/NPTL , threads are created as some kind of process. I can see some of my process have a weird cmdline: cat /proc/5590/cmdline hald-addon-storage: polling /dev/scd0 (every 2 sec) Do you have an idea how I could do that for each thread of my process? That would be very helpful for debugging.
