Pointer declarations in Objective C

When reading various texts or code examples on Obj-C I see pointer declarations like this: NSString *myStringPtr but sometimes I see, NSString * myStringPtr where there is a space between the name and the *. Is there a difference between these declarations or are they both just pointers to an object of type NSString or am I missing something? In general is the space between the * and name necessary? I have even seen NSString* myStringPtr Is this any different than the above statements? I realize (NSString *) for method return types or arguments means the method is returning (or being passed) a pointer to an NSString object.
