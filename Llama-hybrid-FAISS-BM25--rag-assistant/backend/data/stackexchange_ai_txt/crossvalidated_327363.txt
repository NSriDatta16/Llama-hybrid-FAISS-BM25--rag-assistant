Splitting into two identical standard deviations

I am looking at estimating the output of two machines. However, the only data I have is the combined output of these machines. These machines are pretty much identical and interchangeable. The data I have is the weekly production rate (in linear feet / hr) of the WORKSTATION . The workstation has two identical machines which are both constantly fed from the same queue. So the data I have is basically (Machine1LF + Machine2LF) and (Machine1WorkHr + Machine2WorkHr) for the last 40 weeks. I need to take this aggregate data and estimate the weekly average and standard deviation of LF/hr for each machine. To estimate the standard deviation of each machine's output (LF/hr) I intuitively arrived at: $$ \sigma^{2} _{X} + \sigma^{2} _{Y} = \sigma^{2} _{(X+Y)} $$ Where $$ \sigma^{2}_X = \sigma^{2}_Y $$ yielding $$ \sigma_{x} = \sigma_{y} = \frac{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} _{(X+Y)}}}{\sqrt{2}} $$ This seems right to me and looks to test correctly when I simulate the results, but searching the internet for a formal definition the only thing I can find is: $$\sigma_{(X+Y)} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}_X + \sigma^{2}_Y + 2cov(X,Y)} $$ which has the added covariance term, and understanding that the covariance of a number with itself is not 0, it is the variance of itself which leads me to: $$\sigma_{(X+Y)} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}_X + \sigma^{2}_Y + 2\sigma^{2}_X} $$ yielding $$ \sigma_{x} = \sigma_{y} = \frac{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} _{(X+Y)}}}{2} $$ I would be fine going with this since it is the formal definition, but the problem is that it does not test out when I simulate the results. Could someone please advise where my assumptions or calculations went wrong?
