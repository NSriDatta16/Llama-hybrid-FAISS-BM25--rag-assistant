The simplest approach is to use the built-in taxonomy module to associate content with a department (a taxonomy term ). If there are only few departments, you will not even need a module like taxonomy_menu to give you menu entries for the taxonomy terms. But, depending on your requirements, there are other options: If you have an order on your content that editors should maintain manually rather than it being maintained based on timestamps, the book module allows that. If members of a department have special rights on their content, one organic group (module organic groups ) per department would be a natural choice. If you need further separation, eg. separate user spaces or completely separate content or upload areas, check out the multi-site setup ( handbook ). Good luck.
