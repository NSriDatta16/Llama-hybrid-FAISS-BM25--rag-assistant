User enters credential. System validates credential. Upon successful authentication, server saves user object into session. System grabs user info from session. System displays webpage. Tadaa!! :) UPDATE To add a little more... User visits the secured webpage. System checks if session contains a user object. If user object exists in session, allow user through to visit the page. If user object doesn't exists, redirect user to login page. You don't need to store user password in the session. In fact, it is highly discouraged. Checking to make sure the user object exists in the session is sufficient. When the user clicks the logout page, then proceed to invalidate the session... that's it. :)
