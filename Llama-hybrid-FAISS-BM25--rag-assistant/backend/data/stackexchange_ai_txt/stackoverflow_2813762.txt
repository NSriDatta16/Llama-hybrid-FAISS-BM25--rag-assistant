I have done this in the past, and I feel obligated to warn you that I think you will be better off not identifying documents as belonging to departments. As you say, they change and grow (and I assume shrink) over time, so you have to keep changing your lists. I suspect you will have more luck tagging the docs. For example, this doc has a customerid=12345 and an invoiceid=asdasdasd. Another doc has no customer id, rather it has a paymentid=1234567890. Then each department can decide what it is interested in, and changes won't require changes to the scanned document -- just the retrieval mechanism. EDIT : I should also have noted that some organizations have temps or lower level folks doing the scanning. If you have to rely on them to correctly categorize a document you might lose or misfile digital documents, just as you would paper documents. Again, perhaps another reason not to link docs strictly to departments. Also, having tags allows a single document to be linked to 2 departments or sub-departments; that alone might be reason enough not to do it your way.
