I'm not a SQL guru, so I couldnt' figure out a good way to do this in pure SQL. Of course, this means I couldn't find a way to do it with named_scopes, either. But you can find parents, and subtract that from all nodes, like so: def childless @childless ||= self.all - self.all(:joins => :children) end This isn't as elegant as I'd like, since it requires loading a lot in memory. But it only takes 2 select statements, which is good. I'll be interested to see the other answers.
