Time series object with multiple station data with different time periods?

How can make a time series object from a set of data. I have data set from a number of regional meteorological stations. And I don't know how to create a time series object that includes time series data from different meteorological stations. My data has following structure , indicates csv file like structure for understanding) . indicates several different data X1,x2, x3 xn and y1,y2 y3 yn indicate different values stationId: Each station has a unique ID number (That I want to use is as a categorical value) Nu, StationID, Year, MeanTemp, MaxTemp 1, 1001 , 1950, x1 , y1 2, 1001 , 1951, x2 , y2 3, 1001 , 1952, x3 , y3 ., 1001 , . , xi , yi ., 1001 , . , xi+1 , yi+1 50, 1001 , 2000, x50 , y50 51, 1002 , 1970, . , . 52, 1002 , 1971 ., . , 1972 ., . , 1973 80, 1002 , 2000 81, 1003 , 1960 84, 1003 , 1961 ., . , etc. My question is: Is it possible to create a time series object; that have more then one meteorological station data where stations may have different number of collected data (one -say- 50 year-long but the other has 40 the third one is 60) The problem is I have more then 250 stations, spanning different years, and have 11 different climate data: Rainfall, temperature, snow fall, freezing days etc. I want to create a loop code to repeat the same analyses for different climate station with respect to changes in the station ID. first I need to solve this time series object problem.
