I study non-stationarity just visually. I then take first differences. I don't see a 12-month lag significant acf , so I decide not to use the seasonal part. I build Arima manually as follows: time-series is differenced once there are 2 lags showing significant acf I try with and without moving average (I judge by the residual acf ) I try include drift or not (I judge by the SE of its coefficient) I study summary and acf(resids) Finally I plot it. x
