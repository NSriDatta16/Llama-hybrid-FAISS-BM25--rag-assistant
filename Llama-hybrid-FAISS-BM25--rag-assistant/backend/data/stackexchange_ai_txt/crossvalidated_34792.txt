In my opinion, this question has been done to death but surfaces again and again due to slightly different nomenclature. First off, it depends on what your scientific question is : are you interested in trend (averaged differential response comparing groups) or heterogeneity (piecewise comparisons of responses among all categories)? What are the outcomes of the study? What are your stimuli? Are the stimuli categorical or ordered somehow or continuous in nature? These are details that statisticians need to know. Ordinal regression is the family of methods around coding ordinal responses by their numeric categories. The physical quantities you estimate are uselessly intepreted as "expected differences in ordinal response levels" (this is verbatim how you would report regression coefficients) which are often non-integral, however the statistics around those quantities do test for association in the response levels . So coding, "very poor" as 0 and "excellent" as 5 in the case of Likert data is sensible. You are using the word dependent ambiguously here. Does your experimental design have repeated measures within individuals? Is one individual exposed to many stimuli and recorded for different responses at different times? This would be repeated measures. Otherwise, I think you are confused about dependence and each stimulus/outcome observation is pairwise independent from other observations.
