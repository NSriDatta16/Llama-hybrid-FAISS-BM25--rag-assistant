Fan page vs Application page

I'm writing a mobile app where I intend to allow facebook posts. Now, I'm a bit confused with what I want to do. For authentication I need an actual app page. Fan page has analytics and in general seems more friendly for users So I'm debating what to do: Just use an application page. That's what Zynga seems to be doing Have both application page and fan page. This seems to be what some other apps (Doodle Jump) do, but I worry that it may confuse users / dilute presence by fragmenting user likes, as if you click on the link of a post ('posted by app'), you go to the application page. The main goal of our page is communicating with users / create a sense of community. Since choosing a custom name is a permanent decision, I would like to hear your thoughts on pro/cons of each approach.
