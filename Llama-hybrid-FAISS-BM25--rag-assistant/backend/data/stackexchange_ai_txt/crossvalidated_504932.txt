Which models can be used to explain data with oscillating binary variables?

The title may be confusing so let me show for demonstration purpose a one-dimensional feature vector x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and the corresponding labels y = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] A logistic regression model may lead to the following curve Now suppose the labels actually look like this y2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] The corresponding curve after training could look like this: As we can see, this model clearly doesn't describe the data well. Is there a "prerequisite" that disallows logistic regression models to be used when the shown case happens? Are there any "standard" models that can describe the data more accurately?
