Deep learning (and in particular deep convoluted neural networks) is very popular right now because of recent, substantial improvements in various machine vision / object detection challenges. Deep convents in particular have been used to reduce ImageNet classification errors from 28% in 2010 to 7% in 2014. Deep learning is certainly overhyped but that shouldn't detract from the fact that there have been meaningful improvements in the field of machine vision.
