You can do many things with BSD licensed code, but you can't exactly "relicense" it. The couple of paragraphs you see in the code is the actual license , and it tells you exactly what you must do and not do. It's very short and simple enough to understand, unlike most other licenses: keep the license and copyright notices. Code you add can be licensed as you wish.
