XPATH Expression fails in JQuery

I ran into a problem while trying to parse an XML string returned from an Ajax Call. The structure of the XML is as follows: USER_LOGIN /core.authenticate.do SYSTEM_DEFINED USER_LOGIN USER_PROVIDED USER_PROVIDED USER_PROVIDED However, I need the value for the tag for the useCaseId USER_LOGIN. A typical XPATH expression for this should like this: /endPointDefs/endPointDef[useCaseId='USER_LOGIN']/endPointUrl I stored the response from the ajax call in a javascript variable as follows: var endPointDefs=null; This variable is populated from an Ajax Call as follows: $.ajax( { type:"POST", url: " /data/EndPointDefs.xml", dataType:"XML", success:function(data){ //alert("End Points Loaded: " + data); endPointDefs=data; }, error: function() { alert('an error occurred! which trying to fetch the end point definitions'); } } ); I tried to execute the XPATH query using JQuery as follows: $("endPointDefs/endPointDef[useCaseId='USER_LOGIN']/endPointUrl",endPointDefs).each(function(){ $('#txtUseCase').val('USER_LOGIN'); $('#txtEntryPointURL').val($(this).text()); }) This is a modified version of what was show here: http://www.compoc.com/tuts/ Though, an alternative approach would be to iterate over all the endPointDef elements and inspect the value of the useCaseId and if it matches my string [USER_LOGIN], then, set the text in the text box. But, a more elegant approach would be to use an XPATH expression indicated above, which would give me the desired results in one shot. I tried many combinations and nothing seems to work. Does JQuery support this kind of XPath queries? If so, can somebody please tell me where am I going wrong?
