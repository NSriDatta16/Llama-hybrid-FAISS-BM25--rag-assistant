Your model must be rewritten as an estimating equation of the form $Y=X\theta+\epsilon$ where $y_1,y_2,y_3$ are just the same observed variable at different groups (or clusters) That implies: $y_i = \theta_1D1_i + \theta2 D2_i + \theta_3 D3_i + \epsilon_i$ Where $Dk_i$ is a dummy variable that =1 if the i-th observation corresponds to the $k-th$ group. So $\theta_1=\beta_1+\beta_2$ $\theta_2=2\beta_1$ $\theta_3=\beta_1-\beta_2$. But estimating the previous equations would yield 3 $\theta$ parameters from which only 2 $\beta$ exist so the system is overidentified. It would more reasonable to write $\theta_3$ as: $\theta_3 = \theta_2-\theta_1$ thus the estimating equation becomes: $y_i = \theta_1(D1_i-D3_i) + \theta2 (D2_i+D3_i) + \epsilon_i\equiv \theta_1x_{1i}+ \theta_2x_{2i} + \epsilon_i$ which is an standard linear regession with 2 explnatory variables. Once the model is estimated ($\hat \theta$), the sum of squared residuals is $\sum_i\hat\epsilon_i^2 =\sum_i y_i^2-2 \sum_i y_i \hat y_i+ \sum \hat y_i^2$ The first term is obtained as $\sum (Y1_i + Y2_i +Y3_i)^2$. DEveloping the second term yields : $-2(\hat\theta_1\sum_i y_i x_{1i}+\hat \theta_2 \sum y_i x_{2i}) $ $\equiv -2(\hat \theta_1 (\sum_i Y1_i-\sum Y3_i)+\hat \theta_2(\sum Y2_i- \sum Y3_i))$ while the third is: $\hat\theta_1^2\sum_ix_{1i}^2 +\hat\theta_2^2\sum_ix_{2i}^2+2\hat\theta_1\hat\theta_2\sum_i{x_{1i}x_{2i}}$ where the sums are straigforward to calculate following the second term algebra. But What about $\hat \theta$ values ? It's easy. Lets consider the first group observations, the equation becomes, $y_i=Y1_i= \theta_1 + \epsilon_i$, the second: $Y2_i=\theta_2 +\epsilon_i$ and third: $Y3_i=y_i=\theta_2-\theta_1+\epsilon_i$ These 3 equations are mutually exclusive as they are based on different samples so estimating the first and second (by OLS, ML etc) implies that the estimated $\theta$ are just averages of the corresponding $Yk$: $\hat \theta_1 = \bar{Y1}$,and $\hat \theta_2=\bar{Y2}$ and therefore $\hat \theta_3=\bar Y2 -\bar{Y1}$
