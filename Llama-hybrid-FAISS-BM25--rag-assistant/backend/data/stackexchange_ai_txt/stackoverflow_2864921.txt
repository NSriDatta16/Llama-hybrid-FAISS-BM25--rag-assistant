Table fragmentation in SQL server

Anybody have an idea about Table fragmentation in SQL Server(not Index fragmentation). We have a table, this is the main table and its not storing any data permently, data come here and goes out continusly. There is no index on this because only insert and delete statements are running frequently. Recently we faced a huge delay for the response from this table. If we select anything it tooks more than 2 to 5 minuts to return result,even there is very few datas. At last we delete and recreate this table and now it's working very fine. Appreciate If any comments,how this is happining? Joseph
