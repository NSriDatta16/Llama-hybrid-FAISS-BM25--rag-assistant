reformat 'File' field in emacs buffer list?

Context: using the Buffer List in Emacs to see what I'm doing, choose a buffer to visit, etc. FYI, I use fairly deep (sub-)directory organization to organize my files. When I have lots of files open from the same subdirectory, the 'File' field mostly shows the part of the pathname that is the same for all files, i.e. the first 2-3 layers in my hierarchy of directories. So it gives me high-level info that's not very useful. The 'Buffer' field shows me the filename. That gives me low-level info that's too specific. Is there a way to reformat the 'File' field to show me the most useful part of the file's path, i.e. the last couple of sub-directories the file is contained in and the filename? Literally, maybe the last characters of the path, instead of the first ?
