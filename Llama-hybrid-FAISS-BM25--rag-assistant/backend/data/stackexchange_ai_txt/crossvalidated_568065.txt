With contrast coding, the intercept is the average of the group effects on the logit scale, not the average of the group probabilities. # Use `logit` and `inv_logit` for clarity logit [1] -1.472219 # Probability for the "average" group inv_logit(-1.472219) #> [1] 0.1866056 You mention that the sampling is balanced. This information is irrelevant for your question: the expected value of the intercept changes with the coding/parametrization but not with the sampling proportions. The number of participants in each group determines how efficiently we can estimate group parameters: fewer participants, larger standard errors.
