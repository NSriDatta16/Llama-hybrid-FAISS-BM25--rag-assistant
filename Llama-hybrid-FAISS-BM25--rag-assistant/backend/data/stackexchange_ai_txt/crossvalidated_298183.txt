You have mixed a couple of different topics and it is not clear what you mean by it not being theoretically possible to use AIC/AICc in your situation (it is not clear what exactly the issue is). So, let me try to split this up into the three main topics: Firstly, AIC, AICc and BIC are all unsuitable for comparing models that are run on different datasets (whether they have different sample sizes or not). They are only relative measures that can be compared on the exact same data. Secondly, missing data are not per-se a reason for why AIC, AICc or BIC could not be used. You already point out one of the approaches that would allow that on the very next paragraph (using some form of generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM)). And the approach of using multiple imputation in some form is typically equivalent (assuming the GLMM exactly matches the imputation model and enough imputations are done). For how to get AIC or similar measures after multiple imputation, you really just need to google something like +"Model selection" +"model averaging" +"after multiple imputation". Thirdly, regarding software implementation there are a lot of options for fitting GLMMs. Since you asked about R, the lme4 package would be an option and there are almost certainly other ones, while in SAS you could use PROC MIXED.
