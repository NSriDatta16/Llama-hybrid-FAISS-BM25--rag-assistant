Estimating the number of sources of population using sampling techniques

Background of the problem: There are about 500,000 uncatalogued specimen in a laboratory. These specimens are gathered from across the world. We want to answer two questions: How many different countries these 500,000 specimen come from? How many specimen come from each of the countries. The specimen are not stored in any specific order currently. There are qualified personnel who can determine the origin of the specimen but their time is limited. We are constrained by budget and in the process of working out how much time can spend sampling but I don't think we can collect information on more than 1000-2000 specimen. I need to come up with a sampling strategy answer the above questions with a reasonable level of accuracy. Any materials/guidance on the strategies and sampling estimators I can leverage would be quite helpful.
