I suppose I should probably give a full answer, so here it is. I don't use Lyx, I use vanilla LaTeX. I tried using Lyx, but it confused me, and I actually found plain latex to be much more understandable. For my money, the interface to Lyx was too much like a word processor and hid the code from me (although I didn't use it for that long, so there may be ways around it). I use Emacs with Emacs speaks statistics and Auctex for my sweave and latex files. This has the benefits of extremely good documentation, cross-platform support and syntax highlighting for both LaTeX and R within an Rnw file. As stated in my comment, it also makes it much easier to go from interactive analysis in the R buffer (an emacs term) to the Sweave file that I intend to use for my report/thesis/paper. I keep absolutely everything I've done in the Sweave file (as bitter experience tells me that the one thing you don't put in the file will be what you have a problem with). I normally have one folder per project/paper, and this folder contains all of the input data files, the sweave files and all the output graphics/data files. This folder tends to become quite crowded over time, so I normally create a subfolder for my final document and rerun the analysis from there. I put everything in the sweave file as stated above, to ensure that all the analysis can be rerun. I typically call rm(list=ls()) on my R buffer before regenerating a sweave file, just to be sure. Rda files are dangerous, as the objects within my not be fully reproducible. That being said, if you have a computation that takes a really long time, then after you're sure that it works, you could change the sweave chunk to eval=FALSE and then load that object from an Rda file. Thats a last resort though ( this advice shamelessly stolen from andrew gelman ). I try to keep the same strategy for all my analyses, but that may change if I start doing more Bayesian work (due to the large amounts of computation involved). The packages I use most for LaTeX is xtable, which suits my needs. I don't tend to use cacheSweave, as I have a morbid fear that I won't be able to replicate my analyses afterwards. Recommended links: Sweave manual Emacs for windows with ess and auctex TeX for the impatient To be honest, I found that the best way to learn LaTeX is to start hacking away at it. There are many Sweave templates floating around the net, get one and start coding. Googling of error messages will probably sort you out, unless you want to do fancy stuff. There's a guide to sweave from a psychologist also floating around which is also pretty useful. Finally, LaTeX in general works way, way better on either a Mac or Linux (Ubuntu is always nice), and Emacs is much easier to extend on Linux. If you do need to stay on Windows, install both R and LaTeX (Miktex is good, select the install packages on the fly option) into a location with no spaces in the path (for example, c:\bin rather than c:\Program Files). This will save you a lot of hassle in the long run (but really install linux, r is faster, latex works better and the command line tools are to die for).
