With lasso or ridge regression, you do not need to divide your data into 3 parts. Once you have determined how to best to split your data into two, you can use the training set with cross validation to determine the shrinkage parameter and fit the model using the same training data without introducing bias (see the lasso paper by Tibshirani on the Journal of Statistical Software, I believe). Consequently, your question should be how much data should be used to fit the model and how much to test. Since your sample size is small, I would recommend either a 70-30 or 80-20 split. There are really no rules about the split but I pay more attention to ensuring that I have enough data to estimate the parameters of my model more than I would care about having "sufficient" test data
