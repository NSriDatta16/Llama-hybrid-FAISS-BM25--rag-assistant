SVM: Would we care about the functional margin if maximizing only with geometric margin were convex?

I am reading Andrew Ng's SVM notes ( https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/cs229-notes3.pdf ) and am lacking the intuition for why we need the functional margin. As far as I understand we need it as the following optimization problem expressed only in terms of the geometric margin is not convex: $max_{\gamma, w, b} = \gamma$ such that $y_{i}(w^{T}x + b) \geq \gamma $ $i = 1 \ldots m$ and $\lvert \lvert w \rvert \rvert = 1$ The constraint $\lvert \lvert w \rvert \rvert = 1$ is not convex. Suppose for the sake of understanding the importance of the functional margin that $\lvert \lvert w \rvert \rvert = 1$ is convex and we can directly optimize this problem. Could we then entirely forget about the concept of the functional margin? In other words, do we only need the notion of a functional margin, as it allows us to rewrite the above equation as a convex optimization problem?
