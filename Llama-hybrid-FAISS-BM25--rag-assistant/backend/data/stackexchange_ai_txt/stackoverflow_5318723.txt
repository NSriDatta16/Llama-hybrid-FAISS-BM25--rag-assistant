How to create a custom C# exception?

I'm currently learning C#, but I am stuck on something and I can't find a solution for it. I am trying to create my own Exception class. The exception is called "InvalidNumberException", it checks if a number is equal to 5. I know it may seem kinda stupid, but I just need to get the idea about creating Custom Exceptions. So far I found on MSDN that for creating the Exception I need these four constructors: public class InvalidNumberException : System.Exception { public InvalidNumbertException() : base() { } public InvalidNumberException(string message) : base(message) { } public InvalidNumberException(string message, System.Exception inner) : base(message, inner) { } // A constructor is needed for serialization when an // exception propagates from a remoting server to the client. protected InvalidNumberException(System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info, System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext context) { } } but I don't know how to implement the method or constructor in this class that a number entered from the console is equal to 5, and if it is not, it throws an exception. I'll appreciate if someone helps me with this.
