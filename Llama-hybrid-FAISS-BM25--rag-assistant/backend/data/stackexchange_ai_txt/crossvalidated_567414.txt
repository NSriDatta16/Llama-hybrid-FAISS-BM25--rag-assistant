Weight's shape of Convolution Neural Network?

I've have read that cnn have neuron per pixel but also read that it is not true. so what is the actual answer? and what I know is cnn tries to adjust the weight matrix which is also a kernel matrix, i might have been wrong about this so don't judge me, then how can we have neuron per pixel? if we have neuron per pixel then we should weight matrix equal to pixel dimension??? Can anybody explain me inner working of cnn with dimension and shape with the help of tensor?
