First, I want to save you time and energy when specifying your equation. For example, inside of the glm() function, I strongly encourage you to use the data = ... argument. It will eliminate the redundancies in your code. See the example R code below: glm(formula = T1D2 ~ EDUCATION + SKILLS + ..., data = FOODLIT, family = "binomial") Note, specifying the data = ... argument obviates the requirement to explicitly reference your data frame each time you want to extract a column (variable). The $ is a basic extraction operator in R, and the data = ... argument pulls the desired columns you want without further effort on your part. Now for your concerns. I do not understand why my output is numbered for example: skills2, skills3 & skills4? R concatenates the level to the variable name to distinguish the categories. For instance, I assume there are four categories associated with the SKILLS variable. By using the factor() function to create an ordered factor , the variable now has four ordered levels (e.g., Levels: 1 2 3 4 ). R omits the first level, and calculates separate estimates for each category . The first level is the "baseline" (i.e., reference) category; it is absorbed into the overall intercept term. Put simply, each skill level is compared with the omitted level. That is the why . Furthermore, your levels are ordered (numbered) categories. To ease the readability of the output, try converting the variable to a named factor. See the example code below: FOODLIT $... SKILLS, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "...", "...")) The order of the labels should follow the numeric ordering. Thus, the label "Low" might correspond to 1, Medium might correspond to 2, so on and so forth. I just want to know if skills is significant or not, as for all the other variables. I observe more than one variable designation for "skill" in your specification (i.e., SKILLS and SKILLSB ). Each appears to have four levels. Since you specified these variables as factor variables, then each level (category) is a separate estimate in your output. Each category is compared with the omitted category. To demonstrate this explicitly, the discretized version of SKILLS is making the following comparisons: SKILLS2 versus SKILLS1 SKILLS3 versus SKILLS1 SKILLS4 versus SKILLS1 In sum, the numbers help disambiguate the different factor levels . I hope this clears things up!
