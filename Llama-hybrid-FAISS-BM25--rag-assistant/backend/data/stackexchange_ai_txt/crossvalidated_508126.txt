Weighting the averages of 11 groups with very different sample sizes

I've read through a lot of answers on here but not found the answer I'm looking for the following problem - I've got a dataset of product ratings - a rating out of 5. I've got this data for 11 different products, with the number of samples in each group as follows: Product 1 n = 437 Product 2 n = 261 Product 3 n = 28 Product 4 n = 29 Product 5 n = 37 Product 6 n = 25 Product 7 n = 165 Product 8 n = 105 Product 9 n = 31 Product 10 n = 31 Product 11 n = 34 I want to find the best product, but can't just get all the averages because the sample sizes are so different. What process is best applied here to weight the average scores based on sample size? I've had a look at ANOVA and run an analysis in Excel, but not sure if this is the right way to go or how to interpret the results. Cheers!
