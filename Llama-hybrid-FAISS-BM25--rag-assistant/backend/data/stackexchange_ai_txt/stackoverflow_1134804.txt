How to get extra error information from PHP's mail() failure?

When mail () fails, there not much info about what went wrong. I understand that the best course of action is to check your sendmail logs, or whatever mailer has PHP used. But from a programming and pragmatic , point of view: on a Linux hosted environment, what can a PHP program do to get as much extra info to properly log the failure, probable cause etc and produce an usable, actionable error?
