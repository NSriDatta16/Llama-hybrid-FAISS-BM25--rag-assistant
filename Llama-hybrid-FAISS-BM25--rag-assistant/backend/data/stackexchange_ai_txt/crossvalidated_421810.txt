Ratio of data matching / not matching target variable in training dataset in XGBoost

I have inherited an XGBoost model and training script. The current implementation uses a training data set of data split 50 / 50 between inputs matching the target variable, and data not matching the target variable. This doesn't mimic the actual data in our domain. which is much closer to 98 / 2 split. Feels incorrect to me, Should my training data set match real world data ?
