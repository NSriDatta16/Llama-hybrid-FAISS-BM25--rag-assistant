Since you're not specifying how records in the arena tables should join to records in the character tables, you're getting a cross join, which returns every combination of character records with arena records. When you say "I want to get them all," what exactly do you mean? Find a starting point for your query. For example: are you looking for all characters, organized by team, with their details and arena stats? Or, for each character, all the teams on which they participate? Defining the requirements a little more clearly will help us suggest solutions. :) Update: Actually, having read the query a little more closely, I believe I can infer what you're looking for: SELECT c.guid, c.name, c.gender, c.class, c.online, c.race, atm.guid atm.played_season, atm.played_week, atm.wons_season, atm.wons_week, atm.arenateamid, cas.personal_rating, cas.guid, cas.matchmaker_rating, at.arenateamid, at.captainguid FROM character_arena_stats cas, arena_team_member atm, characters c, arena_team at WHERE c.guid = cas.guid and c.guid = atm.guid and atm.arenateamid = at.arenateamid AND at.arenateamid = ".$entry." Note that the Arena Team and Character tables are now joined based on the team captain's GUID - this will avoid the cross join ("random rows") problem. Also, Arena Team Members is now joined to Arena Teams, and the filter parameter is only checked against the Teams table. Not sure this will give you precisely what you want without knowing more about your data and requirements - I believe what it will give you is a list of each team captain, their arena stats, along with their team and team members' stats. Hopefully this will move you forward. Good luck!
