The article pointed out by Tim covers most of it but I'd like to add that the title attribute on tags is important too (but don't abuse it!). To sum up: Name your files well. apple.jpg is better SEO wise than PIC2346.jpg . For spaces in filenames use a dash (-) and not an underscore (_). See Dashes vs. underscores for more info. Alyays fill up the alt attibute. Keep in mind that most screen readers for blind people will read this tag. Fill the title attribute when usefull. Use a short statement describing the image. Not a whole paragraph! The context of the image (what is the content around it) is very important too. If the image fits the surrounding contents it will give you more SEO "points".
