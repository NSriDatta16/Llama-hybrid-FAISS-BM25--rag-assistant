Adobe Acrobat intercepting every URL from call to BasicService.showDocument() in java

Our In-House Java application launches various http URLs at various times, including URLs to web-pages, MS Word documents, MS Excel documents, PDF files etc. On over 50+ machines the URL launching works fine and the correct application opens the given page/document correctly. However, on one pesky machine Adobe Acrobat is attempting to open every URL (regardless of whether the target is a pdf or not), and failing (even on pdf documents) with: There was an error opening this document. The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. The code to launch the URLs is: URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com"); BasicService bs = (BasicService)ServiceManager.lookup("javax.jnlp.BasicService"); boolean worked = bs.showDocument(url); The worked variable is true after the call. Other points that may be helpful: The application runs within Java Web-Start. An applet running on the same machine is able to open URLs correctly using AppletContext.showDocument() Entering a URL into the Windows "Run..." dialog launches the URL correctly. We've reinstalled both the JRE and Adobe Acrobat. Thanks in advance for any advice/help you can offer. Update: The following debug code produces the following output: String[] services = ServiceManager.getServiceNames(); if(services!=null) { for(int i=0;i com.sun.jnlp.BasicServiceImpl@bbb8b5 bs.getCodeBase():http://xxx.xxxxxx.com:8080/ bs.isOffline():false bs.isWebBrowserSupported():true bs.showDocument:true
