I can think of a few: Development should not occur on a production server. Development and testing of programs should always occur on a development server. The development products are then deployed to the production server. Developing on a production server runs the risk of crashing the production server. Only production software should be installed on a production server Development software contains components that complicate the operating environment of a production server. There can be DLL versioning issues, for example. In general, the production server should only contain the software it needs to do its job. Having development (or other) tools on a production server encourages uses that the production server is not purposed for. Maybe you are considering installing VS 2008 for convenience. It is nice to have the tools at your fingertips. But how easy is it now to cut corners, and fix something on your server on the fly without following your software development process?
