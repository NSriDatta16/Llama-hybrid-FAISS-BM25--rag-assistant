I wonder, if this is possible ... How do you want to rate whether a behavior is normal for an application? Do you plan a "learning phase" where everything a certain app does, is recorded (if that's possible without root access in the first place!) and then saved as the "profile" of "normal behavior" of that app? Say you record whatever behavior an application has, e.g. a tool to organize icons on the homescreen. Now say this application also offers the function to call one of your favorite contacts directly, it will need the permission to access your contacts and to make phonecalls. If this feature is hardly used, you would probably not record it during your "learning" period of this app and rate the app as malicious once it tries to make a phone call. And what if an app shows malicious behavior during the "learning phase" where you can't detect it because you haven't determined the "normal behavior" yet? Sounds like the "normal behavior" has to be saved somewhere to rate an app before you install it and it starts acting weird or performs unwanted actions. But then again: what is anwanted for one user may be perfectly normal for another one ... I'm interested in whatever fancy solutions people come up with, but I guess this will be a hard one ...
