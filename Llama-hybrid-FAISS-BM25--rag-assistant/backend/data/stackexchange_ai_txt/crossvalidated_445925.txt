Is it okay that the direction of the fixed effects is opposite to the intercept in my model? Yes. The interpretation of the intercept is that it is the log-odds of the event ( DV = 1 ) for the those in the none group (so, being negative, it is a protective effect), while the estimates for the other 2 groups are the log-odds of the event in each of those groups compared to the none group (so being positive, they are risk factors). So the log-odds for the event for those in the weak group are 4.2876 higher than in the none group, and the log-odds for the the event for those in the strong group are 6.1598 higher than for those in the none group. Most importantly, is the odds ratio I've calculated usable? i.e. can my IV function as a proper predictor? Yes, but note that the fixed effects are conditional on the random effects. This means in your case, the log odds - or odds ratios if you exponentiate them - are for the same subject and the same item, rather than being averaged across all subjects and items. If you want the averaged estimates then you could get those using the GLMMAdaptive package Or have I missed or done something wrong? Without more information about your study design it is difficult to say, but if you are worried about the results note that by default, glmer uses the Laplace approximation which means only 1 point per axis for evaluating the adaptive Gauss-Hermite approximation to the log-likelihood, and this can produce biased results with a binary outcome. Try setting nAGQ = 2 or higher. You could also try using the mixed_model function in the GLMMAdaptive package which is specifically written for adaptive quadrature in generalized linear mixed models.
