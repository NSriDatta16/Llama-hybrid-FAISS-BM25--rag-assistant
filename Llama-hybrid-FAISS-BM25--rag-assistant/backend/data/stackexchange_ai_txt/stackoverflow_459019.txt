In Bash, printf is provided by the shell (see the bash(1) manpage , search for "printf"), so you don't even have the (minimal) overhead of fork() and exec() to execute a separate command -- unless you run it from within backticks. Bash's built-in printf lets you assign the output to a given variable with the -v argument; your script fragment could be rewritten as: for ((i=23; i I'm not sure I'd consider that more readable than the original. The most resource-intensive part of your script fragment is calling your other shell script; I wouldn't worry about the overhead of calling printf unless further evidence indicates otherwise. edited to add the difference between backticks and direct execution
