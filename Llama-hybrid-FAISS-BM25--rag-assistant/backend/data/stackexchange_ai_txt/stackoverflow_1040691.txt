Access the project file structure within the Visual Studio Properties property grid?

I'm making a Component that will be used in a VS drag and drop designer. One of the properties on this component needs to be the pack URI of a file within the project. I'd like to make things a little easy and, from within the property editor the PropertyGrid uses for my type's property, examine the solution, construct the Uris and present them to the user for choosing. Is this possible? And, if so, can I get some pointers and where-to-starters on how to go about this?
