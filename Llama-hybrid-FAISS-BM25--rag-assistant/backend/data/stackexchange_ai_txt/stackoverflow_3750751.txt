You can use a BindingSource object. Just drag-n-drop it into your form and point your ListBox.DataSource property to this BindingSource object. Then go to the BindingSource's properties and define Sort as you need. Then in code you can set myBindingSource.DataSource = myCollection and voila, your listbox is populated and sorted. Easy.
