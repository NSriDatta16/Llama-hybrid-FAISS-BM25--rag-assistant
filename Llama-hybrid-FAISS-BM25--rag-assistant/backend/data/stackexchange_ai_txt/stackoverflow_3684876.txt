Magento export script using up all memory -- memory leak?

I have a script that processes Magento's product catalog and exports it. Unfortunately it is killed halfway because it ends up using too much memory. I am afraid I have incurred in the problem with the php garbage collector not being able to free circular references, hence causing a memory leak. I've tried the fix suggested at http://ringsdorff.net/2009/07/23/guest-post-fix-for-memory-leaks-in-magento/ but unfortunately this breaks the script (no data is exported at all). Does anybody know if there are any other fixes for this problem? Thank you!
