First off: are "actions" always the same? If not, try to put them into relation to your error. This could be done via counting (like your first approach). However, you should try to check if it matters which action followed on which one. E.g., "A1->A2->ERR": maybe errors occur more often if a certain chain of actions followed up on each other. Furthermore: use timestamps: how much time in average lays between errors, how does that relate to the number of performed actions? What is a "Maintenance"? Is it always the same error? It is hard to give you proper advise as your problem seems to be very generic..
