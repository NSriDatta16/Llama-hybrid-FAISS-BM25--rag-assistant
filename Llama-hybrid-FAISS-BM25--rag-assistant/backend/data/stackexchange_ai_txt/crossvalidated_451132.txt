How to determine if correlated errors are a result of using an incorrect functional form?

Assume you have identified that the errors of a regression model are correlated. How should you determine if this is a sign of using incorrect an functional form? That is, a situation that should be addressed by changing the primary functional model, for example using a quadratic function. Alternatively, how would you determine if you needed to utilize Newey-West standard errors, or adapt a univariate time series model (AR, MA etc.) instead? Can a set of general rules (no matter how rough and loose they be) be outlined for such cases?
