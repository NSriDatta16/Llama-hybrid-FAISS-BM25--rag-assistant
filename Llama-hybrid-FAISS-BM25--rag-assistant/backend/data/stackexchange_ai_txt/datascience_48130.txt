Multi-class classification as a hypothesis testing problem

I'm diving into the logistic distribution and its applications in classification problem (see my old question for more details about my idea). As discussed in my old post, logistic regression, in fact, can be seen as a hypothesis testing problem. My question is that: is there any hypothesis-testing-based classifier for multi-class classification problems ?
