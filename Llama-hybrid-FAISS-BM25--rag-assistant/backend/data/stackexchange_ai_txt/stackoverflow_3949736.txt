If your static media is derived from your development process, then Fabric is the way to go. It can automate the deployment and replication of anything-- data, application files, even static database dumps-- from anywhere to anywhere. If your static media is derived from your application server's operation-- generated PDFs and images, uploads from your users, compiled binaries (I had a customer who wanted that, a Django app that would take in raw x86 assembly and return a compiled and linked binary)-- then you want to use Django Storages , an app that abstracts the actual storage of content for any ImageField or FileField (or anything with a Python File-like interface). It has support for storing them in databases, to Amazon S3, via FTP, and a few others.
