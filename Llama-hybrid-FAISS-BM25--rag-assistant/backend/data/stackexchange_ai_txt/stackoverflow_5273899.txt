for people like kamal this may be usefull : The little demo works now: - I did all as root with no build accounts. - easy_install buildbot - buildbot create-master /tmp/experimental_buildmaster most important is here cp /tmp/experimental_buildmaster/master.cfg.example xperimental_buildmaster/master.cfg edit it and pay attention to : slavePortnum default is :9989 and git confs : buildmaster will give errors with bad params then buildbot start /tmp/experimental_buildmaster wait for the "started sucessfully" easy_install buildbot-slave buildslave create-slave /tmp/experimental_buildslave localhost:9989 example-slave Password I strongly disagree with the proposed ".. .. .." buildslave start /tmp/experimental_buildslave and now for something completely different : open browser to localhost:8010 the welcome page is here, click buildslave to see your slave: rock'n roll !
