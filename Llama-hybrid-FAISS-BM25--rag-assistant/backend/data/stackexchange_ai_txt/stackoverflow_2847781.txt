What if Web page's background matters

I have a complex background image and images, that should be on exact positions of the background image. How can I organize web page? I can't use absolute positions, because I need to organize background to view it nice on any monitor, any resolution and any browser. It can be aligned to center or smth else. Web page can be written just with Javascript or with a library like JQuery . Here's an example of what kind of web page according to background image and images organization on it I'd like to have. http://desandro.com/portfolio/ (background picture and points on it) Thanks in advance. EDIT I'll add my answer in comments to the question. Background will be a set of circles as matrix (m*n), taking an image(one circle) and repeating it on the page or it would be one background image with all this circles on it. But some of this circles should be separate img, not in the background part, so user could click on them, but he should not fill any difference, as if all circles are of the same type, just some of them click-able. If I could arrange it, so buttons could randomly change, it would be great. Hope, I explained all clearly.
