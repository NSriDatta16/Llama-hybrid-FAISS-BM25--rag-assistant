Framework helpers, what are they for?

I began looking at some frameworks. Particularly Code Igniter fascinated me. But searching trough the folders I found out system/helpers that contains 21 PHP files. Inside these files we find thousands of functions related to html, xml, strings, arrays, numbers, forms... etc. This should be simple, but I really don't understand the meaning of these helper files. I mean: What is generally considered an helper? Are they required? Could I delete them without risks?
