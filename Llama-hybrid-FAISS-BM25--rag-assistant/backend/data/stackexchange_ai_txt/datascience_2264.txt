Perceptrons, strictly speaking, are binary classifiers. To make a multi-class classifier, you should switch to a standard feed-forward neural net with a softmax output layer. Without any hidden layers this is equivalent to multinomial logistic regression. You can also do the one-vs-all trick as @seanv507 suggests. This often works well in practice but there's no strong basis for it in theory, and the true multi-class version is easier conceptually and practically in this case.
