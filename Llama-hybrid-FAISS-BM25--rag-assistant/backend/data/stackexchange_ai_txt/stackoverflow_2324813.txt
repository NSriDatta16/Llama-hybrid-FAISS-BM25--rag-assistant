It's possible that the service only responds to requests coming from a browser; I'd find that a little strange, but not unheard of. However, if that is the case you can emulate a browser request: HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(yourUri); // Pretend to be IE6! request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; windows NT 5.1)"; request.Method = "GET"; request.AllowAutoRedirect = true; request.KeepAlive = true;
