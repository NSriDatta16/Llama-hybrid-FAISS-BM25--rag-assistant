Getting 'shmemBase_attach failed: The system cannot find the file specified' when trying to attach to applet to debug

I'm using netbeans 6.1. I've got the following in my java run time settings: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,address=jdbconn,server=y,suspend=n and the following in the attach dialog in netbeans: Debugger: JPDA Debugger Connector: Shared Memory Attach (Attaches by shared memory to other VMs) Transport: dt_shmem Name: jdbconn I got the above settings from the FaqDebuggingAppletRemotely page on the netbeans Wiki. The applet is in an aspx page (the applet, whcih is signed, is a method of communicating via the client browser to a legacy platform, I'm a C# developer really). I've managed to get the security warning to display which gives me a chance to attach to the applet but whenever I try to attach I see: Attaching to jdbconn shmemBase_attach failed: The system cannot find the file specified in the output window in netbeans. Any help gratefully received!
