Your model seems to have perfect separation . Notice the large standard errors of the coefficient estimates, and the tell-tale warning messages: Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred Your model never actually got fit by the software! As you provided a fixed cutoff of AHI > 5 for defining OSA_status , without any probabilistic element, this isn't very surprising. A logistic regression will have trouble with fitting when there actually is a cutoff that exactly distinguishes 2 groups. For ways to deal with perfect separation, see for example this page and this page . For the dangers of breaking a continuous predictor into discrete categories, see this page .
