A straight forward and standard way to do something like this would be to: Create three new variables. Call them half , times60by365 and sum . Go to their properties and define the Variable Class to be java.lang.Integer or Double , which will allow you to use them for arithmetic operations. Change their Variable Expression properties to $F{amount}/2 for half , $F{amount}*60/365 for times60by365 and $V{half} + $V{times60by365} for sum Drag them to the detail line PS: iReport release: 4.0.1 is available since yesterday!
