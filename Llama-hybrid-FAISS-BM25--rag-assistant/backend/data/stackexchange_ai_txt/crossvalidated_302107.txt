HMM for multichannel - multivariate data

I have a dataset which contains multiple time series of multivariate data both continuous and categorical I would like to use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to find the number of hidden states for all of my data. So I want to use all the time series that I have in order to build my HMM. I have seen libraries in r like seqHMM that can handle multiple time series but not for heterogenous data (i.e. multivariate data that contains continuous and categorical data). On the other hand libraries like depmixS4 can handle heterogenous multivariate data but for only one time series a time. So since I cannot find a library that covers all my conditions I am wondering what procedure should I follow in order to build an HMM using my data. For example can I do some preprocessing in my data and then use one of those libraries. Is there some technique/library I could use? Thanks a lot for your time
