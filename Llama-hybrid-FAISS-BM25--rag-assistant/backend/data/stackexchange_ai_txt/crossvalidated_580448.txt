confusion about logistic regression and its weights

I have studied Logistic regression and I am still confused about certain things: does logistic regression use linear regression to predict a continuous output, but since linear regression can output values above 1 or below 0 (here we are dealing with binary classification so the output must be between 0 and 1) so to squeeze the output we use the sigmoid function. the output of the sigmoid is the probability of it belonging to class 1. to set a threshold for the output of the sigmoid (for example if the value above 0.5 it belongs to class 1 and vice versa, that is where the logistic regression uses decision boundary to separate the data. did I understand it correctly so far? this next question is the main part I am confused about: so when we say z = wx + b, is this the formula for linear regression or is it just weights for the logistic regression or is it the formula for the decision boundary line ?
