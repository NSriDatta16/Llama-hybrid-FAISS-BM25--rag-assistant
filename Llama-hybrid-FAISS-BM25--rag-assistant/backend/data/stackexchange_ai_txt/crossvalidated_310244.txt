The functional relationship between Amplification and Voltage is very strong and perfectly monotonically increasing. Check the following grouped scatterplots made by library(ggplot2) ggplot(APD, aes(x=Voltage, y=log(log(Amplification)))) + geom_point(size=2, shape=23) + facet_wrap(~Serial_number) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~poly(x, degree)) The blue lines are the result of fitting an individual polynomial curve of degree 3 to each plot. Overall, they fit quite well. But e.g. at the right tails, some of the curves would extrapolate in the completely wrong direction. This is a general problem when fitting polynomials. The mixed effects model that you have specified will provide very similar results than above individual curves. There, basically an "average" polynomial is estimated from all serial numbers and then, the per serial number deviations from this average are represented by random effects. So let's replace the blue curves by the predictions of your model: fit Non-convergence warning is worrysome... The overall impression is: The fit is not bad except at the boundaries. There, the curvature is sometimes quite wrong. How does this fit to your residual plot, which looks quite catastrophic? Check the scale of the vertical axis: Actually, the residuals are very close to 0. The "ugliness" thus comes from the fact that the functional relationships are so very strong. The chosen degree 3 polynomial is not flexible enough to capture it in a perfect way. Now you basically have two action plans: Accept the compromise between choosing a simple model and not having a perfect fit. Try different models. E.g. using just one instead of two logs. Or fitting a random shift natural cubic spline.
