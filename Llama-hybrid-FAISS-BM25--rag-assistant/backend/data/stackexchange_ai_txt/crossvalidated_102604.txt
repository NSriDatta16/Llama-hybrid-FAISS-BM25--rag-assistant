How to know one system is significantly better than another one?

I am studying lexical semantics. I have 65 pairs of synonyms with their sense relatedness. The dataset is derived from the paper: Rubenstein, Herbert, and John B. Goodenough. "Contextual correlates of synonymy." Communications of the ACM 8.10 (1965): 627-633. I extract sentences containing those synonyms, transfer the neighbouring words appearing in those sentences to vectors, calculate the cosine distance between different vectors, and finally get the Pearson correlation between the sense relatedness given by Rubenstein and Goodenough and our distances. I get the Pearson correlation for Method 1 is 0.79, and for Method 2 is 0.78, for example. How do I measure if Method 1 is significantly better than Method 2 or not?
