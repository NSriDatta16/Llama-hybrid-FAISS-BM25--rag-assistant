My big hangup is MATLAB's syntax. I use it, and there are things I like about it, but it has so many annoying quirks. Let's see. Matrices are indexed with parentheses. So if you see something like Image(350,260), you have no clue from that whether we're getting an element from the Image matrix, or if we're calling some function called Image and passing arguments to it. Scope is insane. I seem to recall that for loop index variables stay in scope after the loop ends. If you forget to stick a semicolon after an assignment, the value will be dumped to standard output. You may have one function per file. This proves to be very annoying for organizing one's work. I'm sure I could come up with more if I thought about it.
