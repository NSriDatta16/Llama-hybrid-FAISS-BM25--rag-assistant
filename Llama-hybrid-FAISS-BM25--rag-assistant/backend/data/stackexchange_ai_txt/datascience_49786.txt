Does PCA decrease the feature on my Data set or just decrease the dimension?

I'm new in AI and sorry if my question is simple. I have a data set and want to use PCA to decrease the feature but after some research on the internet I'm confused about decreasing dimensions and features. As an example I have a data set with 50 rows and 10 columns, if I use PCA it will reduce a data set with 50x5 (as an example) or 50x10 and just removed some dimensions? I want to do it in MATLAB and want to use PCA function and don't want to write PCA function by myself. What is the PCA parameters in MATLAB to decrease the feature? It's a lot of parameters and confused me.
