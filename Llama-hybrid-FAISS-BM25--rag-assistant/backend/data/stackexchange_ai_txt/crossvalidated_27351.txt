Compare Models. LOCCV implementation in R

I want to compare three models, one linear-regression-model, one regression-tree-model (from rpart ) and one MARS-model (from mda package). I want to compare the models using a leave one out cross validation using the mean square error and MAPE. I have the following implementation in R: library(data.table) library(rpart) library(mda) #Load Sample-Data data(trees) #The following models should be compared: # lm(Volume~Girth+Height, data=trees) # rpart(Volume~Girth+Height, data=trees) # mars(trees[,-3], trees[3]) LOOCV Outputs: Cross-Validation Metrics: ------------------------- LOOCV MSE for LM: 18.15783 LOOCV MSE for CART: 69.83769 LOOCV MSE for MARS: 13.72282 LOOCV RMSE for LM: 4.2612 LOOCV RMSE for CART: 8.356895 LOOCV RMSE for MARS: 3.704432 LOOCV MAPE for LM: 14.6114 LOOCV MAPE for CART: 23.51401 LOOCV MAPE for MARS: 10.00316 Does this implementation make sense? When whould using MSE on the errors make sense? When would I use MAPE/SMAPE instead? I already read " Metric to compare models? " and the conclusion there was it depends , can someone explain this further. On what does it depend? My data is not a time series, it is more like the tree example data.
