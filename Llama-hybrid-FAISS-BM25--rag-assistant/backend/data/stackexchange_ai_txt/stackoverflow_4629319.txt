How to get wanted nodes from Stanford Parser NLP?

My main problem is that I don't know how to extract nodes from GrammaticalStructure. I am using englishPCFG.ser in java netbeans. My target is to know the quality of the screen like: The screen of iphone 4 is great. I want to extract screen and great. How can I extract the NN (screen) and VP (great) ? the code that I wrote is: LexicalizedParser lp = new LexicalizedParser("C:\\englishPCFG.ser"); lp.setOptionFlags(new String[]{"-maxLength", "80", "-retainTmpSubcategories"}); String sent ="the screen is very good."; Tree parse = (Tree) lp.apply(Arrays.asList(sent)); parse.pennPrint(); System.out.println(); TreebankLanguagePack tlp = new PennTreebankLanguagePack(); GrammaticalStructureFactory gsf = tlp.grammaticalStructureFactory(); GrammaticalStructure gs = gsf.newGrammaticalStructure(parse); Collection tdl = gs.typedDependenciesCollapsed();
