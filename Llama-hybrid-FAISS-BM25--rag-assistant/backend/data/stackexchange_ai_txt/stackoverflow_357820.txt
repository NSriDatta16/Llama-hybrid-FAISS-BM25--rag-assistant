The way I do it is with a WSF script (I use JavaScript but you could use VBScript or even an SH script using Cygwin) that creates a header file containing definitions for the version numbers. You can use the Wix statement to drag the version number in. For Inno Setup I create a .iss file that contains the version number, which is #included into the main iss script. I am at home but can post some sample code tomorrow if you like. EDIT: I forgot to mention that I run the script that generates the files containing the build number during the pre-build stage of my various VS projects.
