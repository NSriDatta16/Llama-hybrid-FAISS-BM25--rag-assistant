Best Way to Aggregate further and Analyze a Data Point that is Already an Average

I want to understand how much time (on average) each Customer Service Agent (CSA) is taking to reply to messages that are sent by a Customer on a single chat. E.g., "Charles took on average, 22s to reply to Customer messages during chat id: 1224323." Now, there's a catch - my database only contains the following stats: Communication ID: unique identifier of a chat contact. Creation Date: date when the chat was received (UTC). Average Message Response time of Agent in seconds: I.e., Average time the CSA took to reply to the messages sent by the customer on that chat contact. Average Message Response time of Customer in seconds: I.e., Average time the Customer took to reply to the messages sent by the CSA on that chat contact. Number of messages sent by the CSA: Count of messages sent by CSA during that chat contact. Number of messages sent by the Customer: Count of messages sent by Customer during that chat contact. Total Handle Time: The total time in seconds that the chat contact lasted. It looks just like this: Now, it would in my interest to compute the Average Response Time of all the chats handled by a CSA in an specific time interval. Instead of having the Average Message Response Time for a single contact, I'd like to somehow aggregate the Average Response Time to the agent level. I can't do AVG(Average Message Response time of Customer) because that would be extremely inaccurate (wouldn't it?). With the information that I have available: What would be an accurate approximation to quantify the Average Time a CSA is taking to Reply to a Customer? How can I rank Agents to find out, the Agents that are in the Bottom 20%. What useful calculations can I perform to understand how each agent compares against the others? I appreciate your input, if something is unclear or I missed something important, please point it out.
