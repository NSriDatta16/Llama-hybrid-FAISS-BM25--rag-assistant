"All models are wrong, some are useful" - George Box CART based trees are greedy. They may miss the best split. CART based trees do not look ahead or backfit. The hope is that after many splits, many trees, the final answer will be close enough to optimal. There is no guarantee with any algorithm though, i.e. the no free lunch theorem . There are other types of trees besides CART. Bayesian trees, optimal trees, model based trees, and more, that may not be as greedy and MAY or MAY NOT make a "better" model for your use case. You can always try different algorithms.
