First, I tried a common bayesian rule, which gives me the probability over each sample (starting from a 50/50 prior), like, sample 1 (0.13 high, 0.87 low), sample 2 (0.85 high, 0.15 low). But that doesn't give me a probability over the buckets It gives you a probability over the distributions high and low. Bucket 1 has 13% probability to be from distribution high and 87% to be from distribution low. Bucket 2 has 85% probability to be from distribution high and 15% to be from distribution low. Or possibly you want to compare the two following models: model 1: bucket one is from distribution one and bucket two is from distribution two versus model 2: bucket one is from distribution two and bucket two is from distribution one You can model this in a similar fashion by computing the likelihood ratio for both models.
