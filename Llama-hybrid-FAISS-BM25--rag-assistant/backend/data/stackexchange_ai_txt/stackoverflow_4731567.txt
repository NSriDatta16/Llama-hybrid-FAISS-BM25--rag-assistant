Drag and Drop Inventory for Game in Jquery

I'm creating a game inventory for a browser based game in Ruby Rails. Now, i was trying to find some good resources on the topic but i'm unable to locate some good examples. I would like to find something about drag, drop, lock and stuff like ajax refreshing when i drag an element out of the inventory. Do you happen to know of any good resources, or even a ready made plugin for that ?
