There can be some confusion of terms here depending on whether the adjective seond-order is considered to be modifying stationary or random process (or both!). To some people, A second-order random process $\{X_t \colon t \in \mathbb T\}$ is one for which $E[X_t^2]$ is finite (indeed bounded) for all $t \in \mathbb T$. For us electrical engineers who apply (or mis-apply!) random process models in studying electrical signals, $E[X_t^2]$ is a measure of the average power delivered at time $t$ by a stochastic signal, and so all physically observable signals are modeled as second-order processes. Note that stationarity has not been mentioned at all and these second-order processes might or might not be stationary. A random process that is stationary to order $2$, which we can (but perhaps should not) call a second-order stationary random process provided we agree that second-order modifies stationary and not random process , is one for which $\mathbb T$ is a set of real numbers that is closed under addition, and the joint distribution of the random variables $X_t$ and $X_{t+\tau}$ (where $t, \tau \in \mathbb T)$ depends on $\tau$ but not on $t$. As the link provided by AO shows, a random process stationary to order $2$ need not be strictly stationary. Nor is such a process necessarily wide-sense-stationary because there is no guarantee that $E[X_t^2]$ is finite: consider for example a strictly stationary process in which the the $X_t$'s are independent Cauchy random variables. A second-order random process (meaning finite power as in the first item above) that is stationary to at least order $2$ is wide-sense-stationary. OK, so that is the perspective from a different set of users of random process theory. For more details, see, for example, this answer of mine on dsp.SE.
