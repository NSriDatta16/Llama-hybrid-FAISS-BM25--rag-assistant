Can you replace the global one-dimensional ubyte array with an object with overloaded operator[]? Using the absolute value of the int input might solve some of your issues. Edit: Depending on the usage pattern of your array (no pointer shenanigans), using an object with overloaded operator[] could actually be entirely transparent to the users of the array, hence my suggestion.
