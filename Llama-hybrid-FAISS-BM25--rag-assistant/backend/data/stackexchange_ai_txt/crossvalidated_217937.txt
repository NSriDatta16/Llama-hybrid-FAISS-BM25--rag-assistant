The term you're looking for is "trend and seasonality decomposition of time series". Google this. There are many approaches. If you really have only 100 points then Fourier will not work very well. Yule-Walker based approaches may work better. There are also filter based approaches. For instance, Google band pass filters such as bpassm from Atlanta Fed. The idea's that you filter out different frequency components from the series, so that low frequency would be trend, medium frequency the signal, and the high frequency - seasonality etc. There's a full set of code in this matlab example . It takes you step by step through the process of deseasoning, it works quite well for economic data in my experience
