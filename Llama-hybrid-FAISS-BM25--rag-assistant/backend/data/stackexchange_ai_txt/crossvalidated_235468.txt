Confidence interval for the increase in P(Y=1) from moving between 2 levels of a factor in logistic regression

I have a logistic regression model fit with one categorical variable $x$ that takes value in $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. In R I have obtained the estimate and standard error for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. The question is if it's possible to get a 95% confidence interval on the increase in estimated probability, when $x$ rises from $2$ to $4$. In other words, I want to get CI on $[P(y=1|x=4)-P(y=1|x=2)]$. I know how to construct the CI for estimate when $x$ is at $2$ OR $4$, but don't know how to get the CI when $x$ changes from $2$ to $4$.
