Query Notifications . This is the SQL Server feature that allows an application to subscribe to notifications pushed from the server when data is changed. It is usually leveraged through the SqlDependency class. I have recently posted the LinqToCache project that allows you to add SqlDependency based notifications and cache invalidation to LINQ queries: var query = (from r in ctx.table select r).AsCached( "table", new CachedQueryOptions() { OnInvalidated = (sender, args) { // the query was invalidated, data has changed // refresh display or notify user } });
