Suppose you measure the length of people's left leg and of their right leg. Then you construct a logistic regression predicting the probability that they have bumped their head on an overhead beam in an old house in the last year. You might get a significant overall result because tall people are more likely to bump their head but in the regression neither leg will appear significant by itself as it does not add anything to the model over and above the other one since the length of the two legs are highly correlated.
