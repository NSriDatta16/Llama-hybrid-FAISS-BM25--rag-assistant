It's interesting you note that EM performs nicely from a visual standpoint, because PCA is assuming a linear generative model, whereas clustering can accommodate non-linear. PCA has a probabilistic interpretation: The hidden component (the principal components) distribution, conditioned on the observed variables, is multivariate normal: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/67218/bishop-ppca-jrss.pdf . Clustering with GMM's probabilistic interpretation: The hidden components are a mixture distribution, sum of several multivariate normal: https://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/publications/publication-files/full_papers/0802_Reynolds_Biometrics-GMM.pdf . Why not apply clustering to the original dataset?
