Fit a polynomial model column of time series data

I'm asked to fit a polynomial model on the FTSE column from the EuStockMarkets dataset available in R. How is it possible to fit on just one column in this case? Is there another column of sorts in time series data that I can manipulate like time? i.e. Would time be a feature in predicting FTSE?
