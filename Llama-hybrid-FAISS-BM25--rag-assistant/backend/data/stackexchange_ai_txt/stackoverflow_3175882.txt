Your first step will definitely be taking a Fourier Transform (FT) of the sound waves. If you perform an FT on the data with respect to Frequency over Time 1 , you'll be able to compare how often certain key frequencies are hit over the course of the noise. Perhaps you could also subtract one wave from the other, to get a sort of stepwise difference function. Assuming the mock-noise follows the same frequency and pitch trends 2 as the original noise, you could calculate the line of best fit to the points of the difference function. Comparing the best fit line against a line of best fit taken of the original sound wave, you could average out a trend line to use as the basis of comparison. Granted, this would be a very loose comparison method. - 1. hz/ms, perhaps? I'm not familiar with the unit magnitude being worked with here, I generally work in the femto- to nano- range. - 2. So long as ∀ΔT, Δ Pitch /ΔT & Δ Frequency /ΔT are within some tolerance x . - Edited for formatting, and because I actually forgot to finish writing the full answer.
