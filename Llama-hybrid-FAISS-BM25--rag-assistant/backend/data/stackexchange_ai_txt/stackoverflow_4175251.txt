This is tricky and maybe impossible, depending on precisely what you want - feel free to view this as a list of warnings or starting points, depending on how brave you feel :) to obtain MAC addresses you need to capture raw packets, which isn't possible using pure Java; you'll need to use something like jNetPcap which wraps the (native) libpcap packet sniffing library to determine whether a MAC address is likely to belong to a mobile phone, you'll need the list of Organizationally Unique Identifiers which links the first three bytes of a MAC address with the device manufacturer; mind that the OUI list might not be sufficient, since Apple (for instance) makes phones and other devices to see all wireless traffic you'll need a driver that supports putting the wifi interface into monitor mode - these don't exist for all platforms/devices the devices may not be sending any data...
