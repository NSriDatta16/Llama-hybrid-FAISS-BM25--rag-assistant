The implementation of variable-to-factor and factor-to-variable messages?

I read this tutorial on the implementation of CRF and got to know that the normalization is the sum-product message passing. And I also know that there are two types of messages on factor graph: Variable-to-factor messages(left) and factor-to-variable messages(right): But it seems difficult for me to relate the message passing to the implementation of the CRF. Since logistic can be seen as a simplified CRF could anyone please help explain what the two messages are in the logistic regression?
