magento :: change orders from pending to complete

i made a magento module to handle my bank vpc system, all good until now, i'm using Mage_Payment_Model_Method_Cc as a parent. the code is working 100% but now, when orders take place i see them in the admin panel with "pending" status, i want to mark the request as "complete" when a user submits the request. i tried everything i can think of with no hope. thanks in advance
