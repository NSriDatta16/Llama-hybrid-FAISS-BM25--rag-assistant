SEO blacklisting for cloaking

I am using postbacks to perform paging on a large amount of data. Since I did not have a sitemap for google to read, there will be products that google will never know about due to the fact that google does not push any buttons. I am doing cloaking to spit out all the products with no paging if the user-agent is that of a search engine. There may be some work arounds for situations like this which include hidden buttons to paged urls. What about information you want indexed buy google but you want to charge for the content. Imagine that I have articles that I want users to be able to find in google, but when the user visits the page, only half the content is displayed and users will have to pay for the rest. I have heard that google may blacklist you for cloaking. I am not being evil, just helpful. Does google recognize the intention?
