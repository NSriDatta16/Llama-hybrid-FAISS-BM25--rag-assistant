R bayesglm: Estimates depends on order of variable

I did a logistic regression with bayesglm from package arm . I got different results depending on the order of the variables in the model: set.seed(334) x1 |z|) # (Intercept) 0.8673 0.3329 2.606 0.00917 ** # x1 0.5442 0.2790 1.951 0.05110 . # x2 2.8858 0.5540 5.209 1.9e-07 *** summary(bayesglm(y~x2+x1,data=df,family="binomial")) # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) 0.8652 0.3318 2.607 0.00913 ** # x2 2.8492 0.5428 5.249 1.53e-07 *** # x1 0.5757 0.2907 1.981 0.04761 * I have no problem with this little differences even when the p-value is above or below 0.05 as in this example as long the difference is not too large and the estimates are similar. I'm just curious why this happened.
