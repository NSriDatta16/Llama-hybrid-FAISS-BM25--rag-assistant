The height of a block element defaults to the height of the block's content. So, given something like this: Where is pancakes house? #inner will grow to be tall enough to contain the paragraph and #outer will grow to be tall enough to contain #inner . When you specify the height or width as a percentage, that's a percentage with respect to the element's parent. In the case of width, all block elements are, unless specified otherwise, as wide as their parent all the way back up to ; so, the width of a block element is independent of its content and saying width: 50% yields a well defined number of pixels. However, the height of a block element depends on its content unless you specify a specific height. So there is feedback between the parent and child where height is concerned and saying height: 50% doesn't yield a well defined value unless you break the feedback loop by giving the parent element a specific height.
