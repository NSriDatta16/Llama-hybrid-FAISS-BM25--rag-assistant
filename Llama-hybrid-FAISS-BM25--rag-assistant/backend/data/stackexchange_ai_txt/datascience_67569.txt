Information Extraction from image / text - approach?

I need assistance with a ML project I am currently trying to create. I receive a lot of invoices from a lot of different suppliers - all in their own unique layout. I need to extract 3 key elements from the invoices. These 3 elements are all located in a table/line items for all the invoices. The 3 elements are: 1 : Tariff number (digit) 2 : Quantity (always a digit) 3 : Total line amount (monetary value) Please refer to below screenshot, where I have marked these field on a sample invoice. I started this project with a template approach, based on regular expressions . This, however, was not scaleable at all and I ended up with tons of different rules. I am hoping that machine learning can help me here - or maybe a hybrid solution? The common denominator In all of my invoices, despite of the different layouts, each line item will always consist of one tariff number . This tariff number is always 8 digits, and is always formatted in one the ways like below: xxxxxxxx xxxx.xxxx xx.xx.xx.xx (Where "x" is a digit from 0 - 9). Further , as you can see on the invoice there is both a Unit Price and a Total Amount per line. The amount I will need is always the highest for each line. The output For each invoice like the one above, I need the output for each line. This could for example be something like this: { "line":"0", "tariff":"85444290", "quantity":"3", "amount":"258.93" }, { "line":"1", "tariff":"85444290", "quantity":"4", "amount":"548.32" }, { "line":"2", "tariff":"76109090", "quantity":"5", "amount":"412.30" } Where to go from here? I am not sure of what I am looking to do falls under machine learning and if so, under which category. Is it computer vision? NLP? Named Entity Recognition? My initial thought was to: Convert the invoice to text. (The invoices are all in textable PDFs, so I can use something like pdftotext to get the exact textual values) Create custom named entities for quantity , tariff and amount Export the found entities. However, I feel like I might be missing something. Can anyone assist me in the right direction?
