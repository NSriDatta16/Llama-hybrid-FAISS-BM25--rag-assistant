You must explicitly get Master records before you close ObjectContext . If your navigation property in Detail entity is called Master modify your data retrieval query to: List cachedItems = entities.Details.Include("Master").ToList(); Or in case of using Include extension method form EF 4.1 List cachedItems = entities.Details.Include(d => d.Master).ToList(); This will load are details with their masters immediately with one round-trip.
