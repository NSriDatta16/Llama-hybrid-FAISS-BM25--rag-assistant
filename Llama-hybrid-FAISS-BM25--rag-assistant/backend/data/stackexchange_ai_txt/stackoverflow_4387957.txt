How to install dll into GAC.

I have to install the DLL to GAC. I have checked that same DLL is present there in the GAC related to my project. Is my steps correct? 1: Uninstall the previous DLL by clicking on File > Uninstall Assembly 2: Open Visual Studio command prompt 3: Type this C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322> gacutil.exe \i C:\xyz\My project\Projectxyz.dll OR Drag and drop the DLL from Bin to GAC ? Is it mandatory to give the strong name to the assembly or can I avoid it? What is the side effect if I don't give the strong name?
