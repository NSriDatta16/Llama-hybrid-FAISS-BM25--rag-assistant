I'm pretty sure some of the various code coverage tools such as emma and clover record the number of times each statement is executed because it's displayed in the reports. I'm guessing that they actually rewrite the class files during there compile phrase to insert some tracking code, not sure if this is suitable for you or not. EDIT : As recomended by unknown Cobertura can be used to record statement execution counts Emma open source, but doesn't seem to actually record statement counts Clover commercial coverage tool certainly does Cobertura Newer open source tool than emma and does record statement counts
