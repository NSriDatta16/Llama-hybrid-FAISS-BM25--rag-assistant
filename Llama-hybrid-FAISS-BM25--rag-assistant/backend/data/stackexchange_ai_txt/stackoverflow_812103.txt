Another extension, ".fhtml", appears to be used by some outdated Macromedia product, and at least one other software package uses it to mean "fragment HTML". Having a precedent is nice, but unfortunately the .fhtml suffix also used to indicate HTML templates with embedded Factor code. That kind of ambiguity is annoying.
