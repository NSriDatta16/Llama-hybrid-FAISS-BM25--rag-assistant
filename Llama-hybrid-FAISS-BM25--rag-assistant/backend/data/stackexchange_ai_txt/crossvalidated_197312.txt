Most Bayesian analyses I've encountered don't report the whole posterior, but a summary thereof. A credible interval is a great summary measure that is analogous to the confidence interval that frequentists use. You would need to explain if you've used an informative prior or not. Even we "uneducated" frequentists understand when and why a noninformative prior might be applied. I would advocate against decision rules, Bayes factors, and all that. The only strength that Bayesian analyses had is that, for a brief, shining, moment, it gave people the notion that "tests" do not really convey significance, but estimation intervals do. Nowhere is this so readily apparent as in two sample tests. And yet the journal of experimental psychology, in their endeavors to defenestrate NHST, have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Your cited article drives that point home. Even the abstract says "Bayesian estimation for two groups provides...the normality of the data" which is nonsense. Tests have a contrived interpretation in either context. Just report some CI, any CI, and be done with it.
