is possible to combine: jersey + jetty + spring

I'm trying to create a webserver embedding jetty (rather than Java EE) , and map my servlets RESTfully, using jersey. I'm using spring for dependency injection, and mapping the servlets as beans However, when I try to make an HTTP req to the mapped servlets, i get error 500- server error, or 404, page not found. I'm not sure if i'm doing this the right way, and I should probably be using the jetty.xml rather than this. (wondering if there's a shorcut using jetty.xml) index.jsp I have one class in the servlets package: DoNothing.java package servlets; import javax.ws.rs.GET; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.Produces; @Path("/nothing") public class doNothing { @GET @Produces("text/plain") public String returnNothing() { return ("test"); } } what in the world am I doing wrong? or should I ask what in the world am I doing right? Thanks
