Adobe AIR does allow you to leverage web development skills such as Javascript, HTML and CSS to develop desktop applications. So your skills are transferable in that sense. You can also use Flash (and Actionscript) to develop AIR apps. Adobe used to offer a way to create iPhone apps from Actionscript using a packager but Apple disallowed that. There are impressive AIR apps out there, but arguably it hasn't gotten the traction Adobe might have hoped by now, a few years after release. If I were you I would look at the task or job you need to do and learn the best technology to tackle that, rather than just adopting a platform. But if it's iPhone development, the the Apple way is the only way, and you'll need to learn Objective-C.
