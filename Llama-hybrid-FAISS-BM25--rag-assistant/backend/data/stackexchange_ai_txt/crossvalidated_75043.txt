You could consider using a vector autoregressive model, to model each country individually. The model would look something like this, $$\mathbf{y}_t = c+A_i\mathbf{y}_{t-1}+\cdots+A_p+\mathbf{y}_{t-p}+u_t,$$ where $\mathbf{y}_t=(y_{1,t},y_{2,t},\dots,y_{n,t})'$ and $u_t$ is $IIDN(0,\sigma)$ So you would estimate one vector autoregressive model for each variable for each country, regressing on past values of the outcome variable and past values of your predictors. After you find a model that fit you can look at the coefficients from the variables of interest, which in your case seems to be the fiscal policy rating variable. If you think this sounds interesting, I would recommend Applied Time Series Econometrics, by Lütkepohl and Krätzig, Cambridge University Press, The Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 2RU, UK, 2004.
