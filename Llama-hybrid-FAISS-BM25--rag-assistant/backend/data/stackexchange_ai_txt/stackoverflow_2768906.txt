The verifier didn't change much between 1.5 and 1.6, so it should be equally happy or unhappy on each. (On >= 2.0, it would throw a NoSuchFieldError at the point where the field is first used instead of rejecting the entire class.) The problem seems to be that the Build.MANUFACTURER field did not exist in Android 1.5 ("Cupcake"). I believe it was introduced in 1.6 ("Donut").
