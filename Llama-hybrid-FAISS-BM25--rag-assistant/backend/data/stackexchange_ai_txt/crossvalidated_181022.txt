Assuming you are using MATLAB, one approach is to calculate the cross-correlation between the two time series. Review the MATLAB help of function xcorr for extensive examples on computing lag or cross-correlation. Another approach is to compute the coherence between the two time series. As for the online detection, here is an idea. Do an offline investigation of the windowed values for the respective measure. Define a threshold by taking the average of all the events (hand labeled) of the respective measure.
