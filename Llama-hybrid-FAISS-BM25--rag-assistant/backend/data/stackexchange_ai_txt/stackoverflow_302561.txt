A programming idiom is the usual way to code a task in a specific language. For example a loop is often written like this in C: for (i=0; i PHP will understand a similar construct: for ($i = 1; $i But it is discouraged in PHP for looping over an array. In this case you would use: foreach ($arr as $value) Whereas in Ruby, you would use: (1..10).each for the loop, or: array.each There are many many possibilities to write a loop in those languages. Using the idiom makes it immediately identifiable by experienced readers. They can then spend their time on more important problems.
