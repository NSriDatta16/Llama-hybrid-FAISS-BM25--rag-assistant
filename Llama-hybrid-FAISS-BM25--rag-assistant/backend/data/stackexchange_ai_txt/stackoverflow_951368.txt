PostgreSQL 's most useful features (which MySQL lacks), in my opinion, are: generate_series and set returning functions in general ability to use correlated values in LIMIT and OFFSET clauses Custom aggregates DISTINCT ON clause More advanced JOIN methods ( MERGE JOIN and HASH JOIN ) You can do wonders with them. PostgreSQL code also often looks more elegant (note that "looks" doesn't mean "performs"), since you can use nice casting syntax ( :: ), nice RECORD types and these kinds of stuff. Drawbacks are: You cannot use hints (I know it's intentional; I know they should be avoided; go downvote me) You cannot use session variables without access to server configuration files (you need to set custom_variable_classes ) DISTINCT and GROUP BY operations are laggy. Since both these systems are quite powerful and well-developed, they differ mainly in such fancy features (that most developers never even use). For basic SQL , they're both good.
