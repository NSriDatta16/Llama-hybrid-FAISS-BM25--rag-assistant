To convert a standardized beta coefficient estimate to raw data scale in a logistic regression you need the standard deviation of the original raw variable. The the conversion is $OR_{raw} = exp( log(OR_{std})/SD_{raw})$, where $SD_{raw}$ is the standard deviation of the raw variable, $OR_{std}$ is the odds-ratio calculated from the standardized variable (i.e. z-score). You don't need to worry about the subtraction of the original variable's mean because it only affects the interpretation of the intercept.
