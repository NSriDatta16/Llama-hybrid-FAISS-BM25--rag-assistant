Oh, you're completely wrong with doing this way. You should add stretchable image into UIImageView and put it below UITextField. UIImage *backgroundImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"fieldBackground.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:12.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; Or you can try to disable userInteraction in UIButton.
