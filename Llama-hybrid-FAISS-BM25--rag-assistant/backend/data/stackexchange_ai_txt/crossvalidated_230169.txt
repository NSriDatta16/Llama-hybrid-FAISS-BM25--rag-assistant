It sounds like "think like a Bayesian, check like a frequentist" refers to one's approach in statistical design and analysis. As I understand it, Bayesian thinking involves some belief about prior situations (experimentally or statistically), let's say for example that the mean reading scores for 4th-graders is 80 words per minute, and that some intervention might increase this to 90 words per minute. These are beliefs based on prior studies and hypotheses. Frequentist thinking extrapolates the findings (of the intervention) to obtain confidence intervals or other statistics that are based on the theoretical and practical frequency or probability of these results happening again (i.e., how "frequently"). For example the post-intervention reading score might be 91 words per minute with a 95% confidence interval of 85 to 97 words per minute and an associated p-value (probability value) of this being different from the pre-intervention score. So 95% of the time, the new reading scores would be between 85 and 97 words per minute after the intervention. Therefore "think like a Bayesian"---i.e., theorize, hypothesize, look at previous evidence, and "check like a frequentist"---i.e., how frequently would these experimental results occur, and how likely are they to be due to chance rather than the intervention.
