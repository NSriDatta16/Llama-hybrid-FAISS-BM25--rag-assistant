Distribution of minimizer of sum of squared pairwise differences

Suppose I have iid random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ and some parametric function of $\theta,$ $f_{\theta},$ which is linear or nonlinear in $\theta$ (I am more interested in the nonlinear case, but if the linear case has been studied but the nonlinear case has not, I would be interested in the linear case as well). Is there existing literature on characterizing the distribution of minimizer $\theta_n$ of the sum of squared "pairwise" differences (just including $n^2$ in the denominator to make it look more like an average) $$\theta_n=\arg\min_{\theta}\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \left\{f_{\theta}(X_i)-f_{\theta}(X_j)\right\}^2?$$
