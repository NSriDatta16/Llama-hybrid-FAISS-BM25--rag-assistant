Does Physical File Deframentation contribute to Index Fragmentation?

I have a sysadmin who wants to frequently defrag my hard drives on my servers. Does physical file defragmentation cause my indexes to become more fragmented? Should I rebuild my indexes after ever disk defrag? I know clustered indexes might benefit from disk defragmentation, but what about the nonclustered ones? That's what I am mostly asking about. Thanks.
