If you calculate the PCA on the original data without scaling, then the scores should be in the original scale. For instance, the default prcomp function in R would do this. It has an argument scale which is FALSE by default. If you set it to TRUE then it'll scale the inputs by the variance and the scores will not be in the original scale anymore. One thing to be aware of is the center parameter. PCA in general requires that the inputs be centered. It's not an issue with interest rates usually, because you're supposed to run PCA on the differences of rates, which are usually centered around zero. You don't seem to be differencing the rates, so in your case centering (which is default in the function) will shift the component levels, though the range will still be in the same scale as the input rates. Running PCA on levels of rates is not meaningful in most applications. In your data set the yields are clearly non-stationary, you start in early 2000s, pre great recession. Applying PCA to such a long period is a question in itself, because correlations are unstable over time. Applying it to levels is even more questionable in this case.
