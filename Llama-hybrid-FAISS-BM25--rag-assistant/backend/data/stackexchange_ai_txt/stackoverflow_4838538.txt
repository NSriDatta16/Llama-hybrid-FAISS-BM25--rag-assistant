My name is Dmitriy, i'm technical project manager of Magento Core Team. 1.5.0.0-rc1 packages were wrongly packaged and contains local.xml file from test installation. Please remove local.xml file from app/etc folder or download package one more time. We have fixed packages. Sorry for this issue but like you know the old saying sais "He is lifeless that is faultless". Thank you for pointing this out.
