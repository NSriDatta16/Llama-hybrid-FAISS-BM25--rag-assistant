Google Analytics not working 100% with Magento

I need to solve a problem that the e-commerce report on analytics page, is showing 30% less sales than the Magento report. I was wondering where I put the analytics code with the sales transactions? In the success page after the payment? On our e-commerce, we use a third party billing app that makes the user navigate to another page, and I guess, sometimes the user just doesn't go back to the success page. So I was thinking that this could be the problem. Thanks, Joe
