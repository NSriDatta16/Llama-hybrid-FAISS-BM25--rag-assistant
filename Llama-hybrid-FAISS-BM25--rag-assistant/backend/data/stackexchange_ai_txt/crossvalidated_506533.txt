I'm dubious of generating more training data, even with techniques like SMOTE. Generating more training data via any method which is not observation of the phenomenon risks biasing any estimates by imposing some synthetic data generating processes. It could work, but I'm not sure it is reliable. If you're worried your training sample is too small, you could use Bayesian models with informative priors. Else, get more data.
