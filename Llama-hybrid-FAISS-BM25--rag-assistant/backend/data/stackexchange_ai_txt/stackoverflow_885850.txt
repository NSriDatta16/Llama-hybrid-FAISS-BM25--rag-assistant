Why is swallowing InterruptedException ok for subclasses of Thread?

In Brian Goetz's article on how to handle InterruptedException , one paragraph stands out: The one time it's acceptable to swallow an interrupt is when you know the thread is about to exit. This scenario only occurs when the class calling the interruptible method is part of a Thread, not a Runnable. I don't get this. Is the reason something to do with the Runnable possibly being handled by a threadpool whereas the Thread is something you start on your own ?
