MAMP : Mysql won't turn on

My mamp mysql server won't turn on. I tried executing /Applications/MAMP/bin/startMysql.sh but that gave me this error : 101110 05:50:31 mysqld_safe Logging to '/Applications/MAMP/logs/mysql_error_log.err'. 101110 05:50:32 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /Applications/MAMP/db/mysql 101110 05:50:32 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.pid ended /Applications/MAMP/logs/mysql_error_log.err : InnoDB: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/operating-system-error-codes.html InnoDB: Could not open or create data files.
