No, regression typically has asymmetrical penalty for 'mistakes' which would cause various problems in modeling your data. i.e. if your model predicts scores greater than one, that is the same type of error as if it would predict less than one, and classifiers would flatten results greater than one. You can look into logistic regression if you want something in that direction. If you want actual confidence scores you can look into Bayesian logistic regression.
