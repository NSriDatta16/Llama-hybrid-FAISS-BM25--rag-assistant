Common Lisp symbols's names are strings; strings have a length limit of array-dimension-limit The value of array-dimension-limit is a positive integer that is the upper exclusive bound on each individual dimension of an array. This bound depends on the implementation but will not be smaller than 1024. (Implementors are encouraged to make this limit as large as practicable without sacrificing performance.) In practice this can be quite large Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.3-dev-r11583M-trunk (DarwinX8664)! ? array-dimension-limit 72057594037927936 ? Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.3-dev-r11583M-trunk (DarwinX8632)! ? array-dimension-limit 16777216 ? This answer ignores the method name's package name; this could double the lengh.
