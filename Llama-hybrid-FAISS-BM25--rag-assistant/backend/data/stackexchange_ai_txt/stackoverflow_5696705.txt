It is sadly not possible to determine this completely. Packets might be split, reassembled etc. by network hardware all along the path to the receiver, so there is no guarantee to calculate the exact number of bytes. Ethernet defines the frame size with 1500bytes, which makes 1460 bytes remaining if the headers are subtracted. Using jumbo frames up to 9k bytes is usually only supported locally. When the packet reaches the WAN, it will be fragmented.
