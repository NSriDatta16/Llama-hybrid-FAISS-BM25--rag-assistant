The AUROC (which is related to Kolmogorov Smirnov) is not only invariant to a change in coefficient, it is invariant for any order-preserving transformation and consequently it tells how well you predict the ranking of the subjects. A test for checking whether your probabilities are well predicted is e.g. the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (see e.g. http://media.hsph.edu.vn/sites/default/files/Statistics%20eBook%20-%20Hosmer,%20Lemeshow%20-%20Applied%20Logistic%20Regression.pdf ). There may be other tests, but that depends on your problem. E.g. if you use the logistic regression in the context of predicting company failure and your goal is not to predict probabilities but to predict rating 'classes'.
