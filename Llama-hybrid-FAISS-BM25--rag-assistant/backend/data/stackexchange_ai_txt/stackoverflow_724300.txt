It's not generally considered terribly good practice, but there are very occasional cases in the JDK where this is done. Look at the 'biasRet' parameter of View.getNextVisualPositionFrom() and related methods, for example: it's actually a one-dimensional array that gets filled with an "extra return value". So why do this? Well, just to save you having to create an extra class definition for the "occasional extra return value". It's messy, inelegant, bad design, non-object-oriented, blah blah. And we've all done it from time to time...
