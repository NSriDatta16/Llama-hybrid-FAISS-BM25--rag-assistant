Silverlight 4 RichTextbox Paragraph Margin or similar?

I'm trying to add bullets to the SL4 RichTextBox. Using the Run / Paragraph objects and adding the correct bullet child seems to be an easy approach. However, when I want to apply a bullet to an existing paragraph, I would like to indent the content of the paragraph. How can apply this kind of styling to the paragraph? The margin doesn't exist for the SL version of Paragraph. Thanks.
