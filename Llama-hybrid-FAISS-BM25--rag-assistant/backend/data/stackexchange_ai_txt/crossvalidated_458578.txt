For your poisson glm, you are modeling the death rate, that is the predicted rate is: Starting with your intercept, the mean death rate is exp(-2.807e+00) = 0.06038588 and for example 1 unit of G (1 mutation guess) increases this rate by exp(6.913e-03) = 1.006937 times. To answer your question, 1 mutation in Gene V for example increases the death rate 1.034926 fold.. I don't know if you can necessarily make the jump about it being harmful etc, that's your call. Not sure what the average number of mutations in your data (which I suspect to be > 1), but will be useful to make sense of your coefficients in terms of that, for example, every 10 mutations increases the rate by .. fold
