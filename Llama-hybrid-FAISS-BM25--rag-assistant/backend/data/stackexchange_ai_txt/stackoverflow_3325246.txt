I guessed this question wouldn't fly and I admit I didn't find an incredibly elegant way to solve my problem. For completeness, this is what I do in my css to have things display the way I want: td {height:22px;white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;} p {display:inline;} br {display:none;} h3 {display:inline;} ... I am especially happy about the br tag as the maintainers of the imported data use it excessively.
