Grabbing Just The Top Entry From A LINQ Query

I basically have a lot of poorly designed code to do something that, I'm sure, can be done far more elegantly. What I'm trying to do is grab the last date from a database table. var Result = from a in DB.Table orderby a.Date descending select new {Date = a}; foreach(var Row in Result) { LastDate = Row.Date.Date; break; } Basically, there's a foreach loop that is designed to run only once. Crappy code! What's a "best practice" way to accomplish the same thing?
