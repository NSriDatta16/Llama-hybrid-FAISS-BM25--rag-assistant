R plot Odds Ratio for each value in logistic regression

I am trying to replicate the method in section 3a of this paper where, for a logistic regression model, they plot the functional relationship between a continuous variable and the odds for developing the outcome (using a smoothing spline). I was wondering how do you replicate this from an R glm model, as example: x |z|) (Intercept) -3.7311 1.9556 -1.908 0.0564 . x 0.6906 0.3611 1.912 0.0559 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 20.19 on 14 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 13.47 on 13 degrees of freedom AIC: 17.47 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 how can I extract the OR for each single value in order to replicate the example? Is the m$effect or what other parameter? I know how to plot predicted values, like this , but this is a different question
