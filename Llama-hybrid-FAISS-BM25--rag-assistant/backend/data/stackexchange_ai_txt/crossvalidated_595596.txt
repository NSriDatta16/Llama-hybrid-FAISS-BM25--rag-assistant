Why we can apply conditional logistic regression to model the effect of air pollution?

In a book called 'Analysing Seasonal Health Data', the time series dataset - CVDdaily was expanded by 'casecross' function, casecross(cvd~o3mean+tmpd +Mon+Tue+Wed+Thu+Fri+Sat,data=CVDdaily, stratalength=28,exclusion=6) and I cannot understand why we need to expand the dataset in order to fit the conditional logistic regression, please explain it. This is the original dataset(CVDdaily) from library(season) After using casecross function to expand the dataset: the dataset became: Why the function adds 22 rows to every dates and why we need 'case' and 'timex' column? Also, why we can use the above data with only 'True'(case = 1) case? Update: I want to ask one more question: why we add 22 rows without knowing whether people admitted to hospital in case days would go to hospital again in control days or not?
