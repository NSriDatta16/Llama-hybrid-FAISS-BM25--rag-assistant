The timeline API is a level higher than what you need to do. There is a general VCS implementation of it in ChangesetModule , which delegates the changeset (event) retrieval itself to a VCS-specific Repository . So you should implement the versioncontrol API instead. The API is designed for a “pull model”, in which Trac queries the VCS when constructing a timeline. If you really prefer a “push model” (why?), you could try working off the CacheRepository implementation as a base, injecting your events into the cache, or just writing an event-storing repository from scratch. Be aware that this goes against the grain of the existing design, and will very probably be unnecessary extra effort. I suggest that you go with the normal pull model instead, it will be easier and cleaner. You could use the Subversion implementation or the Mercurial implementation as a reference, and probably use GitPython to talk to git .
