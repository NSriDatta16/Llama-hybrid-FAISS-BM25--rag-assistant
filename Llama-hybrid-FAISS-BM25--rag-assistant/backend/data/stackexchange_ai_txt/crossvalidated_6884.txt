The formulas are straightforward but they are not as simple as intimated in the question. Let $Y$ be the previous EWMA and let $X = x_n$, which is presumed independent of $Y$. By definition , the new weighted average is $Z = \alpha X + (1 - \alpha)Y$ for a constant value $\alpha$. For notational convenience, set $\beta = 1-\alpha$. Let $F$ denote the CDF of a random variable and $\phi$ denote its moment generating function , so that $$\phi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}_F[\exp(t X)] = \int_\mathbb{R}{\exp(t x) dF_X(x)}.$$ With Kendall and Stuart , let $\mu_k^{'}(Z)$ denote the non-central moment of order $k$ for the random variable $Z$; that is, $\mu_k^{'}(Z) = \mathbb{E}[Z^k]$. The skewness and kurtosis are expressible in terms of the $\mu_k^{'}$ for $k = 1,2,3,4$; for example, the skewness is defined as $\mu_3 / \mu_2^{3/2}$ where $$\mu_3 = \mu_3^{'} - 3 \mu_2^{'}\mu_1^{'} + 2{\mu_1^{'}}^3 \text{ and }\mu_2 = \mu_2^{'} - {\mu_1^{'}}^2$$ are the third and second central moments, respectively. By standard elementary results, $$\eqalign{ &1 + \mu_1^{'}(Z) t + \frac{1}{2!} \mu_2^{'}(Z) t^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \mu_3^{'}(Z) t^3 + \frac{1}{4!} \mu_4^{'}(Z) t^4 +O(t^5) \cr &= \phi_Z(t) \cr &= \phi_{\alpha X}(t) \phi_{\beta Y}(t) \cr &= \phi_X(\alpha t) \phi_Y(\beta t) \cr &= (1 + \mu_1^{'}(X) \alpha t + \frac{1}{2!} \mu_2^{'}(X) \alpha^2 t^2 + \cdots) (1 + \mu_1^{'}(Y) \beta t + \frac{1}{2!} \mu_2^{'}(Y) \beta^2 t^2 + \cdots). } $$ To obtain the desired non-central moments, multiply the latter power series through fourth order in $t$ and equate the result term-by-term with the terms in $\phi_Z(t)$.
