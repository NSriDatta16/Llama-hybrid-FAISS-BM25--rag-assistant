there are actually two problems... one is that the page may be cached in the browser; the second is that the page may be cached on the server. The more likely is actually is the first one. The best way is to have Pragma: NoCache: no-cache in the section of the page (IIRC, you need to statement; one for HTTP1.0 and one for HTTP1.1, and they require different statements). You need to put it on the pages that are only available for logged in (or at least the most sensitive ones). This will cause the browser to go back to the server. The other is server caching, which is actually, less likely - you would probably know if you or, say, Zend optimizer did some caching. for this you can use session_unset or session_is_registered. But try Pragma first.
