As an aside, Mann-Whitney U is NOT a test of central tendency (aka median). It is a test of stochastic superiority (a random value from one sample is, on average, more likely to be higher that a random value from the other sample). Only in some very specific (and hard to verify) cases does it become a test of the medians: either when the 2 samples are symmetric (and then median=mean and it becomes also a test of means), or when the 2 samples are NOT symmetric, but they have exactly the same shape (how to prove this? An exercise "left to the student"?)
