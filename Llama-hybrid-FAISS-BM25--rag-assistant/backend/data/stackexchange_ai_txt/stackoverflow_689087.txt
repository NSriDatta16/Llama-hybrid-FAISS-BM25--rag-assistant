Automatic generation of Unit test cases for .NET and Java

Is there a good tool to generate unit test cases given say a .NET or Java project, it generates unit test cases that would cover an almost 100% code coverage. The number of test cases could be directly proportional to the cyclomatic complexity of the code (the higher the nesting of loops and conditions the higher the cyclomatic complexity) where the higher the cyclomatic complexity, the greater the set of test cases are generated. I'm not expecting it to be fully functional (say I'm going to build the unit tests and run it after its been generated), but I would say that it can have a template style in the test case where you are to modify the case that suits your intended needs. But it should also have a proper setup and teardown method and is good enough to detect if mock objects for unit testing should be used should there be any dependencies. So, is there such a tool that exists?
