Searching for multiple strings in a larger text is a well-understood problem, and signifigant research has been made into making it fast. The two most popular and effective methods for this are the Aho-Corasick Algorithm (I'd rcommend this one) and the Rabin-Karp Algorithm . They use a little preprocessing, but are orders of magnitude less complex & faster than the naieve method (the naieve method is worst-case O(m*n^2*p) where m is the length of the long string [the webpage you scraped] and n is the average length of the needles and p is the number of needles). Aho-Corsaik is linear. A C# implementation of it can be found at CodeProject for free. Edit: Oops, I was wrong about the complexity of Aho-Corasick -- it's linear in the number & length of input strings + the size of the string being analyzed [the scraped text] plus the number of matches. But it's still linear and linear is a lot better than cubic :-).
