php require_once resetting to current working directory

This is a longshot but I have a file with something like this: document structure: /some/path/start.php and /another/path/test.php /another/path/images/ ?> I'm looking for a way for the required file (test.php) to correctly load the images (essentially reset what it believes to be the currrent directory). I don't want to force people to use absolue paths and really don't want to add some variable in there. Is there a php construct to handle this? I'm using Zend_Framework. Maybe the reverse, a construct to have multiple index.php files that map via absolute paths to my starter script for Zend Framework. Any ideas would be appreciated? I have the following there's an elegant sol'n - I'm just not seeing it.
