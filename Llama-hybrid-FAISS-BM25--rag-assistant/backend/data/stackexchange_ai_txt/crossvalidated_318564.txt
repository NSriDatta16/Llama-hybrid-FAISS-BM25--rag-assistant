Is it possible to design a global image classifier?

For neural networks, current approach requires optimization of hyper-parameters for a given training dataset. For individual dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR and, IMAGENET, we can achieve a pretty descent accuracy. However, my question is why we need to design individual classifier for each dataset. We do have transfer learning between different models trained on a given dataset. Can't we build a global classifier which can learn features from all these dataset, something which human brain does?
