Uncertainty means we do not know the value (or outcome) of some quantity, eg the average porosity of a specific reservoir (or the porosity of a core-sized piece of rock at some point within the reservoir). Variability refers to the multiple values a quantity has at different locations, times or instances – eg the average porosities of a collection of different reservoirs (or the range of core-plugs porosities at different locations within a specific reservoir). I think the uncertainty amounts to the epistemic uncertainty(or model uncertainty; caused by parameter uncertainty, and can be reduced by providing more data), and the variability the aleatoric uncertainty(or data uncertainty; inherent uncertainty in the data, but cannot be reduced by providing more data). And their difference is illustrated in this answer . The frequentist models can only capture the aleatoric uncertainty while the Bayesian both, then the frequentist interpretation of (epistemic) uncertainty would be of no meaning. The aleatoric uncertainty is expressed in the distribution across the classes, which is zero if one class gets a probability of one. The epistemic uncertainty is expressed in the spread of the predicted probabilities of one class, which is zero if the spread is zero. The non-Bayesian NN can’t express epistemic uncertainty (you can’t get different predictions for the same image), but the BNN can. The above is a quote from this book: Probabilistic Deep Learning: with Python, Keras and Tensorflow Probability And how is it quantified? The aleatoric uncertainty can be measured using entropy, and the spistemic uncertainty can also be quantified as illustrated in 8.5.2 of this book: Probabilistic Deep Learning: with Python, Keras and Tensorflow Probability .
