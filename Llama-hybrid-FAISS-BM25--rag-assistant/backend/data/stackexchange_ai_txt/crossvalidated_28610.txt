I will try to give an alternative explanation, coming more from the Bayesian Side of things. It is true that every sequence is equally likely, including the one with just sixes. I think the frequentist framework has some problems here. There are many possible ways to test the null hypothesis of independent throws from a fair dice, including maximal sequence length of every possible number from 1-6, the average of the throws, the distribution of ones, twos,... up to sixes or a complete comparision of the observed frequences with the theoretical frequencies via a a chi-square test. But none of these tests detect all the possible deviations from independent + fair dice. Testing for more deviations at once will give you a problem with the multiple testing problem. OTH the other hand in a Bayesian Framework you could argue that a series of all sixes is much more likely under the assumption that the dice is manipulated or the player is cheating. Given prior probabilities for "something is fishy" and a probability for "six dices if "something is fishy" you could update your probability for "something is fishy" based on the result via $$ P(\text{"fishy"|"all sixes"}) = \frac{P(\text{"all sixes"|"fishy"})P(\text{"fishy"})}{P(\text{"all sixes"})}. $$ Note that $$ P(\text{"all sixes"}) = P(\text{"all sixes"|"fishy"}) + P(\text{"all sixes"|"all ok with the die"}). $$ This means that for a fixed prior belief for "fishy" not equal to zero $P(\text{"fishy"}|\text{"all sixes"})$ is strictly increasing with $P(\text{"all sixes"|"fishy"})$. While it is in practice impossible to put a number on the last term, it is enough to give a lower estimate on it to get a lower estimate for the probability for "fishy". Obviously it's a bit subjective, but so is the judgement that all sixes is a particular strange result.
