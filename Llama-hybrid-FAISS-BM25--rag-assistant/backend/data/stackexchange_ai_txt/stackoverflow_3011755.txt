Your description is a little hard to follow. Here's how I interpret your question: Give me a transformer that copies everything by default, except: it converts oldItem elements into Item elements it adds an extra item to the oldItems element under "step 1", as the last element And here's a solution: Step1item which, when applied to: (not exactly what you gave, but what I think you were going for) yields: which needs some whitespace cleanup, but I think is the structure you're looking for. If you wanted block text instead of an extra item, you can simply rewrite the add-new-step1-stuff template like this: Here's some block text that goes at the end. Key differences between my stylesheet and yours: Your identity (copy-by-default) transform applies to every node in your document and produces an Item, within which you're copying the rest of the contents â€“ which is why you're seeing Items all over the place! In mine, the identity transform and the addition of an element are separate. Note that the identity transform does not need to be called explicitly if you add apply-templates at the appropriate places. Your transformations are missing the copying of attributes, which I imagine you want to keep instead. Your transformation will add an Item after every oldItem in oldItems underneath Step 1, which I'm also imagining is not what you want.
