Java - Search using a part of key word

I have requirement of selecting s subset of data from a collection using a part of a key word Assume that I have a collection consist of following entries, "Pine Grosbeak" "House Crow" "Hume`s Leaf Warbler" "Great Northern Loon" "Long-tailed Duck" "Lapland Longspur" "Northern Gannet" "Eastern Imperial Eagle" "Little Auk" "Lesser Spotted Woodpecker" "Iceland Gull" When I provide a search string as “ro” following should be filtered; "House Crow" "Pine Grosbeak" (This is something similar to “LIKE ‘%ro%’ “ clause in SQL) Can some one help me on this?
