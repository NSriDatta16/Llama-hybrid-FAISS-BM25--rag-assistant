Emulator will not start (?) with 2.2

I am not sure where to start with debugging this problem so I thought I would make a post. I could not find the same problem anywhere else I am using eclipse, windows 7, and installed the android sdk and eclipse plugin both. I can create hello-world applications, compile and run them nicely for target 2.1-update1 (7) I cannot get the emulator to start for target 2.2 (8). I have tried creating profiles through eclipse, and running them stand alone. What happens is the window comes up and it says "A N D R O I D _" and stays there forever. I left it for hours. I tried starting the emulator from the command prompt, identical result. I tried the -wipe-data command, no change I cannot get logcat to work: I start " emulator -avd phone2.2 -logcat '*' ", then try " adb -e logcat " in a different console. the logcat says "- waiting for device -" and never changes. Maybe the emulator never starts? Can someone please advise me on some things to try? -- Thanks for your feedback ---- update i started the emulator with -show-kernel and it highlighted some probelms. I will reinstall the SDK as you suggested, but here is the kernal output where the problems arise and where it stops and waits forever: Freeing init memory: 104K init: cannot open '/initlogo.rle' yaffs: dev is 32505856 name is "mtdblock0" yaffs: passed flags "" yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 31.0, "mtdblock0" yaffs tragedy: Bad object type, 43188627 != 11, for object 267386880 at chunk 25 535 during scan yaffs: dev is 32505857 name is "mtdblock1" yaffs: passed flags "" yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 31.1, "mtdblock1" yaffs_read_super: isCheckpointed 0 yaffs: dev is 32505858 name is "mtdblock2" yaffs: passed flags "" yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 31.2, "mtdblock2" yaffs_read_super: isCheckpointed 0 init: cannot find '/system/bin/sh', disabling 'console' init: cannot find '/system/bin/servicemanager', disabling 'servicemanager' init: cannot find '/system/bin/vold', disabling 'vold' init: cannot find '/system/bin/netd', disabling 'netd' init: cannot find '/system/bin/debuggerd', disabling 'debuggerd' init: cannot find '/system/bin/rild', disabling 'ril-daemon' init: cannot find '/system/bin/app_process', disabling 'zygote' init: cannot find '/system/bin/mediaserver', disabling 'media' init: cannot find '/system/bin/dbus-daemon', disabling 'dbus' init: cannot find '/system/bin/installd', disabling 'installd' init: cannot find '/system/etc/install-recovery.sh', disabling 'flash_recovery' init: cannot find '/system/bin/keystore', disabling 'keystore' init: cannot find '/system/etc/init.goldfish.sh', disabling 'goldfish-setup' init: cannot find '/system/bin/qemud', disabling 'qemud' init: cannot find '/system/bin/logcat', disabling 'goldfish-logcat'
