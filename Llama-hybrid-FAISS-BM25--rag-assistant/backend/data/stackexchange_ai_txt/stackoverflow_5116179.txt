Thoughts on how to implement paging for a detail page

I am curious as to what people would thing is the best way to implement this. On my overview page, I have a data grid which is sortable and has custom filtering written for it. When you click on an item in the grid, it loads a separate page with details. I would like to implement result paging through on the detail page keeping in the same order as the previous page data grid. Now I've thought of a few ways to do this: Change the link to be a postback and handle the sort order programatically Sort filter and sort settings on application of the settings in the session Pass the filter and sort settings on the query string to the detail page None of these seem very clean to me, and option 3 is the only cogent option I've thought of. Am I missing something? Is there a more elegant way to do this?
