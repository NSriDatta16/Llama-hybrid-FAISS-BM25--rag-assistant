Don't use the sender method unless you absolutely have to. It ties the function directly to being used only as a slot (can't be called directly). Retain the behavior of having the function accept a string and simply make a mechanism by which you can call it. One method, among others you might find, is to leverage use of QSignalMapper. It will map objects to values and regenerate signals of the appropriate signature.
