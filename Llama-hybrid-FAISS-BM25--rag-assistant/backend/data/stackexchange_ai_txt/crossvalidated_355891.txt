If you want to stick with neural nets, it sounds like you may be interested in rnn structures because they incorporate feedback loops in the network topology. Alternatively, graph algebra is a social science tool that can be used to express complex models incorporating things like feedback loops. I think this might be closer to what you're actually interested in, instead of neural networks because (1) you already have a notion of what you want to model, and how the various factors are related and (2) you're modeling social phenomena, so the graph algebra literature will be written with your goal in mind. Two key publications: Brown, Courtney (2008), Graph Algebra: Mathematical Modeling With a Systems Approach , Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences, 151, SAGE, ISBN 9781412941099. Cort√©s, Fernando, Adam Przeworski, and John Sprague. 1974. Systems Analysis for Social Scientists. New York: John Wiley & Sons.
