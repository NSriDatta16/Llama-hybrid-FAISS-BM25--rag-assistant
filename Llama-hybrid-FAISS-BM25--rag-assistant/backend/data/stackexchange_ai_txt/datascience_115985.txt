How do well informed labels for ordinal encoding improve model performance?

From Kaggle's intermediate machine learning tutorial, it was stated that for each column, we randomly assign each unique value to a different integer. This is a common approach that is simpler than providing custom labels; however, we can expect an additional boost in performance if we provide better-informed labels for all ordinal variables. Here's what I understood: If I had a column named place with the unique values being [first, second, third] , then I would get better performance by encoding those as [1,2,3] compared to [2,1,3] . Is my understanding correct? If so, how does this lead to better performance? Since the integers are just used as a numeric placeholder for the unique values, does the ordering even matter as long as those integers can uniquely identify each value?
