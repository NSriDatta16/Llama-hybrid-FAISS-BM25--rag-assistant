neural network high misclassification rate

I have to create a binary classifier for a dataset of approx 150 samples and 50 binary features. The classifier has to be a feedforward neural network (NN). My problem is that while the NN performs extremely well on the training set (approx 3-4% misclassification rate) it produces large test errors (approx 40-45%). I think this is a clear case of overfitting the data. I tried two things so far to reduce the number of features: I tried to reduce the number of hidden nodes, and even eliminate them, but to no avail. I created an autoencoder (50-X-50 NN, with X hidden nodes, X=15,20,...40) to map the original dataset to a lower dimension. Unfortunately the reduced dataset behaves as bad as the original. Any idea what should I try? (I don't have access to more data).
