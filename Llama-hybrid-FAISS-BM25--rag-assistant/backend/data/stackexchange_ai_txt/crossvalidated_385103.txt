changing the coding system from helmert coding to difference coding changes regression results?

EDIT : I think I have mistaken the names of the coding systems, so I changed it (in bold). The content has not changed at all, though, so I would still appreciate any answer. END EDIT I'm running linear generalized mixed effects regression ( glmer ) on binomial data. To simplify: I have two categorical predictors, A and B . A has two levels ( a1 and a2 ) while B has three ( b1 , b2 , b3 ). I used a helmert coding system for B , i.e. one contrast codes for the difference between b2 and b1 , and the second contrast codes for the difference between b3 and the average of b1 and b2 . A is sum coded. With these coding systems, I get that the interaction of A and the first contrast of B ( b2>b1 ) is significant at p=0.08 (see results below). When I change the coding system of B to difference coding (i.e. adjacent levels are compared; contrast I: b2>b1 , contrast II: b3>b2 ), I get that the interaction of A with the first contrast ( b2>b1 ) is significant at p=0.04 (see results below). How can this be? The first contrast of B is the same in both coding systems. The contrast matrix I used for helmert coding is the following: > helmert.codes b2 vs b1 b3 vs mean(b2,b1) b1 -0.5 -0.3333333 b2 0.5 -0.3333333 b3 0.0 0.6666667 And the contrast matrix for difference coding was this: > difference.codes b2 vs b1 b3 vs b2 b1 -1 0 b2 1 -1 b3 0 1 After searching the forum, I ran across this post in which @barnhillec explains that for difference coding, it is the pseudo-inverse of the above matrix that should be used. Based on this, I tried to use the following matrix instead: > inverse.difference.codes b2 vs b1 b3 vs b2 b1 -0.6666667 -0.3333333 b2 0.3333333 -0.3333333 b3 0.3333333 0.6666667 With this matrix, I once again get that the interaction of A and the first contrast of B is significant at the level of p=0.08 (although there are still some differences three places after the decimal). So my questions are: Which matrix should I use if I want a difference coding system? Assuming the inverse is the one, could someone please help me put sense into it? I don't understand how the inverse is the one that codes for these contrasts. Should I expect any difference between the two coding systems ( helmert vs difference ) in the first contrast of B (and its interactions), at all? * LATER ADDITION: RESULTS * Results with helmert coding (relevant effects only): Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.
