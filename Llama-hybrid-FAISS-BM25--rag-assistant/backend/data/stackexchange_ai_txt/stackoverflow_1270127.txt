You can subclass a UIView to track the touch movements by overriding the touchBegan:withEvent: , touchMoved:withEvent: and touchEnded:withEvent messages. In these messages, track the UITouch objects' locations (converted to points on the view by using the convertPoint:toView: message of the UIView you're subclassing) and calculate the difference of movement; then apply the same difference to your object, wherever it might be on the screen.
