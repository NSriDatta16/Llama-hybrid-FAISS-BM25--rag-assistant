resource size for different densities in android

i have made images for an mdpi phone in android. i want to resize those images for hdpi and ldpi screens. what is the conversion factor for the dimesions? i have heard that we multiply the height and width of the mdpi image by 1.5 to convert it to a hdpi screen. what is the accurate conversion factor- for both mdpi to hpdi and mdpi to ldpi? thank you in advance.
