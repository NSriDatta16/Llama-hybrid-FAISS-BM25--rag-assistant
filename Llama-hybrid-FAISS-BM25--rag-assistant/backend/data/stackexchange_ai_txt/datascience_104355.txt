You could look into neural nets, e.g. using LSTM layers. There are examples, such as „Jena“ weather forecast with Keras : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_weather_forecasting/ Alternatively, you can use VAR models (vector autoregressive models). If you use R, have a look here (section "Multivariate Time Series Models") .
