Windsor IHandlerSelector in RIA Services Visual Studio 2010 Beta2

I want to implement multi tenancy using Windsor and i don't know how to handle this situation: i succesfully used this technique in plain ASP.NET MVC projects and thought incorporating in a RIA Services project would be similar. So i used IHandlerSelector, registered some components and wrote an ASP.NET MVC view to verify it works in a plain ASP.NET MVC environment. And it did! Next step was to create a DomainService which got an IRepository injected in the constructor. This service is hosted in the ASP.NET MVC application. And it actually ... works:i can get data out of it to a Silverlight application. Sample snippet: public OrganizationDomainService(IRepository cultureRepository) { this.cultureRepository = cultureRepository; } Last step is to see if it works multi-tenant-like: it does not! The weird thing is this: using some line of code and writing debug messages in a log file i verified that the correct handler is selected! BUT this handler seems not to be injected in the DomainService. I ALWAYS get the first handler (that's the logic in my SelectHandler) Can anybody verify this behavior? Is injection not working in RIA Services? Or am i missing something basic?? Development environment: Visual Studio 2010 Beta2 Thanks in advance
