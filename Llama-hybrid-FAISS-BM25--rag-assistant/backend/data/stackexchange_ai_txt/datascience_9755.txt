It might be easier for you to take a look at the events streaming services that are offered in Amazon Web Services (AWS), mainly Kinesis. The easiest of them in Kinesis Firehose ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html ), which gives you an endpoint where you can write your events to, and they will appear in Amazon Redshift, which is a data warehouse service that can scale to huge sizes ( https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/ ). AWS also announced that they will add Kinesis Analytics, which will allow you to write SQL code on top of the events stream of Kinesis. You can calculate different statistics such as moving agerages and other relevant statistic on your incoming events. These events that are processed in near real time, can be clicks on your web site, purchases in your e-commerce site, security events that should be monitored for potential intrusion, etc.
