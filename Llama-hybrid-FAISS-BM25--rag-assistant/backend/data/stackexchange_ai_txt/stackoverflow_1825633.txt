If you are only counting word frequencies, sentence parsing is unnecessary. All you need to do is tokenise the input and then count word frequencies using a java HashMap . If you want to use the Stanford tools, then use any of the tokenisers in edu.stanford.nlp.process . This gives you the frequency of any given word, but in general it may not be possible to find the word corresponding to a given frequency rank, since some words may be equally frequent in the document.
