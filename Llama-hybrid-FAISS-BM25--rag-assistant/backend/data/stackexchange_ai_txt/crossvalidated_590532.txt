The answer to both questions is: because you are generating the response in the wrong way, because you are assuming the response to be fixed, conditionally on $x_i$ . Indeed, the binary logistic regression model can be written as $$ Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i), $$ $$ p_i = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i}},\,\,i=1,\ldots,n. $$ According to your assumptions, $\beta_0=2,\beta_1=10$ , $x_i\sim \text{N}(0,1)$ iid and $n=1000$ . The correct way to generate the data from the model is thus set.seed(1) n=1000 x1=rnorm(n) xBeta=2+10*x1 p=1/(1+exp(-xBeta)) y=rbinom(n,1,p) dat = data.frame(y=y,x1=x1) model
