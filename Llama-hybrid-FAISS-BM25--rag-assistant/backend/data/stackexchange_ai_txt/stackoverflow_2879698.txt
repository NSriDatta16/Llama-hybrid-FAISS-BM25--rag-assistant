Django 1.2 crash course needed

I know Python but I've never used Django. What do I need to know about Django 1.2 to port my typical PHP CRUD web application in one weekend? (Yes I've read Joel Spolsky's Netscape article :-)) I'm reading this tutorial right now and it's excellent. I'm already playing around with inspectdb to generate my models from the existing schema. I'm planning to use the following this weekend: Fragment caching Static asset versioning (for far future expires) Schema migrations (or whatever they're called in Django) Auto-admin (and customize it later) The test framework Skins ...other stuff I probably don't know about yet I'm familiar with all these concepts in other languages/frameworks, except for the ORM which I've never used. I know SQL pretty well though. Any links, sage bits of advice, gotchas, stuff not mentioned in the (excellent) tutorial/docs, or stuff that is mentioned but warrants repeating == very welcome. Thanks!
