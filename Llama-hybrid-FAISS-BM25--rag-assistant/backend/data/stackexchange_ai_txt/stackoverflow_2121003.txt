What all Design Patterns can I use?

1. I need to build a "Web Service Server (Simulator)" which generates the xml files and also sends async calls to the client for notification. At this point, I am writing a code to generate dummy XML files which will be used for testing (FileGeneratorClass-- builder)? 2. Also, can I implement this in a way that I do not have to write a complete code from scratch to simulate another web service server and another file format ? - what pattern can I leverage there ? 3. The objects/classes are generated from a Schema file (for xml File) and WSDLs ( for web service ), how can I make my code immune to changes to these files (newer versions) ? - which design pattern ?? (Please let me know if information I provided is too much or too less, also if you need me to edit) Thank you very much. Disclaimer : I am a complete newbie and using patterns for this small project might be overkill yet I want to do it so that I learn/understand it. Which, I think, will give me confidence and clarity when I need to do that in a more complex project.
