Can I perform only instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN?

I've to do instance segmentation of microscopy images. I was reading the Mask R-CNN paper and found that it has an additional branch for predicting mask and that it predicts class, bounding box and mask parallelly. Now I don't have bounding boxes in the training data, can I still use Mask R-CNN for just instance segmentation? This is the multi task loss on each RoI they used during training $L=L_{cls}+L_{box}+L_{mask}$ , so I don't think it's possible. Any help is highly appreciated.
