Probability distribution of measurements and Parameters of measurements

I am new to statistics and recently learned about ISO guidelines for Accuracy & Precision and Uncertainty & Error . I have tried to plot a graph for what I have learnt including all the parameters of a measurement. I just want to know that my graph is correct or not according to defination of ISO? I am very sure about the error part (systematic error, random error and total error) that I illustrated it properly but want to confirm the relations that I showed between Trueness & Systematic Error (difference between true value and theoretical mean of measurements taken infinite times) Accuracy & Total Error ( difference between true value and measured value that is average of some finite measurement sample ) Precision & Standard deviation ( dispersion in mean of finite sample) are right or wrong?
