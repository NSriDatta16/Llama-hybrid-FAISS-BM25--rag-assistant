If you want to extract bag-of-words features from the text, you'll need to run CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer on text column. The rest is pretty straightforward, scikit-learn has an example code here . For Naive Bayes you'd need to change SGDClassifier to appropriate Naive Bayes algorithm from scikit and maybe drop TfidfTransformer (it does tf-idf scaling of the counts, so it doesn't help if you only use bare counts, as in Multinomial/Bernoulli Naive Bayes).
