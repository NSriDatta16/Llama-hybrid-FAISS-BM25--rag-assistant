Similar to Self Organization Maps, are all other clustering algorithms "self organizing"?

From my understanding of the terms: Self means: No supervision is required during training. Organizing means: To create a topographic ordered map by using unsupervised competitive learning and cooperative learning. Competitive: All neurons compete with each other to become a winning neuron. Mechanism known as ‘Winner take all learning’. Cooperative: Neuron dealing with closely related piece of information come closer to each other. Map means: Neurons in output space attempt to map their weights to conform to the given input data. OR The nodes in a SOM network attempt to become like the inputs presented to them. Because of this mapping, also called Self Organization Feature Map. K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN all meet the definition of Self as it appears for SOM. We can also say they are Maps as there is mapping of input vector to centers. My question is: can we also say whether or not they are Organizing as well? In brief, is the below table correct?
