To compare 2 excel files using python

I have a excel file with following fields Software_name , Version and Count. This file is a inventory of all softwares installed in the network of an organization which was generated using LANdesk. I have another excel file which is an purchase inventory of these softwares which is generated manually. I need to compare these sheets and create a report stating whether the organization is compliant or not. Hence how do i compare these two files. there are instances like Microsoft Office is mentioned as just office and 'server' is spelt as 'svr' How do go about with it?
