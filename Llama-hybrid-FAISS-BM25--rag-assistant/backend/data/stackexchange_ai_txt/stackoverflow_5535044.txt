Disable/deny going back to previous page on asp.net 2.0

On my current project I want to deny going back once my customers hit submit button and redirected to the final page. How can I deny from going back to previous page or some mechanism to expire the page if the back button is clicked. I tried this code and it didn't work page.response.cache.setcacheability(httpcacheability.nocache)
