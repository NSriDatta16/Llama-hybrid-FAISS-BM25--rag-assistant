You describe a circumstance in which spending might vary around a constant level (under the null hypothesis) or change suddenly to vary around a second level at some point during the series. One way to measure this is to compare the variance in spending under the two models. In the first case it would be the mean squared difference between spending and the overall average. In the second case, the differences would be relative to the two levels of spending for the best possible model : that is, among all possible points where the series could break, choose the one where the magnitude of the effect is largest. Let's call the resulting mean squared difference the "two-level variance." A permutation test can do a fine job of assessing the data. Its null hypothesis is that the sequence of the data doesn't matter. The sampling distribution of the two-level variance therefore is obtained by examining all possible reorderings of the data and computing its value for each one. In practice there are so many reorderings that we sample from them randomly, thereby approximating the sampling distribution. The data will show significant evidence of a break when it is rare for the reordered data to exhibit a two-level variance that is as low (or lower) than the two-level variance of the data themselves. Here, in the histogram at left, is an approximate permutation distribution of the two-level variance for the data given in the question. The vertical dotted red line marks the value of the two-level variance for the actual data. The p-value is very low because no permuted versions of the data exhibited a smaller two-level variance. The plot at the right shows the (obvious) break where the symbols change between indexes 7 and 8. Here is R code to reproduce (or extend) these calculations. It requires about one second to compute ten thousand values of the permutation distribution--more than enough for practical work. (The computation of the test statistic can be optimized and made to scale directly with the amount of data.) # # The two-level variance. # stat
