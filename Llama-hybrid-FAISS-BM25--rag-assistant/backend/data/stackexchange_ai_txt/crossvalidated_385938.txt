For this specific example - where there is a predetermined "correct" answer - I would re-work the x/y cooridnates to be polar coordinates around the city they were being asked to mark on the map. The accuracy is then measured agains the radial component (mean, sd, etc.). An "average angle" could also be used to measure bias. For myself, I'm still looking for a a good solution to when there is no pre-determined centre point, and don't like the idea of a pre-pass over the data to create a centroid.
