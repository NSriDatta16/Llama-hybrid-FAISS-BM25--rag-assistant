Explain whats going on with this embedded mp3 player

I'm making a first attempt at embedding an mp3 file on a webpage. I've found some code snippets that work, but I don't understand them, and I hate not understanding what I'm writing. I also can't believe how complicated (and redundant) the code is for a simple player, so I'm thinking this snippet is not as simple as it could be. On the other hand, most of the code snippets I found look pretty much the same. Could someone explain to me the purpose of each piece of this code, and if it is all necessary?
