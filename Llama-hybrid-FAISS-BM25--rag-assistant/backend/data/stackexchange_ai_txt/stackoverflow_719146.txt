I think there are two approaches to meaning of term "competent Java programmer". If it is about lexems, syntax and terms of OOP I began to completly understand Java before 2 (two) days of learning. But firstly you will be charmed by impossibility to shoot your own leg ;) But if it is case of embeded class system (i.e. packages), APIs references, tips-and-tricks and etc., it takes about half-year to feel yourself friendly with Java. I think.
