You really ought to keep them in source control. If you're using Subversion, as Beepcake says, you can use svn:externals to share the files between different projects. Alternatively, you could have a custom build action that fetches the latest copy of the shared files from wherever you keep them. We do this in a variety of ways -- either we issue an "svn checkout" for a subdirectory (but svn:externals would work for this), or we do a "wget ..." to grab the output from the last successful build of another project (we use TeamCity for continuous integration, and it makes "artifacts" available over HTTP).
