The considerations by Kjetil make this a complicated problem and therefore a complete answer is difficult. There is a point that I would like to highlight here 'just using a lower 95% interval bound is very arbitrary'. I think you can do better. For a simple case: assume that individuals performance is normal distributed and that the individual mean level is itself also normal distributed. Then we can consider a ranking based on estimates of the individual means. This can be done with some Bayesian technique or with an random effects model. In both cases you will get that the estimates for players with little data will be closer to the general mean. Instead of computing a single random effects model or Bayesian model, a simpler practical way to continuously update a ranking would be to use some elo-rating system (whose mechanism will somewhat boil down to a sort of Bayesian model and probably you might even show that it is equivalent) Elo-rating type of systems considers a prior distribution for the level of players and based on the outcome, win or lose, these distributions are updated. In bridge it will be a bit more complex than a win or loose in a game of two players, but the mechanism of elo rating is very simple and in this way you might also be able to incorporate the complex parts of Bridge tournaments. Instead of win/lose you have a score. But, basically you just need some function that predicts the outcome based on a difference in elo rating level. In chess this is a logistic function, for bridge you could convert the prior distribution of performance level difference into points scored according to some function that can start of a bit arbitrary, and eventually be updated based on observed distribution of points for given difference in Elo rating. The links from Kjetil's answer propose to give individuals their own ratings and average them in some way to get an Elo rating for the couples. Another thing that you can add to this (which, I believe, is not mentioned in those links) is that in duplicate bridge multiple pairs of pairs play the same hands and you can compare the relative performance for the group as a whole. E.g. if a couple A with Elo 1800 plays against couple B with Elo 1950 and couple C with Elo 1900 plays against couple D with Elo 2000, then you expect that couple B is gonna score better than couple D. Based on the observed difference in score. Instead of making computations for each deal, it might be easier to look at the end results of an entire tournent and use the total scores of the couples. Then based on the observed scores and the expected scores (e.g. some Gaussian distribution based on the ELO and the number of deals) you compute a new ELO rating.
