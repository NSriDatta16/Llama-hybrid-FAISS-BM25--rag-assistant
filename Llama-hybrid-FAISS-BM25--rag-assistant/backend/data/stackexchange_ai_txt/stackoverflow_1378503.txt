In online/public BETA releases, I think of the google services as a good example. If you have a good finance way, you can host your BETA environments and the final one in different machines/servers/services. Later in time you just need to forward the requests to the servers you want on the current application state. If you only have one machine or little resources, I think the best way is always to decouple the application as much as you can, in a way that you can update some module without crashing the application (without losing sessions, transaction/action flows). . Other thing you need to keep in mind is if this web site will be used by world clients (require registration) and some kind of DATA production, in this case I think the best way is always to share the same data storage (database) in the BETA and Final Release.
