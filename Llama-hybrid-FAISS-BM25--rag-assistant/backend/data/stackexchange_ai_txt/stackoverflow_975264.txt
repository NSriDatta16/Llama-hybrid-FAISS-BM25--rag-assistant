How do I set an HTML class attribute in Markdown?

If I have some Markdown like ## My Title A paragraph of content here. code_line(1); // a code comment class MoreCode { } and more text to follow... How can I set a class on the block that's generated in the middle there? I want to have it output code_line(1); // a code comment class More Code { } But I can't seem to set it. I do not have control over the Markdown code being run, only over the content.
