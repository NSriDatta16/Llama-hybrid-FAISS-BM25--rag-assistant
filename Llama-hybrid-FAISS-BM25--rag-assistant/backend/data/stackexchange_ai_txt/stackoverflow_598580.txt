User-specific privileges. I myself had been trying to work it into that-- some of the new (and at least at the time, undocumented) features (from newforms-admin) make it actually possible. Depending on how fine you want the control to be, though, you can end up getting very, very deep into the Django/admin internals. Just because you can doesn't mean you should-- it's easier and less fragile to do so with a custom admin app.
