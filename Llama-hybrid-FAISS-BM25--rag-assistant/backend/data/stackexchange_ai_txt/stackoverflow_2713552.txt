Design documentation belongs in a design document. Why not have a project folder with subfolders for drawings, manuals, source, example data files, test cases, wish lists, change logs, etc. I'm not saying that each document type needs a separate directory, but things should be organized logically. Time to open the external file is not an issue next to the time wasted to make the ASCII art, and how quickly it falls apart when someone uses a different editor or font.
