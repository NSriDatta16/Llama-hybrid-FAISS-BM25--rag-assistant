An alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder

Does anyone know of an alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder? It feels pretty clunky, after working with VS2008 and Eclipse. If not, has anyone successfully worked with this language outside the IDE? I'm not against using a simple text editor, but I find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the Powerbuilder editor. To date, the only tools I have had any success with are: PowerGen, for builds (with NUnit and CruiseControl.NET) ConTEXT, which has syntax highlighting for Powerbuilder PBL Peeper, which has some interesting features not present in the IDE EDIT: I added a bounty to draw some wider attention to the question. It would be a very nice thing to have, if it exists. EDIT: Well that was disappointing. The bounty apparently did not cause even 1 new person to look at the question.
