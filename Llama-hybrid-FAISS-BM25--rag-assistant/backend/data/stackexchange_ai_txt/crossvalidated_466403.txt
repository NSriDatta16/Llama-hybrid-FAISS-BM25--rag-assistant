Why do heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors in logistic regression?

I am following a course on R. At the moment, we are working with logistic regression. The basic form we are taught is this one: model This makes perfectly sense to me. However, then we are being recommended to use the following to get coefficients and heteroscedasticity-robust inference: model_rob This confuses me bit. Reading about vcovHC is states that it creates a "heteroskedasticity-consistent estimation". Why would you do this when doing logistic regression? I taught it did not assume homoscedasticity? Also, I am not sure what the coeftest does?
