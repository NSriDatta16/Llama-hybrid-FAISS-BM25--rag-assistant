A few points: It doesn't matter that the distribution of the response is skewed. What matters is the distribution of the residuals. It also doesn't necessarily matter that the response is strictly positive. Think about the distribution of height among, say, male students in a university. This is a typical example where we would expect a normal distribution even though height very clearly must be strictly positive and indeed very small values are basically impossible. Another problem here is that you only have four groups for the factor FY . This is definitely insufficient in my opinion. You are asking the software to estimate a variance for a normally distributed variable from only 4 observations, so this should be a fixed effect, not random. If you really want to treat it as random then a Bayesian approach would be more appropriate. I would suggest starting from scratch with a simple linear model: lm(rAi ~ meanW * Pairing + meanW * Costructure + Caste + YF, data = mydata) and inspect the usual residual plots. If these are way off then think about transformations you could apply to make the residuals plausibly normal and homoskedastic. If this doesn't lead anywhere, then think about a gamma or beta GLM
