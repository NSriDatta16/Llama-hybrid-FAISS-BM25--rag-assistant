If I roll a die 25 times what is the probability that the mean outcome is greater than 4?

Consider a problem: You take a fair die to a party and announce that you will roll it 25 times. You will record each outcome and at the end average the 25 outcomes together to get their arithmetical mean. You offer a bet: The player puts down \$1. If mean exceeds 4, you will give him $21 back, but otherwise, he loses his dollar. Is this a good bet for the player? (Use Central limit theorem, CTL). I tried to solve it. Please check whether it is true:
