You can access the main class' stage property the same way you do it for any DisplayObject on the stage: Use this.stage . So just this should be enough: var sp:Sprite = new Sprite(); stage.addChild(sp); You could then pass the sprite and the main class' stage as a parameter, the way you did - but I would recommend creating a subclass Draggable extends Sprite and instantiate the whole thing using new Draggable() instead. The new object will automatically have its own reference to stage as soon as it is added to the display list, and limitingFunc could be a member of Draggable, as well. Also, you can use the startDrag() and stopDrag() methods, no need to implement your own: You can specify a Rectangle as a parameter to startDrag() to limit the permitted movement.
