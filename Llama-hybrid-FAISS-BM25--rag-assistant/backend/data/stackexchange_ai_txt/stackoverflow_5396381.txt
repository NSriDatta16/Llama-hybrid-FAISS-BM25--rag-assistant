getting git branches of a certain age

My organization is using git branching extensively. As a result, we have produced over 2000 branches in the past year. We are now trying to adopt a strategy for cleaning up all the old branches that are of some given age. I know how to delete branches, but I can't find a straightforward way to list all of the branches with heads of a given age. The plan is to set up a cron that periodically deletes all branches of a given age, except those that are on some list. Has anyone tried anything like this before?
