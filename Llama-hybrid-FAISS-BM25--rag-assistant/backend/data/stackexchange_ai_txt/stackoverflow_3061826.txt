Just combine RenderCapability.Tier and HwndTarget.RenderMode together and you'll get what you're looking for: RenderCapability.Tier tells you what the current graphic card supports HwndTarget.RenderMode tells you whether WPF will actually use the GPU or not RenderCapability.Tier changes and fires TierChanged any time the Direct3D surface switches to a new video card (such as a window being dragged between monitors or switching the display to a new monitor). HwndTarget.RenderMode is only changed by user code but has no notification mechanism for when it changes. If you only set it in one place you can simply notify from there, otherwise you might need to use a timer to check it periodically. Basically if HwndTarget.RenderMode==RenderMode.Default and RenderCapability.Tier is high enough you have hardware acceleration.
