Just to address the question in the title "Why do we use hypothesis tests instead of just letting people do bayesian updates?" directly... The reason is that Baysian probability was seen as having a subjective basis that was undesirable a-priori and scientists/statisticians wanted to put things on a more objective basis. There are two problems with this (i) Bayesianism isn't necessarily subjective (c.f. Jaynes) and (ii) frequentistm does not eliminate the subjectivity or the need for prior knowledge - ISTR that Fisher wrote that the significance level for an NHST should depend on the nature of the problem. So often the subjective elements of an NHST are simply "swept under the carpet". There is also the point that the Bayesian method often involves bespoke integration problems, which is beyond many user's mathematical skills, and frequentist procedures are often easily implemented (without a sound understanding of the underlying framework), which is also one of the reasons why pseudo-Fisherian NHSTs proliferate. So a lot of it is historical context.
