Integrate gmail in asp.net web application

I am using asp.net 3.5 with C#. I want to integrate gmail into my site, just like any widget so that, people can login there and can access their gmail account. Actually gmail is blocked in my organisation & I want to access it via proxy that I can integrate in my website. Thanks a billion.
