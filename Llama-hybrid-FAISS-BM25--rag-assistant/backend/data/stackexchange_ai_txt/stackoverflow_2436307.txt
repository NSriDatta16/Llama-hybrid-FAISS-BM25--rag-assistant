dynamic dashboard interface

I want to create an interface similar to the following in Silverlight. http://demos6.dundas.com/Silverlight/ I need to create a dashboard where different elements can be re-arranged using Silverlight. The dashboard elements can be different usercontrols that in turn may contain charts, guages, grids...... The user should be able to dynamically add and remove dashboard elements. The user should also be able to use drag and drop to reposition the dashboard elements. If there are some code samples to get me started, that will be great as we are just starting out on some Silverlight development. Thanks, Pratik
