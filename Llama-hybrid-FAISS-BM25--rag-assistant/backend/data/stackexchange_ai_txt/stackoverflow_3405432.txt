The use vars pragma predeclares global variable name at compile time. The variable is undefined unless you assign any value to it. Since you print it before the assignment, you rightfully get an empty string. BTW, this pragma is obsolete. From perldoc vars : NOTE: For variables in the current package, the functionality provided by this pragma has been superseded by "our" declarations, available in Perl v5.6.0 or later. See "our" in perlfunc.
