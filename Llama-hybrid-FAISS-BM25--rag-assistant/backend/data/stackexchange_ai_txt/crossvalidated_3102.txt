My understanding is that your sample size is 200 observations for each running length (i.e. the sample size is such that doubling the number of observations has a non trivial effect on accuracy). Denote $y_1$ the 100 meters series ($y_2$ the 400 meters series). I suggest pooling both series unto $y$ and adding a dummy $l_i=I(i\in y_1)$ (where $I()$ is the indicator function) and performing an isotonic regression of $\log(y)$ on $date$ and the dummies ($l$ as well as the $z$ controling for injuries, running style ect....). Because of the $\log()$ transformation on the left hand side, the value of the coefficient of $l$ can be understood as the average percentage increase in running time, al else equal, due to running a 4 time longer length. The doubling of sample size will improve accuracy since you have in effect only added a single parameter to the model. Also, re-reading my previous answer, i noticed i had linked to the wrong article. By the same author, the correct reference is 'Bayesian Isotonic Regression and Trend Analysis', B. Neelon, D. B. Dunson (the previous link was to the version of there approach adapted to the case of binary dependant variable). A non gated version of the article is here
