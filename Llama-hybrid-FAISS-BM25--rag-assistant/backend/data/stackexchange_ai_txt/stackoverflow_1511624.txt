I have been using Summary, which is paid for software, for years, and love it. The cost of updates is getting to me, and paying for an update to just get user agent string updates out of the deal is getting bothersome. Not that there are not other fixes, I just tend to not need them. Anyone care to share if they have used Summary compared to analog?
