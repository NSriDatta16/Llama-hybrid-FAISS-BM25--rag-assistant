American Football Statistical Analysis Offense Breakdown: Bayesian? Poisson?

I have asked around my local network, but no one seems to be able to point me in the right direction. I was a High School football coach for about 10 years, but now I am self employed and am doing some analytical work for some local football teams. Anyway, in football when breaking down an opposing teams offense, you have a bunch of data. What I think is happening is that the opposing coach is calling plays to the right and left in almost 50/50 split, you can see it in the data. I want to be able to compare the other teams decision with a truly random data set. So, if the coach calls three Right plays in a row, how does this compare to his decisions in the past AND how likely is he to call either right or left on the next play. I was told it had to do with some Bayesian statistics, but I am not sure. Here is some example data of a recent breakdown I did last season: Example Data Set
