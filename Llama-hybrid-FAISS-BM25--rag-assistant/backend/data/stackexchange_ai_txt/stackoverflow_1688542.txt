I am using eclipse for developing code in Java, Python and PHP. I was using Ganymede to do all this, until I wanted to upgrade to Galileo. The upgrade was quite simple. These are the steps I followed: Back up the workspace somewhere where uninstalling Ganymede won't affect it. Copy all the software sites onto a text file and backup that text file with the workspace. Uninstall Ganymede. Install Galileo. In my case, the workspace had not been altered, and I pointed Galileo to the same workspace, so all my projects and files were still there. Update all the plugins and extensions in Galileo from the update sites noted in the text file. At this point I had some trouble because of outdated versions of plugins / incompatibility issues of plugins with Ganymede and Galileo. However, some minimal Googling helped me fix these issues. Galileo was one of the cleanest and most straightforward installs I have ever done and I never had to mess around with eclipse.ini
