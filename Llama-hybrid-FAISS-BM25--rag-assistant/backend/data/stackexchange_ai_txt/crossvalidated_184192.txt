How to choose classification model when number of observations in one class dominate the other?

My dataset is about sales in a department store, I have sales from previous years as my predictors, and I want to predict if a customer will or will not purchase this year. I used random forest first, and here's the result of my confusion matrix: The model is good at predicting 0s, but did a poor job predicting 1s. My guess is that this is because we have 25 times as many 0s as 1s in the response variables, thus, even if the model predict 0 for all observations, the error rate would still less than 4%. I also tried taking out variables that might lead to multicollineary. And because my predictors are highly right-skewed, I also tried to use log/sqrt/reciprocal transformation, but none of those works. Thus, I am wondering what kind of model, or what is the general approach when the number of one class outrun the number of the other class in response variables? Any idea/comment/suggestion is appreciated
