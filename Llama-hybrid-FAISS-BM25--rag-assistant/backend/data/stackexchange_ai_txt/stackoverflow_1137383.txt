Windows Forms Textbox - fade-in/fade-out background color

I want to validate the user's input and I want to inform him/her about validation error with changing background color of a standard Windows Forms TextBox control. But instead of changing color immediately I would like to use a color fading effect. Is there any simple way to do it ? Edit: I also have access to Infragistics controls, I'm not sure if it makes any difference.
