Implementing the Chow test in R: interpretation problems

I was looking for something online, when I found this clear paragraph: https://bookdown.org/ccolonescu/RPoE4/indvars.html#comparing-two-regressions-the-chow-test It's short and very easy to read. The example arrives to the conclusion that the 2 models, mod5 and mo6, are equivalent, since the p-value is very high the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Now I am pretty confused about the models we should use according to the possible results of this test. Accept H0 --> use model 5 Reject H0 --> use model 6 Or something like that? Accept H0 --> use model use model 6
