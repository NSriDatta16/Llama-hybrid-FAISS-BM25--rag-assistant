Compiling content without XNA

I have a Content Project for an XNA game, but I'm embedding the game inside a WinForm so I'm not actually using the Microsoft.XNA.Framework.Game class. How can I make the Content project build with the WinForm's project? I tried adding it as a reference, but the Project isn't listed to be added. To make it clear, I have two projects in my solution: KinectGraphics XNARenderContent How can I make XNARenderContent build along with my KinectGraphics' project?
