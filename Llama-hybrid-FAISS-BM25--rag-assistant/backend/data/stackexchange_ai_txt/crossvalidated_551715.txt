Your data contains weekly seasonality, as you have spikes every 7th day in your ACF. Probably you are selling more on a certain weekday than on others? Therefore ARMA-Modelling is not suitable. I propose the following: As a first try, aggregate your data on a weekly basis and use an ARMA Model on that data. If you need a daily forecast, use a more elaborate method that can deal with seasonality, such as SARIMA from the ASTSA package or use the Prophet package . Note that you also have yearly seasonality. Btw, "stationary" means that the mean of a time series is independent of the time, and the autocorrelation only depends on the lag. Your time series is non-stationary, even after differentiating, as the autocorrelation of today with yesterday depends on whether today is a "spiky day" or not.
