Hypertable is an implementation of concepts in Google's BigTable . Namely a column-oriented DB which has properties of being highly denormalized which means it doesn't need joins. Memcached is an in-memory caching layer which acts like a distributed hashtable , keeping your app from having to hit the actual DB. Both lend themselves well to being distributed and work well with MapReduce style topologies but they serve different purposes. Memcached/DHT is going to serve to speed access to data in memory while HyperTable/BigTable are actual mechanisms for permanent data storage on disk.
