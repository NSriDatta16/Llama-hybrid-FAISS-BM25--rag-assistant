Spatial organisation of a group of blocks on a grid

I have a grid of cells (empty at beginning), and a collection of blocks which are rectangles or squares whose size are a multiple of a cell (for example, a block might be 2 cells by 3 cells). I won't know all the blocks in advance, but will have to place them as they arrive. In case anyone's wondering, this has to do with placing a bunch of smaller bitmaps on a large one, where all the bitmaps's sizes are a multiple of 32. I've been thinking that I could simply iterate through the grid, looking for a place to fit the block, and if I find a place, put it there. I could also have a quadtree that keeps tracks of which chunks of the grid are occupied, so I don't have to iterate through already allocated cells much. I've tried googling for examples and solutions, but since English is not my native language, I've had trouble formulating what I want to search for. So my question is what algorithms and data structures are used for this kinds of problems?
