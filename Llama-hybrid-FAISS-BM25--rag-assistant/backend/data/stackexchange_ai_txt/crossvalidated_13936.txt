Can we compare correlations between groups by comparing regression slopes?

In this question they ask how to compare Pearson r for two independent groups (such as males vs females). Reply and comments suggested two ways: Use Fisher's well-known formula using "z-tranformation" of r; Use comparison of slopes (regression coefficients). The latter could be easily performed just via a saturated linear model: $Y = a + bX + cG + dXG$, where $X$ and $Y$ are the correlated variables and $G$ is a dummy (0 vs 1) variable indicating the two groups. The magnitude of $d$ (the interaction term coefficient) is exactly the difference in coefficient $b$ after model $Y = a + bX$ conducted in two groups individually, and its ($d$'s) significance is thus the test of difference in slope between the groups. Now, slope or regression coef. isn't yet a correlation coef. But if we standardize $X$ and $Y$ - separately in two groups - then $d$ will be equal to the difference r in group 1 minus r in group 0 and therefore its significance will be testing the difference between the two correlations: we're testing slopes but it appeares [as if - ?] we're testing correlations. Is that I've written correct? If yes, there's left the question which is a better test of correlations - this one described or Fisher's one? For they will yield not identical results. What do you think? Later Edit: Thanking @Wolfgang for his reply I nevertheless feel I miss understanding why Fisher's test is more correct a test for r than comparison-of-slope-under-standardization approach described above. So, more answers are welcome. Thank you.
