There are several tricks you can do that can help you train a machine learning model on a underperforming PC, without paying the extra buck. 1. Baseline / Simple Models: depending on the dataset, Logistic Regression can provide fair results if the features are well engineered. 2. Train on less data: see how well the model performs on validation data by training on a smaller samples of training data, also known as plotting the learning curve (check the intuition on this Medium post) . Your model may not benefit from that extra training samples that increase the computation time. 3. Dimensionality Reduction / Feature Selection: when handling large datasets (which is not the case of IRIS), some techniques can be employed to reduce the number of features, by either converting the original dataset into smaller dimensionalities (such as the PCA ) or by removing features that seem to be statistically irrelevant (see this post ).
