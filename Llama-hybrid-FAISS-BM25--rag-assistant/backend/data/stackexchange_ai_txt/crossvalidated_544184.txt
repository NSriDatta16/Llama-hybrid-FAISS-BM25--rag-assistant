Which design one-way ANOVA or 2-way ANOVA using SPSS?

I have 2 drugs A & B with different 6 concentrations and for both drugs, at a specific concentration, the result is recorded (3 replicas), so I am confused. I have tried 2-way ANOVA but Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances was 0.005 . I have tried 1-way ANOVA in split file organized by sample, then the result was: drug A Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances was .031 , and drug B Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances was .064 . Also, I tested normality with splitting, it is normally distributed. My question is about Which design one-way ANOVA for each drug or 2-way ANOVA including both drugs using SPSS ?
