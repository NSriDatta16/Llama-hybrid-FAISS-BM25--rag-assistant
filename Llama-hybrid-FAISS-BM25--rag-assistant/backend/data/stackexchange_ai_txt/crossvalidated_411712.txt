Value of using a better normal distribution

I tried to derive this on my own, but my stats education proved too far back… (This is a problem in Bayesian decision theory – if that makes you uncomfortable, feel free to reformulate it) Let's say I have options $o_i$ with payout $u_i \sim \mathcal N(\mu_i, \sigma_i)$ . How much would I profit from reducing the variances to $\sigma_i ' = a_i \sigma_i$ . For simplicity, let's assume the values of $a_i$ are given. Example: I have 5 tasks that I can do. Either I do the one that I assume has the best return on investment straight away, or I investigate first which one is the best. Investigating has some cost attached and offers only a better estimate of the return on investment, not the exact value.
