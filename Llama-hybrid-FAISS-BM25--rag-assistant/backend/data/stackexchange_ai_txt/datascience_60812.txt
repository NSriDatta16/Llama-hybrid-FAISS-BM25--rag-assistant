Forecasting time series outside the training/test set

I am trying to predict some time series based on precedent values using LSTM. I have pretty good results when I compare the predicted time series with the test set (0,18% error) I just miss how to forecast outside the interval of data ^^' I have to admit that I used a point by point prediction method that looks like this: def predict_point_by_point(model, data): predicted = model.predict(data) predicted = np.reshape(predicted, (predicted.size)) return predicted I then, I used it to override the predict function. maybe the original function could have nailed the prediction to have a future time series? maybe the point by point isn't that bad neither? I mean; how could I predict, some precise interval of time series (3months for example) without just reffering to the test set? Example: the test set starts 01/01/2018 and ends 01/12/2018 and I want to predict 4 months from 02/12/2018 Thanks in advance for your help
