JQuery DatePicker: How to add a custom class

I need to apply a custom style to my datepicker but can't work out how to add a custom class to the datepicker. I am defining my date picker as follows: $("#From").datepicker({ showOn: 'button', buttonImage: '/Content/images/icon-calendar.gif', buttonImageOnly: true }, $.datepicker.regional['en-GB']); How do I add a custom class to the datepicker div? I know I can write: $("#ui-datepicker-div).addClass("MY_CLASS_GOES_HERE") ..but can I rely on the datepicker always having an ID of "ui-datepicker-div"?? Is their a more elegant way of doing this? Thanks in advance.
