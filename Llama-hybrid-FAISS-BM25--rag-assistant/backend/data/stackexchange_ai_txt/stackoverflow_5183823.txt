The app XXX was not installed ... because the entitlements are not valid

I'm trying to create a build for a small group of non-developer testers to do some beta testing on my App before I submit it to iTunes Connect. I have read the Developer's Guide on "Distributing Your App for Testing (you may need to be registered with Apple to read this) as well as Technical Note TN2250 on Ad Hoc distribution , and innumerable blog posts and Stack Overflow articles, but with no success thus far. Steps I've taken: (I'm running Xcode 3.2.5.) I've created a Development Provisioning Profile in the iOS Provisioning Portal, and included the devices for all the testers. I have downloaded this profile and installed it into Xcode by dragging it to the Organizer window, and I can see the profile under Development>Provisioning Profiles I've set this profile as the "Code Signing Identity>Any iOS" in both the project and target settings I've created an Entitlements.plist file, set the property list type to "iPhone Entitlements plist", deleted all rows except the "Can be debugged", and set that to unchecked I've set the "Code Signing Entitlements" to Entitlements.plist (the exact, case-sensitive name) in both the project and target settings I've "Build and Archive"'d my project From the Organizer window, I've selected my project & clicked "Share...", selected the same provisioning profile used above and saved the resulting .ipa to disk I've compressed the .ipa and the provisioning profile to a zip file and e-mailed it to my testers The testers have: Unzipped the file I sent Tried installing by just dragging the .ipa to iTunes and syncing Tried installing by first dragging the .mobileprofile to iTunes and syncing In either case, at the end of syncing, they get the dialog reading "The app [ my app name ] was not installed on the [ their device and device name ] because the entitlements are not valid." It may be worth also noting that I was able to distribute an earlier version of this same App to the same testers last Autumn without any problems and without an entitlements list. I'm not sure what has changed, other than upgrading Xcode. Can anyone provide any insight or see what I'm doing wrong? [I have also posted this on Apple's Developer forums and will re-post any solutions here.]
