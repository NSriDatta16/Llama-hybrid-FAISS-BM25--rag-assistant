This is a good question! The first thing to ask yourself is what is the purpose of carrying out clustering over this dataset? (e.g. to identify certain customer groups, by clustering them into clusters which represent how much a customer group spends on average) This will help with selecting appropriate features. In the case of identify clusters with similar average spends, then it is best to perform Exploratory Data Analysis over these features to see which ones can discriminate between average spend groups (for example), by both visualising the data over the average spend and other carrying of statistical tests over the data and the average spend groups.
