If you do not like this consequence of hypothesis testing but are not prepared to make the full leap to Bayesian methods, how about a confidence interval? Suppose you flip a coin $42078$ times and see $20913$ heads, leading to you saying that a 95% confidence interval for the probability of heads is $[0.492,0.502]$. You have not said you have seen evidence that it is in fact $\frac12$, but the evidence suggests some confidence about how close it might be to $\frac12$.
