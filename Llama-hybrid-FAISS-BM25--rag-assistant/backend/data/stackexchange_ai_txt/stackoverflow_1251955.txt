The browser sends an "Accept-Encoding" header with the types of compression that it knows how to understand. The server looks at this, along with the user-agent and decides how to encode the result. Some browsers lie about what they can understand, so this is more complex than just searching for "deflate" in the header. Technically, any HTTP/2xx response with content can be content-encoded using any of the valid content encodings (gzip, zlib, deflate, etc.), but in practice it's wasteful to apply compression to common image types because it actually makes them larger. You can definitely compress the response from dynamic PHP pages. The simplest method is to add: to the start of every PHP page. It's better to set it up through the PHP configuration, of course. There are many test pages, easily found with Google : http://www.whatsmyip.org/http_compression/ http://www.gidnetwork.com/tools/gzip-test.php http://nontroppo.org/tools/gziptest/ http://www.nibbleguru.com/tools/gzip-test.php
