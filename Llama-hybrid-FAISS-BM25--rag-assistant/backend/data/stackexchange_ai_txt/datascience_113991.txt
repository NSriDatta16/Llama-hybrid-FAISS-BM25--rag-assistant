What are the "EMA" weights included with certain pre-trained models?

I came across this machine learning model called "Stable Diffusion v1." When downloading the pre-trained weights for this model, I noticed that there's a couple of different files: sd-v1-4.ckpt sd-v1-4-full-ema.ckpt How do I know which file I want, and why does it matter? What is "full EMA" regarding weights?
