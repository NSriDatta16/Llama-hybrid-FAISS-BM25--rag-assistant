In my opinion this is very open-ended and highly model dependent. If you used an ARMA/ARIMA based model originally to tune the coefficients, then you would need to start it from scratch. If you used some kind of Bayesian structural time series you may or may not need to re-train it depending on how much data cardinality there is, because ideally Bayesian-based models (and other online learners), should progressively "learn to adapt over time". If you used one of those fancy neural network one or zero shot learners then you may not even need to technically re-train. You can just give it the observed data and "should in principle" be able to shoot forward in time again based on the changed observations in 2022.
