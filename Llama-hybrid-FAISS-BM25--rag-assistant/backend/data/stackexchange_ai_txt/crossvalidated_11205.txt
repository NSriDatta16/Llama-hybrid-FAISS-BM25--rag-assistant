Holt's or Winter-Holt's exponential smoothing methods can give negative values for purely non-negative input values because of the trend factor which acts as a kind of inertia, which can drive the time series below zero. Normal exponential smoothing doesn't have this problem, it's always smoothing inwards , it never overshoots.
