In general, that should be fine for your example, if your packages were "N.UI" and "N.Util". I've seen namespaces used in two general fashions: 1) All tiers of a system have a namespace (i.e. database, web, biz, etc.) 2) Each component has a namespace (i.e. Customer, Invoice) and tiered namespaced underneath Either way, the sub namespaces would be inter-related packages within a larger namespace, so it would be perfectly fine for you UI code to depend on your domain objects. However, while it would be fine for N.X classes to depend on classes from N, I don't think it would make much sense for classes from N to depend on classes from N.X - it sounds like you could use some reorganization in that case.
