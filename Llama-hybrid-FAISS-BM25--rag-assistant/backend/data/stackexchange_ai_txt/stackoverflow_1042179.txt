HTTP Expires header not respected by browser?

I have a situation where my (embedded) web server is sending Expires header, but the browser does not seem to respect the header setting, i.e., if I refresh the page, the browser requests the resources that are supposed to be cached. Following are the headers that are getting exchanged: https://192.168.1.180/scgi-bin/ajax/ajax.cgi GET /scgi-bin/ajax/ajax.cgi HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.180 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Cache-Control: max-age=0 HTTP/1.x 200 OK Date: Wed, 24 Jun 2009 20:26:47 GMT Server: Embedded HTTP Server. Connection: close Content-Type: text/html ---------------------------------------------------------- https://192.168.1.180/scgi-bin/ajax/static.cgi?fn=images/logo.jpg&ts=20090624201057 GET /scgi-bin/ajax/static.cgi?fn=images/logo.jpg&ts=20090624201057 HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.180 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: image/png,image/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: https://192.168.1.180/scgi-bin/ajax/ajax.cgi Cache-Control: max-age=0 HTTP/1.x 200 OK Date: Wed, 24 Jun 2009 20:26:47 GMT Server: Embedded HTTP Server. Connection: close Expires: Wed, 1 Jun 2011 20:00:00 GMT Content-Type: image/jpg ---------------------------------------------------------- The ajax.cgi returns an html page with a logo graphic (via the static.cgi script), which I'd like cached, but the browser is asking for the logo on every refresh.
