Normally you use an assembler and a linker to create an exe file. There is no magic involved. The different parts are assembled, a header and other boilerplate is added so the OS knows where the bootstrap code is located for the program and to organize the memory. The VC++ compiler does that under the hood. You might consider playing a bit on Linux as you can better see the machinery working on Unix platforms. It is fundamentally the same, but it s just difficult to look through to UI on windows.
