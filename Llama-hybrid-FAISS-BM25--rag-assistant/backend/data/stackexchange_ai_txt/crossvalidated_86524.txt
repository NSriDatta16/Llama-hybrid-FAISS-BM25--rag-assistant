Random forest for binomial data

I have data where the response is of the form (k,n) - k successes, n trials for a given subject. The covariates are just some subject-specific predictors. Is it possible to use randomForest for this? I have thought about replicating the data so that for each subject we have n lines, k of which have the y-value '1' and n-k of which have the y-value '0' - is there an alternative? This makes cross-validation pretty messy, because I want to be able to predict p=k/n for new subjects, and I think the cross-validation would have to be 'locked' so that each training set contains all the rows for a given subject, or none of them.
