Embedding Opera in Cocoa

So, I'm writing a Cocoa application that needs to be able to display web content using Opera's rendering engine. This is for a feature, not because I'm an Opera fanboi (I'm not). All I've been able to find on the subject is this press release about Adobe's use of the Opera engine . Has anyone done this? What's the API like? Are they going to want royalties, payments, an NDA, etc? Edited to add: This is for a cross-engine web debugging tool. I'm going to be using this alongside WebKit.
