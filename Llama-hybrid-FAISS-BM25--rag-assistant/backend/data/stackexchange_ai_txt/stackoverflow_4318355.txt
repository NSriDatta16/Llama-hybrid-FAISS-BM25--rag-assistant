Does the nature of your query allow you to invert it? Instead of "(join, join) union", do "(union) join"? Like: Select * from ( ) cq join ( Select * from table1 t1 union Select * from table2 t2 ) ts on cq.id=ts.id I'm not really sure if double evaluation of your complex query is actually what's wrong. But, as per your question, this would be a form of the query that would encourage SQL to only evaluate once.
