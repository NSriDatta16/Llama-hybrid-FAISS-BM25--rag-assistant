Bayes theorem is $$ p(\theta|X) = \frac{p(X|\theta)\,p(\theta)}{p(X)} $$ where, by the law of total probability , for discrete distributions $p(X) = \sum_\theta \,p(X|\theta)\,p(\theta)$ . So for the numerator, you multiply the likelihood by the prior, and for the denominator, you need to do the same for all the possible values of $\theta$ and sum them to normalize it . It gets more complicated if we're dealing with continuous variables. If $\theta$ is continuous, "all" the values of theta mean infinitely many real numbers, we can't just sum them. In such a case, we need to take the integral $$ p(X) = \int p(X|\theta)\,p(\theta)\, d\theta $$ The problem is that this is not necessarily straightforward. That is why to do this we often use approximations like Laplace approximation, variational inference, MCMC sampling (see Monte Carlo integration ), or other ways of numerically approximating the integral . Grid approximation is one of those methods. It approximates the integral with Riemann sum $$ \int p(X|\theta)\,p(\theta)\, d\theta \approx \sum_{i \in G} p(X|\theta_i)\,p(\theta_i) \, \Delta\theta_i $$ where $G$ is our grid and $\Delta\theta_i = \theta_i - \theta_{i-1}$ . Notice that in the example from the book uniform prior was used, so $\Delta\theta_i$ was constant and was dropped from the calculation. The grid is simply a set of points used to evaluate the function used for the sake of approximating the integral. The more points, the more precise the approximation is. It should also cover the range of possible values for $\theta$ , e.g. if it is a Gaussian, it should not range lower than two or three standard deviations to account for 95% or more of the possible values . Picking the grids is a separate subject in itself (how large, uniform or not, etc). Using Riemann sum intuitively makes sense, as you can think of the integral as a sum over infinitely many elements $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x_i = \int \,f(x) \,dx $$ If the concepts of integral calculus and Riemann sums are not clear to you, I highly recommend the Khan academy videos explaining them in greater detail. That said, there are many much better alternatives to grid approximation, so unless you are solving a simple, low-dimensional, problem, this is not something you should use.
