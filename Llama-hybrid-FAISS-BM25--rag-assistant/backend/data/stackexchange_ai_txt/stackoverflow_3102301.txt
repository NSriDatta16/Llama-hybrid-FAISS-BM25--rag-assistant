Embed an image nested inline within an HTML page for IE7+

Is there a way for nesting an image in an HTML page *inline* in IE7? I can't use external resource, all because of a particular server configuration (it's a web dispatcher in maintenance mode that redirects all requests to a single .html page). So I can't afford using the classical embedding by using the following: When looking for a solution, I found these: Using inline SVG within an XHTML file # => I can't use XHTML extension in my case the page has the .html extension (and I can't change it) Using base64 encoding # => It works pretty well with Firefox & Chrome, but not in IE7 None of which seem to be working in my configuration. The more I seek the less I hope. Any ideas?
