Implement C# Generic Timeout

I am looking for good ideas for implementing a generic way to have a single line (or anonymous delegate) of code execute with a timeout. TemperamentalClass tc = new TemperamentalClass(); tc.DoSomething(); // normally runs in 30 sec. Want to error at 1 min I'm looking for a solution that can elegantly be implemented in many places where my code interacts with temperamental code (that I can't change). In addition, I would like to have the offending "timed out" code stopped from executing further if possible.
