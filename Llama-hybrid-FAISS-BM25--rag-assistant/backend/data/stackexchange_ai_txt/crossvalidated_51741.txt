Random Forest or other machine learning techniques with paired samples

I am trying to select features from paired samples and was wondering if there are methods out there that adapt random Forest or other machine learning algorithms to paired samples i.e. if randomForest was a machine learning analog to a standard FDR-corrected ANOVA approach, what would be the machine learning analog be of a paired t-test between two categories?
