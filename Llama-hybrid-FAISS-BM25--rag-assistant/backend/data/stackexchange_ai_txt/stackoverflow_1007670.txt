Luckily for you, you can abstract away the need to be concerned with which back-end database you use to store your data. Technologies such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and OLEDB (Object Linking and Embedding, Database) allow you to limit your concern for the backend datastore to the task of crafting your connection string. In your example, the connection string says, "I'm going to connect to a SQL Server CE database via its OLEDB provider, and it's physically located over on D:/... Within the code, you use standard OLEDB mechanisms to access and manage the database. Because of this abstraction, you can use OLEDB providers for SQL Server, Oracle, XML, Access or comma delimited text files as your backing store if you wish, and the only change you need to make to your code is the connection string. Your choice then should be to pick the database that you have the tools and know-how to set up and manage initially.
