Rails 3 does not render HTML as markup

I submitted a form, to create single row in SQL database table, as a blog entry: This is a paragraph. And the result, when I query it out for display, via Rails's ActiveRecord, it rendered like this, : This is a paragraph. and here's the code, when I view source in browser: &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; How do I solve this? Or I just have to convert the and > by Javascript? Thank you :)
