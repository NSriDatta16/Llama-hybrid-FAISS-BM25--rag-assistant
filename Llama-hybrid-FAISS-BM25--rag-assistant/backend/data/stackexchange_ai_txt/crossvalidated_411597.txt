Logistic regression demonstration with one preditor

I got an assignment from which nothing is clear for me. I have the following logistic regression formula: and what I am struggling in understanding how to do is to the to prove that this equation is true for binary logistic regression with one continuous predictor. What should I do? Should I plug inside some values and solve it? Moreover, I don't understand what does pie stands for, what does it denotate?
