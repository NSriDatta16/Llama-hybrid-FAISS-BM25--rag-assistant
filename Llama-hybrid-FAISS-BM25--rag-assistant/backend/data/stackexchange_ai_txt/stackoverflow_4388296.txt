camera quality in Flash

I have this simple code to access the webcam: var camera = Camera.getCamera(); camera.setLoopback(true); camera.setQuality( 0, 100 ); if (camera != null){ myVid.attachCamera(camera); } The quality of the video is extremely bad, with big compression fragments. I am using a built-in webcam as test, so I don't expect too much. But what I see is not normal for my webcam. So how do I set the quality of the video? I cannot see any difference in quality if I remove the setQuality call.
