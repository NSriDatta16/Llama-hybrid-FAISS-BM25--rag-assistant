It's common in Python to use exception handling to decide which code path to take; inspecting the exact type of an object (with isinstance()) to decide what to do with it is discouraged. For example, say that what you want to do is, if it's a string, print it in "title case", and if it's an object, you want to call a particular method on it. So: try: # is it an object with a particular method? lists[listname][0].particularMethod() except AttributeError: # no, it doesn't have particularMethod(), # so we expect it to be a string; print it in title case print lists[listname][0].title()
