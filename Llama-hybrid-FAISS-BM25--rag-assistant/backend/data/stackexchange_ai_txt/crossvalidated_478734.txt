Should I use highly skewed features in my model?

Many of my features are highly skewed as you can see below in the figure. Should I be using such skewed data for modeling purposes? If I cannot, then is there any way to integrate such features in my model? Since most of my features have a distribution plot like this, can I make a good machine learning model from such data?
