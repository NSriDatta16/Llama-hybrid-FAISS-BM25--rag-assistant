The answer depends on the type of inference you wish to make. Do you wish to make statements about each ROI or do you want to quantify the distribution of effect over ROIs? If you wish to infer on each ROI, multiplicity correction is the way to go. The fact that you do not need to define the exact dependence between the test statistics at each ROI isan generally an advantage. Unless, of course, you still lack power. Assuming you are able to quantify the exact dependence between ROIs, you can look for a rejection region that controls the FDR at the desired level using simulation (deriving it analytically might be rather hard). If you are pleased with your findings using "vanilla" Benjamini-Hochberg, I would use it as is. On the other hand, if you wish to infer over all ROIs, there is a point in assuming the distribution of effects over ROIs. In which case you could indeed compute the mean activation over ROIs and the conditional distribution of the effect given the observed. Personally, I find this sort of analysis hard to interpret. Especially since the ROIs are defined only within your study (as such, they are random entities). I do suspect that en empirical Bayesian (such as Gelman) might disagree with me on this point.
