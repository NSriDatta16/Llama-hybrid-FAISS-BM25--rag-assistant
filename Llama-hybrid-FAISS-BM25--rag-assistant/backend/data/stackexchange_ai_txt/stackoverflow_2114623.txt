Suppressing linebreak when entering environment

In the following LaTeX fragment, how can I suppress the newline that is automatically generated between XXX and YYY after entering the align* environment. XXX \begin{minipage}{t}{0.1in} YYY \begin{align*} ZZZ... \end{align*} \end{minipage} yields XXX YYY ZZZ... But I want XXX YYY ZZZ... Perhaps align* is simply the wrong environment, but I couldn't find an alternative that provides similar functionality, yet doesn't introduce a linebreak.
