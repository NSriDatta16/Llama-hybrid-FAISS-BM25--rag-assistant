You don't need any SQL license to run the client tools (Management Studio, Profiler, etc). If your organization has a copy of the installation media for Developer, Standard, or Enterprise, you can install the client tools on your local machine under the same license. If you're working solo, I would recommend purchasing SQL Developer edition, it's only $50.
