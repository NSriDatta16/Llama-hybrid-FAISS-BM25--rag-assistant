Standard error of the success rate of a collection of different binomial distributions (whose success rates need to be estimated)

I would like to estimate the correct percentage of tweets that are written in a particular language from a collection of followers of a given account . The goal is to compare different accounts to check which one has the highest percentage of tweets in a specific language among its followers. Since I cannot download all follower's tweets for a given account, I need to estimate the population mean out of the sample I am able to get. But I am pretty confused about the right way to do it. Let's say I have 50 tweets from each of 1000 random followers' accounts. Therefore, there is uncertainty both in estimating $p_i$ for each follower and in estimating the global average. I consider language of each tweet of a given account as a Bernoulli distribution: success if the tweet is in the goal language, failure otherwise. For each follower i, we have a binomial distribution with a particular success rate pi, that we need to estimate from the sample of 50 tweets. But the goal is to estimate the correct percentage of tweets in a specific language for all followers of the account : the average follower. Initially, I made the assumption of considering the array of size n = 50 * 1000 (i.e, num_tweets_per_follower * num_followers_tracked) as a binomial sample of size n. I can easily compute the fraction of success tweets and then standard error just by using the formula $SE = \sqrt{(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/N)}$ But I think this assumption is wrong. Each sample of 50 tweets per follower $i$ with different $p_i$ has an error I am not actually considering. Should I use a $\hat{p}_i$ for each follower? But then, how should I compute the global estimate ? As you can see it is not clear to me whether the solution is very simple or actually more articulated.
