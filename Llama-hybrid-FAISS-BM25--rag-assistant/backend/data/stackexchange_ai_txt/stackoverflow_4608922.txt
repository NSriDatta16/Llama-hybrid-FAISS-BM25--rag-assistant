Mobile web apps - Is this the right approach?

I need to build a cross platform mobile app (iphone, android, etc). The app is for a company like a cellular operator (Tmobile, ATT). The app needs to do the following: Show previous bills (cached so that it does not have to download everytime) Need an internet connection to download newer bills, view recent data, etc. Can I build a mobile web app to handle this? I understand that there is offline storage and iPhone has good support for web apps (full screen, good icons, offline, etc). Will a web app be the best approach to take as the app requires to be online? The app will not be used by lots of people, just customers of the website who don't want to use an existing website. We are all web developers and a mobile web app looks like the best way to approach this.
