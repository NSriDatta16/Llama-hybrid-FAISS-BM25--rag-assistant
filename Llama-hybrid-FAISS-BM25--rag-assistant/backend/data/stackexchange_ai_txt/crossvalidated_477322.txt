Non-significant logistic regression coefficient in simulated data

I'm new in all this R and stats thing... I'm trying to understand de "logic" of the binary logistic regression but I'm stuck with a surprising result. I have created a data frame with simulated data with n=10,000 and two variables: and independent variable ("prop") which is a proportion (from 0.1 to 0.5), and "VD" a binary dependent variable (1,0). The data frame is created so that all cases with "prop" 0.3 have a value 1 in VD. 50% of the cases with prop=0.3 have VD=1 and 50% VD=0. Ok, this looks like a data frame with the ideal structure for a very good result in a binary logistic regression... since the two variables are made to be correlated, I expected the logistic regression coefficient of "prop" to be statistically significant...So, if you run the model, Nagelkerke R2 is high as expected... but I cannot understand why the logistic regression coefficient is non-significant Here is the code: library(DescTools) library(ggplot2) data 2000 & data$ID 4000 & data$ID 6000 & data$ID 8000 & data$ID 0.3] 4000 & data$ID 5000 & data$ID Thanks in advance!
