I would say yes. I followed the link you posted and noticed that the first paragraph said Some of the the Perf4J tools require additional dependencies (for example, the custom log4j appenders require the log4j jar to also be in your classpath). That suggests to me that not having log4j in your classpath is a normal thing.
