Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 are equal in binary classification and I don't know why

I have a binary classification problem which in the test set, the number of data in both classes are equal (the test number of class 0 and class 1 are equal). Since we know that the number of samples from every class are equal, I use median on the probabilities of logistic regression output (probabilities of samples for class 1) and map probabilities to zero and one and then calculate f1-micro and f1-macro. But they are absolutely equal and I don't know is it odd or not and why is this happening. I would be grateful if you have any idea what's going on and what is wrong.
