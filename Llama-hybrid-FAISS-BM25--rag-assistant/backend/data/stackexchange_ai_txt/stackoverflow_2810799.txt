I have used Telerik data grid in the past and it seemed to have the least hastles for me compared to others I have had a look at. However I can pretty much put my money on it that someone else would feel that Telerik's control wasn't great and that Infragistics was better etc. - so I suggest that you maybe download the trials and test them for your specific scenario.
