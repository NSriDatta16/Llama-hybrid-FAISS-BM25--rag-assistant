I can see three possible approaches for dealing with this. 1. The "just focus on one side" approach If you believe that the two measures are really closely related, and can produce a reasonably high correlation coefficient to back this up, then you could use data from only one side (whichever side has the least missing data). I've done work in the past using eye-tracking where we only analyse movements with the right eye (right tends to be the dominant one). For most of the phenomena I've studied, I've had no reason to believe that the left eye will do anything substantively different, so I don't analyse that data (in reality, I don't collect it... Binocular eye-tracking is a hassle!) 2. The "just take an average and live with some missing data" approach This is relatively similar to the first approach really. If you don't think the two sides are going to be all that different then just average them. Yes, the averaging will add a little noise, but if the effect you're interested in is robust enough then it probably won't make a difference. 3. The "take a sledgehammer to crack a nut" approach Use PCA/FA to reduce the two sides, which we believe are going to be very closely related, to a single score. This score will probably not be on the same scale as the raw measurements, so you lose some interpretability. As with 2, you'll lose some cases where there's missing data, but, really, I'm not sure there's an approach out there (short of imputation) where you won't suffer this problem. Personally, as long as the correlation coefficient was good then I'd probably just do 1.
