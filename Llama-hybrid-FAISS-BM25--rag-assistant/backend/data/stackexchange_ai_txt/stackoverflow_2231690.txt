Turn off eclipse confirm move

One of the most annoying things about the new eclipse version is that it makes moving files rather hard. By default on the left of your screen you will see the file system explorer (where it lists your workspace projects). I used to be able to drag folders/files around - but now each time I do that it pops up a window and asks me to select the destination folder. This is a problem because I already dropped the file to where I wanted it (often several levels away) and having to re-navigate in the pop-up to that same folder is a pain. Can I disable the "Move Resources" confirm window somehow?
