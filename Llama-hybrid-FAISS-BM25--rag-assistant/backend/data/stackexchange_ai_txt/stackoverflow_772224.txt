How does your class know that this is a freestore pointer? E.g. what speaks against the following code? DummyChannel d; in = &d; out = &d; This is an entirely sensible piece of code but your destructor will crash when trying to delete either of the pointers. Long story short: reclaiming resources is the job of whoever has allocated the resources in the first place. If your class gets passed a pointer, the class cannot know and does not care about deallocation. This is strictly the responsability of the caller. Elegant ways to solve this dilemma without making the client to a lot of work are smart pointers, as mentioned before.
