Machine Learning Framework that accepts Inputs with missing data and Outputs predicted values for that missing data

Imagine a dataset of with values for 10 features for 100,000 samples. Some feature values are missing at random from some samples. I would like to use this incomplete data set to train a single model with the following characteristics: As input, this model will accept data from 1 sample that is incomplete for at least one of any of the features. As output, the model will predict scores (and provide measures of certainty in regards to those predictions) for all missing values. Thanks in advance for your insights and ideas!
