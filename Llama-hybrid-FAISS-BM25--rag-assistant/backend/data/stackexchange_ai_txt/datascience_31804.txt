Sklearn PCA with zero components example

I'm simply trying to repeat a benchmark from the sklearn's docs . The unclear part is: n_components = np.arange(0, n_features, 5) . They are applying a PCA transform with 0 components! Can somebody, please, explain, what's the mathematical meaning of this transform?
