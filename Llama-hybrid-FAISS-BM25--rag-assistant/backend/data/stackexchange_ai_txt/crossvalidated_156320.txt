Mixed Linear Model - REML approach AI or FS algorithm

I am trying to see if there is a situation where Fisher scoring algorithm would be better than Average Information algorithm. I know that Average information algorithm is more efficient for large data sets because of the data computational issues Fisher Scoring algorithm has with big data sets but if your data set were reasonably sized to use Fisher scoring algorithm does it hold some sort of advantage over Average information algorithm?
