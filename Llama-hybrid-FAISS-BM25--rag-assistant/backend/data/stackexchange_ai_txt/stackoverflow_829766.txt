not sure what your issue with SSMS is. Maybe you dont have permission? Unless your sa you need to be a member of the SQLAgentOperatorRole in MSDB? If you can still run queries then look at the sysjobs and sysjobsteps tables in the MSDB database, this has all the properties You can use the sp_update_job to modify the job
