What you want to do doesn't seem straightforward from a matrix point of view so doing in a "pure numpy" manner is likely unfeasible. I'd probably break it up into 2 or 3 operations: Pull out row F, transpose it and average it with column B. Take the first value of the row F you pulled out and average it with the first value of row B. Pull out column F and average it with column B.
