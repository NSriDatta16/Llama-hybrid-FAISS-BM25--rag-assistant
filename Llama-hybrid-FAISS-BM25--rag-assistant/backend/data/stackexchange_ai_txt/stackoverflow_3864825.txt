Let M and N be your two points and O the origin. We will find P, the middle of MN segment: OP = OM + ON / 2. You compute the magnitude of OP: |OP|. Your needed point will be R with OR = OP / |OP| = OM + ON / 2|OP|. Good luck with computing this. I don't know Delphi, but maybe it allows direct vector operations. If not do it with analytic geometry. The coordinates for the middle point are the arithmetic averages of the coordinates of M and N (you said you can calculate those). To get the magnitude of |OP| you extract the square root of x^2+y^2+z^2. To get R you just divide the coordinates of P to the magnitude calculated just now. You handle separately when M and N are opposing (P==O).
