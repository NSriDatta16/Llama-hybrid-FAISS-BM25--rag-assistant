You can use HTML5 Offline storage to store your app code and data.However you still need a simple bootstrapper js code to load the app (basically eval) from offline storage. You can also store small images (base64 encoded) in offline storage. The downside is you have to roll your own versioning and update local storage if there's a newer version of the app.
