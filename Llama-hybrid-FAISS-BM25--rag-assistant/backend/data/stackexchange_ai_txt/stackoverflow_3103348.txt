Empty WPF ListBox as Drop Target

I have a ListBox that is a drop target of items from other sources. Everything is working fine except in a particularly situation. When the ListBox has no Items I can only drop in the border of ListBox (I have a trigger so the Border is visible when dragging). To give a bigger drop area I set the MinHeight of the ListBox to 25. When dragging, the Border reflects the MinHeight of the ListBox but the area is not considered a target. What is probably happening is that the target is considered to be the background because there is no Item in the ListBox . Here is the code for the ListBox : If I set the ItemPanel to: I can drop items in the empty ListBox but then the items are presented on top of each other, instead of as a list. Any thoughts on this?
