It's more a functional or organizational problem than a technical one. No tool will automatically guess how to migrate data from one schema to another one. You'd better learn how to write stored procedure in order to migrate your data. You'll probably need to disable constraints, create temporary table and columns, copy lots of data, and then delete the temporary tables and columns and re-enable constraints to have migrate your data. Once in maintenance mode, every new feature that modifies the schema should also come with the script allowing to migrate from the current schema and data in production to the new one.
