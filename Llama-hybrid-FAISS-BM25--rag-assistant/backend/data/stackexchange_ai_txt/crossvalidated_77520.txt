Right, one way to think of $w$ is as a vector representing a separating hyperplane. However, in order to understand its usefulness, you better consider it a regularization value: $||w||$ is a measure for the complexity of the model represented by the SVM. The idea is to find a model that on one hand accurately models the training data, and on the other hand has a minimal complexity, because simple models tend to generalize better. So the optimization term of the SVM has two components, with $||w||$ representing the complexity.
