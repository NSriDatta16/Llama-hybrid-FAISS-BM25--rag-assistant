I consulted this question with a few people and the recommendation was to go with Search for products via image and text similarity separately and then look at combined similarity (we could just sum/average the two similarity scores) as it should be the easiest and most flexible option. My initial idea should most likely work as well but it is less flexible. Hopefully this helps somebody in the future.
