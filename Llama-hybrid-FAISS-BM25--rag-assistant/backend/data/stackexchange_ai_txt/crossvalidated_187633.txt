Clustering of binary/nominal variables in one sample

Assume that a medical school classifies its active, full-time students according to their free time activities. By distributing simple questionnaires individuals have to answer whether or not they're keen on a particular habit (Yes/No) and the following comprises only a small piece of the final results; I've been searching (rather unsuccessfully) for a way to group positive responses that appear to have a statistically significant correlation eg. students who attend business workshops are also likely to be interested in programming too. That might extend to three or four variables depending on the factors provided by the method. Factor analysis rings some bells, but the data are purely nominal and there's no outcome in the form of a scale or ordinal variable. Any ideas ? So far I've produced the following resourceful conclusions in SPSS; Frequency tables. Gives a general idea about the distribution. Correlation matrix. Special attention is given to positive values that fall below the 0.05 (*) and 0.001 (**) levels of significance respectively. Ordinal Regression. Provides a probability table, indicating the chances of two positive responses in two different variables to be found the same.
