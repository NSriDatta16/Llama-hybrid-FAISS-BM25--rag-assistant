Chances are, the page is being built from a number of fragments and processes that don't attempt to maintain valid HTML. With a mixture of knowledge, luck and testing it's possible to build web pages that work fine, even though they're nowhere near valid. How does it affect SEO? Probably surprisingly little. Search engine parsers have to do the same thing that browsers do, otherwise authors would exploit differences to serve one content to browsers and different content to search engines. The success of a search engine depends on matching the search string to pages that the display the content that the user was looking for. So long as the page displays correctly, whether the page uses valid markup or not is of no interest to the user, and therefore of no interest to the search engine. In terms of general best practices, it scores 0.
