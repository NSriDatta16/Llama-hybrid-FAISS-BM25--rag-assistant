Features for Neural Networks

I try to understand my time series data. I have temperature values measured with a sampling rate of 10.000 values / 1 second. So I measure in 1 second 10.000 different temperature values. So I have a vector x with length 10.000. This I repeat with certain time intervals. Since the vectors are big, I want to create subsequences of them for my model later to predict. But now I do not understand if I have to see the whole time series data with a shape (number of samples, vector x length) or (number of samples*vector x length, 1) to move on.
