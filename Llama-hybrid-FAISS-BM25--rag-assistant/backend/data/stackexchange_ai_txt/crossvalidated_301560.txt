Calculating Expected Range of Scores

I have a clinical test that 35 healthy people took twice. Each test consisted of 6 trials. We measure a subject's perception of vertical. I am trying to calculate the test/retest reliability for this clinical test, but due to the nature of the test the average is not a useful measure. The test uses positive and negative numbers, they have biological importance. 0 is "normal", so a person scoring -6,+6 will look as normal as someone scoring -1,+1. An absolute average removes data as side matters-- someone answering -6,+6 will then look the same as someone scoring +6,+6 (much more consistent). Someone answering +6 multiple times, while way off traditional vertical, is fundamentally different from someone answering +6 then -6 (their perception is not constant). I would like to calculate, regardless of the average score, the expected variation in response in a healthy individual, so I can say someone who scores 0+/-6 is abnormal compared to someone who scores 0+/-1, for example. Does anyone have any idea how to go about this? I have each trial for each subject and overall averages / standard deviations for all 6 trials for both tests for each subject.
