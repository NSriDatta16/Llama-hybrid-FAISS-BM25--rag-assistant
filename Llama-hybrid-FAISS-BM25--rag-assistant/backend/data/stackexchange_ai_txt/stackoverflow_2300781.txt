I agree with Greg D, there is a lot of "stuff" coming. MS with the new .Net4 framework and their Axum project. The problem that I see with all those approaches is that they get extremely complicated and that skills, knowledge and experience in the areas of distributed/parallel/distributed computing is rather "limited". I don't write that to offend anybody, but I reckon that universities and educators in general have to pay more attention to these topics. But, what I think and hope is that the mainstream awareness that MS creates with implementing many of these ideas, Axum, CCR&DSS, Asynchronous Agents Library etc. and the general trend/need towards multi-core / cloud computer system, that we will see more soon :)
