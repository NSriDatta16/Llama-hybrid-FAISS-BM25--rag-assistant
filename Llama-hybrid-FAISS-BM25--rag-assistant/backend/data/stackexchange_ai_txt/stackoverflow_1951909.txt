Grouping a list of of entities which has a sublist in c#

I have a set of Entities which basically has this structure. {Stats Name=" (en)" TotalResources="10" ..} {DayStats Date="2009-12-10" TotalResources="5"} {DayStats Date="2009-12-11" TotalResources="5"} {Stats} {Stats Name=" (us)" TotalResources="10" ..} {DayStats Date="2009-12-10" TotalResources="5"} {DayStats Date="2009-12-11" TotalResources="5"} {Stats} ... What I want to extract from this set is a new set entities (or entity in the example above) where the first level has been grouped by the (ignoring the country label) where all/some of the properties has been summmed together, including the the sublist of {DayStas} on a per day basis. So the result set of the example would look something like this: {Stats Name=" " TotalResources="20" ..} {DayStats Date="2009-12-10" TotalResources="10"} {DayStats Date="2009-12-11" TotalResources="10"} {Stats} ... So my question is: Is it possible to do this in a more elegant way in LINQ rather than the vanilla "loop-trhough-each-entity-and-compare"-way? And I want the set to contain the same type of entities as the original set ({Stats}, {DayStats}), your answer doesn't need to include code for that, I can probably work that out by myself. Just letting you know in case you need to take that into account.
