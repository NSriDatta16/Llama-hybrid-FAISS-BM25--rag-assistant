This is the most elegant I can think of on short notice. ArrayList generatePrimes(int numberToGenerate) { ArrayList rez = new ArrayList(); rez.Add(2); rez.Add(3); for(int i = 5; rez.Count Hope this helps to give you an idea. I'm sure this can be optimised, however it should give you an idea how your version could be made more elegant. EDIT: As noted in the comments this algorithm indeed returns wrong values for numberToGenerate
