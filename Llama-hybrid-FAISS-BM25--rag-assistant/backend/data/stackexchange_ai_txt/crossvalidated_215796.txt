How to check if the optimization algorithm produces the correct result [SVM]

I have implemented the gradient decent algorithm for the SVM (linear case). I would like to check if my implementation is correct. I see 3 possible solutions: Write some unit tests for the code Check the results using another tool (python libs) Check if the estimated parameters have the expected distribution. For the latter approach, I would like to know if there are any papers that provide some hint on the confidence interval of the estimated parameters of the SVM (it would be great for the case when kernel trick is applied).
