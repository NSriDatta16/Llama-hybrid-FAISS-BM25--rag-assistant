The way to automatically instantiate a class in Xcode /Cocoa is, strangely enough, through Interface Builder (IB). Open your MainMenu.xib in IB and make sure you can see the Document window (menu Window >> Document). Now, in the Library expand Cocoa >> Objects & Controllers >> Controllers. You'll see a number of controller, among them a blue cube. Drag this blue cube to your MainMenu.xib document window. You'll see that File's Owner and Font Manager sport the same blue cubes as their logo. Now, select your blue cube and in the Inspector choose the Identitiy panel (letter i on blue circle). Set the Class to the class you created before in Xcode, and save MainMenu.xib. When you run your program, your class will automatically be instantiated. Your starting point from where you can start calling other methods or instantiating other objects is - (void)awakeFromNib { NSLog(@"%@ I'm alive!", [self class]); }
