The simple answer is that regression is just another way of saying curve-fitting, and presuming that the fitting is to be done to a polynomial, then there needs to be the same number of data points as coefficients (or terms) of the fitted polynomial for there to be an exact fitting (or interpolation), and that it is impossible to so such an exact fitting if there are more data points (at least for a non-degenerate case). Think of trying to fit a line to data points. If there are 2 points, then there is an exact line containing them - but for 3 points, unless there is the degenerate case of the points being collinear, there can only be a "best fit" regression to the points in which the sum of the squares of the error (i.e., the difference between the data point and where the fitting function is for the input variable) is minimized (and which has an elegant solution using critical values for a multivariate function for the coefficients).
