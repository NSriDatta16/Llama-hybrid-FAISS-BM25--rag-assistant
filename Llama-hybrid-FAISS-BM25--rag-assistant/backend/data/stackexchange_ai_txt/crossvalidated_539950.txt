How do Bayesians interpret unobservable model parameters?

This is designed as a canonical question relating closely to some other questions asked on this site (see e.g., here , here , here ). In this canonical question I will try to get to the crux of the issue more clearly than in other posted questions. Suppose we have a simple IID Bayesian model, with an observable (infinite) sequence of data $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,x_2,x_3,...)$ and we observe a sample of $n$ values. If we denote the sampling density for a single observation as $f_\theta$ (given a parameter $\theta$ ) and the prior as $\pi$ then we have the Bayesian model: $$\begin{align} x_1,...,x_n | \theta &\sim \text{IID } f_\theta, \\[6pt] \theta &\sim \pi. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ If we have this kind of simple IID model, what is the proper interpretation of the parameter $\theta$ ? Does it correspond to anything in an operational sense, or is it just a model parameter existing in the hypothetical mathematical ether?
