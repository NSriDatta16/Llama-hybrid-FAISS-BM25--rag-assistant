PowerShell idiom to test for existence of a command?

I'd like a function to test for the existence of a command (cmdlet, function, alias, etc.) in PowerShell. It should behave like this: PS C:\> Test-Command ls True PS C:\> Test-Command lss False I have a function that works but strikes me as neither idiomatic nor elegant. Is there a more posh way to do this: function Test-Command( [string] $CommandName ) { $ret = $false try { $ret = @(Get-Command $CommandName -ErrorAction Stop).length -gt 0 } catch { # do nothing } return $ret } Bonus question: Python : pythonic :: PowerShell : ? I'd say posh but is there something else in common use?
