Note the caveat in the manual at http://uk.php.net/error_reporting : Most of E_STRICT errors are evaluated at the compile time thus such errors are not reported in the file where error_reporting is enhanced to include E_STRICT errors (and vice versa). If your underlying system is configured to report E_STRICT errors, these may be output before your code is even considered. Don't forget, error_reporting/ini_set are runtime evaluations, and anything performed in a "before-run" phase will not see their effects. Based on your comment that your error is... Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_VARIABLE, expecting ',' or ';' in /usr/home/REDACTED/public_html/dev.php on line 11 Then the same general concept applies. Your code is never run, as it is syntactically invalid (you forgot a ';'). Therefore, your change of error reporting is never encountered. Fixing this requires a change of the system level error reporting. For example, on Apache you may be able to place... php_value error_reporting 0 in a .htaccess file to suppress them all, but this is system configuration dependent. Pragmatically, don't write files with syntax errors :)
