Differentiate between a scroll caused by .scrollLeft and a user trying to scroll in an HTML page

I have a scrollbar that has to follow some timeline. It is being constantly scrolled with .scrollLeft using setInterval . I still want the user to be able to naturally take control and just drag the scrollbar away. If I can detect the user did that, I would just turn off the setInterval timer and leave the control to the user until he explicitly turns the auto scroll back on. Is there a way to differentiate the user scroll event, from the scroll created by .scrollLeft ?
