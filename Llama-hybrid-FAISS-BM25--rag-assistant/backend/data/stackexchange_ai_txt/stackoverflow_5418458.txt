Using gl_FragCoord to create a hole in a quad

I am learning WebGL, and would like to do the following: Create a 3D quad with a square hole in it using a fragment shader. It looks like I need to set gl_FragColor based on gl_FragCoord appropriately. So should I: a) Convert gl_FragCoord from window coordinates to model coordinates, do the appropriate geometry check, and set color. OR b) Somehow pass the hole information from the vertex shader to the fragment shader. Maybe use a texture coordinate. I am not clear on this part. I am fuzzy about implementing either of the above, so I'd appreaciate some coding hints on either. My background is that of an OpenGL old timer who has not kept up with the new shading language paradigm, and is now trying to catch up... Edit (27/03/2011): I have been able to successfully implement the above based on the tex coord hint. I've written up this example at the link below: Quads with holes - example
