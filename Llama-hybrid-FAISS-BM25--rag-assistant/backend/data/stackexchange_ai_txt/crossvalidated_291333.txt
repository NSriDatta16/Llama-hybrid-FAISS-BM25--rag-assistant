Imputing missing values in Python using RandomForest model

I know some strategies of imputing the missing data, for example, using filling with zeros, using mean, median or the most frequent values. So what I don't quite understand till this point-how can the missing values be predicted in Python using some machine learning techniques such as RandomForestRegressor? What steps should be taken to imputing the values by predicting them with RandomForest (or maybe other models, such knn, for example).
