how to predict new cases using the neuralnet package

Using RGUI. I have a dataset called Data. The response variable that I'm interested in is contained in the first column of Data . I have training sets of Data called DataTrain and DataTest . With DataTrain I trained a neural network model (called DataNN ) using the package and function neuralnet . > DataNN = neuralnet(DataTrain[,1] ~ DataTrain[,2] + DataTrain[,3], hidden = 1, data = DataTrain) Does anyone know how to create a prediction on this model using the test set ( DataTest )? Normally (for other models) I would use predict() for this. E.g. > DataPred = predict(DataNN, DataTest) But when doing this for neuralnet I get: > DataPred = predict(DataNN, DataTest) Error in UseMethod("predict") : no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "nn" Obviously I can't run predict() on this model. Does anyone know of any alternatives? I've checked the help for neuralnet and I found a method called prediction in the page 12 of the documentation . I don't think it's what I want at all though, or at least I don't know how to apply it to my Data . Any help would be appreciated (if there is any solution to this at all).
