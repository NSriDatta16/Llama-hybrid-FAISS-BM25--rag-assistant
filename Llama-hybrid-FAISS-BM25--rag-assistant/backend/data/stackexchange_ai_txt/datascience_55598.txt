Why we add a constant value column in our DataFrame sometimes?

Currently I'm learning data science and I'm in the beginners stage. I have seen many times we add a "constant" column in our data frame with all row cells of that column having value 1. I need to know why we do so. And also what will happen if we don't use it. Thank you.
