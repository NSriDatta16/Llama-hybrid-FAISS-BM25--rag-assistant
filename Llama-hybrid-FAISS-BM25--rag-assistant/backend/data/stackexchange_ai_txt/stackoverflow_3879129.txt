Select & Copy firefox content to clipboard in C or C++

I found a few questions similar to mine but none of the answers are satisfactory and they are a few years old. So I am hoping that perhaps some progress has been made on that front since then. What I am interested in is the ability to access the content of an active Firefox window and copy it to the clipboard -- using C or C++ code. In Internet Explorer I can use COM's IHTMLDocument2 to access the broswer's contents DOM . Is there something similar in Firefox? If so, how do I do that? BTW, my current (ugly) workaround is to mimic Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C by sending virtual keystrokes, but this is not a truly robust and elegant solution. Ideas, tips, insight, knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Note: To further clarify the challenge, I would like to note that I am not interested in a Javascript based or Flash based solution. Instead, I am interested in a C/C++ solution, even if it is limited to the Microsoft Windows platform only.
