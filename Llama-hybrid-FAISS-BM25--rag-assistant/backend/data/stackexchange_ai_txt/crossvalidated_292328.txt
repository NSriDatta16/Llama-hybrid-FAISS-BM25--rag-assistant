What is the choice of statistical test when the dependent variable is binary but independent variable is multinomial

What is the choice of statistical test if you have a binary dependent variable but a multinomial independent variable? Example will be Outcome - Good skin vs Bad skin Skin Care product - A vs B vs C vs D If we use the chi-squared test it is possible to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups but are we able to generate odds ratios? My understanding for logistic regression is that you can analyse binary dependent variables with multiple independent variables which are either binary or continuous? But in this case I only have only 1 independent variable with multiple categories
