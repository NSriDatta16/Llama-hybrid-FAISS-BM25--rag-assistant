I assume you refer to "weak stationarity", namely, constant unconditional mean, constant unconditional variance, and unconditional covariance that if it is not zero, it depends on the distance between two elements of the time series, and not on the time index. More over, who said that dummy variables are not-stationary? The binary dummy variable (Bernoulli r.v.) you refer too will be non-stationary only if you specify a priori that its probability of occurring in each time period is not constant (its specific realization to which you refer, does not affect this a priori assumption). If, therefore, the dummy variable is (or is assumed) also $I(0)$ then the variable $Y_t = X_tD_t$ is a continuous transformation of two stationary r.v's - and stationarity is preserved under continuous transformations - so $Y_t$ is also stationary. Now, say you are faced with a specific "time-window" and a specific realization of the dummy variable, that makes you suspect that this dummy variable does "not look like" a stationary process. Then test it for stationarity if a test is available, or at least discuss your visual suspicions and work from there. If the dummy represents something seasonal, use the tools available to deal with seasonal time series.
