How to reconstruct negative acceleration values using a simple autoencoder?

I am trying to reconstruct the acceleration values of a tri-axial accelerometer using a simple autoencoder. As acceleration values are often negative (e.g, -3.4) therefore using a ReLU activation function clips the negative values to zero and a sigmoid function gives output only in interval 0 to 1. Here is a diagram showing the autoencoder which as only 2 hidden layers and takes an input of size (1x3) (x,y, z-axis) and tries to reconstruct same values at the output layer (x^,y^,z^) what would be a good solution for this problem?
