Using Vim, isn't there a more efficient way to format LaTeX paragraphs according to this best practice?

The best practice mentioned in the title is the one suggested by Uri : When writing paragraphs, start each sentence at the beginning of a line, and if it spills over, each subsequent line is tabbed. I use gVim with Vim-LaTeX , which comes with an indent/tex.vim file, to edit LaTeX files. The way I currently implement the practice mentioned above is as follows: I :set textwidth=79 to automatically break lines before they become too long. I manually hit Enter after I finish inserting each sentence. If I'm done with revising and editing a sentence, I manually shift any spillovers using > > , prefixing it with a count if necessary. Occasionally, that last step will make one or more spillovers go over the maximum line width. In this case, I g q q the faulty line. J my way through to the end of the sentence. repeat steps 1 and 2 as necessary. As you can imagine, this can become tedious. Isn't there a more efficient way to achieve the same result? Ultimately, I want to be able to write the sentences without worrying about their format, and then use g q a p , or g q i p , to automatically produce the result that I currently produce manually. To do that, I suspect that I will need to write a formatexpr of my own, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I have found a number of plugins, Latex Text Formatter and Text (Especially LaTeX) Formatter , and a tip , but none of them seem to suit my needs, and I'm not sure how to modify them to do so.
