IIUC, The problem here is that the webserver process might not like extra long-running threads, it might kill/spawn server processes as demand go up and down, etc etc. You're probably better of by communicating to an external service process for this type of processing, instead of embedding it in in the webserver's wsgi/fastcgi process. If the only thing you're sending over is the filepath, it ought to be pretty easy to write that service app.
