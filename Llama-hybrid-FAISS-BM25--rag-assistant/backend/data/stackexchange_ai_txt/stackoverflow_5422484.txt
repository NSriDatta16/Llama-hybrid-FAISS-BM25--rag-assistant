Django - sort a previously filtered list

I'm a real noob to programming and I want to make sure that this approach is solid enough. I want to filter search results for my model and then allow users to sort the results according to various variables. My thought was to attach the filter variables as GET parameters to the sort link (which would then have unique sort variables). I've looked on other sites and it seems as though there is probably a more elegant solution (they don't contain huge querystrings). Is there a better approach?
