In ccTouchesBegan , use the same code as what you've got in ccTouchesMoved to determine the angle, then move to that angle using CCRotateTo . You will need some handling of the user moving his finger while CCRotateTo is active, perhaps stopping the current action and kicking off another one to move to the new angle.
