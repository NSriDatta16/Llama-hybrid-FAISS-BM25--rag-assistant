This might not be as accurate as you want, but if you could be sure that only text markups such as headings links and paragraphs where being used, something like: $i = 0; while($i ', $i) + 4; } echo substr( $string, 0, strpos($string, ' ', $i)+4); It would mean you would have variable string lengths but they would be as close as possible to the nearest paragraph.
