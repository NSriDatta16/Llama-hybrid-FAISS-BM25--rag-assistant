Upgrading from Access 2003 to Access 2007 and SQL Server

I am maintaining a pretty large Access 2003 project with a MDB data file on the server and linked tables. The plan is to upgrade to Access 2007 (or even 2010) and SQL Server as the data storage. As this is a two-step plan, which of these steps is best done first? Does it make a difference if I first upgrade to 2007, or should I link to SQL first?
