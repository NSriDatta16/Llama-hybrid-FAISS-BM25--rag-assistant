Clamp MovieClip to only be draggable inside stage?

I have a MovieClip that I want the user to be able to drag inside the stage, but I don't want it to be able to move outside the stage. Currently I'm using this._parent.startDrag(); to allow the MC to be dragged, but I don't know how to stop it from being dragged outside the frame.
