I would use "fully Bayesian" to mean that any nuissance parameters had been marginalised from the analysis, rather than optimised (e.g. MAP estimates). For example a Gaussian process model, with hyper-parameters tuned to maximise the marginal likelihood would be Bayesian, but only partially so, whereas if the hyper-parameters defining the covariance function were integrated out using a hyper-prior, that would be fully Bayesian.
