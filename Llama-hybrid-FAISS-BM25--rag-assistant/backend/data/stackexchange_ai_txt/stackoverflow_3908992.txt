As long as the original messages and the responses have the same structure (set of attributes, or columns) then you can use the single table approach. It has the advantage that you can search over original messages and responses with a single query. The set of original messages can be found where pid = selfid and the responses where pid <> selfid. If it's important to be able to see the original and response messages separately (without knowledge of the storage mechanism) you can encapsulate the above conditions in two VIEWs: OriginalMessages and Responses. If the originals and responses have different attributes (for instance, if you want the original to allow links to URLs, photos, etc) you might consider using two separate tables. But even there, I'd probably argue for the one table structure with a separate, extender table for the additional attributes. That means you don't have to store often-empty columns for those original messages that don't use the extended attributes, and you can later easily add the extended attributes to the response messages as well (if desired).
