How to draw a line between 2 elements using JQuery and refreshing that line?

I am using JQuery-UI draggables and droppables to clone elements onto a div. What is the best way to draw a line between elements on a page using JQuery. What is the best way to refresh lines on the page? I will have multiple lines on the page and only want to update a particular line rather than refresh every line.
