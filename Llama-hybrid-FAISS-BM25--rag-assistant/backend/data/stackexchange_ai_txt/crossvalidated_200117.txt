That the data are moving averages means they are time series. As noted by @laterow, if you want to find "real" relationships with a target variable that doesn't capitalize on spurious trends in the information (unit roots, cointegration, nonzero means, autocorrelation, etc.), you would be wise to analyze residuals output from some "white noise" process. In other words, getting these 4,000 variables into an HAC (heteroscedastic and autocorrelation consistent) framework should be your next step before running glmnet, lasso or any other variable reduction method.
