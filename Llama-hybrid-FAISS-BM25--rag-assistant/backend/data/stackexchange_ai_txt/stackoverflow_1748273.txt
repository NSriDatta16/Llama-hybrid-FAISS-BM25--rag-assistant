The organisation already has a contract with AlertSite which we have now extended to cover the additional webapps. It seems reasonable for basic availability monitoring and reporting. It sends a request to the application at predefined intervals from a number of different locations, and immediately sends a notification if it does not receive a correct reply from the login page. I have set it up so that each day it sends a report by email detailing the uptime for the previous day.
