SVMs are outdated for time series classification - Citation needed

I'm looking for a strong publication I can cite to prove that SVMs perform worse for time series classification tasks in comparison to other methods (such as ANNs, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines, etc...). I found several posts indicating or justifying that SVMs are not popular nowadays , that deep learning rendered kernel methods obsolete or that SVMs have severe drawbacks (such as parameter sensitivity or the need to conduct a grid search for the parameters). However, I could not find a source explicitly stating that SVMs perform worse for time series classification tasks than more recent models.
