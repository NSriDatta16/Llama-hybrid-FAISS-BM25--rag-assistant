Is clustering subsequences of time-series still meaningless with unsupervised learning?

In the paper " Clustering of Time Series Subsequences Is Meaningless " Keoh et al. claim that breaking a time-series into chunks (sometimes called lags) of fixed-size using the rolling window method provides meaningless clustering results. From what I understand of the paper, this is because the lags are more similar to each-other than to the clusters found. Does this problem still apply if an unsupervised method of dimension-reduction, such as tSNE , before the clustering is performed?
