You can get at a usercontrol's child controls using myUserControlInstance.FindControl("ChildControlID") but you probably don't want to. This is rather fragile, due to the lack of compile-time checking. If the control was renamed (or refactored into another control for reuse),this would start failing at runtime. I recommend either a property on the user control that exposes the checkbox, or enough properties/methods on the user control to set the checkbox's state. You may also want to consider why the parents need to know about the innards of the usercontrol. I usually treat a control's children as analogous to private/protected methods on a class. Hide the implementation details, so you can change them if required!
