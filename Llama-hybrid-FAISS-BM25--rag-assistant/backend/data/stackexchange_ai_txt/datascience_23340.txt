Your question is not properly framed. Deep learning optimizes a function that maps input variables to output variables. Your input variables are the pictures (specifically, the combination of RGB pixel values). What are your output variables? That is, what specifically do you want the network to predict? If you are trying to get the network to simply rate how aesthetically pleasing an image is on a scale of 1-10, that is fairly straightforward: simply have a large sample of human volunteers rate the images on this scale, and train the network to predict those ratings. If done properly, the network will then be able to give a fairly sophisticated prediction of whether or not a given image is aesthetically pleasing. If you are trying to get the network to create aesthetically pleasing images, you have a long road ahead of you - this is an unsolved problem and an area of open research. Check out this post . If you are trying to train a neural network to understand what qualities make an image aesthetically by detecting underlying patterns and communicating them to humans, you are probably using the wrong tool.
