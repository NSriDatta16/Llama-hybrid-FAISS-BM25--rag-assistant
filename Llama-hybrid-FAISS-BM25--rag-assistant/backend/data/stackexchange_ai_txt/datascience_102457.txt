Additionally to the previous answer, I would go for POS tagging features (features that count the number of verbs, adverbs, nouns, etc contained in your review), since you are trying to distinguish between two kind of reviews, it sounds reasonable to think that something that talks about the function of the product has for example more adjetives. Of course you can add those as additional features to your BagOfWords vectorizer. Additionally if you can try different ngrams combinations it might work, from my experience when using those basic embedding, adding bigrams helps a lot Finally I would go for a non linear kernel, you may check via CV if it works better than a model with a linear one.
