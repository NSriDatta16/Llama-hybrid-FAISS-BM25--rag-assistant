iphone SDK:Can't diagonal scrolling in a image array?

I have a large size image. To save the memory so I don't want to load the whole picture at one time, so I divide the image into 9 pictures like an 3X3 array 036 147 258 I can scroll the smaller image pieces from one image to an adjacent image, like from(1,1) to (1,2)(1,3), or from(1,1) to (2,1)(3,1), but I can't scroll it from (1,1) to (2,2) or(3,3). It seems I can only scroll the pic up from side to side or up and down, but not diagonally. If I scroll diagonally, then all image looks messed up, like this: 360 471 582 How can I scroll diagonally, and/or skip sections while scrolling? Here is my code: .h CGPoint first; IBOutlet UIScrollView *scr; NSMutableArray *ary; int x_total; int y_total; BOOL move; BOOL inside; IBOutlet UIView *mapview; int x_begin; int y_begin; int x_times; int y_times; Cut images move = NO; inside = NO; x_times = 0; y_total = 0; ary = [NSMutableArray new]; for (int i = 0; i and the method to control finger touch and move - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"touchesBegan"); //Set Animation [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; //Trigger start //UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; NSSet *teaches = [event allTouches]; for (UITouch *myTouch in teaches){ //first = [myTouch previousLocationInView:self.view]; CGPoint currentTouchPosition = [myTouch previousLocationInView:mapview]; //first = [myTouch previousLocationInView:mapview]; NSLog(@"currentTouchPosition x is %f",currentTouchPosition.x); NSLog(@"currentTouchPosition y is %f",currentTouchPosition.y); NSLog(@"mapview.frame.origin.x is %d",mapview.frame.origin.x); NSLog(@"mapview.frame.origin.y is %d",mapview.frame.origin.y); if ((currentTouchPosition.x > 0 && currentTouchPosition.x 0 && currentTouchPosition.y Touch Moved - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ //Touch Trigger NSSet *teaches = [event allTouches]; for (UITouch *myTouch in teaches){ CGPoint currentTouchPosition = [myTouch previousLocationInView:mapview]; NSLog(@"currentTouchPosition.x is %d ",currentTouchPosition.x); if (inside) { if ((currentTouchPosition.x > 0 && currentTouchPosition.x 0 && currentTouchPosition.y = 64/2) { y_times ++; for (int i = 0; i = 64/2) { x_times ++; for (int i = 0; i = 64) { x_times ++; for (int i = 3; i = 64) { x_times ++; for (int i = 6; i = 64/2) { x_times ++; for (int i = 0; i = 64) { x_times ++; for (int i = 3; i = 64) { x_times ++; for (int i = 6; i 0 && currentTouchPosition.x 0 && currentTouchPosition.y
