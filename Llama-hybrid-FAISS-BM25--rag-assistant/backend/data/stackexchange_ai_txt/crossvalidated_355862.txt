How well does my logistic regression model fit?

I performed a logistic regression to my dataset which has 6 variables. I got output from R as the following: I used the step() function in R to select the best model, and above is my best model. The AIC value is so high! Could someone help me to explain how well does my model fit based on this information on the figure? If additional information is needed, what do I need to calculate? BTW, how to calculate $R^2$ for my model? Thanks,
