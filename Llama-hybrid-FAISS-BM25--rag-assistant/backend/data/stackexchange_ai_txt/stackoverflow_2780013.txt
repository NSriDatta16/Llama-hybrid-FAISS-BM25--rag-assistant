Is anyone on your team copying files and folders around manually so that the revision info in the .svn folders is no longer correct? As derobert describes in an answer to a related question, overwriting other users changes is possible if you manually copy your modified files into a newly updated SVN folder: Here is how the nuke/copy procedure can revert other people's changes: Checkout, get r1; Modify foo.c, giving r1 + changes; Someone else checks in a change to foo.c (you don't know they've done this, of course, and the normal way of checking is broken for you), foo.c in the repo is now r2; You now nuke your repository except foo.c (r1 + changes); You do a checkout, get foo.c r2. You replace foo.c with your copy (r1 + changes). Subversion, however, is unaware of this, and thinks you based your changes on r2, not r1. Checkin, foo.c is now r3, which has just lost the other person's changes in r2.
