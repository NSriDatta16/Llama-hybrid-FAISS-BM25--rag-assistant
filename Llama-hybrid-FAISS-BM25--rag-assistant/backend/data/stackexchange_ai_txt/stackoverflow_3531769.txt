sql query and php script to show average questions per day

In my questions table, each post is timestamped (MM-DD-YYYY). Each individual post has a QuestionID, and a response has both a QuestionID and ResponseID. I want to run a php script that will grab all questions (all posts where ResponseID = null) and display how many questions per day. I'd like it to be avg questions per day since June 1, 2010. Your help is much appreciated. Thank you!
