If I understand you correct you don't want to have a dummy div element only to be able to place inside a html fragment received from ajax. In this case you can build you element directly and insert befor or after a real DOM element which you already have. The code can looks like following jQuery('#select_id').remove(); // if not exists this line makes nothing var htmlfragment = ' '; htmlfragment += x; // place data with select element received from ajax call htmlfragment += ' '; jQuery(htmlfragment).insertBefore("#myexistingelement");
