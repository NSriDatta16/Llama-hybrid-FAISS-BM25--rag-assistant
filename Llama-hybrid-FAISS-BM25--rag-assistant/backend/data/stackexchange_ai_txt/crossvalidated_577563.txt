Is this a meaningful method to determine spread around mean?

I have student ratings of 123 schools across the US. They represent 100% of this type of school across the US. The ratings are on the scale Poor, Fair, Good, and Superb, and I have the number and percentage of students giving each rating at each school. Since this is ordinal data, I am not comfortable calculating a mean score on the rating scale for each school, and therefore I am not able to get a standard deviation to indicate spread around such a mean. Would the following make sense / provide meaningful information? Students infrequently rate their school as Poor, so I could determine when a school deviates from other schools because that school has, relatively speaking, a substantially higher percentage of students rating it as Poor. I could use the percentage of Poor ratings for each school to calculate an average percentage of Poor ratings across the 123 schools, and then calculate a standard deviation based on that. In theory, that should tell me how much schools vary in their percent of Poor ratings. But is that a legitimate, defensible calculation of a standard deviation that provides meaningful information about spread? Or would a different approach make more sense / be more defensible?
