Is there a dataset that can predict duration to complete a task using task description?

I am working on a problem where the task is to predict how long will it take to complete a given task using just the description as a feature set. The description is something like "pick up X and place at y". Currently what I have done is vectorized the descriptions using tensorflow feature embedding: a categorical column with vocabulary list, and an embedding column with dimensions set to 100. Since the dataset I have only consists of 6 rows, and my client wants to see if the same model can be trained on a larger dataset I am looking for something similar. Therefore, please advise, also am I doing this the right way ?.
