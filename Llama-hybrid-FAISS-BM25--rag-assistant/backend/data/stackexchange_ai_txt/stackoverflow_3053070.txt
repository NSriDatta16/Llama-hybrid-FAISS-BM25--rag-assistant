I think that it depends on how you feel comfortable. Personally, I prefer the Passive View implementation but, if I got it right, both Passive View and Supervising Controller prescribe that the View should be updated by the Presenter (apart from simple data-binding in the case of Supervising Controller). Another exception could be if your view is a web form and you want to update it client side via javascript. You could have a look at the following: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647543.aspx where you can find the paragraph: View Updates "When the model is updated, the view also has to be updated to reflect the changes. View updates can be handled in several ways. The Model-View-Presenter variants, Passive View and Supervising Controller, specify different approaches to implementing view updates. In Passive View, the presenter updates the view to reflect changes in the model. The interaction with the model is handled exclusively by the presenter; the view is not aware of changes in the model. In Supervising Controller, the view interacts directly with the model to perform simple data-binding that can be defined declaratively, without presenter intervention. The presenter updates the model; it manipulates the state of the view only in cases where complex UI logic that cannot be specified declaratively is required. Examples of complex UI logic might include changing the color of a control or dynamically hiding/showing controls." Hope it is helpful Matteo
