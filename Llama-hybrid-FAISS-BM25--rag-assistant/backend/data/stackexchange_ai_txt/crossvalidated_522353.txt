Interpreting constant in regression with an interaction term

In a regression model with a single categorical exposure and no interaction term of the form: $y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1$ the $\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the result in the reference group. So for a linear regression it would be the mean value of the outcome variable where the exposure = 0 (baseline group), for a logistic regression the log odds in the baseline group, and for a Poisson regression the count in the baseline group, or rate where you've included log time as an additional exposure. My question is what happens to the interpretation of the $\beta_0$ when we add an interaction term with another covariate: $y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_1x_2$ I was told regarding Poisson that we can't interpret the constant once there's an interaction - because an interaction term doesn't have a meaningful "baseline". Is that true in linear and logistic regression as well? This doesn't totally make sense to me since if the values of the covariates are all 0, the interaction term would fall out as well as all of the independent effect terms, leaving us just the $\beta_0$ as the predicted value in the baseline group?
