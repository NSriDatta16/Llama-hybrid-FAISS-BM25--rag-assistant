Test to rank methods by AUCs on various benchmarks

Suppose I have N methods and M benchmarks. I have an AUC statistic (and some other similar statistics) for each combination of method with benchmark. What test should I use to test if one method is better than the rest? I have seen some authors do pairwise comparisons using a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test but I would prefer to test all methods at once. In any case I'm not sure the assumptions for the one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test hold. If the average AUC for each benchmark varies widely can you say the samples are from the same population? Also I'm not sure the distribution of the AUCs is symmetric around the median. Any advice would be welcome.
