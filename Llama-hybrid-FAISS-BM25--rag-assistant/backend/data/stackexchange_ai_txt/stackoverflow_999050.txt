How to get all subsets of an array?

Given an array: [dog, cat, mouse] what is the most elegant way to create: [,,] [,,mouse] [,cat,] [,cat,mouse] [dog,,] [dog,,mouse] [dog,cat,] [dog,cat,mouse] I need this to work for any sized array. This is essentially a binary counter, where array indices represent bits. This presumably lets me use some bitwise operation to count, but I can't see a nice way of translating this to array indices though.
