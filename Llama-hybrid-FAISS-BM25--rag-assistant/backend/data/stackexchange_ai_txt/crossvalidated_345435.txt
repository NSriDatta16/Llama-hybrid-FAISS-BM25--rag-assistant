The term “random effect” does not mean “something that is random”, it refers to something in a hierarchical or mixed model that is not a population-level effect. Suppose I have some adorable newborn Great Dane puppies, and I feed them a special puppy supplement that I think will help them grow larger than they would without the supplement. I give different puppies different doses, and I measure their weights when they’re grown and fit a model of “weight = intercept + beta*supplement_dose”. My intercept here is the expected weight of a puppy who was not given the supplement, and my slope is “the increase in weight per unit dose of supplement”. Now, suppose I do this with multiple litters of Great Dane puppies. Due to factors like their parents’ genetics and their mothers’ nutrition during pregnancy, some of the litters have bigger puppies than others. Littermates are more alike with each-other than with other puppies, so I no longer have independence of observations - if I fit a regular linear model here, I will calculate the variance incorrectly and my standard errors and p-values will be wrong. So I add a random effect for litter, specifically a random intercept. This means that now in addition to the model having its overall intercept (a fixed effect) each litter also gets its own separate intercept to account for the fact that some litters have bigger puppies than other litters. My fixed effect intercept is now kind of a weird averaged-across-litters expected weight of a puppy not given supplement. But since that differs by litter, I have to add the litter-specific intercept to get the expected weight of a puppy from litter #7 who was not given supplement (which may be different from the expected weight of a puppy from litter #3 who was not given supplement). The random intercept for litter #7 is “the effect of being in litter #7 on the weight of a puppy”. It has no meaning at the population level, but because it is part of the structure of my data I have to account for it or I will miscalculate the variance of other things in the model. Random intercepts aren’t the only kind of random effect. Suppose I did the same experiment again, but this time I used litters from different breeds. I have a litter of Great Danes, a few mixed-breed litters of various ancestries, and a litter of Chihuahuas. If they all gain three pounds per gram of supplement, I am going to end up with some really big Chihuahuas... more likely, I may find that while the Great Danes gain 3 pounds per gram of supplement, the Chihuahuas gain 0.25 pounds per gram of supplement, and each mixed-breed litter gains different amounts of weight too. So the slope of weight gain relative to supplement dose now also differs between litters. I can add a random effect for slope to allow slope to vary between litters like that, while still being able to look at my overall question “does the supplement make puppies bigger?” The important thing with random effects is that they’re usually something that’s meaningless at the population level. “The effect of being in litter #7 on weight of puppy.” There is never going to be another litter #7 exactly like that with exactly the same effect on puppy size again. It’s something meaningless/random that I can’t make any useful inferences about, but that I still have to account for in order to correctly model the situation.
