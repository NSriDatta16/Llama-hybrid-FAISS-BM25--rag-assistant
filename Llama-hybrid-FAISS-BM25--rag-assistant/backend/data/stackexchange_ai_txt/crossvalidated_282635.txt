Why is weak stationarity equivalent to strict stationarity only when distribution is normal?

I read that this is because the mean and variance completely specify a normal distribution. However, e.g. for a Poisson distribution the mean, variance and third moment can all be expressed with the same parameter lambda. Is this not what it means to 'completely specify' a distribution? What is an example of two Poisson distributions having the same mean, variance and different higher moments? If we treated weak stationary as if it was strict stationarity, what would happen when we try to do time series analysis?
