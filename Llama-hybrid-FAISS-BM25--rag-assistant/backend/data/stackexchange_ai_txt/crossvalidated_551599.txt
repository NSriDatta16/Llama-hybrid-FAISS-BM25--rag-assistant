I agree that confidence intervals provide a lot more for performing inference than a single p-value for a single hypothesis, but there is no reason to ditch the p-value and no reason to rely solely on bootstrap confidence intervals. The confidence interval is the set of all hypotheses that are not significant (one would fail to reject) at a specific alpha level. The confidence interval is the inversion of a hypothesis test. If one uses percentiles from a bootstrapped sampling distribution this is a crude approximate confidence interval that does not follow proper construction, but works well nevertheless particularly when the parameter estimator is approximately normally distributed. I find the confidence curve to be a great way to visualize frequentist inference. It shows p-values and confidence intervals of all levels for a parameter of interest, analogous to the Bayesian posterior. The best solution is to raise awareness and promote continuing education, rather than discarding methods. Here is a link to a great paper by Eric Gibson on the topic.
