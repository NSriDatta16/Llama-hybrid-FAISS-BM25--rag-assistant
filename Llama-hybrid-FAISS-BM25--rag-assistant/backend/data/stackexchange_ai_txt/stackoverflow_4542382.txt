I'm guessing you are talking about the Exception Handling Block? I studied it for a while, trying to find the point behind it. Admittedly I still don't really get it, but that's a professional liability. As far as I can tell, it gives IT staff some measure of control over the way exceptions are reported and dealt with. Which is relevant in an enterprisey setting where the departmental gap between the people that create exceptions (software engineers) and the people that have to deal with them (IT staff and users) can be difficult to bridge. Code crashing with an impenetrable exception message is all too common, getting them fixed with lots of middle management layers in between can be quite difficult and time-consuming. In this kind of scenario, being able to improve the diagnostic and help the user avoid to make the same mistake, instead of having to slay the enterprise dragon, makes a lot of sense.
