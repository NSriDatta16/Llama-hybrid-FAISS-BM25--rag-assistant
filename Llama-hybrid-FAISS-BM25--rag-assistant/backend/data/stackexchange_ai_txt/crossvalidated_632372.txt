Bayesian modeling opens up a vast array of possibilities. Bayesian models can more precisely reflect the data generating mechanism and prior knowledge. For example, when adjusting for a supposedly linear effect of log BMI but not wanting to fully trust that log height and low weight are optimally captured in log BMI, notice that BMI assumes the ratio of the coefficients of log weight and log height are -2. Put a prior on this ratio that is centered at -2 but allows for the possibility of other ratios. In this way youâ€™ll have excellent adjustment for height in weight while not spending a full 2 parameters on them, thus reducing mean squared errors of estimates.
