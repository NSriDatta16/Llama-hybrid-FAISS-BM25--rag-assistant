Silverlight Create draggable control over image

I want to build some GUI where an image is presented, and the user should pick nd/or adjust some points (ellipses) according to the image. Basically, like a map control, when we want to mark some points or make a route, but instead of a map, a picture must be presented. The final locations will be used for image processing. Is there a built-in silverlight functionality to do this? How should be the best way? regards
