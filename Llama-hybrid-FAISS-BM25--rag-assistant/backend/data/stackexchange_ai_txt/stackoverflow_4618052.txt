Thing is, sqlalchemy never mixes the data with your query. The query and the data are passed separately to your underlying database driver - the interpolation of data happens in your database. Sqlalchemy passes the query as you've seen in str(myquery) to the database, and the values will go in a separate tuple. You could use some approach where you interpolate the data with the query yourself (as albertov suggested below), but that's not the same thing that sqlalchemy is executing.
