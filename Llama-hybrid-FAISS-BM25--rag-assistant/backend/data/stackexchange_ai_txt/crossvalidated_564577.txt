Since no real answer came to this I will just expand on my comment above: "Balance" is a property of the dataset: there are as many positives in total as there are negatives in total. That is TP + FN = TN + FP . TP (true positives) and TN (true negatives) are properties of your classifier: they are the number of positives and negatives that it gets right. If we take TP + FN = TN + FP we have $$ \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{TP}{TP + FN} + \frac{TN}{TN + FP}\right) = \\ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{TP}{TP + FN} + \frac{TN}{TP + FN}\right) = \\ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FN}\right) = \\ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{TP + TN}{\frac{1}{2}(TP + FN + TN + FP)}\right) = \\ \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FN + TN + FP}, $$ as per the quoted text. My view, for what it's worth, is that "imbalanced data" is a fake problem produced by unwarranted focus on accuracy as a target for model selection. I encourage you to check out @Stephan Kolassa's links in the comments.
