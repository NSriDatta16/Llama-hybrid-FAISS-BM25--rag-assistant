Time series: ets() Box Cox transformation and AICc comparation

I am using ets() from the R forecast package and AICc criterion to select the best model. Suppose we have a time series denoted by y : x Is AICc from fit2 comparable with AICc fit? In other words, Does ets() make some internal transformation that provides a comparabe AICc?
