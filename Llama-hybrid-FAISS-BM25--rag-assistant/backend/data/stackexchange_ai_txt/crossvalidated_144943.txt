Ordinal responses on the Likert scale (1-5) are not quantitative, and you can't take, for example, a mean or average. There is no easily definable "distance" between a score of 4 and a score of 5, for example. You will have to look into some other types of statistics, depending on how deep you want to dig. Here is an interesting place to start, with some suggestions for ordinal or interval data: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/ Good luck!
