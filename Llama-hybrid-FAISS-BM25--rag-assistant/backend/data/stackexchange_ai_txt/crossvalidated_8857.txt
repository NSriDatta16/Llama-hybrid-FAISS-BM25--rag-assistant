Is the percentage the most raw data you have, or did you compute the percentage from some sort of binomial count data? If the latter, then you should submit the raw 1s and 0s to a logistic regression. In R, check out glm: glm( response ~ group , family = binomial ) If each individual of each group contributes multiple 1s an 0s, then use lmer from the lme4 package to model the individuals as random effects: lmer( response ~ (1|individual) + group , family = binomial ) If all you have are the percentages, then maybe consider either bootstrapping confidence interval on the group means and differences, or employ a permutation test for differences.
