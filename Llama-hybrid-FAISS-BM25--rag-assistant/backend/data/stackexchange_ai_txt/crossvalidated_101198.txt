$y = B0 + B1*x1 + B2*x2$? Does it even make sense for categorical variables? If you look at continuous variables, for example most values of $x$ are clustered together, and there's a couple of outliers, these outliers is going to have high leverage and have a large impact on the regression coefficients. I imagine the same might happen to the strongly imbalanced categorical variables (if you interpret the equation y ~ B0 + B1*x1 + B2*x2 in the sense of, say, logistic regression, with x1, x2 etc being dummy variables).
