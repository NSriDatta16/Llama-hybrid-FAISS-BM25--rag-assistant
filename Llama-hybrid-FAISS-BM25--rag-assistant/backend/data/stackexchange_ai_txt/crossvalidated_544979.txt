Based on Data Augmentation in numerical dataset

I want to develop a machine learning model for a dataset like 5 inputs and 1 output. I stuck in stage with not sufficient dataset, I am aware about data augmentation technique in image and text type data's is there any specific method for numerical data like this. If there is any technique pls help to resolve the problem also if possible cite some reference with example code.
