Mixed effect logistic regression model

I am very new to the world of statistics and I need some help. I am currently doing an experiment and I have to analyze the data, but I honestly do not know anything about statistics (I have tried to attend some courses at the university, but they only deal with descriptive stat; I've learned a bit from some books but in many cases a really starting course is difficult to find). However, from what I have learnt I have understood that I need to run a mixed effect logistic regression model. I have a binary dependent variable (yes/no), and different predictors: Group age (with three levels: 20, 30, 40) Preference (with two levels: a, b) Season (with two levels: summer, winter) Weather (with two levels: sunny, rainy) As random effects I have both the ID and the item number (there are 25 observations for each participants, and all the items are the same). How can I choose the correct model? In my prediction, the dependent variable is influenced by group age, season and weather, as well as the interaction between season and weather. Instead, I do not think that the variable preference would affect the result, but I would like to control for this. Is it possible to use the package glmulti in R to find the correct model? I have read about the necessity to compare some index such as BIC and AIC. But generally, what is a BIC value for example according to which the model is okay? For example, is a BIC of 2700 too high? And what about if different models share the same BIC/AIC? After having run the model, what should contain a complete statistical analysis? I am really sorry for the stupid questions, but I think that a bull point about the passages step by step would help me a lot since I do not have a "methodology" (or I do not know where I can learn it).
