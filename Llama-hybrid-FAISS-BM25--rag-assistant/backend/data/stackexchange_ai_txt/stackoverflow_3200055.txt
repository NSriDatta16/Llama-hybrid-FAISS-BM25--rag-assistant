C#: Folder structure with service layer, interfaces, and mocks?

I recently started creating services layers and making declarations like: MyService myService = new MyService(); myService.DoSomething(); This was inspired by some ASP.NET MVC videos and I like the pattern. Then I started creating interfaces and mocks like: IMyService myService = new MockMyService(); myService.DoSomething(); So I can isolate parts of the code to test. But now my service layer folder is loaded with classes, interfaces, and mock classes: IServiceTypeA.cs ServiceTypeA.cs MockServiceTypeA.cs IServiceTypeB.cs ServiceTypeB.cs MockServiceTypeB.cs ... IServiceTypeZ.cs ServiceTypeZ.cs MockServiceTypeZ.cs How do you organize these in a logical way?
