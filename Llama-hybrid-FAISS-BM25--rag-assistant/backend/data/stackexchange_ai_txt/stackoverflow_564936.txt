Java Web Start - Popularity

I recently used a Java Web Start application. I launched it from my web browser using an embedded jnlp link in the page I was viewing. The application was downloaded, launched and worked just fine. It had access to my local file-system and remembered my preferences between restarting it. What I want to know is why are Java Web Start applications not a more popular delivery format for complex applications on the web? Why do developers often spend considerable time & energy replicating desktop functionality in html/javascript when the power of a desktop application could be delivered more easily using Java & Java Web Start? I know that in some corporate environments, e.g banking, they are relatively popular ways of delivering complex trading applications to clients, but why are they not pervasive across the web as a whole? (For the sake of discussion let's assume a world where: download sources are "trusted" & applications are "signed" (i.e. no security concerns), download speeds are fast (load time is quick) and developers know Java (in the numbers they know html/js/php)).
