I focus on the ROC as an metric for discrimination ability of prediction model. In the general ROC estimation, we should build a logistic regression model and estimate unconditional probability of a positive response for each observation. For example: set.seed(63126) n However, in the conditional logistic regression, we only get the probability of a particular one will have a positive response among the group of observations that this observation belongs to (strata). So we can not plot the ROC directly. In 2020, Hui Xu et al. introduced an alternative to solve this problem, the algorithm has not been integrated in SAS, R and Stata.
