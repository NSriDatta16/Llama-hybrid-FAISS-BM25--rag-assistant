You can only include a definition one time but headers can be included multiple times. To fix that, add: #pragma once to the top of each header file. While #pragma once is relatively common, if you are using an older compiler it may not be supported. In that case, you need to fall back on manual include guards: #ifndef MY_HEADER_H #define MY_HEADER_H ... #endif (note that you need to replace MY_HEADER_H with a unique string for each header file)
