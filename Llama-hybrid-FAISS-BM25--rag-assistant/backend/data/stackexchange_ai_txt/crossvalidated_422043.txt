How can I create a neural network that can recognize objects without having data for objects that aren't in the classification set?

I have a data set of 10,000 images of 5 different recycling items. The goal of my neural network is to tell me if an item is recyclable or not. The problem is that I only have data for the 5 different classifications (soda can, crushed soda can, water bottle, glass bottle, cardboard boxes). If you feed the trained network something that is not one of these 5 items (something like a plastic bag) it will still try to label it as one of these 5. Is there a way to logically separate out the garbage items without having data of the garbage. I don't have time to collect more data of garbage items and add a 6th classification to the neural network.
