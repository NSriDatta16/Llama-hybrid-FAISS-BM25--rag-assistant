I gave up using my two workstations for development and moved to just using my mobile laptop as my main developer/business machine. Using a HP workstation docking station i get my dual-screen setup. then i have a desktop machine as my local server and backup machine. get some SSD flash memory storage for your laptop and it will be faster than your stationary ones!
