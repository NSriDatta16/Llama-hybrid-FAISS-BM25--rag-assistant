Can I use a GAN to increase my Dataset used for Image detection?

I am currently working on a machine learning project where I use the YOLO Algorithm to detect an object inside of a picture or video. The problem I face is that the specific image set (side-scan sonar) that I am working with is mostly classified, thus there is not a wide range of images available to the public to be used for training. Would I be able to implement a GAN to produce a larger data-set of side-scan sonar imagines to be used for training an image detection Algorithm? I understand that there may be image distortion from using a GAN, but for the purpose of having a larger training set would this be possible?
