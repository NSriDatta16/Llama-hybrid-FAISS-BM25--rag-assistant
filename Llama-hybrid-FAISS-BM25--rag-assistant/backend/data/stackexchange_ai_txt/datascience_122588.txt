I think you need to compute/output confidence intervals for each prediction because, often, you are not given the true data at inference. Basically you decide how much wide your interval should be, the wider the less confident. The intuition is that the true value is contained within the interval with some probability $p$ , whereas your prediction is always inside the inteval. For practical implementation, assuming linear regression, you may want to look at these two answers: 1 and 2 . Another way would be to directly use models that can estimate confidence, like Bayesian and Quantile regression, or even a Gaussian Process .
