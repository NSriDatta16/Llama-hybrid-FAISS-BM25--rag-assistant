(Not directly an answer to your question if the queries are the same, but the comment field is too restricting for this) If you leave out the .Include() , doesn't it load it anyway (because of the where)? Generally it makes more sense to me to use projections instead of Include() : var beverages = from p in db.Products.Include("Category") where p.Category.CategoryName == "Beverages" select new { Product = p, Category = p.Category }; var beverageList = beverages.ToList();
