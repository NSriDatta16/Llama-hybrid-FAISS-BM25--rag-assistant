Scaling multiple views in android

I'm creating a board game in android. In my absolute layout, I have a board view, and a tile view. Those two views can overlap each other, since you're placing a tile onto the board by click and drag. I am not using a bitmap drawing for this since I want to handle two separate onTouchEvent for the board and for the tile. Problem: I want my board view to be able to zoom in and pan. At the same time, I want to tile to know to scale itself. Is there anyway to do this on android? My current solution is to scale the two view separately(which is a lot of work) but I think there should be a better solution than this out there. Or my approach on this is completely off? Any ideas or help would be appreciated. Thanks!
