Memory, File or Session for ASP.NET Charting Tools

Which storage method should I use when using ASP.NET Charting Tools? I'm currently using memory, because it seems like the most straight-forward and easy to implement option. Is there any reasons I should be aware of why I should choose one of the other options? The charts generated will be useful only for an overview kind of purpose (checking to see if a data collection is following a certain pattern, as it is being built day by day), and this function won't be used frequently. Thank-you in advance for any advice you can offer. Jere
