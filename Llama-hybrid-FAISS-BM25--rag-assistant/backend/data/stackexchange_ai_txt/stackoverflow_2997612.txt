How to export all changed/added files from Git?

I am very new to Git and I have a slight problem. In SVN [this feels like an Only Fools and Horses story by uncle Albert.."during the war..."] when I wanted to update a production site with my latest changes, I'd do a diff in TSVN and export all the changed/added files between two revisions. As you can imagine, it was easy to get those files to a production site afterwards. However, it seems like I'm unable to find an "export changed files" option in Git. I can do a diff and see the changes, I can get a list of files, but I can't actually export them. Is there a reasonable way to do this? Am I missing something simple? Just to clarify once again, I need to export all the changes between two specific commits. Thanks in advance!
