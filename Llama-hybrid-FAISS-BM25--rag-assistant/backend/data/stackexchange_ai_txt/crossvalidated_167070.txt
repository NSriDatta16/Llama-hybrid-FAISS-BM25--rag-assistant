Today, we're all Bayesians , but there's a world beyond these two camps: algorithmic probability. I'm not sure what's the standard reference on this subject, but there's this beautiful paper by Kolmogorov on algorithmic complexity: A. N. Kolmogorov, Three approaches to the definition of the concept “quantity of information” , Probl. Peredachi Inf., 1965, Volume 1, Issue 1, 3–11. I'm sure there's an English translation. In this paper he defines the quantity of information in three ways: combinatorial, probabilistic and (new) algorithmic. Combinatorial directly maps to frequentist, Probabilist doesn't directly correspond to Bayesian, but it's compatible with it. UPDATE: If you're interested in the philosophy of the probability then I want to point to a very interesting work " The origins and legacy of Kolmogorov’s Grundbegriffe " by Glenn Shafer and Vladimir Vovk. We sort of forgot everything before Kolmogorov, and there was a lot going on before his seminal work. On the other hand, we don't know much about his philosophical views. It's generally thought that he was a frequentist, for instance. The reality's that he lived in Soviet Union in 1930', where it was quite dangerous to venture into philosophy, literally, you could get in existential trouble, which some scientist did (ended up in GULAG prisons). So, he was sort of forced to implicitly indicate that he was a frequentist. I think that in reality he was not just a mathematician, but he was a scientist, and had a complex view of applicability of probability theory to reality. There's also another paper by Vovk on Kolmogorov's algorithmic approach to randomness: Kolmogorov’s contributions to the foundations of probability Vovk has created a game-theoretic approach to probabilities - also very interesting. UPDATE 2: Here's a Bayesian, actually, a professor from one of the universities in Washington, DC. He was trying to make a point that we should elect politicians who update their beliefs based on experiences, new observations. Here $P(B|E)$ is the posterior belief $B$, after the new experience $E$; $P(E|B)$ is the prior. He was trying to explain this to Colbert/Stuart "Rally for Fear" participants. UPDATE 3: I also wanted to point to something in Kolmogorov's original work that's not commonly known for some reason (or easily forgotten) by practitioners. He had a section about connecting the theory to reality. In particular, he set two conditions for using the theory: A. if you repeat the experiment many times then the frequency of occurrence will differ by only a small amount from the probability, practically certainly B. If probability is very small, then if you conduct the experiment only once then you can be practically certain that the event will not occur There are different interpretations of these conditions, but most people would agree that these are not the pure frequentist's views. Kolmogorov declared that he follows von Mises' approach to certain extent, but he seemed to indicate that things are not as simple as it may appear. I often think of condition B, and can't come to a stable conclusion, it looks slightly different every time I think about it.
