Triangular distribution

I am working on a dataset that ranges between 0 - 100 and typically is centered around 50 for the most part. It seems like the dataset shows a triangular distribution given its bound between 0 - 100. I wasn't sure and just wanted to double check if this would be a triangular distribution? Can we compute z-score for this dataset? If not how would you recommend analyzing this dataset on a cross-sectional as well as time series basis?
