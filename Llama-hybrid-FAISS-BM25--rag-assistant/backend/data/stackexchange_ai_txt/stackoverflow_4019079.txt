In under 24 hours, there is very little you can learn about C# that would convince an interviewer that has even a slight clue that you know the language. Focus on brushing up on your own strengths (e.g.: solve some interesting algorithm problem in some language you know). If you really want to cram, read an overview . I understand the desire to impress with at least some smidgeon of knowledge, and it certainly can't hurt to be able to say that you've started looking into it. But as an interviewer, one of the first questions I ask is what languages the candidate is familiar with, and then proceed on that basis. I don't question them on what they know of languages they haven't used, because I know that anything they've picked up online will be superficial and largely useless in the day-to-day process of writing code. Instead, I focus entirely on a demonstration of the skills they possess in whatever language they are comfortable with. Of course, that's just my style and I can't guarantee tomorrow's interviewers will have same viewpoint. But I still think that, as a basic guiding principle, you should always play to your strengths. With regard to language similarities, don't pay any attention to the advice that Java and C# are similar, and most certainly do not make such a claim in an interview for a C# job. While the languages may be superficially similar, with many features in common, C# has numerous modern language features that Java lacks (iterators, lambda forms, LINQ, struct, properties, expression objects, reference parameters, indexers, etc.). This leads to wildly different programming styles.
