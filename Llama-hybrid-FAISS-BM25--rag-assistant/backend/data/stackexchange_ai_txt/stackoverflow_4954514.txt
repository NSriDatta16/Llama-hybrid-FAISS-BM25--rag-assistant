Writing it all in pure C# is possible but not very convenient when you are trying to achieve a specific html layout - it is painful to maintain, and very hard to work alongside a developer if you want to take their html and just tweak it to add the data. Personally I'd look at MVC here; for example, I've been playing with razor recently which allows very elegant integration between C# and html in the same file: @foreach(var item in obj.Items) { @item.Name } There I can: clearly see at a glance how the code maps to the source I can see at the client make changes with confidence, both from visual inspection and the IDE telling me if I do something obviously wrong compare to the designer's draft easily
