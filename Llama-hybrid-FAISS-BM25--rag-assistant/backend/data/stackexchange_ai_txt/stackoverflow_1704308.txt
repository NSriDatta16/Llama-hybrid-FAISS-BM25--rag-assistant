I have a hero ( and love it ) but as the web devolops I find I care less and less about flash. Frankly I feel that HTML5 is the way forward - Canvas + SVG + JS + local DB seems to be a very flexible platform for building anything from applications (see any google app) to games (see http://www.paulbrunt.co.uk/2009/09/20/berts-breakdown/ ). Also openvideo (to me) replaces the need for Flash video players.
