If you are using a linear kernel, then it is possible that feature selection is a bad idea, and that regularisation can prevent over-fitting more effectively than feature selection can. Note that the performance bounds that the SVM approximately implements are independent of the dimension of the feature space, which was one of the selling points of the SVM.
