I submitted an app using this code to the Mac App Store, and Apple approved it: Objective-C WebPreferences* prefs = [webView preferences]; [prefs _setLocalStorageDatabasePath:@"~/Library/Application Support/MyApp"]; [prefs setLocalStorageEnabled:YES]; Swift 3 var prefs: WebPreferences? = webView.preferences prefs?._setLocalStorageDatabasePath("~/Library/Application Support/MyApp") prefs?.localStorageEnabled = true Whether they will continue to approve that, I don't know, but they allowed it for my application as of 2011-01-29. Update: They also approved a version update to the same app, so it has gone through twice.
