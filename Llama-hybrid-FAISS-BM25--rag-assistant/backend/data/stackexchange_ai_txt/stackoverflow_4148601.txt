Automatic way to move Visual Studio project into LINQPad?

I thoroughly enjoy the amazing power of LINQPAD (thanks, Joseph Albahari !) and particularly LINQPad's Dump method. Frequently I take an existing Visual Studio project and move it into LINQPad for the sole purpose of adding a couple Dump statements to see what the data looks like--though Visual Studio's data popups are certainly useful, the Dump output is just much easier to digest. To do this, I open each file I need from the current project, copy and paste the individual classes over to LINQPad, add assemblies and using statements, attempt to run so that LINQPad will tell me what I missed, and repeat until I find all the orphan references. This method seems antithetical to the elegant, streamlined nature of LINQPad. Is there an easier way? Any chance of seeing " Import Project " on LINQPad's File menu any time soon? If not, I may end up writing a utility myself...
