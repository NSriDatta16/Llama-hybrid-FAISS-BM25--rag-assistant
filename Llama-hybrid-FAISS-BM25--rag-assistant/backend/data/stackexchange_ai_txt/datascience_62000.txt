LSTM - Incorporate word embedding in layer with multiple records in same date

I have a time series data having more than one record in a single date. Number of records in a single date is not consistent. I have 3 input features namely phrase, cost and weight. My goal is to predict 'Cost'. I have used Keras texts_to_sequences to deal with the text input 'phrase' column. I have following concerns how to incorporate Phrase column in the LSTM model how to deal with multiple records in a single date what will be the shape of input data How do I structure the model like 1st layer to be Embedding layer, 2nd to Dense and so on. Here is the sample of the data: Here is the processed data: Kindly assist me.
