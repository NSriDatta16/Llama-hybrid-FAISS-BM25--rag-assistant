Oracle truncate with / without drop storage

Tried to get a bit more info on this, but figured I'd just ask.... I attempted to perform a table truncate on Oracle 10g with the drop storage, however the results aren't entirely what I was expecting. Basically, the table in question had over 30 million records and over 3Gb allocated for it, but somehow the space allocated for it still appears to be used. Is there a way to actually drop the allocated space used, or am I going about it the wrong way? ===EDIT==== My bad...I was referring to physical disk space, in terms of the datafile size... At the moment our export / backup amounted to about 13GB, so the intention here was to shrink the actual file in the process of truncating the data when we export to a file for backup.
