Are you using Struts 1 or 2? If you're using Struts 1 then there are couple of ways of doing it. I prefer to do it using org.springframework.web.struts.DelegatingActionProxy. You'll need to have the spring-webmvc-struts.jar in the classpath. struts-config.xml: applicationContext.xml: I've found this technique to be the most elegant, it doesn't affect old code that doesn't use spring. There are at least two more ways of integrating struts 1 with spring. There's an article at ibm developerworks that explains the pros and cons of the different solutions, google "Get a better handle on Struts actions, with Spring" (newbies like myself aren't allowed to include links).
