I would start off adding your time period fields and waiting until size becomes an issue. The kind of data you are describing does not sound like it is going to consume a lot of storage space. Should it grow uncontrollably you can always look at the archive approach later - but the coding is going to take much longer than simply storing the relevant period with your data.
