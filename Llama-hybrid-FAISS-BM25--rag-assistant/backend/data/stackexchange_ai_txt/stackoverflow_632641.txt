The W3C have been working towards defining a standard for XML fragment interchange . I'm mentioning it not because it's a solution to your problem, but it's definitely relevant to see that there's discussion of how to handle such things. In the .NET world you can work with XML fragments and, for example, validate them against a schema . This suggests that it is worth searching for similar support in the Java libraries. If you want to transform such fragments with XSLT, a very common approach is to put a wrapper element around them, which can then act as the root of the DOM.
