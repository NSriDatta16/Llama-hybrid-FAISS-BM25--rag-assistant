Searching optimum ranges for maximizing a variable

I am currently working on a project where I have been asked to analyze a dataframe with various time series. signal_alpha signal_beta ... signal_omega idx time_a value value value time_b . . . ... . . . time_n . . . Let us pretend that signal_omega is the variable that I would like to maximize. Is there a mathematical method to analyze and return the ranges for maximize that variable in function of the others?
