Jus as example: URL "fixing" For http-URLs I treat path fragments mandatory, like every browser does. So I make it a point to "fix" user input and imported data, and always add the trailing slash to e.g. http://example.org before displaying or storing such values. Probably not "uber professionalism", but normalizing URLs often simplifies dealing with them later on. And don't know, it just seems "better". $url = preg_replace("/^(http:..[-\w.\d]+)$/", "$1/", $url); So I'll always have http://example.org/ in values, no matter what. This doesn't make your HTML any more standards compliant, but it's just one of my pet peeves.
