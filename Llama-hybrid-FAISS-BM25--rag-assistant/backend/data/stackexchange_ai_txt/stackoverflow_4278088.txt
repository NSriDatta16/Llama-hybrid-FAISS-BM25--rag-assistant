You can follow Facebook as it stores a lot of files (15 billion photos): They Initially started with NFS share served by commercial storage appliances. Then they moved to their onw implementation http file server called Haystack Here is a facebook note if you want to learn more http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=76191543919 Regarding the NFS share. Keep in mind that NFS shares usually limits amount of files in one folder for performance reasons. (This could be a bit counter intuitive if you assume that all recent file systems use b-trees to store their structure.) So if you are using comercial NFS shares like (NetApp) you will likely need to keep files in multiple folders. You can do that if you have any kind of id for your files. Just divide it Ascii representation in to groups of few characters and make folder for each group. For example we use integers for ids so file with id 1234567891 is stored as storage/0012/3456/7891. Hope that helps.
