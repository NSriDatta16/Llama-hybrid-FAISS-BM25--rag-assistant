BatchNorm was a choice made by early ConvNet designs primarily targeting vision. NLP did not follow that preferring LayerNorm instead. The question as to whether LayerNorm would be a better choice for ConvNet and vision is investigated in the 2022 paper [1]. Alongside other changes it observes "ConvNet model does not have any difficulties training with LN; in fact, the performance is slightly better."
