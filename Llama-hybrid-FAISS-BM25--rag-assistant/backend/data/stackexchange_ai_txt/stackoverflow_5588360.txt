Drag an object in AS3 to affect currentFrame as opposed to x/y coordinates

I have a 3 dimensional object rotating in a Flash video file (embedded in a MovieClip). Its 100 frames long. It's trivial to drag an object in Flash to affect its x/y coordinates with startDrag() ... But I want to be able to drag the object and change the currentFrame of the MovieClip depending upon the position of the mouse from left to right. My best idea is : Have an invisible box around the object Initiate startDrag() on the invisible box Set currentFrame during the drag operation based on the position from origin Snap the invisible box back to the original position when the drag operation is complete - and record the frame offset for next time someone drags it Just want to make sure there's no easier trick - or something 'out-of-the-box' (either AS3 code or IDE script) that I could use. Edit I'm pursuing this approach and it's working quite well. However Flash doesn't seem to like seeking randomly backwards through a movie clip. If I drag to the right it plays smoothly, but if I drag to the left it is very jumpy trying to seek to a previous frame. Is there some AS3 to optimize 'reverse play'?
