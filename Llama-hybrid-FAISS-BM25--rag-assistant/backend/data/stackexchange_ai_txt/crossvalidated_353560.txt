Repetitive Time Series analysis

I'm a student and I'm trying to make a brief analysis of flight tickets prices. I've got for some days flight prices on a specific route for the day and for 90 days ahead. I've done this twice per day. I'd like to estimate the weekday effect (i think prices would rise during the weekend) on price but I don't know how to handle repetitive measures. Any advice? Thank you. A portion of data: data=structure(list(Date = structure(c(rep(17569,238),rep(17570,236),rep(17571,234),rep(1572,232) ), class = "Date"), Time = c(rep("10:00",119),rep("16:00",119), rep("10:00",118),rep("16:00",118), rep("10:00",117),rep("16:00",117), rep("10:00",116),rep("16:00",116)), Price = c(152.89, 128.69, 181.49, 128.69, 128.69, 128.69, 152.89, 128.69, 89.09, 106.69,
