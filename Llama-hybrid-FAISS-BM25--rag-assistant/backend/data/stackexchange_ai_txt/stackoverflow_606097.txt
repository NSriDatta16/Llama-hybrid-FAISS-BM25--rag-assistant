You could store the variables in a cookie on the user's machine (jQuery doesn't have native cookie support, but this plugin gives it to you). However, that requires Javascripw, which you mention that you don't want to require. However, if you want the user to be able to drag modules on a page around, then you aren't going to be able to do this without the aid of js. If you do want to store this data server-side, then all I can suggest short of using a database is to store them in a file-based cache.
