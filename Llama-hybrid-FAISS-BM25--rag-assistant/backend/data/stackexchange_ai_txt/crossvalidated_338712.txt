Turns out GMMs are not good for modelling very high dimensional data because it increasingly becomes difficult to cluster points with more dimensions. Integer data was normalized. I reduced the dimensionalty using LDA followed by using training a GMM for each class. My feature space was incomplete and I ended training a CNN based classifier with even higher dimensional points and with even more data.
