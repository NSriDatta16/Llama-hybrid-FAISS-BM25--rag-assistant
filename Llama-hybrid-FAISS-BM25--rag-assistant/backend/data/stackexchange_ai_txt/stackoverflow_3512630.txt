A webpage will never have access to the computers hardware. You need a program to run locally on the machine (java, c++, c#..) with full trust to gain access to this ressources. Maybe you can also use a signed applet or ocx control, but most users won't accept that. The information the browser sends to the server like user agent, language, installed plugins and IP address are the only information you have. They aren't guaranteed to be unique, though.
