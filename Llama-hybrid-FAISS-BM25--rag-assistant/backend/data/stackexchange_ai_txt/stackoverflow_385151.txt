Longitudes and latitudes are not generally known to any greater precision than a 32-bit float. So if you're concerned about storage space, you can use floats. But in general it's more convenient to work with numbers as doubles. Radians are more convenient for theoretical math. (For example, the derivative of sine is cosine only when you use radians.) But degrees are typically more familiar and easier for people to interpret, so you might want to stick with degrees.
