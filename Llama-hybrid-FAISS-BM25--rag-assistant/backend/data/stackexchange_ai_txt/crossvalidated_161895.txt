Calculating BIC for a HMM without any training data

I need to evaluate my HMM models, that are trained using EM algorithm, since I don't have any training data. In order to evaluate with BIC or with most of the other criterions I need the log likelihood. But it seems it's too expensive to calculate. In equations, I need $P(Z\vert\theta) = \sum_{X} P(X,Z \vert \theta) $ Where $Z$ observed states, $X$ hidden states and $\theta$ are the parameters. This summation is not possible to calculate for reasonably long Markov chain. For a example , a model 2 states and 100 time steps, will have $2^{100}$ possibilities to sum up. How can I do this ? Am I missing something ?
