You should look at the open-source Quartz library from OpenSymphony. Very easy to use and perfect for this kind of thing. TimerTasks are best suited for running something in a short time in the future. But for a repeated execution in a large timeframe such as this, Quartz excels. You can even keep your list of upcoming tasks in persistent storage such as a file or database, so upcoming timed jobs are not lost if your application is restarted. Also, there's a fantastic abstraction for Quartz in the Spring framework.
