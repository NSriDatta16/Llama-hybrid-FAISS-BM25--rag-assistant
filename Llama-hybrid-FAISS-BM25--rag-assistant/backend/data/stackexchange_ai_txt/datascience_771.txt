From what I heard, Pylearn2 might be currently the library of choice for most people. This reminds me of a recent blog post a few month ago that lists all the different machine learning libraries with a short explanation https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/python-tools-machine-learning The section you might be interested in here would be "Deep Learning". About Pylearn2, he writes PyLearn2 There is another library built on top of Theano, called PyLearn2 which brings modularity and configurability to Theano where you could create your neural network through different configuration files so that it would be easier to experiment different parameters. Arguably, it provides more modularity by separating the parameters and properties of neural network to the configuration file.
