I think it's an artefact of your test class. I created a similar class, then decompiled it with javap. The [eclipse] java compiler breaks the String literal into chunks, each no longer than 64k. The bytecode for initializing the non-constant field consists of cobbling the source string together with a sequence of StringBuilder operations. Although it is this final gigantic string that is interned, the large atoms it is made of take up space in the constant pool.
