All things being equal, the major difference is the variation in the effect as a function of sample size. A very simple simulation in R shows this as the case. Here I simulate two groups who have the same mean and standard deviation of a given DV. Theoretically, their Cohen's $d$ should be zero on average (because their difference in means is zero ), but random sample fluctuation means this will vary. To test how much they will vary based on sample size, this code generates $B = 1,000$ simulated Cohen's $d$ values based on sample sizes from $n = 3$ to $n = 200$ . #### Load Library #### library(effectsize) #### Parameters #### boot You can see from the plot that the Cohen's $d$ values hover around a pre-specified mean difference between groups (here the black line shows correctly that they average to zero), but their variation is substantial in low $n$ situations, which means higher effect sizes are more likely in small samples. You can see for example that one of the tiny samples has a Cohen's $d$ that is greater than 2, which would be quite substantial if true!
