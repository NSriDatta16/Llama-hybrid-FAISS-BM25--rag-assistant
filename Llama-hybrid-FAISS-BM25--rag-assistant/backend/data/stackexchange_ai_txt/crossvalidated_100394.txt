Bootstrap confidence interval for the t-test

I am dealing with data with unbalanced sample sizes (12k vs 18k) and variance (0.2 vs 0.4) and want to perform a two sample t-test. With the unbalanced features, I am thinking about applying a bootstrapped t-test. Can I just re-sample from the larger data-set and perform t-test many times then get the average? To be more specific about the data I am dealing with: Set 1: 12K (var 0.02) vs 18K (var 0.04), Set 2: 700 (0.02) vs 900 (0.04). I also need to compare 12K from set1 to 700 from set 2. It seems that 1,2 are OK for the Welch two sample t-test, but I am more concerned about the third one. t.test.btsp $v1, size=n1, replace = T) group2 v1, size=n2, replace = T) t.values[i] Is this the right way to get the CI?
