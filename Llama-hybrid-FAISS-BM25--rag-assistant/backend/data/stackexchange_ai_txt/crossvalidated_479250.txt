If interactions among the 210 variables are a possibility, then use C4.5 or C5.0 on a balanced dataset, as MatchMakerEE's answer suggests. Random forests could be tried next if you're unhappy with the results. If you expect no interactions among the 210 variables, or only known interactions that you can specify, instead first try factorial logistic regression with a balanced dataset. If you're an advanced analyst who wants to consider during the modelling process a probabilistic map of relationships among the variables, consider the BN2O model and/or IDA (Intervention when the Directed acyclic graph is Absent). See for example Sections 10.2.3 and 26.6.3 of Kevin Murphyâ€™s 2012 book, Machine Learning . Equally you could try a probabilistic expert system; see Section 10.4 (ibid).
