Is there a lint tool for OpenGL Shading Language?

I've started working with OpenGL and writing shaders. My app checks for errors after loading and compiling shader programs, and if there is a problem it prints out the info log. This is great for catching errors (and I'm a newbie so I'm making a lot), but what I'd really like is to catch these errors at build time. If I had a lint tool that could simply check a vertex or fragment shader for syntax errors, I could add it to my build process and have it stop the build. I haven't been able to find such a tool. I started to try to write one, but I'm working on OpenGL ES and had trouble trying to write a desktop program that links against the ES libraries . Maybe I missed it somewhere. Does such a tool exist?
