Reference fields within tables such that they can be edited

I'm new to making a db. So far I have a form set up like I like it, but no values are bound b/c I need to switch between tables (I could probably just add all of the fields from the first table to the second table, but half of the point of me doing this myself was learning). I've encountered two problems. First, I'm having trouble making the form accept that I want its recordsource to be myTable. I have no idea why. It seems simple enough form.RecordSource="myTable" Unfortunately, it doesn't work. If I do that, text boxes that are bound to fields in myTable say #error or #name? instead of their intended value. To try and fix this, I went into the properties of the form and set its control source to: "SELECT * FROM myTable, myTable AS backup_1;" I have no idea what that means, but that's what I had to do to get anything to work. This is my first problem - how do I 'properly' associate a db with a form without the shenanigans and have references work? I have done it 3 different ways now, one worked for a while then stopped, one (form.recordSource=myTable) simply didn't work, and the other is the first method I mentioned. All of them are causing me problems. At any rate, I used the SELECT... since it's the closest to actually working. From there I set the text boxes that I didn't want to leave Unbound as [myTable.FieldName], and it worked. Programmatically I was able to use [myTable.FieldName] to edit get the information from a particular field from a particular record without difficulty. The problem is that I cannot seem to programmatically edit the data stored in those fields. For example, if I try: txtDisplayField1=[myTable.Field1] Works fine. But if I try: [myTable.Field1] = txtDisplayField1.text I get run-time error 2448 - "You can't assign a value to this object." (Which is the most helpful error message ever.) Earlier I mentioned that when associating my form with a table, there was one way that worked at first but then stopped working for some reason. Originally I just typed: form.recordsource = myTable and it worked just fine. I was able to reference fields by referring to them as Field1, etc., without the brackets. It worked as of me getting off work Friday (gasp - I'm not a programmer by trade) but didn't work when I got in. That's probably the most convoluted explanation of a problem humanly possible... but any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
