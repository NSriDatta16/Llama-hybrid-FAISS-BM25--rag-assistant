Stationarity in Forecasting Weekly Retail Sales

I'm new to forecasting and trying to create a model to forecast one step ahead weekly sales from my company. The variables I've identified for the model are Lag 1 Markdown spend and lag 1 sales, and I've included dummy variables for monthly seasonality and some promotional weekends we run, resulting in the below model: > summary(fit) Call: lm(formula = Sales.RtlT ~ L1.MD + P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 + P6 + P7 + P8 + P9 + P10 + P11 + L1.Sales, data = lux) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.7028 -2.8850 -0.2948 2.5488 15.3845 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 5.17443 1.86670 2.772 0.006115 ** L1.MD 0.16591 0.02353 7.050 3.06e-11 *** P1 0.21394 1.84689 0.116 0.907902 P2 0.47421 1.83599 0.258 0.796462 P3 -1.16762 1.75653 -0.665 0.507013 P4 -0.77594 1.84712 -0.420 0.674892 P5 3.36375 1.76142 1.910 0.057650 . P6 -1.11759 1.56631 -0.714 0.476384 P7 1.76297 1.79197 0.984 0.326429 P8 5.13988 1.66437 3.088 0.002309 ** P9 5.39127 1.52419 3.537 0.000506 *** P10 6.58703 1.61126 4.088 6.37e-05 *** P11 7.02233 1.60600 4.373 2.00e-05 *** L1.Sales 0.63513 0.04829 13.152 my weekly sales data isn't stationary, but if I difference it once it is, as shown below: However I can't fit lm with the differenced values. Is it preferable to have a stationary time series for a forecast like this, and if so how should I run the regression to account for this?
