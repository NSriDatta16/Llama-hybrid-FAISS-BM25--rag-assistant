Classification: one of the classes have a much wider range of predictor values then others.

How do I supposed to deal with the situation when one of the classes is very general, it actually covers a bunch of classes, but other 3 classes I have are very precise. I have a data that has a lot of classes, I just need 3 of them, and I use 4th class as a class for everything else. What problems such method of labeling can cause and how do I deal with those problems? Thank you! My data has about 170 features and I have about 1500 samples. I plan to use Random Forest classifier.
