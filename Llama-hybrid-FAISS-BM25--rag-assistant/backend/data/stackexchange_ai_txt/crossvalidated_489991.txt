The idea of using properties of a dataset to decide on classifier characteristics is called metalearning I do not know much about metalearning itself, nor any specific aspects of metalearning for SVMs and classification hardness A search on Google Scholar points to https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-013-9406-y (open access) as a recent and well cited survey of metalearning. I know of one result on metalearning-like results for SVM: the mean distance between classes is a good heuristic value for the $\gamma$ hyperparameter for the RBF SVM (both behind paywall): Analysis of the Distance Between Two Classes for Tuning SVM Hyperparameters Empirical comparison of cross-validation and internal metrics for tuning SVM hyperparameters
