First of all, considering only treated individuals that are also in pro-Trump subreddits and only untreated people that are also in pro-Clinton subreddits will not give you a good estimation of the impact of Russian propaganda accounts. You want to have treated and untreated in both subreddits. Otherwise, you don't know whether the voters' choice is really influenced by Russian or whether it is just the political orientation (expressed by what subreddit is read). See e.g. matching . The SUTVA is independent of the above problem. It just says that the outcome of the treatment of an individual is independent of the treatment other individuals receive, and the outcome of the treatment must be independent of how the treatment was assigned. E.g., as you already correctly pointed out, if exposure of an individual's friends to Russian propaganda will influence that individual's outcome of the treatment, the SUTVA is violated. In summary , first, you have to make sure that the data has been collected in compliance with SUTVA. Then, to compute the average treatment effect , you have to use an appropriate method like matching.
