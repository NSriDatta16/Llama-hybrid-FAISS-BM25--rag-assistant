You already answered your own question: you shouldn't use a stacked area plot for any statistic for which the the statistic of the total is not the unweighted sum of the statistics over the component categories. In other words, the statisitic must be a linear operator . The arithmetic average, count, and total are all linear operators, but the median, geometric mean, and most other statistics aren't. However, in your example case, I doubt that the difference would be massively noticable just from visual inspection from a plot. Have you tried plotting it to see what happens? You could plot the stacked area chart of the median, then plot a line with the true median over the top. BTW, does this dataset exist? It would be quite a useful teaching tool, and would make a great addition to R's dataset package.
