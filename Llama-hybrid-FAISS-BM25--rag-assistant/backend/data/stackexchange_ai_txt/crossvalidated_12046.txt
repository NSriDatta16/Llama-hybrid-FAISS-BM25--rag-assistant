Organizing a classification tree (in rpart) into a set of rules?

Is there a way that once a complex classification tree is constructed using rpart (in R), to organize the decision rules produced for each class? So instead of getting one huge tree, we get a set of rules for each of the classes? (if so, how?) Here is a simple code example to show examples on: fit Thanks.
