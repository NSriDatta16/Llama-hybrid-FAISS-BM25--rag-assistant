Quarter as a Count variable in SAS

Hye Guys, I'm busy working on a time series and am trying to find the commands that allow me to insert a quarter count variable. To keep things simple, the third quarter of 1995 (date my observations start) should be quarter -2, the fourth quarter of 1995 should be -1 etc etc uptill 2006 (should be somewhere around 45 by then). My dates are in date9 format, such as 20JUN04 etc.. Anyone who can help me with the commands I need t o let this work in SAS? Thanks
