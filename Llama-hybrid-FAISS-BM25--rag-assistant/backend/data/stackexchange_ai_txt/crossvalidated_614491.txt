NA values in numeric values

I have a numeric integer feature (i.e, age), with an important number of non-valid values (NA, zeroes...). Not enough to discard the variable. I can't easily impute with estimated values. What would be a way to manage them? Set the values to an 'impossible', value like 999999? Are some algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM...) better than other to deal with them? In the worst case, the only solution I can imagine is create a model with the rest of the variables to 'predict' the missing one, but I think, I the particular case I'm sudying, It wil not be accurate.
