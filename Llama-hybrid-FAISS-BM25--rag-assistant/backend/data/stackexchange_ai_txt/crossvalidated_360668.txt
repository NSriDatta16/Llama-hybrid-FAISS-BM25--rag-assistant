Assuming "Frequency" in your post is the phenotype of interest, you would just change your model to: $$Phenotype \sim Age + Age^2 + PC_1 + PC_2 + ... PC_k + genotype$$ with $k$ top principal components estimated from the genotype matrix. Standard empirical choices could be between 3-10 top PCs. If $age$ itself is the phenotype, one can apply a similar model in a reverse regression style: $$genotype \sim Age + Age^2 + PC_1 + PC_2 + ... PC_k$$ but more appropriate would be explicit modeling of age as a time-to-event outcome, i.e.: (using R-style notation) $$ Surv(Age, death) \sim PC_1 + PC_2 + ... PC_k + genotype$$ Survival analysis on genome scale is available in ProbABEL , but the model choice there is limited. You might want to ask again on Bioinformatics SE if you're looking for some other tools. The background of using PCA here is that human populations have different genotype distributions, but also differ in phenotype because of non-genetic reasons (e.g. specific environmental exposures). Thus, genotype-phenotype associations are confounded by population structure, and conditioning on PCs as a proxy for the structure should control for this. Granted, it is a bit crude, and state of the art now is to fit a mixed linear model with a covariance matrix estimated from the genotypes - although the PC control seems to work fine at the level of precision needed in most such studies.
