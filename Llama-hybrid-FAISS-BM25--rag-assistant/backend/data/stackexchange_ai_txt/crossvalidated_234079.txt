R function/package to Cross-Validate Probability Threshold Value in Making Predictions from Logistic Regression

I am currently validating the work of another statistician tasked with developing a logistic model for biomedical data. The data consisted of the following: metab_x is a 71 x 186 matrix of 186 clinical chemistry markers measured across 71 patients; outcome_y is the patient's disease status, a 71 entry factor vector with case/control levels. As the title says, I am looking for a function or package that will cross validate the choice of probability threshold value in predicting the class membership of metab_x data given a fitted logistic regression model. I have constructed this model using glm() in base R. As some others have noted, predict(object, newdata=metab_x, type="response") only gives probabilities, not predicted class labels as given here in outcome_y . I would like to select the optimum threshold probability value as to minimize prediction error of patient outcomes given newdata=metab_x . I have already tried the caret package, but it does not appear to support basic logistic regression, only boosted logistic regression. Otherwise, it's predict.train function appears very similar to what I would like to use.
