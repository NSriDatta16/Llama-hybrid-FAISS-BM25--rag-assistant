Is it possible to add a predictor variable to a regression that is only relevant for some subpopulations and contains NAs for others?

I'm doing research on labour councils and their behavior regarding qualification. So I'm working with a logistic regression with "visited seminar in the last year" as a dependent variable and several independent variables. One interesting independent variable would be the "compatability between council work and professional work". But this variable is only relevant for those council members that still continue their professional work, while there is a large amount of respondants (I think about 40% or so) who work as a council member full time. This leads to the problem that I would do the analysis with only 60% of the observations and I would ignore a very important sub population. So I'm asking myself if there is any trick to add a variable that was only raised for a sub population to a regression model without removing all the other sub populations from it or at least a best practice to handle such a situation.
