It depends a little on the Excel versions you need to support. I've used ExcelPackage successfully in the past for reading and creating Excel 2007 files. It is no longer under development, which is a bit of a shame. You'd have to manually loop though all the cells, which I wouldn't call elegant, but it's flexible ;) Leniel has suggested using EPPlus over ExcelPackage. I haven't used it myself, but it looks very promising. There are several other suggestions in this question , but I have no experience with the other libraries.
