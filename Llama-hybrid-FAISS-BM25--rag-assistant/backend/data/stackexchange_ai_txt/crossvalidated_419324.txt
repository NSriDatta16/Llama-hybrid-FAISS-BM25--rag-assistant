Heteroscedasticity consistent (HC) standard error analysis and interaction effects in an OLS

I have made a model with several variables, and 8 of them interact with a dummy to find interaction effects. These are added stepwise, resulting in three models. Now, through a Breusch-Pagan test I have determined that my model contains heteroscedasticity. I have determined that I will use HC4 (Cribari-Neto, 2004) for the HC standard error analysis, but am unsure how to continue. Thus, my question is: Do I do the coeftest of the HC standard errors on the base model, or also on the models containing interaction effects? Intuitively I would say that heteroscedasticity concerns the variables themselves and not necessarily their interaction effect, which means I would only do it on the base model. However, I have not been able to find any literature on this topic or situation. Kind regards, DB
