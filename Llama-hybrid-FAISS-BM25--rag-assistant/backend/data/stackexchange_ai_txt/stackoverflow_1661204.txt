How do you organize your work?

How do you work? More specifically, how do you keep your programming tasks organized. When I do Mac development at home I use software called an outliner to organize, keep notes and prioritize the tasks I need to do. I started out using a program called Deep Notes which is a nice simple free tool. But now I use The Hit List . I’ve been looking for an equivalently good program on the Windows platform but so far have not found one. So far I’ve tried FusionDesk and am not satisfied with it. I’m starting to get the urge to write my own software but thought I would ask around first and see if anyone knows of a good product that I have not been able to find on this vast internet. Updated If you've never used an outliner to organize ideas, here is a brief overview. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner A good outliner is more complicated than a simple flat hierarchical TODO list but simple enough to be a one trick pony. One of the most important features of an outliner is being able to create a nested hierarchy of tasks. For example: Implement Feature A --- Add support at the data level --- Create quick interface for Feature A --- Create business logic that connects interface to data layer --- Refine the interface You can also collapse the nested tasks like a folder structure. If I'm not working on Feature A then I should be able to collapse the tree so it's sub tasks are not viewable.
