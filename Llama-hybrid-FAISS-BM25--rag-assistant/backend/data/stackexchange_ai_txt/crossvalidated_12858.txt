You can simulate the logistic regression model . More precisely, you can first generate values for the age variable (for example using a uniform distribution) and then compute probabilities of success using $$\pi ( x ) = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}$$ where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are constant regression coefficients to be specified. In particular, $\beta_1$ controls the magnitude of association between success and age. Having values of $\pi$, you can now generate values for the binary outcome variable using the Bernoulli distribution. Illustrative example in R: n
