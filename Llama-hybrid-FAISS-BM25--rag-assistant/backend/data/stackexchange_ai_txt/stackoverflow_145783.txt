Open source or free testing solution

Is there a open source or free suite that can integrate testcases, tests, bugs and possibly the fixes(source code) together. Maintaining the requirements in this system is not a necessity (though, it would be nice to enter a requirement id for each testcase in a custom field). We are a small organization and cannot afford something like HP Quality Center. We have coding skills (Java, SQL), so if it comes to integration of different tools using Java APIs, it should not be a problem. Similarly, a practical solution using export/import of results/data should also be fine (we could automate where possible). Has anybody used PushToTest TestMaker as part of such a solution.
