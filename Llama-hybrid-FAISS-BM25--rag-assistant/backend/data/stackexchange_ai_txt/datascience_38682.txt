Data augmentation for the inputs of CNNs to identify flowers

I want to make a neural network to identify flowers from images like this: or similar images e.g as on https://www.pexels.com/search/flowers/ I want to use a CNN for this as in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52463538/reducing-memory-requirements-for-convolutional-neural-network My questions are: Which will be better: to put whole images into training set or to divide each image into 4 parts (cutting in midline horizontally and vertically)? Will it help if I rotate/tilt these images and put them also in training set? Will it help if I blur these images and put them also in training set? The main aim of network is to identify which kind of flower it is. For this, it will be trained with images of about 20 flowers. Hence, classification is the objective. Edit: we can assume there will be only one kind of flowers in one image.
