msbuild task error while loading Microsoft.VisualStudio.Coverage.Analysis

I've written a custom task for analyzing code coverage results. While building the entire solution, I get the following error. error MSB4018: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Coverage.Analysis, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. I checked the path specified during the build process and the dll location is correct. Yet, i get a FileNotFoundException. Am I missing something? Thanks...
