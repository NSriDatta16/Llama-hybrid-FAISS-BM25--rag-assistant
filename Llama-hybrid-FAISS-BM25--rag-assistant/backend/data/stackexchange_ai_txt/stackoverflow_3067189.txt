DevExpress also have charting components which should be on par with Infragistics or ComponentArt. For a couple of charts that we use in both a WinForms and WebForms application that required some pretty hairy features, we used the ProEssentials Charts from Gigasoft...The best feature of the ProEssentials charts was that the support was by far the best of any product we've ever used (charting or non charting). We received email replies within 24 hours no matter what issue we had or day/time of week etc from people who know exactly how it was...however, the cost of the controls is definitely at the higher end...
