modeling time series data with large number of variables

I want to model time series data of 52 dependent variable using neural networks in order to forecast these series in future . I have tried some architectures of LSTM and CNN (conv1D) models but my models always overfit as they can't generalize. Does the number of features impact the results of models, if yes how to deal with data with large number of variables ? Is there any models preferred for this task ?
