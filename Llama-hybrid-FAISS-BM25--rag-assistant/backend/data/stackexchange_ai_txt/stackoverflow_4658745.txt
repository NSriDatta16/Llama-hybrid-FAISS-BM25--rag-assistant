The latest C# wrapper for HTML Tidy was done by Mark Beaton, which seems rather more up-to-date than the links you've referenced (2003). Also worth of note is that Mark provides executables for referencing as well, rather than pulling them from the official site. That should do the trick of nicely organising and validating your HTML .
