overtrain the CNN?

This may sound silly: will the CNN overtrain? From what I have seen so far, having many epochs and parameters are the key of success of CNN. And there is almost nothing I found is about overtrain a CNN. However, I have encountered some issue with my dataset. I keep training for a long epochs and the training accuracy is increasing. However, my validation set accuracy is large at epoch = 1 and then start to decrease (i ran for about 30 epochs). Is this the problem of my dataset? Or I did something wrong? Or I overtrain the CNN? So less than 1 epoch is enough?
