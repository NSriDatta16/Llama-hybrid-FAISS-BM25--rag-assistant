My cgi script can't write to cgi-bin folder of Apache

I m working on a python version cgi script which needs to create img files (which will be shown on the web page) in cgi-bin folder. But it fails with: [Wed Oct 28 16:13:51 2009] [error] [client ::1] OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'average/' [Note] 'average/' is the folder that the cgi script is going to create first for saving those img files. I tried giving a+x permission to the cgi script, but it failed still. This happens on both Win and Mac. Btw, I m working with the default Apache configurations. I didn't change anything after the installation of Apache.
