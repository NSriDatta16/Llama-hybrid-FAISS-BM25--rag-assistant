Well its already been mentioned many times now that a DLLImport is an implementation, and therefore cannot be defined on an interface, but I thought it would still be worth mentioning that normally I group by DLLImports into a "NativeMethods" class for organisation, like so: internal static class NativeMethods { [DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)] public static extern int MessageBox(int hWnd, string msg, string title, uint flags); } Example use: NativeMethods.MessageBox(myWnd, "Hello World", "Hello", flags);
