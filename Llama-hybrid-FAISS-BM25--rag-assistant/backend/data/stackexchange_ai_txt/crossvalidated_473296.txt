Why is this code is not implementing Markov Chain

My MOOC course says that this code is not implementing Markov Chain import random N = 20; position = 0 for iter in range(1000000): if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) > 0.2: if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) 0.5: position = (position - 1) % N The goal is to implement a Monte Carlo algorithm such that it remains with probability 0.2 on the present site, and moves with probability 0.4 to the left and with probability 0.4 to the right. I added the log function and sees that the probability is correct. My hunch is that Markov Chain must follow a tabular-rasa fashion, and the code above does not. Tabular-rasa assures equiprobability, but I could not link that to the reason the code is not a Monte Carlo chain implementation. The code for logging: import random N = 20; position = 0 RUN = 1000000 log = {'stay': 0., 'inc': 0., 'dec': 0.} for iter in range(RUN): if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) > 0.2: if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) 0.5: log['dec'] += 1 else: log['stay'] += 1 print(log) print(log['inc'] / RUN, log['dec'] / RUN, log['stay'] / RUN)
