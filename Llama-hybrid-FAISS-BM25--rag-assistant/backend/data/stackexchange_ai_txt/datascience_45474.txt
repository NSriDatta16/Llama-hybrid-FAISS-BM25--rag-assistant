As others pointed out, you can normalize or standardize your data using the following steps. I'm sure other libraries have similar functions but I think this is efficient. Since you requested normalization, I'll cover that topic in this post. As others alluded, data normalization is the process in which researchers or data science practitioners make all the values in a given dataset be proportionally spread between 0 and 1. To implement normalization, follow the steps below: from sklearn.datasets import load_iris from sklearn import preprocessing iris = load_iris() print(iris.data.shape) X_data = iris.data y_labels = iris.target normalized_X_data = preprocessing.normalize(X_data)
