Generally the only difference between "Just Me" and "Everyone" is the location of the shortcuts that are created. If you right-click on your start-button and choose "Explore" you should be able to drag the "Visual Studio" program group from your user start menu folder to the all users start menu. (Not on Windows atm so I can't give precise directions I'm afraid!).
