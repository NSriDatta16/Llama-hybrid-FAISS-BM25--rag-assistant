Sharepoint does exactly what you say. It's built on top of a relational database and offers something that looks a bit like a file-system with a web-interface. This document storage is primarilly geared towards integration with Office and is only a small part of Sharepoint. Document based database systems. Like CouchDB or Amazon S3 are different beasts. They store data in a less structured way than relational databases. Mostly in the form of key-document pairs. You can retrieve documents by key or by querying but because documents are not uniformly structured like rows in a table in a relational database querying can be more difficult. These databases aren't really meant to be used like relational database, they're geared more toward scalability for large web-backends etc. Lotus Notes actually combines these two. You can use it for document management (and email and much more) and it's built on it's own document-database.
