Well , it would make sense if you do some intelligent feature engineering-that way you have a single model for all. For example if you have salary of the person as a feature you could use two features - total salary (sum of the salaries) and average salary (maybe drop one, like average ). All the while keeping the num borrowers as a feature in itself. You should think of it this way does an increased total salary necessarily help you to predict or not ? you could also extract other statistics but keep in mind what makes sense for the problem. This could be a good starting point. Why, Im suggesting this is because we have done something like this in the medical domain for example when using patient reading's for diagnosis. In our case the number of readings per patient varied drastically ... um well you can figure that each patient stays for a different duration. Hand engineered Statistical features (mean ,median,mode) and interpolation of missing values worked best for us... Interpolation doesn't make sense in your case ,Im hopeful that statistical features will work for you .
