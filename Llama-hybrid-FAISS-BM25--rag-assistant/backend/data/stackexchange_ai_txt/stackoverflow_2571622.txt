This is always a bit difficult, you could increase the min-height of your content area, but even then if someone has a really big screen you'd see the same thing. You could use a bit of JavaScript to increase the min-height if someone has a huge viewport but that's still less than elegant. I'm not sure if there is a CSS-only solution to this. If you want to try the above the code I just posted here: Is detecting scrollbar presence with jQuery still difficult? may be of use to you.
