Theoretical Advice It's quite reasonable not to like IDE's, though you do need to acknowledge their usefulness, and everyone has their own most efficient ways of working, which makes sense. Practical Advice You can't deal with recruitment agents logically, I'm afraid. You need to check their checkboxes, and get past them, to talk to someone real. Once you get into a real interview with a programmer, be honest about everything, about why you don't like IDE's (especially DreamWeaver) and then you can just hope for the appropriate outcome. But with recruitment agents you need to appreciate that they don't understand anything about our industry; and you typically need to give them the answers they want. I'd say your are "familiar" with DreamWeaver and leave it at that.
