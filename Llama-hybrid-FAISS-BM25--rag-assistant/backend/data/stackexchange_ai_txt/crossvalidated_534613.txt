Statistical analysis on values that are not exact but above or below a limit (e.g. >100, or <5)

I have a data set with a small number of bioreplicates (3-10) per sample, and I am assessing whether each sample is statistically different from the wildtype control using a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc multiple comparisons. For some of the samples, my values were outside of the range of the assay, and so are reported as >100 or >200. I am reporting them as is but for assessing significance, I am wondering if it is possible to include them in the Kruskal-Wallis analysis, and if so, what value to use. For example, could I just replace the ">100" value for each replicate with the value of "100"? If anything, since these values are all greater than the control group (which has an average value of ~5) I would think that this approach would actually be more conservative in assessing statistical significance, as the actual values are greater than 100. I was reading a similar thread on StackExchange (linked below) but my example differs somewhat in that there is no clear limit of detection threshold for this type of assay, and so I don't think their solution applies: What to assume if exact lower limit data values are not available I'm a bit of a stats novice so I apologize if this is a bit unclear. Thanks in advance for any help or advice.
