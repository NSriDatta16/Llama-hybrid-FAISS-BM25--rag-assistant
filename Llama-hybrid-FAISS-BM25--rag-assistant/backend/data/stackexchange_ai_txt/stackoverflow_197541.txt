redquare is right, inside your function refer to ui.draggable : $(".drop").droppable({ accept: ".block", activeClass: 'droppable-active', hoverClass: 'droppable-hover', drop: function(ev, ui) { //do something with ui.draggable here } }); That property points to the thing being dragged. Note that if you're using cloned "helpers", the draggable will be the cloned copy, not the original.
