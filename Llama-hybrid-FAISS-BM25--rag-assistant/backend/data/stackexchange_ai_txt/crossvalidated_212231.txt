predictor skewed but normality of errors

In linear regression (linearity assumption had been checked), what is the effect if distribution of predictor is skewed but errors are normally distributed? Is there a risk for estimation of coefficients and confidence intervals ? I founded this paper that seems to answer that it's not a problem: Assumptions of Multiple Regression: Correcting Two Misconceptions Williams, Matt N.; GÃ³mez Grajales, Carlos Alberto; Kurkiewicz, Dason Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation;Sep2013, Vol. 18 Issue 11/12, p1
