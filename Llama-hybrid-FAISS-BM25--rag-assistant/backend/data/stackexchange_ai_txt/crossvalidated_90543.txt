I would recommend inverting the scale for both questions. So afterwards, you have two new variables where the polarity is inverted (e.g. before 6 = bad now 1 = bad). Then you can simply iterate of the variables and watch for people who have always 1 or 2 etc.... Additionally, the inverted scales are much better to analyze afterwards - no headaches because 2 out of 10 variables have to be interpreted "ass backwards". As an additional note: Finding such people is remarkably difficult. Maybe the people are ticking in diagonal patterns or semi-randomly? There are programs out there who are generating random answers (e.g. ticking a random box out of 6 each time...) - so the question gets even more complicated. So to filter out bad answers I would suggest your approach + look for the average answer time, candidates with very short times are prime candidates to sort out + check for very short open answers in unclear cases...
