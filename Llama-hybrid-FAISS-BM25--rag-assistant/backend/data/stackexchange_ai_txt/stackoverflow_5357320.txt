Separate the names from the distances. Create a list that just contains city names. _____0______ ______1______ ______2______ city | Athens | Stockholm | Prague | ------------ ------------- ------------- Then create the matrix separately __0__ __1__ __2__ 0 | 0 | 34 | 0 | ----- ----- ----- 1 | 34 | 0 | 23 | ----- ----- ----- 2 | 0 | 23 | 0 | ----- ----- ----- If you want to search, say, a route from Prague to Athens, then you start by finding where Prague and Athens are in the list... Prague: 2 Athens: 0 Then you search through the matrix for your path. (2,1,23) -> (1,0,34) Finally, you translate to cities using your list (Prague, Stockholm, 23) -> (Stockholm, Athens, 34)
