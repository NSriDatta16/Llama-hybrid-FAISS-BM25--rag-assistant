A loss function needs to have a non-zero gradient almost everywhere in your domain. As you say, or imply, this is not the case for either accuracy or recall. You would need to convert your binary targets into reals somehow, eg use sigmoid as your output, which is a real, and the goal is to minimize the L1 or L2 distance of your output from your targets, expressed as reals, ie 0, or 1. It's not impossible to train with a loss function that involves discrete values, but it tends to need some kind of MCMC, variational, lots of complicated maths. Making your loss function differentiable will be significantly easier.
