How will you know which path to choose? You may say that you will look at your commutes time previously and choose one. When you start utilizing data to make informed decision considering all the parameters you are performing data science Google Map real time travel routes are an example of data science being valuable in real life. At every moment when it is analyzing traffic data to provide you the best route its using Data science. As given the amount of decision we take and amount of data available to take those decisions we cannot do that in out mind. So we use huge machines and algorithm to take those decision not only for us but millions of customers. In short, Data Science Utilises Data to either understand what has happened or suggest what to do next.
