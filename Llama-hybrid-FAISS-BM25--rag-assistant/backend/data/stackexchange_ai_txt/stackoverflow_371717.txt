This draws the thick border around the button: static_cast (GetDlgItem(IDC_BUTTON1))->SetButtonStyle(BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON); A more elegant way to do this would be to define a CButton member variable in CbuttonfocusDlg and associate it to the IDC_BUTTON1 control, and then calling this->m_myButton.SetButtonStyle(BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON); This makes the button to which I'm setting the focus the default button, but note that when the focus goes to a control (inside the dialog) that is not a button, the default button is once more the original default button set in the dialog resource, in this case the "Ok" button.
