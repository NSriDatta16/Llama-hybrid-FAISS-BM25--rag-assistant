"Machine learning" is the very general term used when you have an algorithm A that depends on a lot of parameters, and a second algorithm B that acts on A to automatically find the best parameters. Neural networks are a subset of machine learning. The neural network itself is algorithm A; and most of the time, algorithm B is gradient descent. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks refering to the particular case where the neural network has more than a few layers. I'm not aware of a term for "non-neural network machine learning". However, the term "shallow learning" is indeed used when people want to explicitly contrast neural networks with few layers against neural networks with more layers. Long story short, training a neural network with few layers but many neurons per layer requires more computational power than training a neural network with many layers and fewer neurons per layer. So for a long time, neural networks with many layers were avoided. When computational power increased and it became reasonable to train deeper neural networks, this new "unlocked subfield" of machine learning was called "deep learning", and everyone working with deeper networks was very keen to put emphasis on the depth of their networks.
