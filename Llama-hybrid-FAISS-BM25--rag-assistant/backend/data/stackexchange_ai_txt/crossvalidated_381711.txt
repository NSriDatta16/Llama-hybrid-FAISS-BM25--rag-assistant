DTT streams between proximal nodes in a neural network are not false positives, they produce real phenomena, like the pleasurable sensation of Q-tipping ones ears or making funny faces while playing music. Rather, Bowman is trying to increase the precision to detect distal SCs by adjusting for an expected level proximal, spurious signalling by action potentials. The statistical approach to detection of these SCs is to subtract off the expected potentials under the assumption of an unconnected network. To do this, Bowman creates a Poisson model for the count of firing events where expected firing intensity varies exponentially as a function of the Euclidean distance between two nodes. A combination of nodes will be flagged as a plausible SC if their mutual DTT stream is much more than would be expected under this "unconnected null model" where two close-together nodes are expected to fire more often just as a consequence of being close together.
