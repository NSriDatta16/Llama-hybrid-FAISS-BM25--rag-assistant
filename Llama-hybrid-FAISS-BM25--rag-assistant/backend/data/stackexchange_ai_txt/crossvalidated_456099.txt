Comparing Neural Network to ARMA

I used a neural network tool in MATLAB to predict data, and it gave it's accuracy as MSE and an R-value. I used the econometricModeler tool in MATLAB to predict data using ARMA. It gave it's accuracy like this: How can I convert one of these measures to the other to see which method is more accurate?
