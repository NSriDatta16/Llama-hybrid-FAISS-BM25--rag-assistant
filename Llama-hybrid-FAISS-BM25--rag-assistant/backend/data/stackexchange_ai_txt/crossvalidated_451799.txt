What is the difference between the transition kernel and the proposal density?

When considering MCMC, could someone explain the difference between the transition kernel and the porposal density for me please? Proposal density is the function we use to sample from the proposal distribution to generate a candidate value for the target density in the MH algorithm. Transition kernel is a conditional density that relates how we move to $x_{t+1}$ from $x_t$ I have been unable to discern between the transition kernel and the proposal density and would love an explanation please Thank you
