SQLite uses dynamic typing . SQLite will allow you to insert an integer into that VARCHAR(10) column. SQLite will not complain if insert a string longer than 10 characters into that column. As el.pescado mentions, SQLite has storage classes AKA "affinities". If you attempt to insert a column belongs to a particular affinity , then SQLite will try to convert that value to match the affinity. If the conversion doesn't work, the value is inserted as-is. So while your more granular datatypes are saved (apparently) to the metadata table, they are not being used by SQLite.
