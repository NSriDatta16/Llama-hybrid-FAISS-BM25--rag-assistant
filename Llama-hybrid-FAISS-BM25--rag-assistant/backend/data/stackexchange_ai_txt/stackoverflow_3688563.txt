In the link you post you create a 32-bit bitmap so I'll assume you are reading from a 32-bit bitmap (This assumption may be incorrect). Therefore changing your loop to the following should work: char* pCurrPixel = (char*)lpPixels; for ( y = 0; y Things to bear in mind: 1.Arrays are 0 based in C/C++ 2. You were stepping 3 pixels horizontally and vertically each time. Which meant you aren't visiting every pixel. 3. A bitmap is usually organised such that there are "height" spans of "width" pixels. Therefore you should step through each pixel in a span and then move to the next span. 4. As already pointed out make sure you aare reading pixels correctly. in 16-bit mode its more complex
