Found the problem! I did have my image files in the source tree. (in my Ant build, I copy them to the build dir) The problem was that I had not done a recent refresh of the source tree in Eclipse. So the files were there but Eclipse wasn't paying any attention to them. Thanks for clueing me in to the fact that Eclipse should have them in my source tree.
