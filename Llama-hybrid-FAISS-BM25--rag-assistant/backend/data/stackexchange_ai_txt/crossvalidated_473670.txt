How do you combine an image and meta data as input in machine learning?

Well my question is really about text, but image is easier to understand. Let’s say I have some images and some meta data about the images and I want to train a model with the metadata and the image combined, how would I do it? Would I combine the meta data and pixels as one array and pass that as input? Would my model learn properly this way? Edit: Ok well it’s not really about images but about text, i thought it would be simpler but I guess I just over complicated it. Anyway, I’m building a reddit post to upvotes predictor based on title, desc and post age and I’m just wondering how I would design that model.
