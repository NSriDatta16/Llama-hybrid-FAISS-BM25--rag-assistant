We can do Bayesian analysis any time we can assign meaningful number to the ratios of probabilities, even if the individual probabilities are infinitesimal. But no physical system truly works on point-in-times. There is some time period, even if it is microseconds, over which an event can occur. Also, if the size of the "bin" is small enough that the probability of two different events both triggering the alarm is sufficiently small compared to the probability of a single event triggering the alarm, then the ratios of probabilities will be about the same as if you used a smaller bin.
