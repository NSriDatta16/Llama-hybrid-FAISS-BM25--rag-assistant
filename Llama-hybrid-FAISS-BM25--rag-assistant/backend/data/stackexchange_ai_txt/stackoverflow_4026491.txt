I like writing game programs when I learn a new language. I am in the process of learning Clojure and started writing a Spider solitaire player. If you have never played Spider, don't start; it is very additive :-). See http://www.spidersolitaire.org/ . In writing this game, I am getting to use several things that I want to learn: functional programming, concurrency, Java-interop (for Swing), etc. I have also started writing a Bejeweled player ( http://www.popcap.com/games/free/bejeweled2 ), but have run into a problem finding the definitive rules for scoring the game.
