WPF : How to move a maximized custom window?

I'm working on a custom window to add more styling to my application. I followed some tutorials to enable basic window behaviors : Closing Maximizing Minimizing Moving Resizing These are all okay. I would like what is I believe a Windows 7 functionnality : When a window is maximized, I can still drag it to another screen, where it will kept its maximized state. Do you have any Idea how I could do this? PS : The tutorials I used : Create a custom Window : http://www.kirupa.com/blend_wpf/custom_wpf_windows.htm Resizing : http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=256 Other resizing : http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ResizingCustomWPFWindow.aspx Thanks a lot, Regards
