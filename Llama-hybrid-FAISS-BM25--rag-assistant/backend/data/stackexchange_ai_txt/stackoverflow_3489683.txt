You could try to connect the output neurons to controllers directly, e.g. moving forward, turning, or shooting in the ego shooter, or buying orders for the trader. However, I think that the best results are gained nowadays when you let the neural net solve one rather specific subproblem, and then let a "normal" program interpret its answer. For example, you could let the neural net construct a map overlay of "where do I want to be", which the bot then translates into movements. The neural network for the trader could produce a "how much do I want which paper", which the bot then translates into buying or selling orders. The decision which subproblem should be solved by a neural network is a very central one for its design. The important thing is that good solutions can be taught to the neural network. Edit: Expanding this in the examples: When the ego shooter bot gets shot, it should not have wanted to be there; when it gets to shoot someone else, it should have wanted to be there more. When the trader loses money from a paper, it should have wanted it less before; if it gains, it should have wanted it more. These things can be taught.
