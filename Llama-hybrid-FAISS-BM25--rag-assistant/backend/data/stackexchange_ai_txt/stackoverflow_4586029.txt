How to extend the app timeout in Win 7?

My program is for rendering an animation clip, but every frame has to be computed before rendered. It seems that if the computation takes seconds, windows starts to recognize my process as "not-responding" and refuses to render anything any more, although in the Task Manager, the process itself appears to switch between "running" and "not-responding" all the time. I have been searching solutions online for a while. A lot people suggested to delete some registry entries: HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop\HungAppTimeOut HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop\WaitToKillAppTimeOut HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\HungAppTimeOut HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WaitToKillAppTimeOut HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WaitToKillServiceTimeOut But I could not find those entries. And according to the descriptions, all those entries mentioned are about controlling how long the system waits after the user requires to end a process or log off to kill a process or service. So they are not what exactly I want. I guess there must be some threshold to control when the system should start to consider one process as "not responding" and I want to change that threshold into a slightly bigger one. Thanks for your attention and time, any suggestion is welcome!
