Basically every View should display whats passed in ViewModel. If ViewModel is not enough, then I would look for a way of improving the ViewModel creation itself, not the View's logic. All conditionals CAN be evaluated upon ViewModel creation. Of course, It all depends on how much custom-logic in View does Your project organization tolerates.
