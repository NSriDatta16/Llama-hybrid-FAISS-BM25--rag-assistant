Ondra's answer is the most reliable one In my view , addition to his answer I suggest you to use PHP frameworks which will take care of many things for you and you can focus on design and code in an organized way. If you can see all the codes given above are to hard to maintain because of spaghetti nature of PHP coding . CakePHP and Symfony are really good, Zend needs more time to learn . But still If you need this code just for a minor database connection use the codes given above.
