Storage and Logical Model in Entity Framework

Could someone clear something up for me? As far as my understanding goes, the physical model describes how the data is represented in the context of a specific storage medium. The logical model is a representation in terms of entities and relationships, independent of any particular data management technology. How do these two work with Entity Framework? I assume the EF works against a logical model. In which case, where does the physical model fit in?
