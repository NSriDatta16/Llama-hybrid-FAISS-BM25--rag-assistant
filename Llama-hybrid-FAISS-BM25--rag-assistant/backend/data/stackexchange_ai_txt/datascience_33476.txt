Can a Warm-up loss period easily be implemented in Keras?

I am creating a RNN in Keras. It was suggested that I utilize a warm-up period before loss is calculated to increase accuracy down the line. I saw some people achieved this by creating a loss function via tensorflow. Does Keras have any simple way to directly add a warm-up period?
