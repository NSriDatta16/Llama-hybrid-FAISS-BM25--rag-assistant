The URL is incorrectly encoded. It's XML-escaped instead of URL-encoded . The # is a reserved character in URL's which represents the client-side fragment which is never sent back to the server side. The URL should more look like this: https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?type=user_agent&client_id=7316713919&redirect_uri=http%3a%2f%2fwhomakescoffee.com%3a8080%2fapp%2fwelcome.jsf%26scope%3dpublish_stream You can use java.net.URLEncoder for this.
