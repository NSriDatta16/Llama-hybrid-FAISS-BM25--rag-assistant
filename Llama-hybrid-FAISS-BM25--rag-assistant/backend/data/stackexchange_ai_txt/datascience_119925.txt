Is there a reference dataset for contextual similarity?

I'm doing some experiments with word embeddings to try to capture context-aware similarity, so that for example the word pair apple - hardware, are very dissimilar in the context of a fruit store, but very similar in an IT context. My question is if there is a benchmark dataset for this challenge. I've been looking, but I can't find anything. Thanks in advance.
