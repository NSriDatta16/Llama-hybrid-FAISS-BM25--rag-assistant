How to test if a sequence is iid U(0,1)?

I have a sequence of time-stamped numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive. They are not residuals from fitting any time series model: they are just raw data. I would like to test that they are (a) uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and (b) independent. What is the most powerful way of doing this? Currently I am thinking of using Ljung-Box to test for autocorrelation, McLeod-Li for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity and Kolmogorov-Smirnov for overall CDF. Also, for simplicity, I would prefer a single test if possible, since this is going into our continuous integration tests and will have to be interpreted by non statisticians.
