1) Yes, amount of time price stays the same matters. Primarily because it signifies the underlying market condition - sometimes price rapidly ascends or descends, sometimes stays roughly the same over time. 2) Network is lagging because there is no logical pattern that you are feeding to you network - there is no useful data it can leverage to predict. Market is somewhat predictable when patterns in candles are observed primarily because the observers of the patterns take actions that patterns predict - kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. So you are essentially dragging your prediction graph behind with your live data, not the other way around. 3) Books price is not the same as closing price. Books price is just how much people are willing to buy or sell for, but closing price is actually a deal that was made. I would not use books price as a data point as it adds another dimension - relationship between books price and actual price which can vary quite a bit.
