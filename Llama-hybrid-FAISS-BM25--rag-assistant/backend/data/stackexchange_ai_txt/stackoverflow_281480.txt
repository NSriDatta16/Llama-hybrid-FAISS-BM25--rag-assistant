It should be known that there are some significant differences between SQL Express and MSDE. While a number of these differences are in the favor of SQL Express we found that the critical items for us were the ability to run as a publisher which only MSDE supports as well as the lack of a SQL agent in Express. For an excellent side by side comparison see: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/msde2sqlexpress.mspx#EKE
