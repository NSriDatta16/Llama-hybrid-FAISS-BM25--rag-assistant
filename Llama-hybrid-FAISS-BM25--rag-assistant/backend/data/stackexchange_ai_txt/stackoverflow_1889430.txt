This document lists the JAR files required for embedding and is pretty complete. http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Embedding+Jetty I believe you won't need the Ant jar file unless you're invoking Jetty from Ant, even though it says you need it. Some of the JSP jar files are named differently in the binary bundle than that document calls for, but this document helps figure out which Jetty JSP jars to use: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/JSP+2.0+v+JSP+2.1
