" The result: Any slicing and list comprehension operations on a heapified list will yield non-ordered results. Is this true, and is this always true?" No, it is not always true. Although it will be non-ordered most of the time, it is possible for it to be ordered. heapify() produces a list that satisfies the "heap invariant". In this case, it is a min-heap. It turns out that a sorted list also satisfies the heap invariant (see heapq paragraph 4: "heap.sort() maintains the heap invariant"). So in theory it is possible that a heapified list will also happen to be sorted.
