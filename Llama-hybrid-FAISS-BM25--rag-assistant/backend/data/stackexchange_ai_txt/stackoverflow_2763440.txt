Are there Java libraries to do drag and drop

Are there open source libraries for Java to make implementation of drag and drop easier? I plan to make something like the one shown below: The program is Alice, where you can drag some elements on the left and nest them to the right. It's open source, but they did not use any libraries I think. I'm wondering if we anyone know of open source frameworks that work this way, or assist in doing complex drag and drops.
