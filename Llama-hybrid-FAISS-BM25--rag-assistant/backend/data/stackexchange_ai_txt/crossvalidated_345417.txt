Your formula for the chi-squared statistic is wrong. It should be $\sum_i (O_i-E_i)^2/E_i$. When you see surprising or unexpected behavior, it's the obvious thing to check. With a correct implementation of the statistic you should see a progression something like this: Here we see histograms for your experiment compared to the $\chi^2_5$ density with N = 25, 50, 100, 200 As you see, things are much as one might expect -- the $\chi^2$ approximation is rough at N=25 ($E_i$ approximately 4 in each cell) and considerably better at $N=200$ (where $E_i$ is approximately 33 in each cell). In case anyone feels the need to see it, here's my code (done in R) for N=200: X2.200 = replicate(10000, chisq.test(table(factor(sample(6,200,replace=TRUE),levels=1:6)))$statistic ) This is not especially nicely organized, but okay for a quick simulation (I actually had this as a single line but it's a couple of characters too long for the window).
