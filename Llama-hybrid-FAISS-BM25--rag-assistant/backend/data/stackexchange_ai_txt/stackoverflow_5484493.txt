Changing the height of a tableHeaderView hides the cells

In my UITableView, I have a tableHeaderView that should resize itself according to the content. The resizing works fine, however, the tableHeaderView obscures the first couple of cells. Apparantly changing the frame of the tableHeaderView doesn't reorganize the rest of the view. I've already tried calling [self.tableView layoutSubViews] and [self.tableView setNeedsLayout] , but those don't help either. Also tried giving the tableHeaderView from the Interface Builder an outlet to change the frame on that, but that doesn't reorganize the tableView either. How can I change the size of the tableHeaderView, without hiding any cells, reorganizing the rest of the tableView?
