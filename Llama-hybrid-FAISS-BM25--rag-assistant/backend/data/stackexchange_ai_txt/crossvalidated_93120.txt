Here is what you should do Make two graphs: Sales vs. Time for the entire 24 months Sales vs. Time with the second year plotted on top of the first year Look at them. Annotate the dates of any special promotions, or known competitive activity. "December" is usually pretty obvious, but add a note if helps call it out. Go ahead and fit a time series model - any model (there are hundreds). The model may give you a slightly better forecast for the next period (t+1) than your judgement. At least, it'll challenge your judgement. Beyond the next period (t+n, n>1), any time series model is crap.† So forget about quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of sales campaigns or effects of competitors. If you compare actual sales to predictions, you'll find the predictions are crap. Predicting the future is hard, and no method changes that basic fact. You'll find your two graphs more useful. Study those for a while, then spend the rest of your time coming up with ideas on how to increase sales - this will be a far more profitable use of your time that trying to fit a time series model. † You have more hope if you can creating a predictive model based on leading indicators - i.e., housing sales for the prior month may be useful to predict the sales of window shades in the current month.
