A few points. Your model says Logit P = . It's not logit, it's log . Logit usually arises from logistic regression where we are modelling a binary outcome. When the cells are not treated or reactivated, we expect the outcome to be exp(1.892) or 6.63. Yes The odds ratio for cells that are treated with a concentration of 6.25 compound changes with exp(-0.624) or 0.54 -> this equals a 46% decrease in odds ratio compared to cells not treated with compound. Similar, the odds ratio for cells treated with 25.0 compound changes with exp(-1.952) or 0.14; equivalent to a 85% decrease. Not quite. When two variables interact, the interpretation of the main effects is conditional on the other variable being zero (or at it's reference level in the care of a categorical variable). So you need to add "when reactivation is zero" (if it is a continuous variable) or "when reactivation is ____" where ____ is the reference level for reactivation (if it is a binary variable, which I think it probably is) The odds ratio for cells that are reactivated (but not treated with any compound) changes with exp(1.6) or 4.95 compared to the cells that are not reactivated; this equals a 395% increase. Again not quite; for the same reason - it is conditional on concentration being at it's reference level. Regarding the interactions, yes, you are on the right track but rather than exp(-0.624)*exp(0.2175) I would rather use exp(-0.624 + 0.2175) . These result in the same value but the former is a bit more clear (for me). It's a very minor point.
