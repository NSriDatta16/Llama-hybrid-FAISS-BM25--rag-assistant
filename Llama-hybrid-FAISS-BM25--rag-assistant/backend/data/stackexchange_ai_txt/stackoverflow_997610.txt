java: basic web service interface without a web server

how hard is adding a basic web services interface to an existing java server application without having to turn it into a .war, or embedding a small web server like jetty? say, xml-rpc instead of more modern approaches, if it helps. if not too hard, can you suggest a starting point? thank you in advance :)
