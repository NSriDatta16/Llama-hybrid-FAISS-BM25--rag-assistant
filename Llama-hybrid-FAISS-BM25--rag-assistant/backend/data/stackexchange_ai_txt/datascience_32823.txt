Replace the missing part of the features with zeros. I am not sure how this will affect the algorithm though. I don't suggest this. This input may have special meaning as the input in the real data. A simple an most common behavior is to use the expected value for that entry if you have the distribution of that specific feature which is missed. If you don't know the distribution which is a common issue, you can find the mean of that specific entry among your training data and replace it although there are numerous ways to deal with missing data, that's a simple approach due to regression task. Use a decision tree or random forest? Do these have a more natural way of dealing with a variable number of features? It is also a common practice but due to having regression task, it may have so many branches. In data mining, it's a common approach.
