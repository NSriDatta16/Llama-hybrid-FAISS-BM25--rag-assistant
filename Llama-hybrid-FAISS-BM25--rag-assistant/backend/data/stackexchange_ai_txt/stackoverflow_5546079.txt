To get you file located in the "files" dir (assuming its name is settings.dat), use the following method: String filePath = this.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + "settings.dat"; Import myImport = new Import(this,filePath); If the file itself is a raw resource, follow the answer to this question to copy it. (make sure you have permission to write to external storage...)
