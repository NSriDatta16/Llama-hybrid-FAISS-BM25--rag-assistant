Alternatives to Windows Workflow Foundation?

I've been using WWF for a while as part of an internal call center application (ASP.NET), and while learning it was a good practice in understanding how a state machine based workflow system should work, I am definitely not in love with WWF itself. In my opinion it is: Overly complex, especially for use within web apps (all that threaded runtime stuff) Immature (ever worked with that horrible designer?) Anemic in its current feature set Does anyone have a suggestion for a better .NET based workflow framework? Specifically, I am looking for the following features: State machine based (mapping states to available actions) A focus on user permissions (controlling who has access to what actions) The ability to run workflows as timed background tasks (for example, to send out reminders for items that have been sitting in a certain state for x days) That's really all I need. I don't need to be able to "drag and drop" any activities or visually design the flow. I am perfectly comfortable writing actual code once a particular action is triggered.
