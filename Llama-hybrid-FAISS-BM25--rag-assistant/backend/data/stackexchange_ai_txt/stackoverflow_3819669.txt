I would say to take a look on what it is already in there. In my point of view I am pretty much covered with the available ones, and especially in .NET 4, where the DataGridView, Calendar, and DateTimePicker are included (finally). But if you want also take a look in the components from a company named Infragistics. They are very powerful, but the documentation of them really sucks!
