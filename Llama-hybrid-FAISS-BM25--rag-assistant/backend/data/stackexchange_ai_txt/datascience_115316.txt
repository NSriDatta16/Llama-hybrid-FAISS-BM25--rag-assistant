If you are using tensorflow / keras as deep learning framework, maybe the most feasible approach is to use the model with tensorflow.js. Tensorflow.js is a javascript implementation of a subset of tensorflow. It can use tensorflow models if you export them to their json format . If you are using pytorch as deep learning framework, an option could be exporting your model to ONNX and then using ONNX.js . Note that there are ways to "run" Python code in the browser, like pyodide / pyscript , but you will not be able to run libraries that have native components, like deep learning libraries normally have.
