Older version of Internet Explorer supports Embedded OpenType (EOT) files before @font-face was formalized in CSS3. You can find compatible files on sites like FontSquirrel or Google's Font API . FontSquirrel's conversion tool should also help here. Also worth a read would be the latest bulletproof syntax recommended by fontspring to embedding multiple files for multiple browsers. The fact that this wasn't used frequently until recently is two-folds; first there are legal issues with using @font-face fonts - copyrights to be specific. Unlike cufon which only retains the shape of the fonts, with @font-face you are transmitting the actual fonts themselves, which has legal implications. The other problem is support in other browsers - Firefox 3 was the last of the modern browsers to not support @font-face in some way, so before Firefox 3.5's release in mid-2009 @font-face was still not viable. In addition to all that there are differences in format support between the browsers, so the development of the technology is slow.
