If by "regression equation" you mean linear regression, than you are in trouble, because linear models are not well suited for missing data. You could try to combine these data with dummy variables if they are just three different measures of something similar, but not in general. On the other hand you might resort towards different regression methods that can deal with missing data, like regression trees or random forests. See e. g. "advantages" listed on page 2 in http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350-2006/lecture-10.pdf and the accepted answer in How do decision tree learning algorithms deal with missing values (under the hood)
