Probability of observing values as extreme as the observed value, taking into account a known distribution

I have checked all the questions and most of them were not very conclusive, but one which said that it could be done using Bayesian inference: $$ P(observation | distribution)\, $$ Which is not what I want since this is to know if the point belongs to a distribution. I work with networks and I want to check if the number of links k that group A has to group B could happen by random. For that I will generated N groups (each group is independent from the others) which nodes will have the same degree as group A and I will extract the number of links they have with group B . This will end up in a distribution X , which could be considered as normally distributed. Now I want to test what is the probability of observing values as big or as small as the number of links k from the original group. Could this work? The most similar thing I have observed was in the permutation testing procedure, where the probability is: $$ p =\dfrac{(w+1)}{(N+1)}, $$ Being w the number of values considered more extreme (could be higher or lower than k ) than the observed value k . Thanks in advance I HAVE EDITED THE QUESTION
