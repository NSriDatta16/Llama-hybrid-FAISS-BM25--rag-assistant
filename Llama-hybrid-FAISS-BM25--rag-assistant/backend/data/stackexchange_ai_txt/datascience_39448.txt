Different types of analysis which can be done with Webdata of users

I have rich customer data for site usage, particularly the web analytics data. Some of the data fields I have are: Product Usage details Geographic details Session data: Capture what all they did during a session onsite, unique to timestamp User details Device used to login Product looked at/ downloaded Campaign data for promotion of a product Search queries made on the on-site search bar Results of those search queries and so on. I wanted to know what are the different types of analysis I can perform using this data, more inclined towards the Data science aspect of it. I have already thought of the following: Churn Analysis Campaign effectiveness Find out which product is being sold the most and which at which geography User behavior analysis and such. Could the community help me come up with more ideas which i can use to perform analysis on this data? Thanks
