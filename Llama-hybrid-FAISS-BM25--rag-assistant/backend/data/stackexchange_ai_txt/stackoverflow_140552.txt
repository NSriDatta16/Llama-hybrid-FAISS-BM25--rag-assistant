Introduce code coverage tools and produce an automated report from your build server of all the code not covered by unit tests. His name will be bottom of the board. The board should be printed and stuck somewhere every week where everyone can see it. Stop giving him anything new to do until his coverage is at 85% Give the guy at the top of the board the most interesting jobs. Tie your next written warning to a certain code coverage requirement - then you have clear dismissal reasons should he fail.
