Favorite Google App Engines Tips and Features

When starting with any new major library or system, I go to StackOverflow for the "What should I know?" questions. The answers might be subjective, but the advice usually saves me many hours of trouble. So far, I have burned a number of hours on Google App Engine tripping over the same issues that more experienced developers here already know. I eventually found these common issues: appcfg.py uploads do not appear on the Google Dashboard until you select them from the Versions tag. Using cron jobs for keeping an application from being unserved is necessary if you want consistent response time. This gets to be a "tragedy of the commons issue" (Thanks Nick). PyDev in Eclipse works well with Google App Engine. Getting a local version of Python 2.5 for Ubuntu 10.04 is hard. Or you can "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes" to get it. Use VirtualEnvWrapper to isolate your Python2.5 for GAE from other versions of Python used for everything else. Applications on appspot only switch to newly updated versions when inconvenient, regardless of what the control panel says. You should keep a version number in the title or footer to avoid wild goose-chases. So, what else should I know?
