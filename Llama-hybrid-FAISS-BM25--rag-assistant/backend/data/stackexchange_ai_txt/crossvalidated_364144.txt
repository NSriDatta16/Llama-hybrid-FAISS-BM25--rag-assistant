Reinforcement Learning split in training and test set necessary?

Currently I am learning Reinforcement Learning and I am wondering if it's necessary to split the data in a training and test set? Furthermore, in the examples I have seen the models are trained in mini batches using a random sampling from the memory. Since I am processing a time series I am wondering if this is recommended? Thanks in advance.
