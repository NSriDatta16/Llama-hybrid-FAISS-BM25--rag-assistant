Retrieve value of XML node and node attribute using XPath in JAXP

Given an xml document that looks like the following: STANDARD 300 f000-703-GM2-20101109-1550 2010-12-24T02:25:43Z 2010-12-24T02:26:09Z AGENTQMGR I want to print the values of the "key" attribute and the element so it looks like this: agentType = STANDARD DestinationTransferStates = AgentStatusPublishRate = 300 agentVersion = f000-703-GM2-20101109-1550 CommandTimeUTC = 2010-12-24T02:25:43Z PublishTimeUTC = 2010-12-24T02:26:09Z queueManager = AGENTQMGR I'm able to print the node values with no problem using this code: XPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance(); XPath xpath = factory.newXPath(); XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("//properties/entry/text()"); Object result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET); NodeList nodes = (NodeList) result; for (int i = 0; i And I can print the values of the "key" attribute by changing the xpath expression and the node methods as follows: XPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance(); XPath xpath = factory.newXPath(); XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("//properties/entry"); Object result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET); NodeList nodes = (NodeList) result; for (int i = 0; i It seems like there would be a way to get at both of these values in a single evaluate . I could always evaluate two NodeLists and iterate through them with a common index but I'm not sure they are guaranteed to be returned in the same order. Any suggestions appreciated.
