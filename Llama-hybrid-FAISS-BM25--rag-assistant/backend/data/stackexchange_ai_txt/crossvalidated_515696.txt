I think the main advantage is that you will have more confidence in the score. Like with any other statistic, if you measure it many times, and average it, you reduce the variance of the estimation. But it depends a lot on the size of the data, of corurse. You can check out the Python package that I built (mainly for my own projects) that performs nested cross validation: https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining It's the first package that I made, so any comment will be very appreciated.
