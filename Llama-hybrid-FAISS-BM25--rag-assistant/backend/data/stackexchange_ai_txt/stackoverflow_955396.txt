Is it possible to flush output with iText RTF (Java library) gradually? (outofmemory error)

I'm using iText to create an RTF document. It'll have a few hundred pages when completed. However, I keep getting an outofmemory error, when it's finished adding all the various paragraphs and tables to the document, and it's trying to actually create the RTF file (with document.close();) I've increased the Runtime memory with -Xmx350m, but it's not feasible to increase it anymore as the users computer won't have that much memory. Is there a way to gradually write to the RTF document, rather than in a huge block at the end?
