You test the authentication in the tests for the IAuthenticationProvider class. That is assumed to work. In SignIn() you have to consider the _provider as perfect (any trouble will be tested somewhere else in your testsuite) and test the SignIn routine. However, you must test everything that has been tested for IAuthProvider on the SignIn method as well. That will give you the additional coverage that your information is actually passed correctly to _provider, and its result is properly returned.
