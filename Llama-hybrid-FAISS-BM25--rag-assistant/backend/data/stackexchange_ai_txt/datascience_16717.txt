From regression neural network to generative one

I made a neural network with word embedding, RNN and some dense layers to predict the score of computer game reviews based on the title of the game. I used Keras in Python. I was wondering if it would be somehow possible to transform my model into a generative one that would produce titles with high (or low) predicted score. It could be possible to do brute forcing and run all combinations through my network but maybe there is a smarter solution.
