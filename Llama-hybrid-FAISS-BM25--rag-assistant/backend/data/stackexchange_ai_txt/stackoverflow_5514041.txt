Best way of encrypting text to store in mysql database

I want to know the best way of storing text in a database and encrypting it so as to prevent others (admin) from reading it. I'm allowing users to write (up-to) paragraphs of plain text and then storing in a database. This text is then displayed back to the user in their account. This means that I will have to be able to decrypt the data once i've encrypt it and stored it in the database. (I have created the project using PHP) Thanks
