In other words, does the fact that one document mentioned viagra 3 times instead of once really not matter? It does matter. The Multinomial Naive Bayes model takes into account each occurrence of a token, whereas the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model does not (i.e. for the latter model, 3 occurrences of "viagra" is the same as 1 occurrence of "viagra"). Here are two illustrations as well as a comparison table from {1}: {1} neatly introduces Naive Bayes for text classification, as well as the Multinomial Naive Bayes model and the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model.
