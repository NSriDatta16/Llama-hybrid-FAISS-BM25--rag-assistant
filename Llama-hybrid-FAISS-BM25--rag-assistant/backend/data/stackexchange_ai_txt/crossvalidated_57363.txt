Image classifier in python for few samples

I have 150 pictures that represent archeological signs and 5 categories to which they belong. These pictures have features like circularity, roughness and elongation that are expressed as continuous values, and other values like number of end points, number of contours, and angles between segments. I have read that SVM needs at least 100 images for every category to work well, nearest neighbor use Euclidean distance metric that does not consider all features in different ways, mix everything! Alternatives? What would be the best classifier?
