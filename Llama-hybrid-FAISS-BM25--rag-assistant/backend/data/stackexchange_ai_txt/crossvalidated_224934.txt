Sometimes yes, sometimes no. E.g., if you look at http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/conv.html , you'll see some methods that flip the kernel, and some that do not. But to be mathematically correct, it should flip (the downside being it might make it less intuitive). Another source echoing it: http://www.slideshare.net/GauravMittal68/convolutional-neural-networks-cnn "Deep learning" is not the best field for rigorous definitions. FYI: Difference between “kernel” and “filter” in CNN The meaning of tensors in the neural network community
