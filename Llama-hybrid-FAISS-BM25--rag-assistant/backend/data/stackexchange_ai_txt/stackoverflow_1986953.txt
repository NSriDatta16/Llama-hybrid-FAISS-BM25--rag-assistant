Passing bad string as javascript parameter

I'm having a problem passing parameters that I think I should be able to solve elegantly (with 1 line of code) but I can't seem to solve the issue. I have a link to delete items, like so: The problem arises when result.headline contains characters like ' or " or others that break the javascript call. I have tried ${fn:replace(result.headline,"'","")} which fixes issues for ' however I want to do some sort of URLEncode (I think) so that these characters dont break the javascript call. Any ideas on how to fix this without changing anything on the back-end?
