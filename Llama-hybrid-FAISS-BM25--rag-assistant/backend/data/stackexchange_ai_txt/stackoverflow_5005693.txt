In a nutshell... You should start with some source control solution - probably Subversion or Git. Once that's in place you can create a script that generates a clean build of your source code and deploys it to your production server(s). You could do this with a simple batch script or use something like Ant for more control. Here is a simple example of a batch file using Subversion: svn copy svn://path/to/your/project/trunk -r HEAD svn://path/to/your/project/tags/%version% svn checkout svn://path/to/your/project/trunk -r HEAD //path/to/target/directory Ant makes it easy to do things like automatically run unit tests and sync directories. For example: This is really just a starting point. A next step might be a continuous integration solution like Hudson . I would also recommend reading " Pragmatic Project Automation: How to Build, Deploy, and Monitor Java Applications ". One ColdFusion specific gotcha is to make sure you clear the Application scope when required (to update any singleton components). A common approach here is to use a URL parameter that causes onRequestStart() to call onApplicationStart(). You may also have to clear the trusted cache .
