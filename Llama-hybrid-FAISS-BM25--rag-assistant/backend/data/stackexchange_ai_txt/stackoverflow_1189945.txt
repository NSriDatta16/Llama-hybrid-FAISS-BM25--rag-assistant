jQuery sortable('disable') from start event not entirely working like expected

The below code does not fully disable the sortables on the start event. It will add the classes ui-sortable-disabled and ui-state-disabled to the sortable elements, but it doesn't disable the functionality - in other words, the sortables look disabled, but they still accept the dragged item and behave like they are enabled. var assignedSortables; var startDrag = function(event, ui) { assignedSortables.each(function() {$(this).sortable('disable');}); }; var stopDrag = function(event, ui) { assignedSortables.each(function() {$(this).sortable('enable');}); }; assignedSortables = $(".my-sortable-containers").sortable({ connectWith: '.my-sortable-containers', start: startDrag, stop: stopDrag }); The reason I want to do this is on drag start is because I might need to disable other connected sortables that already contain the item being dragged (I stripped out the logic in order to simplify). Is this a bug or is there a way around it?
