Everything looks good from what you've shown. Ensure that: The Assembly really is in the GAC with the version and publickeytoken you specify when you are installing the feature (I assume by means of STSADM.exe) If the assembly is NOT in the GAC, you either haven't properly strong named it with your keyfile, or GACUTIL is just failing on your build for some reason. Ensure that the assembly really is called just "HelloWorld" in the GAC. Go into project properties, see the "Signing" tab, and ensure the "Sign the Assembly" checkbox is checked, and that it's pointing to your keyfile. You can manually install the dll into the GAC by dragging and dropping the file from the bin directory into C:\windows\assembly . Hope this sheds a little bit of light on how to get your dll into the GAC.
