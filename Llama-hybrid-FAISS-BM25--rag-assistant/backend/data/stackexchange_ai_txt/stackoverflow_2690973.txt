How to effectively clip the amount of entries in a dictionary?

I had a List myList for storing a list of items. When I had to clip this (discard any amount of items above some threshold) I used: myList.RemoveRange(threshold, myList.Count - threshold); where threshold is the max amount of things the list can contain Now I've upgraded the datatype to a Dictionary myDictionary How can I basically do the same: Discard all entries above some threshold. (It doesn't matter which ones are discarded) I guess I could foreach through the keys collection and manually delete all keys/value pairs. But I was hoping there was a more elegant solution.
