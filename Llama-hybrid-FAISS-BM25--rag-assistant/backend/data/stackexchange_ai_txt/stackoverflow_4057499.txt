I wrote part of this in comments above, but rewriting here for further clarification. is an inline element. Inline elements can't have a fixed width; their width is determined by the width of the text they contain, plus the margins and paddings. See CSS fixed width in a span You can change this behavior by turning your span into a block-level element. This is done by setting display: block or display: inline-block . But this also introduces other behavior, such as floating and taking up a whole line instead of staying inside the paragraph. This, again, can be countered by float: left and similar options. Weigh the different options and decide based on your needs. In your specific code example, you might benefit from using and tags instead. They were built for exactly that purpose.
