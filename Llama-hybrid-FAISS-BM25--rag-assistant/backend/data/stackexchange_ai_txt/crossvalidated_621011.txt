If the errors are independent of the $x_i$ and symmetric, so that errors of $y$ and $-y$ are equally likely, then: Let $A$ be the average and let $D$ be the difference of the higher and lower observations. If the error is $Y$ , then $D=|Y|$ and $$Var[Y]=E[Y^2]-E[Y]^2=E[D^2]-0.$$ Similarly, since $A=X+\frac12Y$ , \begin{align} \mu &= E[A],\\ \sigma &= Var[A]-\frac14E[D^2]. \end{align}
