With the benefit of hindsight and additional experience, a relatively straightforward solution occured to me and I will post it here in case it is of use to others. With respect to question one, it is a matter of focussing on the relevant differences in trial types, redefining factors based on those differences, and specfiying a model to test possible differences. Rather than focussing on how the trial conditions were generated, let's consider the contrasts of interest. The hypothesis under test was that hands (and potentionally other body parts), would have attentional attraction greater than the control categories. Thus, because left and right presentation is counterbalanced, we can simply focus on whether the probe dot was congruent with a stimulus or not. An omnibus analysis of congruence (yes/no) by image category (hands, hand tools, sea stars, and toasters) will followup pairwise comparisons of the congruence effect in each category would address the research question. lme.hand Estimated marginal means as well as a suite of possible contrasts and associated confidence intervals are expertly implemented in the emmeans R package, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html .
