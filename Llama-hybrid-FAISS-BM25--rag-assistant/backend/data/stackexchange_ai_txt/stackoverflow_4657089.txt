Some complement to the good response of RobertPitt you should really add an autoloader if you start storing objects in the session.If the class of your object is not available you'll get a standard broken objet if you do not have an autoload mecanism for class loading. Then, depending on how your session are stored you should be careful of the size they take. let's say you store it on a very fast drive or on a memcached service, you do not need to worry too much about the fact that this file will be read for every request of your user. If you have slow IO on your drive be careful. Now if you store your session in a database you may care about the insert/update/delete rythm on the session table, some databases (think about MySQL) are not very god at handling an high write load on one table. In term of security you do not have to worry too much about session storage as it is on the server. At least if you (the admin) use disk storage you should ensure that all handled application are not using the same directory for session storage, if not the weaker application will define you security level for sessions.
