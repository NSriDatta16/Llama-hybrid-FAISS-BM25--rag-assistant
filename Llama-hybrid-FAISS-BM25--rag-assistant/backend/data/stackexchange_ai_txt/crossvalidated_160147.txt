Suppose we have observations taken across $m$ different years, $\{ X_{1j} \}_{j=1}^{n_1}, \{ X_{2j} \}_{j=1}^{n_2}, \ldots , \{ X_{mj} \}_{j=1}^{n_m}$ where $\text{Var}(X_{i1}) = \sigma^2_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$ and everything is assumed independent. Then we can directly calculate the variance of the overall mean, $$ \begin{align} \text{Var} \left ( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} X_{ij}}{ \sum_{i=1}^{m} n_i} \right ) &= \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \sigma^2_i }{ \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{m} n_i \right )^2 } \\ &= \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{m} n_i \sigma^2_i }{\left ( \sum_{i=1}^{m} n_i \right )^2} \end{align} $$ You could then estimate this quantity by replacing each $\sigma^2_i$ with $\hat{\sigma}^2_i \equiv \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_i)^2 / (n_i - 1)$, the sample variance within year $i$. However, it's not clear what you'd be estimating with the overall average if the means also vary with time.
