This is an excellent question. Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is the following latent variable model \begin{align} \mathbf z &\sim \mathcal N(\mathbf 0, \mathbf I) \\ \mathbf x &\sim \mathcal N(\mathbf W \mathbf z + \boldsymbol \mu, \sigma^2 \mathbf I), \end{align} where $\mathbf x\in\mathbb R^p$ is one observation and $\mathbf z\in\mathbb R^q$ is a latent variable vector; usually $q\ll p$. Note that this differs from factor analysis in only one little detail: error covariance structure in PPCA is $\sigma^2 \mathbf I$ and in FA it is an arbitrary diagonal matrix $\boldsymbol \Psi$. Tipping & Bishop, 1999, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis prove the following theorem: the maximum likelihood solution for PPCA can be obtained analytically and is given by (Eq. 7): $$\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML} = \mathbf U_q (\boldsymbol \Lambda_q - \sigma_\mathrm{ML}^2 \mathbf I)^{1/2} \mathbf R,$$ where $\mathbf U_q$ is a matrix of $q$ leading principal directions (eigenvectors of the covariance matrix), $\boldsymbol \Lambda_q$ is the diagonal matrix of corresponding eigenvalues, $\sigma_\mathrm{ML}^2$ is also given by an explicit formula, and $\mathbf R$ is an arbitrary $q\times q$ rotation matrix (corresponding to rotations in the latent space). The ppca() function implements expectation-maximization algorithm to fit the model, but we know that it must converge to the $\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML}$ as given above. Your question is: how to get $\mathbf U_q$ if you know $\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML}$. The answer is that you can simply use singular value decomposition of $\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML}$. The formula above is already of the form orthogonal matrix times diagonal matrix times orthogonal matrix, so it gives the SVD, and as it is unique, you will get $\mathbf U_q$ as left singular vectors of $\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML}$. That is exactly what Matlab's ppca() function is doing in line 305: % Orthogonalize W to the standard PCA subspace [coeff,~] = svd(W,'econ'); Can I assume principal subspace is spanned only by a unique set of orthonormal vectors? No! There is an infinite number of orthogonal bases spanning the same principal subspace. If you apply some arbitrary orthogonalization process to $\mathbf W_\mathrm{ML}$ you are not guaranteed to obtain $\mathbf U_q$. But if you use SVD or something equivalent, then it will work.
