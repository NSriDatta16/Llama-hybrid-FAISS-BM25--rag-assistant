The output of cross-validation with LIBSVM is a score. LIBSVM's internal cross-validation uses accuracy as score metric, which is known to be suboptimal for model selection. It would be better to use a measure like area under the ROC curve (which you can compute using perfcurve if you have the statistics toolbox). Your code seems okay at first glance, except that one-class SVM uses the nu parameter, not C . You could use specialized libraries like Optunity to do the hyperparameter tuning for you. It offers more efficient routines than grid search to optimize hyperparameters (e.g. which require less parameter pairs to be tested) and has built-in cross-validation with score metrics of your choosing so you don't have to bother implementing it yourself. Optunity is available in MATLAB ( example ). Disclaimer: I'm the main developer of Optunity.
