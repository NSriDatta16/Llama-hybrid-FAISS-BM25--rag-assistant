The code using the logger should not be involved in the enabled/disabled conditionality. As to whether to use a Dummy disabled logger or just a stadanrd logger that knows it's disabled that's less obvious. Pragmatically I suspect that we'll tend to find that partial enablement is the most common scenario - some destinations or message classes will tend to be emitted when most are disabled. So I'd probably see this as the natural job of the logger to understand what it's configured to do. I would go with the dummy only if this makes logger implementation very much easier and it's a common usage scenario.
