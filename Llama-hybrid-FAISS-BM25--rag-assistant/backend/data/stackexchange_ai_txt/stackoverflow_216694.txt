Structuring a winforms C# solution

So i am reorganizing a winforms C# solution to help decouple and make it cleaner and more organized. The solution tracks a small business orders,etc . . I have broken out the projects so far into App.View - all GUI Related Code App.Data - just data structures and interfaces. No other implementation code App.BusinessLogic - all business logic code that has no GUI references I have some classes that i can't figure out where they belong. Please let me know your thoughts which project each class should go or if there is another project that should get created for this. A Class that retrieves user preferences from a database A Class that retrieves static data from our static data server and returns sets of data results. A Class that brings down user entitlements A model class that stores a hashtable of orders A class that emails out messages on a user action
