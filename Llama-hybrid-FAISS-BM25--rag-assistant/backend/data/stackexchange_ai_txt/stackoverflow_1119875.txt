I found what I was looking for here: (on magento site: Resources -> Magento Core API -> Product API or whichever API you want) The problem is there is no Order API yet (or none that I've seen) http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/doc/webservices-api/api/catalog_product#examples This details how you'd write an external php script and obtain,edit or delete products (or anything else with an API). Modules still look daunting, but I am reading through the (very thin) magento book (the only one available). I hope this helps someone else.
