If by hide you mean to remove it from the address bar than you could use a POST request instead of GET or a custom HTTP header. As a third option you could use a GET request but encrypt the data. Also I suppose you are talking about some custom referrer and not the standard HTTP referrer which might be sent by the user agent.
