LibSVM parameter tuning

I am working on LibSVM to classify user comments as negative and positive. I am trying all possible parameter right now however i was not able to find useful information about these parameters Can you give me more information about them? In addition so far my tests shows some of them have 0 effect on results -d degree : set degree in kernel function (default 3) Tried Degree 1-9 no changes observed. What does it do? -r coef0 : set coef0 in kernel function (default 0) Tried coef0 1-9 no changes observed. Again what does it do? -e epsilon : set tolerance of termination criterion (default 0.001) I did not change epsilon yet what does it do? If i change what should be the changes range? -h shrinking: whether to use the shrinking heuristics, 0 or 1 (default 1) Still testing shrinking but so far no changes. What does it do? -b probability_estimates: whether to train a SVC or SVR model for probability estimates, 0 or 1 (default 0) Did not try probability yet does it change anything? I am using C# for testing. In addition libSVM.dll gives error if i make it run as multi threading. After first task completed second task always throws bad memory error. Can you verify libSVM is not supporting multi threading? Ty
