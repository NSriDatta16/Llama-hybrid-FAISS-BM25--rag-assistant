NSString Question

I'm trying to extract the names from this list: new String: blood cz TheDeAtH TBH DragonFire Scotsman King Kot BobLeeSwagger AffeMitWaffe Jackobo D L fatality Jack bobo telex apa Tiger zip Guronzan noobmaster fear piotrekjankiewi RoCJackal These names will then have to be written into an array. I've done this so far: NSString *newString = [[test componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet: [[NSCharacterSet letterCharacterSet] invertedSet]] componentsJoinedByString:@";"]; //yes there are spaces in the above list, previously they were replaced by ; I then load it into an array: NSArray *chunks = [newString componentsSeparatedByString:@";"]; This works, but for the name "blood cz" for example, it takes blood and cz as a seperate thing in the array, but i need them to be together. Does anyone have an idea of how I could achieve this? I've been breaking my head over this, because Im not able to seperate the strings. When taking the whitespaces out, its all together and I can seperate the strings, reason being that these strings are being taken from a gameserver website, where playernames change...
