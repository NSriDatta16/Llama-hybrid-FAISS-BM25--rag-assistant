Insert HTML to DB via form using php

Greetings, I'd like to insert html via a form into my database using php. Can anyone please tell me what function I can use to ensure something such as This is a test Turns up correctly Turns up in the database correctly. Right now when I do an insert the special characters are replaced with the HTML special character code. Also whats the best way to handle inputs such as this? My code is going to be very fragile against something such as special characters and quotes. Thanks
