Quicksort is usually the fastest on average, but It has some pretty nasty worst-case behaviors. So if you have to guarantee no bad data gives you O(N^2) , you should avoid it. Merge-sort uses extra memory, but is particularly suitable for external sorting (i.e. huge files that don't fit into memory). Heap-sort can sort in-place and doesn't have the worst case quadratic behavior, but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases. Where only integers in a restricted range are involved, you can use some kind of radix sort to make it very fast. In 99% of the cases, you'll be fine with the library sorts, which are usually based on quicksort.
