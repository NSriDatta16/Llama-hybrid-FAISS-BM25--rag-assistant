Well, the first problem is with the keyword assure , if you are dealing with random, you cannot assure , unless you change the logic of the slot machine. Consider the following algorithm though. I think this style of thinking is more reliable then plotting graphs of averages to achive 95%; if( customer_able_to_win() ) { calculate_how_to_win(); } else no_win(); customer_able_to_win() is your data log that says how much intake you have gotten vs how much you have paid out, if you are under 95%, payout, then customer_able_to_win() returns true; in that case, calculate_how_to_win() calculates how much the customer would be able to win based on your %, so, lets choose a sampling period of 24 hours. If over the last 24 hours i've paid out 90% of the money I've taken in, then I can pay out up to 5%.... lets give that 5% a number such as 100$. So calculate_how_to_win says I can pay out up to 100$, so I would find a set of reels that would pay out 100$ or less, and that user could win. You could add a little random to it, but to ensure your 95% you'll have to have some other rules such as a forced max payout if you get below say 80%, and so on. If you change the algorithm a little by adding random to the mix you will have to have more of these caveats..... So to make it APPEAR random to the user, you could do... if( customer_able_to_win() && payout_percent() With something like that, it will go on a losing streak after you hit 95% until you reach 90%, then it will go on a winning streak of random increments until you reach 95%. This isn't a full algorithm answer, but more of a direction on how to think about how the slot machine works. I've always envisioned this is the way slot machines work especially with video poker. Because the no_win() function would calculate how to lose, but make it appear to be 1 card off to tease you to think you were going to win, instead of dealing with a 'fair' game and the random just happens to be like that.... Think of the entire process of.... first thinking if you are going to win, how are you going to win, if you're not going to win, how are you going to lose, instead of random number generators determining if you will win or not.
