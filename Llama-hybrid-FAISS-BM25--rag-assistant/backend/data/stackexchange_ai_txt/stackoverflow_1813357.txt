Just to add to this answer (to build the knowledge base as I'm currently looking into this). There's (at least) 2 distinct white screens related to applets. Deadlock (as mentioned by Tom) - area will not refresh when you drag a window in front of it, so you get the strange tails left effect. VM crash - area will become white, Java VM closes (search for hs_err_pid*.log, location dependent on browser)
