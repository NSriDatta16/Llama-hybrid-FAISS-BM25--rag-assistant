Property list or sqlite for static data?

Is there any "Best Practice" approach to storing persistent static data for iPhone apps? I have an app that reads a dictionary of approximately 1000 items many of which are arrays. I started out using a single plist for this and it has become somewhat unwieldy especially since much of the values are HTML strings. Is there a better way for me to approach this? I plan on scaling this app significantly and I obviously don't want to change my approach midstream. I've googled for iphone data storage and variants but have come up short for anything even touching on a best practice.
