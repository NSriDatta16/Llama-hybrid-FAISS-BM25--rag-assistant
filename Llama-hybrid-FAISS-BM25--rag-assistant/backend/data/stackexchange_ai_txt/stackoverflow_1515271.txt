As others have stated, you can use AppSettings to store simple data. The basics are easy; going beyond them is hard (see App.Config and Custom Configuration Sections ). You can also serialize classes to XML or JSON , write custom storage formats, use databases, etc. Making the configuration available throughout your application is a separate issue. Static classes and Singletons are inherently difficult to test , and introduce coupling throughout your other classes. One option is to create an interface for your configuration data class, create and load the configuration on startup, then pass the interface to any class that needs it (often as a constructor parameter). This is called Dependency Injection . If you're doing this a lot, there are libraries that will make it easier (after you get past the learning curve). See List of .NET Dependency Injection Containers (IOC) .
