From a readily compiled environment it is possible to dump the source files (e.g. Cadence -- To list source files used by the snapshot 'worklib.top:snap' % ncls -source -snapshot worklib.top:snap ) but if you are starting from scratch I am afraid there is no easy solution. I would go for the pragmatic one: have a config file with all the directories that contain .sv files and then compile everything in it. If your project has a proper file structure, you could also modularize this by supplying config files for every major block. Hope that helps.
