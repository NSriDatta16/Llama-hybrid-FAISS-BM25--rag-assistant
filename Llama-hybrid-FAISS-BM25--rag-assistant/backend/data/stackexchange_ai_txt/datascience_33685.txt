I do not think your terminology is correct. What you are talking of id Polynomial Regression which we generally use in Machine Learning. Here are the definitions: Linear Regression - Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable. Polynomial Regression - Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y. The point to note is in Linear Regression it is a combination of independent variables. This definition is used in statistics, so I do not know whether we are using wrong terminology in ML.
