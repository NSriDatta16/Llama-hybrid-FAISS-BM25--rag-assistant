One approach I've used in the past to deal with issues like Robert vs Bob is by making queries to internet sources that can identify the similarities. For example, I don't know about Wolfram Alpha's automated search policy (though I think they were working on an API at some point), but a search for Robert ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=robert ) would identify that it should be matched up with the name "Rob". Also, this is not at all programmatic, but I found that clever use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk works wonders for this type of problem if your dataset is reasonably constrained in size.
