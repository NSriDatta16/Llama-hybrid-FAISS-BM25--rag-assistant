I always screw these up the first time, but you can try this (in the .htaccess on www.oldsite.com): RewriteRule ^/?projects/[0-9]+/(.*)$ http://www.newsite.com/?s=$1 [R] In english, this matches a URL on the old site that starts with an optional slash, followed by the word "projects," then another slash, then one or more digits, then a slash, then any number of characters. It redirects to the newsite, passing that last group of "any number of characters" as the query string. The last "R" tells the rewrite engine to issue a redirect to the user-agent.
