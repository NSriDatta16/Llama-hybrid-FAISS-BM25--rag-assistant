I think Dave is right about there being confusion around the meaning of the word export , but there seems to be some confusion as to the commands involved in his answer. If you have a directory structure in which you see the files that look like the source files in your project, and there are no .svn subdirectories, you have the result of an svn export ... command, and you don't have any repository history , you only have a snapshot of the project. In this case, you create a new subversion repo on your new server using the svnadmin create ... command, and then use svn import .... to commit that snapshot into your new repository. If you got a single file with a bunch of stuff in it that looks like it has parts of the source code mixed in with lots of other stuff, then you got what is called a "dump file". This dump file contains your project, including all history for that project. In this case, you create your new repository with svnadmin create ... , then load the data into a repository using the svnadmin load ... command. After that, you will want to use svn co ... to checkout a working copy that you can then develop in. If what you got was a snapshot of the project, I would encourage you to go back to them and try to get a dump file instead... source control history is valuable.
