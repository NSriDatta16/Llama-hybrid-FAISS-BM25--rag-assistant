Quadratic terms in glmer

I'm looking for some references that explain step by step how to model logistic regression to longitudinal data (repeated measurements) in R. I know that I can use the lme4 package and the function glmer for generalized linear mixed models, and I use it to add random effects. But I've read some stuff and sometimes people add quadratic terms and multiply and sometimes they don't. Can someone clarify me on this? For example, on the book "Applied Longitudinal Analysis by Fitzmaurice", in chapter 14.7, he models the logistic regression for a dataset like this: model1 where: $\texttt{time2 $\texttt{trt.time $\texttt{trt.time2 Why doesn't he simply use model1 ? I run this last model in R and the AIC and BIC are basically the same. This is the type of questions that I'm having concerning the R code on this matter. I can't find many literature with R on logistic regression for longitudinal data, and this all very confusing. Can someone explain me when to use quadratic terms, or multiply/add them? Or recommend me a reference. I also found this topic but it didn't help much.
