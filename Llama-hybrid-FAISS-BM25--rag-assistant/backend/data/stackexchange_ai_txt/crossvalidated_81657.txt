Creating semi-random planting designs in R

I want to use R to create 'random' planting plans - drawing plants manually (CAD) is neither random nor efficient - my aim is a list of plants, within an irregular region, (up to 10,000 plants) with their respective numbers and positions. This would use points (trees) of different diameters, with a coverage ratio for each tree, and a predefined level of how the points attract or repel as in attached image. True randomness would not occur as the points would not be truly independent. The maximum plant coverage (range 50% to 100%) would probably be a circle-packing problem, but where packing is random - so maximum number of circles that fit the region while being as random as possible, the result of this would be 100% coverage. My (unstatistical) mind tells me this number could inform the number of circles for subsequent runs of the model for coverages Before I take this further is this do-able in R, and if so what steps should I take?
