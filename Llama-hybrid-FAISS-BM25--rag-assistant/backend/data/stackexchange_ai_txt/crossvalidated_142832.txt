Providing 1 year monthly data (12 points), how to forecast next month

I got an interview question: Providing 1 year monthly data (12 points), can be traffic, product consumption, etc. How to forecast next month? I am confused. This question doesn't looks like a time series question, because only 12 points are provided. If I just answer using January data in the last year as January data of this year, plus average yearly trend movement, is it too simple?
