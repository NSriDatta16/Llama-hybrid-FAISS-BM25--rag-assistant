Two server setup for online store(Magento)

I'm developing an online store with Magento. The site will be high traffic and will need a two server setup, Testing and Production. My question is how do online stores, specifically Magento handle this? The idea I had is: Take Production site offline Empty Testing database Copy data from Production database. (Maybe ) Test Copy files and database to Production site I know Magento offers a Enterprise option, but this is a script I would like to write myself.
