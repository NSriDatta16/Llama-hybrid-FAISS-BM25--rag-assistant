Here is the basic idea. Let $E(x) = m$ and $E(x^2) = v$ . You want to estimate $v-m^2$ with an estimator , and also estimate the variance of the estimator . (What a mouthful.) Let $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{x^2}$ be the sample average of $x$ and $x^2$ respectively. From CLT, we have $\sqrt{n}(b-\beta) \rightarrow N(0, V)$ where vector $b = (\bar{x}, \bar{x^2})'$ and vector $\beta = (m, v)'$ . $V$ can be consistently estimated from the data (involving up to 4th order sample moments). $v - m^2$ is a non-linear scalar function of $\beta$ defined as: $v - m^2 = g(\beta) = g(m, v) = v - m^2$ . Then $\sqrt{n}[g(b) - g(\beta)] \rightarrow N[0, (-2m, 1) V (-2m, 1)']$ .
