A model of the form Y$_t$ =a$_1$ X$_t$ + c$_1$ Y$_t$$_-$$_1$ + a$_2$ X$_t$$_-$$_1$ +V$_t$ would be appropriate to model a first order autoregressive serial correlation with a covariate that is related to Y$_t$ at times t and t-1. You can fit the model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. You can predict Y$_t$ using the right hand side of the above equation (V$_t$ excluded) with the fitted parameter estimates plugged in. Actually when Y$_t$$_-$$_1$ is used in the model the serial correlation is non-zero at every lag. It will be p$^i$ at lag i. However if what you meant is that you want to incorporate a dependence on Y$_t$$_-$$_2$ then just add a term of the form c$_2$ Y$_t$$_-$$_2$. The quantity p appears to be a model parameter that you estimate from the time series data. The V$_t$ is probably a random noise component. I am not sure what B represents here. It could be the backshift operator applied to X$_t$ and X$_t$$_-$$_1$ but the usual notation is to place the operator in frontt og the variable it is operating on rather than behind. Since you introduced the equation to us it seems that you should know what the terms mean. We have no context other than what you gave us.
