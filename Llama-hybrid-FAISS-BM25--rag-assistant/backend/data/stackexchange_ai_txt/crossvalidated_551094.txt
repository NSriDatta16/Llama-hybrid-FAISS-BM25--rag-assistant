The typical rule of thumb is to use modes (principal components, "PCs") if their associated eigenvalue is greater than one. However, it might be better to use an eigenvalue threshold based on the Marcenko-Pastur law: \begin{equation} \lambda^+=\left(1+ \sqrt{\frac{p}{n}} \right )^2 \end{equation} where $p$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number or records in the data used for PCA. PCs whose eigenvalues are less than one (i.e., $\lambda_j ) or less than $\lambda^+$ are mostly noise, even though they are required to recover 100% of the variance explanation. You should also use the correlation matrix for PCA and not the covariance matrix. Regarding performance of logistic regression, you should use the Hosmer-Lemeshow, chi-squared or deviance goodness-of-fit. You can also determine the percent of objects (rows) correctly classified (called "accuracy"), but it's better to use sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC. As far as your other questions, you don't have to use logistic regression for e.g. predicting sex, which is binary class variable (0,1). Class prediction (classification analysis) can be accomplished with other methods, some of which may outperform logistic.
