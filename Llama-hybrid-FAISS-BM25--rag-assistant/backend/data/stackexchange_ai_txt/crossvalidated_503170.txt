MA model or ARIMA model?

Anyone can give some suggestions to decide which model should i use for this time series forecast? It seems it is MA(1) by checking two plots? OR i can also try ARIMA model to compare each other? The ACF shows a sharp drop at lag 1 and damped wave pattern while PACF should show a geometric trend. From this, we might say MA(q) model might fit the series.
