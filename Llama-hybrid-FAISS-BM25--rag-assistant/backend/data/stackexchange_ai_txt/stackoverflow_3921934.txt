How to set the usercontrol for ribbon window in WPF?

First I've created a WPF application, then I added new RibbonWindows to the application, and called it RibbonWindow1. Now I want to set the content of the ribbon control via the code belowe and show the ribbon: RibbonWindow1 ribWindow = new RibbonWindow1 { Title = "This is a ribbon window", Content = new UserControl1() }; ribWindow.ShowDialog(); But I can't see the ribbon bar. If I remove content the ribbon will be shown, also if I use drag and drop I can show it, but I want to do it via simple code, dynamically. If I can dock the related control in a specific grid cell it will be helpful to me. Any suggestions?
