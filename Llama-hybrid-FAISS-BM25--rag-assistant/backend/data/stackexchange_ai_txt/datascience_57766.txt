What regression model can handle tiny amounts of data?

I'm trying to use machine learning to predict properties of a material during a crash test, but each data point requires physically crashing an expensive toy car, so I can only gather a few hundred data points. The end goal is to use the trained model to figure out how to optimize material strength given the parameters I can tweak in the material, which I'm using as inputs. What type of model would be able to: Handle very few data points (minimizing number of crashes necessary) Accurately learn a likely very complex relationship between the inputs (design choices) and the output (performance in crash) Be able to then be explored to figure out, in as few crashes as possible, which changes to the inputs should be made to maximize the output
