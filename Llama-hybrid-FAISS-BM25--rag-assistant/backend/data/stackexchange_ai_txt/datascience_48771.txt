You should absolutely adopt the first scenario. That's because the transformers that you use have some parameters (e.g. mean and standard deviation in case of standard scalar) and this parameters are learned from data like the parameters of your machine learning model. As you know, you should not use the validation and test data for learning the model parameters and for the same reason, you should not use them for learning the transformer parameters. As a result, you should just use the training samples for fitting your transformer parameters if you want to try a practical machine learning scenario.
