If you're only doing key-value stuff, you might want to check out HandlerSocket for Mysql. I haven't used it, but this overview shows installation and usage. Basically, it strips out all the relational stuff (query parsing, joins, etc) and uses mysql's storage directly, making it extremely fast (but suitable only for key-value storage).
