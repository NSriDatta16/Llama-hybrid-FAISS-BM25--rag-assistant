Use one repository, of course. There might be more shared code later on. What exactly is the problem with tagging? So you have an extra folder in the tag, but it doesn't cost you space. If you really don't want that extra folder, here's an idea for organizing the tree: / trunk prj1 prj2 shared tags tag1 prj1 shared That is, when you want to tag prj1, you create tag1, then copy prj1 and shared into it.
