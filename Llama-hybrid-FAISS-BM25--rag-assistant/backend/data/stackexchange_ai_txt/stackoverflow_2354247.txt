Ultimately the service needs a host. You can use a simple windows service or a hosting application. IIS is designed to do this. I would seriously consider hosting your service (web service or other protocols) inside an IIS hosted process. IIS has management support and the new AppFabric technology builds on this to give better management and scaling capability. As the service itself I'd consider using on open web type architecture, such as REST to give you compatibility with as many different platforms. Are your long running processes a workflow? If so you can leverage .net WF to do for you and WF in .net 4 is completely IIS hosted already.
