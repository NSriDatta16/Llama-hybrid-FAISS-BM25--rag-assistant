The regex you use is very restrictive : Using the \w character class before the @ does not allow the . character, which explains why gandalf.storm does not match In the domain part of the regex, you only allow two "words" separated with a . character, which excludes "mysubdomain.mydomain.net" You should try to fix these to match your more complicated examples. As a side note, when you want to match a single character, the {1} part is not mandatory.
