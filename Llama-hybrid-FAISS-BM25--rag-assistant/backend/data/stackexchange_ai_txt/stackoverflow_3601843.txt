It's easiest to process the language in fewer front-to-back passes. Defining things before use improves organization, too. More substantial definitions can be introduced by a small forward declaration: class Dummy { class bar; // declare first, but not a big deal void foo(bar*); class bar { ... }; }; Sample "B" is not affected by the order of declaration. It illustrates that a default argument cannot name a nonstatic member.
