Imagine (so that the models are comparable) that we fit the same model for the mean using least squares and Poisson regression (or indeed any other model with the same model for how the mean relates to predictors) To further simplify the notions, consider the model is for the conditional mean and linear in the predictors ($E(Y|x) = x\beta$) so that we're comparing ordinary linear regression with Poisson regression (now with the identity link because of the previous assumption). [Further (to simplify ideas), assume the model for the mean is correct (so our estimates are unbiased). This is not necessary though] Then your question amounts to asking "if I use an estimator that minimizes the mean square residual, will that smallest-possible mean square residual be smaller than an estimator that does anything else?" The answer is hopefully now obvious - when you measure fit by the very criterion that one estimator minimizes it must win when compared with anything else So the question then becomes why would you use RMSE to compare the two models? Edit: Note that counts whose mean is near 0 will have smaller variance than counts whose mean is larger (indeed, if they're Poisson, the variance will be equal to the mean). So a large value is less "precise" than a value near zero (on average it will be further from the mean of the distribution that generated it). So why would you weight the squared deviation for all points equally? If you want the most precise estimate (in the MSE sense, say) of the Poisson mean, you want to minimize the MSE of the estimator of that mean (i.e. minimize $E[(\hat{\mu}-\mu)^2]$ ... or equivalently, minimize its square root). That's not the same as minimizing the MSE in the data. If your estimator is unbiased, then asymptotically (as $n\to\infty$) in in most situations the MLE will have lowest variance and so will also be asymptotically minimum MSE. In small samples (for easy cases) you can often compute the MSE and compare directly.
