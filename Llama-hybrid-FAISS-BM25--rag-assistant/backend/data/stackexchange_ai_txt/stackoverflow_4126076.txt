Why wont divs sit inline

I read up on inline positioning: http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/html-css/css-block-and-inline/ And then I created a test page: p {display:inline} .inline { display:inline; } Hello Pete Hello Pete Hello Pete However when I view the page I the middle two divs are not inline, they are one after the other. What I dont undestand is why the second two elements arent displayed inline? I mean they shouldn't be according to the article. Paragraph and Divs are both block level so why are only the paragraph elements going 'inline'? Any help much appreciated. Pete
