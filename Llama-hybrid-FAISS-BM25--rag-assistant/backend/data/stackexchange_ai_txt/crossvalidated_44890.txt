a newer method for analyzing time series and periodic data is wavelet coherence analysis which looks where 2 signals are both in phase and out of phase across time and frequency domains. It is different from the ARIMA models in that it gives only diagnostic information and nothing about mechanisms or forecasting. There is a quite a bit of support for it in the Matlab I assume as this method is used mostly in physics and engineering but in R there is the Waveletco package that has an easy to use version.
