Unfortunately error code 999 is also returned in other situations, so it is not a reliable indicator of reaching the hourly 10k limit. Example of response from Yahoo/YQL: HTTP/1.1 999 Unable to process request at this time -- error 999 Date: Sun, 07 Nov 2010 13:46:10 GMT Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 22:00:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-cache, private Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8 Age: 0 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Connection: keep-alive Server: YTS/1.17.21 I think it would be great if YQL could return a header field with the remaining YQL calls for per hour, like Twitter does. Relevant parts of the HTTP Response Header of the Twitter API: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 07 Nov 2010 13:52:18 GMT X-RateLimit-Limit: 150 X-RateLimit-Remaining: 147 X-RateLimit-Class: api X-Revision: DEV X-RateLimit-Reset: 1289141505
