Parameters of beta distribution with a given HDI

Is there some way to calculate the parameters of a beta distribution, if the highest density interval is known. That is, given $a,b,x$ I want to have a beta distribution such that the probability of the interval $[a,b]$ is $x$ . The reason I need this is that I want to use beta priors in a Bayesian analysis, to show how beliefs are updated by the data. So if someone is 95% certain that the true probability is between $a$ and $b$ , then I want to construct a beta distribution that captures this belief as a prior.
