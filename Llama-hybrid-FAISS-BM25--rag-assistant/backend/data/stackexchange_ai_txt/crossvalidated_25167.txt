Why not just use the definition of confidence interval? You seek an upper confidence limit for $\theta$, say with $1-\alpha$ coverage. Because this is tantamount to estimating a scale and $X_n$ is your test statistic, you should seek a UCL of the form $cX_n$ for some universal constant $c$. All this means (by definition) is that $$1-\alpha = {\Pr}_\theta[c X_n \ge \theta] = {\Pr}_\theta[X_n \ge \theta/c] = 1-\left(\frac{1}{c}\right)^n.$$ The solution is $c = \alpha^{-1/n}$. Interestingly, a lower confidence limit for $\theta$ can be found in the same way, in the form LCL = $b X_n$ with $b = (1-\alpha)^{-1/n}$. This confidence interval never contains $\hat{\theta} = X_n$! For example, suppose $n=10$ and we seek a (symmetric) two-sided 95% confidence interval, so that $\alpha = 0.025$. Thus $c=1.446126$ and $b=1.002535$: we have 95% confidence that the limit of the underlying uniform distribution, $\theta$, lies between 1.446 and 1.003 times the largest of 10 iid draws from that distribution. As a test (in R): # Specify the confidence. alpha This (reproducible) example yields 95.05%, as close as one can hope to the nominal coverage of 95%.
