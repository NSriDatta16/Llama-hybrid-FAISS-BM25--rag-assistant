Customer time series analysis

Statistically speaking, If I have 720 0000 unique customer information, how best can I sample from this population such that it is a representative of the whole data set? Also how large should my number of observations be? Does it make statistical sense to build a time series model based on a sample and use that model to make predictions on the whole data set?
