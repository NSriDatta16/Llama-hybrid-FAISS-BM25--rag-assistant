Ok, here is another way (which is certainly not as elegant or concise than the other ones, but it has the merit of not requiring Emacs to check parenthesis matches :-) Let's say we have a vector of predictors of interest like this > Xs Then, we can just use > allXs where > unlist(allXs) gives you all 15 combinations of the X's. Another option is to just change the right-hand side of a formula, say fm so as to reflect the different combinations that you enumerate in your comb_list object. This can be done using the Formula package: > fm fm2 foo foo(1:2) Y ~ X1 + X2 > foo(c(1,3,4)) Y ~ X1 + X3 + X4
