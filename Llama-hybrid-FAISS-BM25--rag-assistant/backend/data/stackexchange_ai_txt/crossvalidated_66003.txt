I do not know much about this topic, but since I found your references very interesting, I felt obliged to give something in return. It appears to me that a reasonable starting point is: Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A. (2000). Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis (2nd ed.). Chapman & Hall/CRC. For instance, they mention the following in the Preface A principal reason for the ongoing expansion in the Bayes and EB statistical presence is of course the corresponding expansion in readily-available computing power, and the simultaneous development in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and software for harnessing it. Our desire to incorporate many recent developments in this area provided one main impetus for this second edition. For example, we now include discussions of reversible jump MCMC, slice sampling, structured MCMC, and other new computing methods and software packages. Best.
