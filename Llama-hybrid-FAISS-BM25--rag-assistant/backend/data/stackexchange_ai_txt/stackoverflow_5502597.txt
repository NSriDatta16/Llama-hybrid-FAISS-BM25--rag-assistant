Just a guess: you want the fade-in to start only after the image is available? Try this: function Display_Load() { var img = new Image(); img.onload = function() { $("#loading").fadeIn(900); $("#loading").html(' '); }; img.src = '../images/loadinganimation.gif'; } If the issue is that you want the image to show up before the content is loaded, then the problem is that the call to "fadeIn" will cause the to be made invisible before it's made visible. In other words, the first thing "fadeIn" does is to hide the element so that it can actually "fade in" to view.
