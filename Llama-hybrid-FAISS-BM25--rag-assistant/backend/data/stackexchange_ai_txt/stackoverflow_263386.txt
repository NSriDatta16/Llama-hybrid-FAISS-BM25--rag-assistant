This may be an open-ended question, but an important one none-the-less. Borland/Code Gear has not had a consistent track record with Delphi releases and I settled on Delphi 7 for much longer than expected, as did many in the Delphi community. Delphi 7 had an awesome help system, sadly abandoned by Borland thanks to some unmentionable internal politics. A year ago we moved to Delphi 2007 for Win32 when Code Gear appeared the re-focus on native Win32 code. This seems to have been a good move for them and has produced product equal to, or even better than Delphi 7. Admittedly, the help in Delphi 2007 is awful and Code Gear have acknowledged this as an issue. An issue that has been rectified with the release of Delphi 2009. We have recently taken Delphi 2009 on and are currently migrating our code to the new Unicode platform. Code Gear has moved fast to establish D2009 as a solid, reputable development platform with Update 1 already out, addressing initial user-reported issues. This is very encouraging. Delphi 2007/2009 makes for one of the best native dev platforms for Vista/2008 whilst maintaining seamless backward compatibility in older Win32 platforms. We depend on Delphi for developing real-time television automation software. The simple answer to your question is - Yes. Only wait for the next incarnation of Delphi if you want native 64bit.
