You could create a data file of filenames, treat each one as an individual record, and then read each file. In the "SELECT ...ASSIGN" you would need to use a working-storage variable for the filename and move the value from the 'file of filenames' into it. As you are using VisualAge, I assume in UNIX, you might also be able to run the program from the shell (sh,ksh), with the filename as a parameter, and repeatedly run the program from the shell for each file name.
