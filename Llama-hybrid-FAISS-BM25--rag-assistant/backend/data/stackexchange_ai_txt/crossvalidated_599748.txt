The best way to determine what percentile a range of numbers closely aligns with?

I have a table of ~600 numbers and percentiles like below: Data 40th 50th 60th 70th 80th 90th 71 53 55 57 60 63 68 101 78 81 83 88 92 102 121 89 94 98 105 110 123 209 146 153 163 171 176 189 68 71 74 77 81 85 92 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... What I want to know is what would be the best way to determine which percentile the 'Data' column falls closest to. On first glance, it looks to be the 90th percentile. I calculated the percent difference between each Data number and each percentile in their own columns, then I took the average of each of those columns (only considering percent differences in the range -100% 40th % Diff 50th % Diff 60th % Diff 70th % Diff 80th % Diff 90th % Diff -25% -23% -20% -15% -11% -4% -23% -20% -18% -13% -9% 1% -26% -22% -19% -13% -9% 2% -30% -27% -22% -18% -16% -10% 4% 9% 13% 19% 25% 35% ... ... ... ... ... ... Percentile Average % Diffs 40th -21% 50th -18% 60th -14% 70th -10% 80th -6% 90th 2% Or is my methodology off? Is there a better way of trying to determine which percentile is closest to the 'Data' column?
