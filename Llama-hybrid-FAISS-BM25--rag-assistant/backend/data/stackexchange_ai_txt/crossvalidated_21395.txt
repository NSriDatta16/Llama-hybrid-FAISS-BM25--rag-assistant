What machine learning algorithm can be used to predict the stock market?

Alternatively, to predict foreign exchange markets. I know this can get pretty complicated, so as an introduction, I'm looking for a simple prediction algorithm that has some accuracy. (It's for a M.Sc. university project that lasts four months) I've read that a multi-layer neural network might be useful. Any thoughts on that? In addition, semantic analysis of social media may provide insight into market behavior which influences the stock market. However, semantic analysis is a bit outside the scope of the project at the moment.
