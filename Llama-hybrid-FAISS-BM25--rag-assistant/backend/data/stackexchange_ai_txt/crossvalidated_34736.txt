Can one compare the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis?

I have been asked to compare an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to one based on a hypothesized model. The answer in Why would the results of PCA differ from a confirmatory factor analysis? seems to suggest that this is not conventionally done. I have very little knowledge of this field, but it seems reasonable to want to compare how a model based on prior assumptions/knowledge compares to the one returned by an EFA. Can anyone expound on this and point me to some specific references? Also can this be done in R (or SAS)?
