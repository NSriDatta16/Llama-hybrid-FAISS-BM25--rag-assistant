How useful is learning GWT?

I develop web applications and in my job so far, I have been waging battles with various browsers whenever some JS or CSS quirks happen. I believe using GWT will help me tremendously from what I understand from this description: Writing web apps today is a tedious and error-prone process. Developers can spend 90% of their time working around browser quirks. In addition, building, reusing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases and AJAX components can be difficult and fragile. Google Web Toolkit (GWT) eases this burden by allowing developers to quickly build and maintain complex yet highly performant JavaScript front-end applications in the Java programming language. What is the general opinion on GWT? How easy is it to learn and use it? EDIT: I am a Java developer!
