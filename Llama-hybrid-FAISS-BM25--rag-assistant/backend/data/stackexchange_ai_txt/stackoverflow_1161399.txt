Most elegant way to deal with singles/plurals?

Say you're making a blog software, and want to show the number of comments an entry got. You might do it this way: [Entry title] [Content........] [ Comments] Which might result in: [Entry title] [Content........] 5 Comments But if an entry had only 1 comment, I want the line to say 'Comment' rather than 'Comments'. And in-line if/else s are ugly and repetitive. What's the best way to deal with this?
