First of all, a choropleth may not yield a truthful or even useful visualization for your task because region area size would not necessarily correlate well with funding size and the socioeconomic index. A better alternative would be a Dorling cartogram . These days, D3.js or Vega.js can be used for implementation in JavaScript - the above example was implemented using the older protovis. For the sole purpose of visualisation, this also answers your original question because all of a sudden you have two valid encoding channels at your disposal instead of just one: size , for either funding budget or socioeconomic index, and color / brightness . Since both variables are quantitative, you will have to decide which variable to encode with color / brightness and whether to bin the said variable or to use a gradient scale - a bit of experimentation should shed some light on this minor issue. It appears from your post that you may have several variables for measuring funding size. Here, an analysis of correlation with the socioeconomic index would help to select the most appropriate one(s). The other road would be dimension reduction using PCA.
