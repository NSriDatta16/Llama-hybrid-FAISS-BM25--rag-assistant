Should I draw the conclusions from average or individual data? Is this approach using Pearson CC correct?

I have made some research and I acquired the following data: 40 "packs" of data each "pack" contains 10 scores of variable A and 10 scores of variable B A is always 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 B is a measurement result and scores in 0-100% My thesis is: the higher A, the lower B. Now, having all this info, I have used Shapiro-Wilk test on every "pack" to deremine normality and p value was always > 0.05. Based on the data I have and the results of SW test, I concluded that Pearson Correlation Coefficient is the right choice here. I calculated the correlation and that's where I am at this moment. Question 1: Can I calculate the average of B for every A (i.e. avarege of B where A = 1 from all "packs", repeat for all rows 1-10) and then use Pearson to calculate the correlation of the averages? Is this valid approach? Question 2: Are there any other statistics that may be important for my thesis and this set of data apart from correlations? Question 3: Should I draw a conclusion from all the individual results? Or from the average? Or maybe something else? I am not a statistician in my daily work, so I would be very grateful for any help. Thank you.
