Feature extraction is always a challenge and the less addressed topic in literature, since it's widely application dependant. Some ideas you can try: Raw data, measured day-by-day. That's kind of obvious with some implications and extra preprocessing (normalisation) in order to make timelines of different length comparable. Higher moments: skewness, kurtosis, etc Derivative(s): speed of evolution Time span is not that large but maybe it is worth trying some time series analysis features like for example autocorrelation. Some customised features like breaking timeline in weeks and measure the quantities you already measure in each week separately. Then a non-linear classifier would be able to combine e.g first-week features with last-week features in order to get insight of evolution in time.
