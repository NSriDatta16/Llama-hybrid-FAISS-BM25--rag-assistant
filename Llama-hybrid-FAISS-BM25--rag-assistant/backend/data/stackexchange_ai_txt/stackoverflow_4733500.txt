copy and pasting directly from this stackoverflow answer The APIs you are looking for are in UIResponder: - (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)motionCancelled:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; Generally you just implement this: - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (event.type == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { //Your code here } } in your UIViewController subclass (UIViewController is a subclass of UIResponder). Also, you want to handle it in motionEnded:withEvent:, not motionBegan:withEvent:. motionBegan:withEvent: is called when the phone suspects shaking is happening, but the OS can determine the difference between a user purposefully shaking, and incidental shaking (like walking up the stairs). If the OS decides it was not a real shake after motionBegan:withEvent: is called it will call motionCancelled: instead of motionEnded:withEvent:.
