Dot product of query and key vector would give us how closely are the words related to each other which is exactly what we need in self-attention layer. Well, we want the layer to output more than a scalar score. We want it to output a vector of "features". For example, if I type a query into a search engine and it tells me that the score of the best-matching webpage is 0.94... well that doesn't really help, I want the actual content of the webpage. There are attention mechanisms which combine the key and value vector in one, but they still output a vector.
