There are the obvious benefits that one day search engines might use them or microdata to associate more meaning to your site. I'm not totaly sure if that is the case yet, but some of the other answers so far provide some good links to answer that question. Another benefit is cleaner markup. It helps to clean up the div soup that solved so many of our organization issues with HTML 4.01. Take this example: Example Blog Post Blog text goes here... Posted in example category. is not as readable or as clean as: Example Blog Post Blog text goes here... Posted in example category. Cleaner markup will make maintaining the markup a lot easier and that is always a benefit in my opinion.
