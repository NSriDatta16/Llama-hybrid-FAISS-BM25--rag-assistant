w3 operating system statistics (win 2000: 0.7%) w3 counter operating system statistics (win 2000: 0.54%) Frankly, its going to be a lot of work to support those operating systems, and unless you have specific reason to, you probably shouldn't. You should probably just support XP and up for an "average" windows application, as that won't be difficult to code, and because the next earliest version, win 2003, is below 2% in both of those charts. :D Also possibly of interest: .net framework installation statistics deployment rate of the .net framework
