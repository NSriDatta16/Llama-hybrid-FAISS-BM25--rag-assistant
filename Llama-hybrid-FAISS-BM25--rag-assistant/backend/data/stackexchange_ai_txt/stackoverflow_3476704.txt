What is the correct term for an implementation of an interface that delegates method calls to a collection of the same interface?

I have an interface thus: public interface Doer { public void do(Object arg); } And I have an implementation that keeps a list of Doers , and does whatever on each: public class DoerCollectionThing implements Doer { private List doers.... public void addDoer(Doer d) { doers.add(d); } public void do(Object arg) { for (Doer d : doers){ d.do(arg); } } } So, what do I call DoerCollectionThing ? Is it a DoerAggregator ? Or maybe DoerCollectionDoer ? What do you all use for this type of thing?
