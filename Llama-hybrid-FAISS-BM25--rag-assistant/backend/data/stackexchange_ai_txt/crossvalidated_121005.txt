Assume the "twofold" decomposition model where the mean outcome difference is accounted for by i) group differences in the predictor variables; and ii) an unexplained component. Additionally, you are interested in the detailed contributions of each predictor variable to both i) and ii) . That is, you want to know how much group differences for each $X_i$ contribute to the explained component and how much differing returns to $X_i$ (i.e. coefficients) is related with the unexplained component. (You don't show complete results, nor Stata code, but this seems to be your case.) Now take a simple model with one predictor: $Y_l = \beta_{0l} + \beta_{1l} X_l + \epsilon_l$ where $l \in \{A,B\}$ and $A, B$ denote two different groups. Under some assumptions, the unexplained component (ii) of this model, can be written as $\hat{U} = (\hat{\beta}_{0A} - \hat{\beta}_{0B}) + (\hat{\beta}_{1A} - \hat{\beta}_{1B}) \bar{X}_B$ where $\hat{\beta}$s denote estimated coefficients and $\bar{X}$ the mean of $X$. Your question involves the difference in the intercept terms of both groups and its relation to the unexplained component. That corresponds precisely to the first term in the right-hand-side of the last equation, and is interpreted as the contribution of "group membership" to the unexplained gap of the outcome variable between groups $A$ and $B$. The second term is the contribution of differing returns to $X$. Succinctly: of the unexplained component, there is one part due to the difference between the intercept of the equations for those in group $A$ and $B$. This is the difference in $Y$ due to "group membership" alone; that is, by virtue of agents belonging to two different groups, and nothing else. References: Jann, Ben (2008).
