How do I deploy to nexus (hosted by secureci)?

Like recommended in a previous SO-Answer I'm running a VmWare image of secureci as a preconfigured development infrastructure containing maven, nexus, hudson, svn. Now I want to configure maven on my Windows XP machine to deploy its artifacts to nexus. But when I configure my pom.xml like this (taken from Deploying Artifacts to Nexus ): nexus RepositoryProxy scp://192.168.0.197/nexus/content/repositories/releases nexus RepositoryProxy scp://192.168.0.197/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots ... mvn deploy prints the error message: Error deploying artifact: Exit code: 1 - mkdir: cannot create directory `/nexus': Permission denied In settings.xml I configured username and password like this: nexus tangens ******** Question: What configuration do I have to use for deploying to nexus? I already tried https instead of scp , but with this maven ran into problems with missing certificates. I tried http instead of scp , but secureci has a firewall installed to block access to port 80 (http), causing a timeout. EDIT: I found that nexus stores its artifacts at /root/sonatype-work/nexus/storage/snapshots/ . But I don't like the idea to enter the credentials of the root account in my settings.xml . EDIT: Q: Did you enabled deployment for a hosted repository under Nexus? Yes, it's enabled by default. Q: Is Nexus listening on port 80? There is an apache running on port 80. Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) DAV/2 SVN/1.4.6 mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g mod_wsgi/1.3 Python/2.5.2 Q: If a firewall is not allowing HTTP, why don't you just add an exception for HTTP connections from the "host" IP? Because I assumed SecureCI is well configured and there should be a way to do it without tweaking the installation. But perhaps I'm too naive here.
