Looking for guidance on embedded .NET database (such as db4o, NHibernate, or RavenDB)

I have an object model that I want to store using an embedded database. I have so far been looking at db4o, NHibernate to SQLCE (w/ linq), and RavenDB. This would be used in a desktop C# application. The key features I am looking to leverage are: Linq or similar for queries (no SQL or HQL), Embedded data engine, pocos, poco first model, no install (no registry or similar) Can any one suggest one? Are the three I am looking at the best choices? Are there other options? Of the three, can anyone recommend one over the other? Thanks
