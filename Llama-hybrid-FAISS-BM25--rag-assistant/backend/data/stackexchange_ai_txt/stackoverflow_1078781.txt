I think the original poster is asking how to detect that the computer hardware supports virtualisation, not that it is running inside a virtual machine. See this question for a possible answer. Also, it might be worth seeing if you can check the CPU flags, as there will either be the Intel vmx flag or the AMD svm flag if the processor supports virtualisation extensions. I can't say I know how this should be done under Windows, but the information is available in /proc/cpuinfo on Linux.
