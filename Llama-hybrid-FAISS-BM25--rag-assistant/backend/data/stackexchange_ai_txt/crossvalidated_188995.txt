MA process formula explained

I'm currently reading about moving average processes. According to my textbook, the following applies: $$y_t=\mu + \epsilon_t -\theta_1\epsilon_{t-1}-...-\theta_q \epsilon_{t-q}$$ Questions on formula: -Does this presuppose a constant process, since we only have $\mu$ and error terms in the formula? -Is this in any way related to the simple moving average ($M_T=\frac {y_T + y_{T-1}+...+y_{T-N+1}}{N}$)? -Why do we subtract the weighted values, instead of adding everything up and dividing with the number of time points (as shown above)?
