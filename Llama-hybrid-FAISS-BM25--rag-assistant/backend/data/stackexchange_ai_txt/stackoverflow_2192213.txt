Your application should almost certainly not be including any javax.* classes within itself - these are usually handled by the appserver. If you do this, you end up with ClassCastExceptions just like this. You need to stop maven from dragging in stuff like xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar , it doesn't belong inside your application. If you fix that, then you won't need to worry about weblogic-specific classloader settings.
