In a generic heap where allocations of different sizes are mixed, then of the two I'd go for putting the allocation in the smallest block that can accomodate it (to avoid reducing the size of the largest block we can allocate before we need to). There are other ways of implementing a heap however that would make this question less relevant (such as the popular dlmalloc by Doug Lea - where it pools blocks of similar sizes to improve speed and reduce overall fragmentation). Which solution is best always comes down to the way the application is performing its memory allocations. If you know an applications pattern in advance you should be able to beat the generic heaps both in size and speed.
