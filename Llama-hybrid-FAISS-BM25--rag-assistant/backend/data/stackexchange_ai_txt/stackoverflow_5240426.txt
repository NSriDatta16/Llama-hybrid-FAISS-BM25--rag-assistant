Advice on MVC pattern for WinForms app

I'm writing a Windows version of my Mac app (C# Winforms) and would like some advice on what design pattern to use. My Mac app uses an MVC pattern with Core Data for storage. This is a simplified diagram of the models and relationships: The desktop app collects logs on a background thread and periodically uploads them to my web app. The database is used to store both the user's account information and logs, and the app has a 3 views to display (and collect) the user's data. I've done some reading and it seems that MVP is the recommended design pattern for WinForms apps, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. I think that my app is simple enough to write without using an external framework like MVC# but as I have never made a WinForms app before I am only speculating. Can someone recommend the best way to go about this?
