The query you listed is how the final query will look like? (So they have the apcatnum=/ID/ ?) where poster_data.apnumber=poster_prodcat.apnumber and poster_categories.apcatnum=poster_prodcat.apcatnum and poster_prodcat.apcatnum='623' poster_prodcat.apcatnum='623' will vastly decrease the data-set mysql has to work on, thus this should be the first parsed part of the query. Then go on to swap the where-comparisons so those minimizing the data-set the most will be parsed first. You may also want to try sub-queries. I’m not sure that will help, but mysql probably won’t first get all 3 tables, but first do the sub-query and then the other one. This should minimize memory consumption while querying. Although this is not an option if you really want to select all columns (as you’re using a * there).
