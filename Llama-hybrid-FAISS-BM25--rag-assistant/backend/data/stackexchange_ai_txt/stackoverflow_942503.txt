Yea, you should absolutley have a base class (or at the very least an interface) that defines all the common methods needed across all Tools. Try to make this code work, and it'll give you a good idea of how to design your classes: m_DragManager.DragType = CurrentTool.DragType; m_DragManager.StartDrag(mousePos); where "CurrentTool" is an instance of your base class or your interface. So basically, when a "Tool" is selected, at that point you determine which derived Tool you're dealing with, but from that point on, you deal with the base class only, and forget about any enums or anything like that to determine the currently selected tool. Make sense?
