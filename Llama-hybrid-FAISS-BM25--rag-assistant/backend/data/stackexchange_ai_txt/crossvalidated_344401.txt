An attempt to answer your questions, please correct me if I'm wrong. Standard deviation is only one particular way of measuring variation. 5 The measure for variation should match your distribution or optimization strategy. You could be right that for a given experiment, it does not correctly measure the variation as intended. As Frank Harrell mentioned in his comment, SD assumes symmetry of the distribution. From the perspective of (statistical) machine learning / deep learning: "Solving an optimization problem with respect to a function requires a mathematical tool called calculus of variations. (..) Different cost functions give different statistics." 1 In this context the error is often measured via mean absolute error 2 and mean squared error 3 , but others are possible (MAPE, sMAPE, ...), depending on what is being optimized. Another interesting resource on pitfalls when comparing models: 4 . Regarding the side question: this would totally depend on the underlying distribution. It could be that 30 year of data is not even close to the distribution of the climate change in the bigger picture, or, for example, it could be that the underlying distribution is easily represented with a linear model through the means of the last five years. We can not really be sure. We can only draw conclusions when our model is a good enough representation of the underlying distribution.
