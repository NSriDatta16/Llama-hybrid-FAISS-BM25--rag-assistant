You using bigram approach with characters, but usually it applied to words, because the output will be more meaningful if we use just simple generator as in your case). 1) From my point of view you doing all right. But may be you should try slightly randomize selection of the next node? E.g. select random node from 5 highest. I mean if you always select node with highest probability your output string will be too uniform. 2) I've done exactly the same homework at my university. I think the point is to show to the students that Markov chains are powerful but without extensive study of application domain output of generator will be ridiculous
