Basic idea: because the constant factor hidden in the O(n) would increase as n increases, and would therefore be not-constant and create a contradiction. One of the downsides of the Big-O notation is that it encourages misconceptions like the subject of your question. O(n) + O(n) suggests you are adding the class of linear functions to itself, but what it really means is "the class of the sum of any two linear functions". The sum is linear again, which is nice, but that result happens to depend on there being only two (or any constant number) of summed linear functions. So, in context, your question actually means 'why is the sum of increasing numbers of linear functions not also linear?'. The proof sketch is pretty simple: ' - Assume, for simplicity, that all linear functions are of the form f(n) = c*n, c >= 1 - Suppose we have an increasing-as-N-increases set of summed linear functions - Assume the sum of that set of functions is linear, ie. of the form c*n - Try to find a value of c that works for all values of N - But, for any c that works for N=x, it will fail for N=x+1 because there is another addition - Contradiction - The sum of the set of functions is not linear
