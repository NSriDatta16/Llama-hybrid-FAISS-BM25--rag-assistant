I recommend these books - they are highly rated on Amazon too: "Text Mining" by Weiss "Text Mining Application Programming", by Konchady For software, I recommend RapidMiner (with the text plugin), free and open-source. This is my "text mining process": collect the documents (usually a web crawl) [sample if too large] timestamp strip out markup tokenize: break into characters, words, n-grams, or sliding windows stemming (aka lemmatization) [include synonyms] see porter or snowflake algorithm pronouns and articles are usually bad predictors remove stopwords feature vectorization binary (appears or doesnâ€™t) word count relative frequency: tf-idf information gain, chi square [have a minimum value for inclusion] weighting weight words at top of document higher? Then you can start the work of classifying them. kNN, SVM, or Naive Bayes as appropriate. You can see my series of text mining videos here
