No mounted sdcard when storing a file in the sdcard

I have a file in the /data/data /files/settings.dat and want to store/copy this file in the sdcard, the file is well readed but when trying to copy it to the sdcard, i have an exception: sdacrd is not mounted. I added the right line to the androidmanifest.xml and added a virtual sdcard in the emulator. -sdcard /Users/Alaeddine/Documents/workspace/android_sdcard Code: public void transfer(){ File sdCard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); if(!Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)) { Log.d("Carburant", "Sdcard was not mounted !!" ); } else { File nmea_file; File root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); FileWriter nmea_writer = null; try { nmea_file = new File(root,"settings.dat"); if(!nmea_file.exists()) { Log.w("Carburant", "File Doesn't Exists!"); nmea_file.createNewFile(); } copyfile(nom,sdCard.getAbsolutePath() + nmea_file); } catch (IOException e) { Log.w("Carburant", "Unable to write", e); } finally { if (nmea_writer != null) { try { nmea_writer.close(); } catch (IOException e) { Log.w("Carburant", "Exception closing file", e); } } } } } How can i solve this problem ? Thank you for your help.
