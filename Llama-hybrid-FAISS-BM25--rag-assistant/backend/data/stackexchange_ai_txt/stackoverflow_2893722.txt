As some have said above, there are alternatives to this problem. The power of the database could be useful (after all, you don't want to code those features yourself when you could be doing something else) but you don't want to go overkill. SQLite may be worth looking at as it can be treated as a file (no server to worry about) but gives you the power of SQL querying. You could also try something like Memcached as a cache on top of whatever data storage layer you choose.
