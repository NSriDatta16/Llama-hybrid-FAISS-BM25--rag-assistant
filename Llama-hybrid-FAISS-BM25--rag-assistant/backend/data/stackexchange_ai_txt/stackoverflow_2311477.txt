How to make sure that my ajax call pulls authenticated content

I am making an Ajax call within my page to a DB and pulling products that have images included. Here is the ajax call that i'm making: $.ajax({ type : "GET", url : "**https**://www.mydomain.org/getRow.php", dataType: 'html', success: function (msg) { $(".drag-desired").html(msg); $.event.trigger('init-draggable-products'); }, error: function (xhr) { $('#errorDisplay').html('Error: '+ xhr.status + '' + xhr.statusText); } }); Problem that I am having is with IE it gives a prompt asking if the visitor would like to view the unauthenticated content. If the person was to click no or yes they would like the browser to block that content I'm not getting the products to display. Here is my php file that is grabbing the products: '; } ?>
