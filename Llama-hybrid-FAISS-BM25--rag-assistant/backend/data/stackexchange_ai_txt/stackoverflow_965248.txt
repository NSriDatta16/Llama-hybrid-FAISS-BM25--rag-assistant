ORM Recommendation for SQL Server

I am going to use SQL Server in my project, for that I want to select an ORM with it. I have some experience with NHibernate as an ORM . In fact, given the nature of that project ( MySQL the backend) NHibernate is really, the only choice. I have also used strongly typed dataset as my ORM , and that's having Microsoft Access as the backend. I have also some experience with LINQ2SQL. Now, I know, all paths lead to Rome ; a lot of ORMs can handle sql server well. But I want the best ORM in terms of Development time . That is, drag and drop designer that maps my entity classes to the database schema. So that if I change my schema my entity classes are updated automatically. Multiple database Support . The ORM must be able to handle multiple databases queries, in an optimum way. Also, multiple connection string support must be done easily too. Extensibility . If I want to add a query than I don't want to mess with the designer files; they are a pain in neck to ruffle with. That's probably it. Any ideas?
