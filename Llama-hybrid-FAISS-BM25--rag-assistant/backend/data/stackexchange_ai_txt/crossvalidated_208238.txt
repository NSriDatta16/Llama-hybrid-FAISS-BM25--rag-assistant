I can't say about cmdscale being not R user (and won't be reading its documentation right now) so can't answer your pt 2. You may do metric MDS for whatever data you wish (although for distances far from being euclidean or metric nonmetric MDS will usually give better map). Word "Metric" MDS has not quite that meaning as in "metric distances", so the term is a bit misleading. Actually, it refers to linear transformation of Dissimilarities to disparities . This transformation is a form of the so called optimal scaling task. Metric MDS imposes the constraint of linearity on it. Nonmetric MDS is more liberal-flexible and allows just monotonicity (thence it is "successful" more often). Torgerson's MDS based on PCA is a bit special form of metric MDS. (Note that there exist iterative metric MDS different from it!) It does not do the task of preserving the pairwise distances on a low-dim. map directly . Being based on PCA, it preserves variances. And here comes the answer to your pt 3: that percentage of explained variance isn't of much use or interest in MDS. Interest is for some form of stress which is about the reproduction of pairwise distances (more precise, of the disparities). Dice matching coefficient , when it is computed between objects based on dummy variables (e.g. a nominal variable recoded into such the set of binary indicators) is equal to Ochiai coefficient, which is the cosine. And cosine is directly convertible to euclidean distance. And euclidean distance is a distance for which metric MDS is quite naturally applicable (for it then just becomes the task to low the rank of the configuration). So, if it is your case - you have a reason to prefer it to nonmetric one.
