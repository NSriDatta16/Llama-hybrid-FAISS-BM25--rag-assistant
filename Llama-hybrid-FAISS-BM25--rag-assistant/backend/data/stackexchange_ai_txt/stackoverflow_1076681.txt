One big factor that I didn't see mentioned yet is that any process improvement (unit testing, continuos integration, code reviews, whatever) needs to have an advocate within the organization who is committed to the technology, has the appropriate clout within the organization, and is willing to do the work to convince others of the value. For example, I've seen exactly one engineering organization where code review was taken truly seriously. That company had a VP of Software who was a true believer, and he'd sit in on code reviews to make sure they were getting done properly. They incidentally had the best productivity and quality of any team I've worked with. Another example is when I implemented a unit-testing solution at another company. At first, nobody used it, despite management insistence. But several of us made a real effort to talk up unit testing, and to provide as much help as possible for anyone who wanted to start unit testing. Eventually, a couple of the most well-respected developers signed on, once they started to see the advantages of unit testing. After that, our testing coverage improved dramatically. I just thought of another factor - some tools take a significant amount of time to get started with, and that startup time can be hard to come by. Static analysis tools can be terrible this way - you run the tool, and it reports 2,000 "problems", most of which are innocuous. Once you get the tool configured properly, the false-positive problem get substantially reduced, but someone has to take that time, and be committed to maintaining the tool configuration over time.
