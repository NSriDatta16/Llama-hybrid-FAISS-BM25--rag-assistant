What is another way of outputting data from an array rather than var_dump or print_r?

I'm on a 3rd party software and when I output the data from the array using var_dump() or print_r() , it comes out messy. Anyone know of a way to output the data in a hierarchical format or something more organized (or some script that does it for me)? Thanks!
