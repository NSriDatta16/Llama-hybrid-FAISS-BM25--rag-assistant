Silverlight Drag and drop custom controls

I want to create a drag and drop functionality in my silverlight 3.0 project. I use Nov 2009 release of the silverlight toolkit. I created several custom user controls and want to apply drag and drop functionality to them. I checked using ListBoxDragDropTarget with a ListBox but found that it must be bound to some data source. is there a way to put my custom controls inside the list box and achieve the drag-drop behaviour ? thanks
