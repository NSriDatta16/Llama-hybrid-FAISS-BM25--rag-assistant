Is there truth and is there inaccuracy into the above statement? Regarding the truth, think of the classical statistical modelling approach where a statistician sits down together with a subject-matter expert and they design a model for the phenomenon at hand. A simple example could be a multiple regression model for, say, house prices (something encountered early on in Woodldridge's introductory econometrics textbook). The citation makes a lot of sense for this kind of situation. Regarding inaccuracy, you could say that automated feature selection in regression, e.g. using information criteria, contradicts the statement. But still the general pool of models from which an automated procedure selects one is designed by the statistician. With regards to machine learning methods, perhaps they do not quite fit in the classical understanding of statistical models -- but this may be subjective.
