In response to RMorrisey's comment: Actually, it's more convoluted :/ It would look something like this (code untested, but you should get the general idea): JSONValue jsonValue; JSONArray jsonArray; JSONObject jsonObject; JSONString jsonString; jsonValue = JSONParser.parseStrict(incomingJsonRespone); // parseStrict is available in GWT >=2.1 // But without it, GWT is just internally calling eval() // which is strongly discouraged for untrusted sources if ((jsonObject = jsonValue.isObject()) == null) { Window.alert("Error parsing the JSON"); // Possibilites: error during download, // someone trying to break the application, etc. } jsonValue = jsonObject.get("d"); // Actually, this needs // a null check too if ((jsonArray = jsonValue.isArray()) == null) { Window.alert("Error parsing the JSON"); } jsonValue = jsonArray.get(0); if ((jsonObject = jsonValue.isObject()) == null) { Window.alert("Error parsing the JSON"); } jsonValue = jsonObject.get("Desc"); if ((jsonString = jsonValue.isString()) == null) { Window.alert("Error parsing the JSON"); } Window.alert(jsonString.stringValue()); // Finally! As you can see, when using JSONParser you have to/should be very cautious - that's the whole point, right? To parse an unsafe JSON (otherwise, like I suggested in the comments, you should go with JavaScript Overlay Types ). You get a JSONValue , check if it's really what you think it should be, say, a JSONObject , you get that JSONObject , check if it has the "xyz" key, you get a JSONValue , rinse and repeat. Not the most interesting work, but at least its safer than just calling eval() on the whole JSON :) Attention: as Jason pointed out, prior to GWT 2.1, JSONParser used eval() internally (it only had a parse() method - GWT 2.0 javadocs vs GWT 2.1 ). In GWT 2.1, parse() became deprecated and two more methods were introduced - parseLenient() (uses eval() internally) and parseStrict() (the safe approach). If you really have to use JSONParser , then I'd suggest upgrading to GWT 2.1 M2, because otherwise you might as well use JSOs. As an alternative to JSONParser for untrusted sources, you could try integrating json2.js as a JSON parser via JSNI . PS: cinqoTimo, JSONArray jsonValue = JSONParser.parse(incomingJsonRespone); obviously doesn't work because JSONParser.parse has a return type of JSONValue , not JSONArray - didn't your IDE (Eclipse + Google Plugin?) warn you? Or at least the compiler.
