What you want is an General Linear Model of the form y = b0 + emo b1 + rt b2 + emo rt b3 where b0: is the intercept b1: is the main effect of emotion (positive/negative) b2: is the main effect of reaction time (regardless of condition) b3: is the interaction effect of emotion and reaction time (effect of reaction time depending on condition) If you dummy-code emotion as neutral=0 and negative=1 the main effect rt will represent the association between y and reaction time at neutral conditions and the interaction term will represent the additional change in association due to negative conditions. Make sure to center or standardize (z-Score) your reaction-times beforehand. If you do so, b1 will represent the effect of emotion at the overall mean reaction time (for a subject of average performance). If you forget to do so b1 will represent the effect of emotion for a reaction time of 0 (and thus nonsense)... The big question is whether your experimental design was within-subject (all 20 subjects had both emotional conditions) or between-subject (some only negative, some only positive condition). Between subject: do the ancova (emo+rt+emo*rt). Within subject: Things will get a little more involved, because there is no repeated-measures ANCOVA for changing continuous covariates. In this case you have to use a mixed model (aka random effects model). Here, the fixed part of the model should be defined exactly like for the ANCOVA, but you should add the following random effects: – by-subject intercept (each subject gets its own intercept) – eventually also by-subject random effect for emotion (each subject gets its own effect estimate of emotion... however this will only be estimable if you have multiple repetitions/trials for each subject and condition)
