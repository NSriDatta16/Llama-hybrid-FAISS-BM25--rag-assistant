You can use something like this to login and save the cookie so you won't have to do it again. Of course you will need to come up with your own logic to post it directly but this is how I use Mechanize's built in cookie_jar method to save cookies. if !agent.cookie_jar.load('cookies.yml') page = agent.get('http://site.com') form = page.forms.last form.email = 'email' form.password = 'password' page = agent.submit(form) agent.cookie_jar.save_as('cookies.yml') end
