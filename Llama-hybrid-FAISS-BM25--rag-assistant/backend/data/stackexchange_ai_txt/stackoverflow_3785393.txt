tag property has NSInteger type and can have any value NSInteger can hold, so 20000 should not cause problems. Code you posted definitely lacks some details - do you actually put dragger into your cell? Note also that it is recommended not to add subviews to UITableViewCell directly - you must add them to cell's contentView instead: [cell.contentView addSubView: dragger]; and access it later: DragView *newDragger=(DragView*)[cell.contentView viewWithTag: row+20000 ]; Also note that your code will not work when table reuses the cells, that is when cell is used for a row different from the row it was initially created for and you will try to access subview with wrong tag anyway. P.S. Also see this question Detecting which UIButton was pressed in a UITableView . It deals with buttons but may be it will be helpful for your custom view as well.
