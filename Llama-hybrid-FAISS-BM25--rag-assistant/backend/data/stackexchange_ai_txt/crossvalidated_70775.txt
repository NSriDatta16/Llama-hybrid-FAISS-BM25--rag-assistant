What is the objective Scikit-learn's Random Forest classifier is optimizing at each node?

I would like to ask what is the specific objective function that Scikit-learn's Random Forest classifier is optimizing at each node for the "Entropy" option. My understanding is that entropy is used as a measure here to split the training data reaching a particular node to the left and right subtree by ensuring that the split is done in such a way that the training data within each split is as "pure" as possible. However, what function is used to split the data? A linear separator? Axis-aligned linear separator? Conic-section?
