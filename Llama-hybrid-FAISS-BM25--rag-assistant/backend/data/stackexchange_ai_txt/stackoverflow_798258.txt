What objects are suitable for Add-Member?

Documentation states: Adds a user-defined custom member to an instance of a Windows PowerShell object. What "Windows PowerShell object" stands for? This works fine: $obj = new-object system.object $obj | add-member -membertype noteproperty -name Name -value "OK" $obj.name But this does not: $obj = @{} Actually, I am trying to add property to $error[0].
