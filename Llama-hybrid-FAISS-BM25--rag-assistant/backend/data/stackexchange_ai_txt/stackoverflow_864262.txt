The simplest way is probably to use a hash instead. For example: seat['A'][1] = value But if you really need an array for some reason, then the method you describe is the simplest. Assuming the row string is a single character 'A' through 'Z', you can do it using row_string[0] - ?A (or row_string[0] - ?A + 1 if you want the index starting at 1 as in your example). For a multi-character version where row AA is after row Z, you can do this in 1.8.7 and newer: row_num = row_string.bytes.inject(0) {|total, x| total = total * 26 + x - ?A + 1} You may want to upcase your row string beforehand, just to be on the safe side. In 1.8.6 and below, String does not have a bytes method. You can accomplish the same thing by doing: row_num = 0 row_string.each_byte {|x| row_num = row_num * 26 + x - ?A + 1}
