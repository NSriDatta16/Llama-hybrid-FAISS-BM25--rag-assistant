Maximum number of principal components in PCA. Is sklearn wrong?

Recently I've been interested in applying PCA to a dataset I have and I wanted to develop a deep understanding of what I would actually be doing when I implement it. Today I encountered two confronting answers to the question of what is the maximum number of principal components . The two answers are these ones: maxn_pc = min(n_samples, n_features) . Supported by sklearn's documentation Or this formula. Supported by this flawlessly looking argument . if n_samples Do any of you know what is the meaning of that extra component that sklearn's PCA is offering?
