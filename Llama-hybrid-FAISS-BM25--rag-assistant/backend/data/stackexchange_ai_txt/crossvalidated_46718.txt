Without wanting to sound critical, this is a case where I think most of the work needed is clarifying what questions you are wanting to answer, and designing your investigation accordingly. As best I can tell, the number of cases falling into each habitat class is your response variable, and you wonder if these counts vary under differing conditions. You seem primarily interested in whether these counts differ by site location or gender or possibly some combination of these covariates. Let me state a few things. First, because you know the total, it is best to think of your data are proportions rather than counts. Although I don't think you want to use a chi-squared analysis, the potential threat to its validity is if expected counts under independence are less than 5, not observed counts. Finally, note that if any of your covariates matter in terms of the proportion of cases in the differing habitats, that means that the habitat classes are not equi-probable; I would ignore that question unless there are clearly no relationships amongst the variables. What you want to look into is multinomial logistic regression . This is just a generalization of binary logistic regression (with which I assume you are familiar) to situations where there are more than two response categories. You might find some of the related threads on CV interesting; you can search them by clicking here: multinomial . I don't know JMP8, but the UCLA statistics consulting site has a user-friendly introduction to multinomial logistic regression in R .
