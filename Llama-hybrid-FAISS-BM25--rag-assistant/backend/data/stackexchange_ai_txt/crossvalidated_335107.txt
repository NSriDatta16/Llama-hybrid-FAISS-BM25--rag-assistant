Multiple digits MNIST and transfer learning

I have a sample of 50,000 images, some of which are shown below: $\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$ Associated to these images are labels for the digit with the largest pixel size. My goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the largest digit in an image by pixel size. To that end, I used transfer learning on the resnext model, but only found an accuracy of 60%. Given that this implementation uses transfer learning to train a model to predict MNIST digits, I would now like to crop each training image to retain only the largest digit and then train the model using the linked implementation. So, my question is, how I do crop the training images to retain only the digit in each image with the largest size.
