SQL Server Bulk insert of CSV file with inconsistent quotes

Is it possible to BULK INSERT (SQL Server) a CSV file in which the fields are only OCCASSIONALLY surrounded by quotes? Specifically, quotes only surround those fields that contain a ",". In other words, I have data that looks like this (the first row contain headers): id, company, rep, employees 729216,INGRAM MICRO INC.,"Stuart, Becky",523 729235,"GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, INC.","Nelson, Beena",114 721177,GEORGE WESTON BAKERIES INC,"Hogan, Meg",253 Because the quotes aren't consistent, I can't use '","' as a delimiter, and I don't know how to create a format file that accounts for this. I tried using ',' as a delimter and loading it into a temporary table where every column is a varchar, then using some kludgy processing to strip out the quotes, but that doesn't work either, because the fields that contain ',' are split into multiple columns. Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to manipulate the CSV file beforehand. Is this hopeless? Many thanks in advance for any advice. By the way, i saw this post SQL bulk import from csv , but in that case, EVERY field was consistently wrapped in quotes. So, in that case, he could use ',' as a delimiter, then strip out the quotes afterwards.
