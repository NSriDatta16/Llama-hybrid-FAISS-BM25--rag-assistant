Calculate Risk Ratio with CI in R from Odds ratios

I have performed a multiple logistic regression because I wanted to see the association between Death and Cardiovascular disease. I adjusted using age, sex, risk factors. The result came in ODDS RATIO with CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. How do I do this using RISK RATIO with CONFIDENCE INTERVAL instead? If I just do the ratio between exposed and non-exposed then I don't adjusted for age, sex, risk factors anymore and also I don't have confidence interval. Please help with codes and method I use R
