CGAN not getting conditioned properly. How to start debugging?

So I was trying to condition some images (10 classes) on corresponding EEG signals. However after traing, the CGAN is producing decent looking images but the images being produced simply do not correspond to the class whose conditioning was given. What could be the possible culprits to this problem and what should i look into to fix this problem? Do you think it this is not very likely and there is a high chance of error in my code logic itself if this happening?
