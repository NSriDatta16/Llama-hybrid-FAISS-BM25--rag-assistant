What are the effects of adding technical/pseudo replicates to the ones to be deconvolved?

I want to perform deconvolution of a small data set (3 samples of one conditions vs. 4 of another). The tool CibersortX can estimate the sample-specific expression of cells, using the bulk expression data provided, and a signature matrix of typical expression by cell type. I suffer from a low number of samples. However, I have also a technical replicate for each of the 7. The biological replicate underwent a biochemical procedure and then was sequenced once again - however the biochemical procedure turned out not to have a strong effect, so it's more of a technical replicate than a biological one. A large ratio of samples to cell types is good for deconvolution. What would be the effect of adding those technical replicates to the pool, and then deconvolving them using CibersortX High-Resolution mode (which outputs per-sample value)? What would be the effect of generating pseudo-replicates (taking the replicates I have, and artificially adding noise to them ) to the pool of CibersortX High Resolution mode ? Some more details : I intend to use a published signature matrix , averaged to two cell-types only (due to the small number of samples I have) : the cell type that which is of my primary interest (for example Monocytes/T-cells) + "All Others". I am interested in finding differentially expressed genes in that one cell type that is of interest to me.
