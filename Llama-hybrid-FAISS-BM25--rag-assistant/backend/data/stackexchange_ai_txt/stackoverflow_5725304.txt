This is a good question, and I left it unanswered for a while to see if anyone knew something that I didn't. But unfortunately, I think you're going to discover that it's not possible to receive notification messages corresponding to this event. The wallpaper slideshow doesn't actually change the system theme or any of the system settings, so a WM_SETTINGCHANGE message doesn't get sent. It's designed to happen in the background and not require that any application be notified. If the user has selected the "slideshow" option, it's reasonable to assume that they expect the background to be changed at periodic intervals, no interaction or notification necessary. In short, in at least 99% of cases, your application should not respond any differently as a result of wallpaper changes arising from the slideshow option. The best thing I can think of is to determine the interval they've specified at which the wallpaper should be changed, and then have your application respond accordingly when that time has elapsed. Essentially, you'll have to create and respond to your own notifications. Polling the registry is to be strongly discouraged. Not only is that completely undocumented and thus subject to breaking on future versions of Windows (or even Windows updates!), but it's also not a reliable indicator. If there's any alternative (including omitting the functionality altogether), that's the path that I would take.
