I hate using percentages since they depends on other things. I usually do something with static values, like : #body_container{ margin: 10px auto; /** The auto will make this div centered to the page **/ width: 1000px; /** suppose you want this width **/ clear: both; border: 1px solid #3F0; } div.body_contents{ width: 748px; /** The width of the main part, -2px (for the border) **/ float: left; border: 1px solid #960; } div.sidebar{ width: 248px; /** The width of the side bar, -2px (for the border) **/ border: 1px solid #F0F; } Of course, if you want the width of you main div to change regarding of the size of the browser (as it would be with your original CSS), my answer doesn't work. But I would recommend you to NOT do a change of width based on the browser since it would change the organization of your page depending on the window.
