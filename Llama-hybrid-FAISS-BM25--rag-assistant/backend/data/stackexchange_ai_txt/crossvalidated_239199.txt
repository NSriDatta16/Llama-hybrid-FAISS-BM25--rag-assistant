To your main question about implementation, this is quoted from the clogit function help: It turns out that the logliklihood for a conditional logistic regresson model = loglik from a Cox model with a particular data structure. Proving this is a nice homework exercise for a PhD statistics class; not too hard, but the fact that it is true is surprising. When a well tested Cox model routine is available many packages use this ‘trick’ rather than writing a new software routine from scratch, and this is what the clogit routine does. In detail, a stratified Cox model with each case/control group assigned to its own stratum, time set to a constant, status of 1=case 0=control, and using the exact partial likelihood has the same likelihood formula as a conditional logistic regression. The clogit routine creates the necessary dummy variable of times (all 1) and the strata, then calls coxph. So really by using a special case of Cox regression is a shortcut to performing the same analysis with existing, tested routines.
