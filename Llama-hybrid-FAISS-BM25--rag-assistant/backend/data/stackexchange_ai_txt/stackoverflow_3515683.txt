I think what he is saying is that he's using exceptions for non-exceptional conditions like normal loop terminations. That is considered a no-no by programmers in most languages that provide exceptions, including C++. The reason for this is that exceptions tend to drag a fair bit of information along with them. On some platforms, they bring the entire callstack at the point of the exception, for the purposes of displaying it in a nice debug message. That's very expensive, if all you really want is a unconditional control jump. Instead, you should be using statements like break , return , or even (in a real pinch) goto .
