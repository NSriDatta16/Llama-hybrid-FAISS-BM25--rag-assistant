What does sampling the hidden representation mean

I'm doing a course on Neural Networks, which at some point states: Sampling the hidden representations regularizes the network by pushing the hidden representation to be binary during the forward pass which limits the modeling capacity of the network. What does Sampling the hidden representations mean?
