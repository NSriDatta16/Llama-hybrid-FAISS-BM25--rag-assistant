How to compute average deaths in population at the end of a period?

Wondering if you can help with solution for this. (I run a simple simulation to get the answer currently)... There is a pool of resources. Every day a resource can become unavailable (die) or just grow older. There is a process that fills the resource pool to the required size (N) in case one or more deaths occur. A resource can live for x days where minAge So how can I answer the question: "How many resources are replaced every day given pool size N and the min/max age range".
