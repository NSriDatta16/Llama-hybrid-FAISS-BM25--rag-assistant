Non-normality in linear mixed models/GLMM

I have some data of time-depth profiles of whales. I want to model how the maximum depth of each dive (deepest point reached during a dive) changes between two dive types, foraging (if the whale feeds) and non-foraging (if there is no feeding activity). I also have as a fixed effect if the dive was carried out during daytime, twilight or at nightime and as a random effect the whale ID. id = dive ID (each row represents one dive Example of data: id whale max_depths dive_type diel 1 1 57 NF Day 2 1 26 NF Day 3 1 18 NF Day 4 1 23 F Night 5 1 51 F Night I tried first to use a linear mixed model. The following had the lowest AIC: mod3_b I had a problem of high autocorrelation which was solved by using corARMA() and heteroskedacity which decreased significantly by adding weights (probably because twilight has significantly less data than day and night). Nevertheless, my residuals are not normal (graphs below): Due to this, I tried to use instead a GLMM. My questions are: 1- residuals of GLMM are still not normal. Is that a problem? 2- should I transform the data instead? (I think this increases the heteroskedacity problem though) 3- what distribution is better (I tried both poisson and neg binomial) or how do I compare GLMM models (since they don't have AIC)? 4- Can I had weights to GLMM? And if yes, how? I tried doing but with no success (I guess it may be important since diel categories are not equally represented in the data) UPDATE resulting plot of standardized residuals vs fitted values of the model with max_depths log transformed: LMM: GLMM: QQ and hist of log transformed data
