P/N is actually correct from a frequentist perspective. You could also use a bayesian approach to incorporate prior knowledge, but since you don't seem to have that knowledge, I guess P/N is the way to go. If you want, you can also use Laplace's rule which iirc comes down to a uniform prior. Just give each link on the page a start of 1 instead of 0. (So if you count the number a link was clicked, give each a +1 bonus and resemble that in your N.) [UPDATE] Here is a bayesian approach: Let p(W) be the probability that a person is in a specific group W. Let p(L) be the probability, that a specific link is clicked. then the probability you are looking for is p(L|W). By Bayes' theorem, you can calculate this by p(L|W) = p(W|L) * p(L) / p(W) You can estimate p(L) by the amount L was clicked, p(W) by the size of that group with respect to the rest of the users and p(W|L) = p(W and L) / p(L) by the number of persons of the specific group W that clicked L divided by the probability that L is clicked.
