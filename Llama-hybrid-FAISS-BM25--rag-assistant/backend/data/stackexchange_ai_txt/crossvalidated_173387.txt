Conditional independence in bayesian network

I am referring a Bayesian Net Example from here . Prob(A=T) = 0.3 Prob(B=T) = 0.6 Prob(C=T|A=T) = 0.8 Prob(C=T|A=F) = 0.4 Prob(D=T|A=T,B=T) = 0.7 Prob(D=T|A=T,B=F) = 0.8 Prob(D=T|A=F,B=T) = 0.1 Prob(D=T|A=F,B=F) = 0.2 Prob(E=T|C=T) = 0.7 Prob(E=T|C=F) = 0.2 In this case how do you solve for P(E=T|A=T) ? Because C is not known E and A are not independent events.
