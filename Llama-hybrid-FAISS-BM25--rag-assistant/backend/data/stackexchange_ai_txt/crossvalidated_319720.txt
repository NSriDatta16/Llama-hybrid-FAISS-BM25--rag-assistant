Is Sargan-Hansen J test relevant for panel data containing large number of observations?

I am working on a project that has 4680 observations (18 years, 265 regions), in which one variable is endogenous. We tried various combinations of two IVs, but always end up with a significant Sargan-Hansen J Test. Recently I have found this quote: "Testing of over-identifying assumptions is less important in longitudinal applications because realizations of time varying explanatory variables in different time periods are potential instruments, i.e., over-identifying restrictions are automatically built into models estimated using longitudinal data. " Does it mean that for panel data that contains large number of observations the Sargan-Hansen J Test is irrelevant as it almost always ends up significant? The precondition of the test is that at least one of the IVs is a relevant IV. Should we therefore restrict ourselves to using one IV?
