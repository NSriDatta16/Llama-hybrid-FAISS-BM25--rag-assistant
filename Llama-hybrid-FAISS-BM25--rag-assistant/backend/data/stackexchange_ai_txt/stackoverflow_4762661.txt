Designing for "Pretty" URLs

I'm aware of mod_rewrite methods to convert ugly URLs to pretty. My question is preceding this conversion. I have not yet developed my website. I would like to design all pages such that the pretty URLs are also pretty on the server side. I would like to come up with a general rule for ALL pages. Normally all pages are slightly different... /news/12345 => /news.php?id=1234 /members/Mikhail => /members.php?name=Mikhail /subsection/page/banned-members => /subsection/page.php?view=banned-members In the three examples above the GET variable name is different for each case, and the third example could ALSO be developed to be interpreted as /subsection.php?file=page&view=banned-members So my question is : What can I do, from the design point, do have an elegant solution on the client AND server side to create pretty URLs? Thanks!
