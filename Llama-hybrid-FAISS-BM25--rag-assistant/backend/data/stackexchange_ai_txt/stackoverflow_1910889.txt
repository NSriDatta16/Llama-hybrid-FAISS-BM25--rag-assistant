If you are supplying a script for other people to use, then you could have them load easyXDM which would allow your script to communicate with the document loaded in the iframe (if it also has the easyXDM library set up). You would also have to require them to host a simple html file on their domain in case easyXDM cannot use postMessage and has to resort to using the hash/fragment solution.
