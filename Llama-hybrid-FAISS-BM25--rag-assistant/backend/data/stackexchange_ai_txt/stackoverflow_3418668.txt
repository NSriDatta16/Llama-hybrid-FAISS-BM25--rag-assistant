I assume that the older next post link is the only one missing. That would mean that your newer posts link is visible. How are you sorting your posts? Maybe you are looking at the oldest posts, so there are no older posts to show? try This will organize posts from newest to oldest, and should enable the link to older posts. you could also try orderby=ID to use post id's instead of dates
