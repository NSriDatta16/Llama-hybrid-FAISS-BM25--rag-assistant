To prepare or handle a spike (or peak) performance, I would first determine whether you are ready through some simple performance testing with something like jmeter . It is easy to set up and get started and will give you early metrics whether you will handle an expected peak load. However, given your time constraints, other steps to take would be to prepare static versions of content that will attract the highest attention (such as press releases, if your launch day). Also ensure that you are making the best use of client-side caching (one fewer request to your server can make all the difference). The web is already designed for extremely high scalability and effective use content caching is your best friend in these situations. There is an excellent podcast on high scalability on software engineering radio on the design of the new Guardian website when things calm down. Good luck on the launch.
