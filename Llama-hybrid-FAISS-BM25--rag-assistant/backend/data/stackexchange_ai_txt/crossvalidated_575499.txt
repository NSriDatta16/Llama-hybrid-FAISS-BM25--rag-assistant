Combining similarity scores from 2 measures into one score

Assume I have items: a, b, and c. And I calculated the similarities between each pair using two different measures, and I got the following similarity score metrics: using measure 1 , the results are: a b c a 1 0.5 0.1 b 0.4 1 0.3 c 0.1 0.2 1 and by using measure 2 , the results are: a b c a 1 0.9 0.6 b 0.1 1 0.2 c 0.3 0.7 1 Is there an approach to combine both score matrixes into a single matrix, does using average will be a good choice? Have you seen such papers? To put more context, my problem is finding similarities between cities, so the two measures are totally different. For example, measure 1 tries to find similarities based on population, while measure 2 tries to find similarities based on street layout.
