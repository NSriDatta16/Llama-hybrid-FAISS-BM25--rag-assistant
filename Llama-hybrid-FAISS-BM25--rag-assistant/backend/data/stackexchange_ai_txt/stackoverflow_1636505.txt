UIPickerView - event fired when row is highlighted

What I would like to do is this: A UIPickerView is shown. If the user touches the selected row, the row is locked (it is a multi-component picker) and the other components are free to spin. If the row has already been locked and the user touches the locked row, the row is then unlocked and free to spin. I have the locking part coded already using a button. I would like to remove the button and replace with the highlighted picker option. I have tried: - (void)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView didSelectRow:(NSInteger)row inComponent:(NSInteger)component { } Apparently this only fires if the row has not been selected already so when I touch a row that is in the highlighted region, this event does not fire. I then tried - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesBegan"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesMoved"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesEnded"); } None of these events fire when the picker is touched. Any ideas on how to detect when a highlighted/selected row in a picker is touched by the user?
