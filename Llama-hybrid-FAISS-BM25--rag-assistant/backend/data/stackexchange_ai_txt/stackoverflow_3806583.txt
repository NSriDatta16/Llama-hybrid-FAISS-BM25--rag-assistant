If you have some idea of the range of frequencies, you could do a simple average as long as the measurement period were sufficiently long to give you the level of accuracy you want to achieve. The more wavelengths worth of data you average against, the smaller the ratio of contributed error from a partial wavelength. I'd suggest first simulating/modeling this in software like Matlab. Data you'll need to consider: The expected range of vibration frequencies The measurement accuracy you want to achieve The expected range of mass you'll want to measure The function of mass to vibration amplitude
