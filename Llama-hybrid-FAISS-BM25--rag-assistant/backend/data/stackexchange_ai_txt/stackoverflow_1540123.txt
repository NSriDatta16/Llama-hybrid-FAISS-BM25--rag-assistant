Best way to store time interval values in MySQL?

Stupid easy problem, but I haven't been able to find an elegant solution. I want to store time intervals in a MySQL columns, for instance: 1:40 (for one hour, 40 minutes) 0:30 (30 minutes). Then be able to run queries, summing them. Right now I store them as INT values (1.40), but I have to manually do the addition (unless I'm missing an easier way). The TIME column type only stores upto 900 hours (about, I think), so that's (almost) useless for me since I am tracking upwards of hundreds of thousands of hours (I store one field with a summation of many different entries). Thanks!
