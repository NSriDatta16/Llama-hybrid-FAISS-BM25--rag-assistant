Neural networks are in general based on linear algebra computations. If you think about graphics operations like combining two textures (bitmaps), or changing somehow each pixel of texture, what GPUs are built for, it's nothing more and nothing less than simple matrix / vector operations. Going deeper - GPU is processor that has thousands of computation units with different data registers and common command register, so for example, operation like: X = X + 1 Where X is large matrix can utilize every single core of GPU as long as there is only single command to be run of each of them. How particularly those features are use depends on software, usually linear algebra library / tool like for example Matlab or nVidia DNN libraries.
