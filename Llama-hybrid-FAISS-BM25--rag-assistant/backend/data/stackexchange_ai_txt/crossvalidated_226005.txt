Does a statistically significant correlation always give predictive power?

Suppose you're trying to predict anomalies. That is, consider the case where you have a data set that has a column called result . Suppose the data set has 365 rows and result has a value of 1 in only 12 of those rows and 0 in the other rows. Now suppose you have another column in the data set called val1 . Further suppose that the p-value of the correlation between result and val1 is small (say R cor.test method . Does this imply that we should be able to predict somewhat accurately the value of result given the value of val1 ? I naively assumed it did and used logistic regression to predict but got very bad F1 results. (Basically the logistic regression model always predicted 0 for result and thus there were no true positives.)
