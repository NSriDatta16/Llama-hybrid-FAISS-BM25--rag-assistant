What is your performance target? With proper caching, fast frontend + MySQL could have no problems with serving 200-400 requests per second ( If you use heavy frameworks and crap code, you will get 5 requests per seconds no matter how fast is underlying storage. So my suggestion - use what is EASIER and write proper code, avoid heavy frameworks.
