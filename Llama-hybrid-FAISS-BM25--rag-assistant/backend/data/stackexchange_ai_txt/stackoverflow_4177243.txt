Put semicolon in sql

I would like to know if i can put a semicolon in a SQL table. Or would that mess things up like an injection attack. Basically what I'm trying to put in is my HTTP_USER_AGENT info and that includes a semicolon. Or Basically there a way i can turn that semicolon into the html symbol for it? Thank You So Much
