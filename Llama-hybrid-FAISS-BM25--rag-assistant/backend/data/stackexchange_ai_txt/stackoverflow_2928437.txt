Damian Conway has a series of articles about Vim at IBM Developer Works. This one: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-vim-script-2/index.html shows how to create a function to line up assignment operators. It's in the section called A function to help you code . I think you could generalize it to your needs. Or use the Align plugin. I'm sometimes torn between writing my own tool, from which I can learn something, and getting somebody else's tool, which is often better than mine, and lets me get back to work more quickly. By the way, the entire series is excellent, and there are more to come. The last paragraph of the last article says: So, in the next article in this series we’ll explore Vim’s simple plug-in architecture, which allows you to factor out parts of your .vimrc and isolate them in separate modules. We’ll look at how that plug-in system works by developing a standalone module that ameliorates some of the horrors of working with XML.
