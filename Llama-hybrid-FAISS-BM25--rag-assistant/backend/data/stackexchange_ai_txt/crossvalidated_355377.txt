Should feature scaling be used while using unsupervised algorithms?

I have read many articles and resources about using feature scaling and when to use it, in particular two answers on this website as well- When should I apply feature scaling for my data? What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? But all answers focus on using feature scaling on supervised algorithms. My question is - Should I use feature scaling in unsupervised algorithms (like clustering) as well? Or, feature scaling makes no sense in unsupervised problems? Or, feature scaling has no effect in unsupervised problems?
