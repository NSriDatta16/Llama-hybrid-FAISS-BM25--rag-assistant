Issue a "changelog" with new releases, that will show as part of the installer wizard in a "readme"-type dialog. Yes, tips of the day can be annoying and are often turned off, but try a one-time dialog when the newly-updated program starts, with a summary of new features. Extensive help documentation, including a series of "How Do I" articles. Use icons with ToolTips to attract attention to new menu options/buttons/features in the first version they're released. People often seem dead-set against learning the software they use on a daily basis. Most office-type jobs require regular use of MS Office, but I doubt very many could even tell you how to create an Excel chart without fumbling their way through it while doing so. The best you can do is make the learning resources available.
