If the ObjectSummary.objectId is also the id for ObjectDetail , they should be mapped to a single table. In this case, ObjectSummary can't be a an entity, with a "life cycle" that is independent from ObjectDetail . You can mark ObjectSummary as an embeddable entity. ObjectDetail will have a property embedding ObjectSummary . Check the documentation for the section about embeddable objects .
