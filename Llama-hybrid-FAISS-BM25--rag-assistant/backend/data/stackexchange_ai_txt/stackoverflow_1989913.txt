Run multiple VMs. Each VM is a process and you should be able to run at least three processes per core without suffering any drop in performance. Of course, your application would have to be able to leverage multiprocessing in order to benefit. There is no magic bullet which is why you see articles in the press moaning about how we don't yet know how to use multicore machines. However, there are lots of people out there who have structured their applications into a master which manages a pool of worker processes and parcels out work packages to them. Not all problems are amenable to being solved this way.
