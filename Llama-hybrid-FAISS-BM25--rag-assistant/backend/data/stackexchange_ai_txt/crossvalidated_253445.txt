How to deal with small statistics in plotting a "good" and "representative" plot for a limited number of measurements in simulation runs?

In a cosmological simulation, we are calculating a physical quantity at different times from 3 different viewing angles; that is at any particular snapshot or epoch, we have three output numbers for the physical quantity. From each run, we have one time array including its error (called x and xerr ) and one physical quantity array including its error (called y and yerr ). In order to plot x vs. y , I am using matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar(x, y, xerr, yerr) function in Python3 in which y is set to the RMS value of the three output numbers corresponding to each x and yerr is set to the STD value for the limited number of 3 trials. This is the way my x and y arrays have been produced. Here you can find my original question that I initially posted in a wrong page where you can see my python script. ( Original Post ) Given the complexity and expense of the simulations, we have only 5 runs corresponding to 5 distinct astrophysical environments having the same characteristic. This means that I can produce the same x vs. y plot for each of the 5 distinct runs in which RMS values are connected via straight lines and each data point has a vertical "error bar" associated with it. Since we only had 3 trials for each epoch, we cannot really establish a rigorous Poisson statistics in order to come up with a True Standard Deviation for each RMS value of y . Regardless of the fact that we are able to produce 5 plots, we don't know the number of STDs in the magnitude of the error bar calculated with such limited number of trials. Now, given this limitation, I would like to have a "good" single representative "average" plot which can be safely assumed to be typical for the five distinct simulation runs. The way I have come up with is to use matplotlib module of Python3 to produce an "average" plot basically by averaging the RMS values of y at each x simply averaging 5 RMS values at any x common to all runs; however I don't know how to deal with the error bars corresponding to y values. I think the best way is to draw the joining lines as having a finite width or a sort of confidence interval but I do not know how to combine 5 error arrays which are not true STDs by any means. Here are the mentioned plots:
