I would say there is no need to look at existing code if you want to learn. You will probably learn more by doing it yourself. A good start would be to write code that does the following: Compute Condition Probabilities from Joint Probability table, For example, from P(A,B,C) compute P(A|B) Compute Joint Probability Table from complete set of Conditional Probabilities For example, from P(A|B,C)*P(B)*P(C) compute P(A,B,C). Given a DAG, compute if A is d-seperated from B Do all of the above naively and then go back and try to make them efficient. It should give you a good understanding of what Bayesian Networks are (conditional probability tables) and what they are used for (reasoning about probability).
