Even when you check the "Copy files ..." checkbox when you drag your files in, it's done "When necessary", without telling us when it thinks it's deemed not necessary to copy the files. I'd find that the best way to check if a bundle is self-contained is to compress it to .zip (the entire folder), move it to a temp folder, decompress and then go through all the files, or simply compile and run. It's amazing that Xcode doesn't have a consolidate function like iTunes does.
