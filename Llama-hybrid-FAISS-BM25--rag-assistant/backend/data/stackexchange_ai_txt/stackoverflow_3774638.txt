In Magento, how do you filter a product collection by the manage_stock field?

I've built an inventory update script - where I fetch a product collection in Magento, and iterate through the result set, updating product inventory (based on a separate inventory feed) as I go. I can fetch the product collection no problem. However, I only want to get products which have the "Manage Stock" field (a dropdown in the admin under the "inventory" tab) set to "yes". So I tried: // get all magento catalog products with "manage stock" field set to yes $items = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection(); $items ->addAttributeToSelect(array( 'id', 'sku' )) ->addFieldToFilter(array( array( 'attribute' => 'manage_stock', 'eq' => '1' ), )); But, getting an error: Invalid attribute name: manage_stock.
