It's unusual to see both classes in this plot, and I suspect the two colors are exactly equal in each bar: the effect "toward" class 1 is the same effect "against" class 0. See https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html#shap-feature-importance and https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/api_examples/plots/bar.html These four features all have discriminative power according to their shap values (which are in turn based on your model), apparently in decreasing order by name. (I'm not familiar enough to know whether 0.1 average shap value is "good" or not.)
