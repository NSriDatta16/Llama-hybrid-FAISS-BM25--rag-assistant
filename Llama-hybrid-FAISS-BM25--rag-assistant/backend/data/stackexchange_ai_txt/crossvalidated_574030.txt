Thank you very much for your answer EdM! If I understand correctly, your point is that main effects are not meaningful when an interaction is present. I assumed that they might be in some cases (like in my case, or in others I have read about https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpret-main-effects-interaction/ ) Maybe I should have included this from the beginning, but this is the pattern of results that I expect to have. In this graph, (from my admittedly limited knowledge of data analysis) I identify an interaction effect between both predictors, as well as main effect of the name of the target (the average of the green line is lower than the average of the blue line). And this pattern of means would in my mind confirm my prediction that T(C) is judged more negatively than L(A). And I guess I assume that the statistical translation of this pattern of means would be interaction + main effect of name. I guess I will keep in my back pocket the idea of just using a post-hoc test to compare means since as you said it will easily answer my question and is regularly used for such questions.
