You can't apply PCA directly to price data. However, if you assume that a linear combination of your stocks is co-integrated, than you'll have a process $Y = Xw$ that is stationary. If $Y$ is (cov)-stationary (let's not require strict stationarity), we can go forward and say that $Cov(Y) = Cov(Xw)$ over which we can apply the principal component factorization. We could not do that without the assumption of co-integration: "A time series is said to be covariance stationary if its mean and variance do not change over time" ( ref ). This means that we can drop "time" for the equation and generalize our results outside the span of the time-series. PCA and cointegration go hand in hand: having applied a linear transformation on the data allows us to select the hedge-ratio as the eigenvector corresponding to the biggest eigenvalue. Going back to your questions: PCA can be applied in case of co-integration.
