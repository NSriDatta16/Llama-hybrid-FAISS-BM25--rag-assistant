PHP closes connection after 10sec without data beeing echoed

I have a PHP webpage, that generates statistics and takes about 15sec to generate them, before sending them to the Browser. The issue I have is that the browser ends up loading with a blank page. Unfortunately I don't have access to the error_log file. But I figured, that if I start sending data in the foreach-loop which consumes most of the generation time like so echo ' '; the connection will not terminate and the page will load. First I thought this might be a memory_limit or max_execution_time issue, so I increased both, without any luck. But this would also seam odd to me since hitting the max_execution_time would result in a blank page no matter I'm sending echo ' ' or not. Is there an other PHP setting, I don't know of, that would cause a connection to terminate after about 10sec without data beeing send? Edit : The page is not completely blank. Here is the data beeing sent: @import url(css/ie6.css); After this point the statistics are beeing generated and therefore I only see a blank page. Here is the HTTP-Header: quest URL:http://gruppenunterkuenfte.de/index.php?mod=home&action=stats_belegungsanfrage2 Request Method:GET Status Code:200 OK Request Headers Accept:application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Cache-Control:max-age=0 Referer:http://gruppenunterkuenfte.de/index.php?mod=home&action=stats_belegungsanfrage2 User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.63 Safari/534.3 Query String Parameters mod:home action:stats_belegungsanfrage2 Response Headers Cache-Control:no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Connection:close Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8 Date:Sat, 25 Sep 2010 15:07:11 GMT Expires:Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Pragma:no-cache Server:Apache/2.2.16 Transfer-Encoding:chunked X-Powered-By:PHP/5.2.11
