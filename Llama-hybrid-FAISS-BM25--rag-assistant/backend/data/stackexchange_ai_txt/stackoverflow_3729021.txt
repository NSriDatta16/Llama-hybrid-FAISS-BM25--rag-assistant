Finally! If found a way much more elegant and probably with better performance either. (see also Accessing an ItemsControl item as it is added ) We "misuse" the property ItemsControl.AlternateIndex for this. Originally it is intended to handle every other row within a ListBox differently. (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.itemscontrol.alternationcount.aspx ) 1. Set AlternatingCount to the amount of items contained in the ListBox 2. Bind to AlternatingIndex your DataTemplate ... So this works without a converter, an extra CollectionViewSource and most importantly without brute-force-searching the source collection.
