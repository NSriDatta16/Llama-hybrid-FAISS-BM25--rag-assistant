There is no need for you to use an external public CA for a closed community project. In many larger organisations they operate an internal PKI to issue certs for internal projects like this. An advantage of using a PKI is that you can setup a trust relationship between the various components based on a single securely distributed root certificate / trust anchor. However, if the project allowed internal users to connect securely to an internal service via their web browser you may want to consider using a public CA issued cert. The alternative is to make sure that every browser that may need to connect to your service trusted your root cert; this is to prevent browser warning messages.
