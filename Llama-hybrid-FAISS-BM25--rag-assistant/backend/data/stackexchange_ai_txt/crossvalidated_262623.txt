multinomial logistic regression modelling

I want to find the determinants of choice of delivery by expecting mothers in India where we have 3 categories: home public health facility and private hospital For each category, I know the total number of deliveries and aggregated determinants such as female literacy percentage, percentage of villages without health facility, percentage of households living in lowest quintile income, etc. What is the most reasonable model to predict the delivery based on the determinants?
