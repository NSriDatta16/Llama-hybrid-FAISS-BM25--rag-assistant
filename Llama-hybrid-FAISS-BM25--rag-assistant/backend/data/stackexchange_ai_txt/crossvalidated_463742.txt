That is not a bayesian approach. If you want to know the parameter p of a Bernouilli distribution, in the Bayesian approach, you start with a distribution of this parameter p, called the prior distribution. You use for this a Beta distribution. It is standard to start with a Beta(1,1) if you don't know much about p. In a sequential procedure, given data, your Beta distribution will change its parameters. If you have N new points with p ones and N-p zeros, your Beta distribution will be now B(1+p,1+N-p). This is the posterior distribution, and you can use it again as a prior distribution when you have more data.
