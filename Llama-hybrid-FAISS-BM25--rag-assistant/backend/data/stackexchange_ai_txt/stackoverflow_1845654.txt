How to use filegroupdescriptor to drag file to explorer c#

I would like to drag and drop an element of a listbox to explorer. When the drag and drop is started, I need to prepare the file on demand and save it to a memory stream. Can you provide me with an example on how to do it using the FileGroupDescriptor data structure? Thanks. Andrea
