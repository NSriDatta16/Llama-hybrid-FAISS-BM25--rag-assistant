If you're just concerned about well-formedness (missing closing tags and such), you probably just want to check the structure of the chunks AJAX is inserting. (Once it's part of the DOM, it's going to be well-formed... just not necessarily the structure you intended.) The simplest way to do that would probably be to attempt to parse it using an XML library. (one with an HTML mode that can be made strict, if you're not using XHTML) Actual validation (Testing the "You can't put tag X inside tag Y" rules which browsers generally don't care too much about) is a lot trickier and, depending on how much effort you're willing to put into it, may not be worth the trouble. (Because, if you validate them in isolation, you'll get a lot of "This is just a fragment" false positives) Whichever you decide to use, you need to grab the AJAX responses before the browser parses them if you want a reliable test result. (While they're still just a string of text rather than a DOM tree)
