Logistic regression: odds ratio when change in the independent variable values is less than 1 unit

I have one independent variable which has values less than 1, and want to see how the odds of having a disease change when the independent variable increase by 0.1. I ran a binary logistic regression to predict an outcome (disease vs healthy) and as expected it turned out odds ratio (when the independent variable increases by 1) had a crazy high value and confidence intervals. Therefore I took the 10th root of odds ratio and CI and now odds are interpretable, however, I don't know if what I did makes sense at all from a mathematical standpoint...
