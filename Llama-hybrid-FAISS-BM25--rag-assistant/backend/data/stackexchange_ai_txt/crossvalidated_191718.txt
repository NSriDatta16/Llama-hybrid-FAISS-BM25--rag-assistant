Maximizing the utility of performing PCA

Besides for generating a biplot and screeplot, are there any other useful graphical outputs that I can obtain from running PCA on a multivariate dataset? So, to sum up, my question really comes down to how much juice I can squeeze out of performing PCA on any arbitrary multivariate dataset, or complementing the PCA with a follow-on test (e.g., linear discriminant analysis or factor analysis) to glean as much useful information (both graphical and numerical) as possible from a dataset.
