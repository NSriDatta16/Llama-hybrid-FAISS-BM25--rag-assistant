Selecting Multiple Text Objects

Consider there are two text field objects: TextField1="texta"; TextField2="textb"; Output: texta textb Now I want to select from "ta" in TextField1 to "tex" in TextField2. By the drag of a mouse. I know that by conventional methods it is not possible? Is there any other way to achieve this? And I need to highlight the text also. Please help me....
