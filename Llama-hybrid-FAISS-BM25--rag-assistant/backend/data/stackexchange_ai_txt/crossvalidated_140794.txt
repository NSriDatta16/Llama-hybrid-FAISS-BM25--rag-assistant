The Lyapunov characteristic exponent [LCE] gives the rate of exponential divergence from perturbed initial conditions. To examine the behavior of an orbit around a point X^*(t), perturb the system and write X(t)=X^ (t)+U(t), (1) where U(t) is the average deviation from the unperturbed trajectory at time t. In a chaotic region, the LCE sigma is independent of X^ (0). It is given by the Oseledec theorem, which states that sigma_i=lim_(t->infty)1/tln|U(t)|. (2) For an n-dimensional mapping, the Lyapunov characteristic exponents are given by sigma_i=lim_(N->infty)ln|lambda_i(N)| (3) for i=1, ..., n, where lambda_i is the Lyapunov characteristic number.
