I would say that you should try to consolidate CSS into as few files as possible in order to reduce connections needed to load the CSS dependencies; this will speed up initial page load time. You should also try to leverage a Master Page at least for common elements such as loading jQuery, CSS, etc. Finally, I would use GREP for Windows and add it to Visual Studio as a Toolbox item to do simple text searches like this: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm
