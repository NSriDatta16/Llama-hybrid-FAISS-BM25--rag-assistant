I don't know of an out of the box way you can parse the SCM message as part of the trigger. You have a couple of options that might achieve what you want though Write your own Hudson SCM plugin Chain your jobs together into a build pipeline. The first job could simply look for that message in the changelog.xml to determine if the next build is triggered or not. If you are looking at building a pipeline of build jobs, check out the build-pipeline-plugin. http://www.centrumsystems.com.au/blog/?p=121 Anyone got a more elegant solution?? Cheers, Geoff
