What is no ' information rate ' algorithm?

I plan to implement ' no information rate ' as part of summary statistics. This statistic is implemented in r ( Optimise SVM to avoid false-negative in binary classification ) but not in Python (at least I cannot find a reference) . Is there a canonical reference that I can refer to so as to implement this algorithm ? I've searched Wikipedia and various Google searches but have not found a reference. Update : Reading caret doc https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/caret.pdf " The overall accuracy rate is computed along with a 95 percent confidence interval for this rate (using binom.test) and a one-sided test to see if the accuracy is better than the "no information rate," which is taken to be the largest class percentage in the data. "
