Getting a Broken Pipe while uploading an mp3 with paperclip

Keep getting a broken pipe after uploading a mp3 with paperclip to S3. What did i do wrong? Model has_attached_file :mp3, :storage => :s3, :path => 'mp3/:class/:id/:style.:extension', :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :bucket => 'cobras-production', :url => ':s3_domain_url' Controller def create @track = Track.new(params[:track]) if @track.save redirect_to(@track, :notice => 'Track was successfully created.') else render :action => "new" end end
