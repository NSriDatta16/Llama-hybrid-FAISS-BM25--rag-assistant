The standard make install target of the Python 3.0 sources doesn't install a python binary. Instead, make install prints at the end * Note: not installed as 'python'. * Use 'make fullinstall' to install as 'python'. * However, 'make fullinstall' is discouraged, * as it will clobber your Python 2.x installation. So don't worry. If you easily want to remove the entire installation, do something like configure --prefix=/usr/local/py3
