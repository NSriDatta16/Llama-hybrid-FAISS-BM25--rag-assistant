Cannot save prepopulated sql database to core data sql database: managedObjectModel not found

my program needs to take a prepopulated sql database and then save the records to the app's database. Unfortunately for some reason the application quits in this method in the application delegate: #pragma mark - #pragma mark Core Data stack - (NSManagedObjectModel *)managedObjectModel { if (managedObjectModel_ != nil) { return managedObjectModel_; } NSString *modelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"iProspectLite" ofType:@"sqlite"]; NSURL *modelURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:modelPath]; managedObjectModel_ = [[NSManagedObjectModel alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:modelURL]; return managedObjectModel_; } it seems as if the application cannot find a valid managedObjectModel_, or it doesn't exist, or is not creating one. How do i solve this? one of the error messages I get on the console is this: Terminating app due to uncaught exception reason: [NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:] part of this I have narrowed down to the NSManagedObject, in that there doesn't seem to be one created or found. Other information that may be helpful: I added an entity and defined attributes as described in many other core-data tutorials the following is the class that defines my entity: #import "Mine.h" @implementation Mine @dynamic primarykey; @dynamic name; @dynamic firstCommodity; @dynamic longitude; @dynamic county; @dynamic secondCommodity; @dynamic latitude; @dynamic thirdCommodity; @end
