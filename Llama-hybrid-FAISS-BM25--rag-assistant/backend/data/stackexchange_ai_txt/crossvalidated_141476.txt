This problem is a natural fit for straightforward Bayesian methods. In Bayesian terms, what you're asking is the posterior probability that the next draw from this categorical distribution will be Sunday. The answer depends on the prior distribution we choose for this variable, which can be thought of as our beliefs, prior to seeing any data, about what day the postman would deliver the package. A prior that expresses a weak belief that each day is equally likely seems reasonable. The conjugate prior of the categorical distribution is the Dirichlet, and a flat Dirichlet, with parameters (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), expresses a weak belief in uniformity, as desired. Now the posterior probability of a new draw being each day of the week is easy to calculate : it's equal to the ratio of observations for that day (plus 1 for the prior) to the total number of observations (plus 7 for the prior). We get (79 / 107, 6 / 107, 1 / 107, 10 / 107, 1 / 107, 1 / 107, 9 / 107) = (.738, .056, .009, .093, .009, 0.009, 0.084). The highest probability is the one for Sunday, so that's the single most likely day. Its value is .738, so the package's probability of delivery on Sunday is .738. Notice that .738 is a little less than 78%, which is the observed rate in the data. This makes sense because we have a lot of data relative to the prior, so our posterior belief should mostly reflect the data, with a slight slant towards our prior belief in uniformity (towards .143, or 1/7).
