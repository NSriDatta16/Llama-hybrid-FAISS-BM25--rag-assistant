In addition to posted comments, how did you start your Restlet application? Using the Server class, as below: public class MailServerApplication extends Application { (...) public static void main(String[] args) { try { Server server = new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8084); server.setNext(new MailServerApplication()); server.start(); System.out.println("Press a key to stop"); System.in.read(); } catch(Exception ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } } } As you said, you develop a JavaEE application, perhaps did you use the servlet extension? In this case, mapping at servlet level can also enter into account. With the first approach, I made work your application with org.restlet.jar and org.restlet.ext.xml.jar (version 2.0.5, jee edition). I accessed it using url http://localhost:8084/accounts/10/mails/1 . Hope it helps you. Thierry
