Preconditions for averaging time series

I have several time series of annual data from which I'd like to calculate a yearly mean (arithmetic or robust). Am I correct to assume that each of these time series has to fulfill the conditions of having the same mean and being homoskedastic (i.e. stationarity)? Is it also important to prewhiten the individual series (i.e. remove autocorrelation)? Is there a canonical reference on this topic?
