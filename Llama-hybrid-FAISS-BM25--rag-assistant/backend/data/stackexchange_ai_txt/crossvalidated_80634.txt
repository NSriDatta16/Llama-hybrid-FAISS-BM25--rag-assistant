For your aim, precision/recall curves are not that relevant. Yours is a probability estimation problem, something that logistic regression and its many variations can do quite nicely. There is nothing magic about a probability threshold of 0.5 nor is it needed. You can choose $k$ based on cost and inspect the units with the $k$ highest predicted probabilities. Also, plot a lift curve. The estimated probabilities are also self-contained error rates. Always keep then handy during the inspection process as this will make the inspectors aware of "close calls."
