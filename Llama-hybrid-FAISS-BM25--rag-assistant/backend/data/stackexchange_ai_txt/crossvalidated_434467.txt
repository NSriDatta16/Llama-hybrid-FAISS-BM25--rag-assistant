Suppose you have a set of time-series data values $x_1,...,x_n$ . For some value $k in the series, the corresponding moving average over $k$ periods up to time $t$ is: $$\bar{x}_{t}^{(k)} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_{t-i}.$$ As you change the last time period $t$ you move the average to be an average over different values (but always over $k$ consecutive values). This means that you get a running sequence of moving averages $\bar{x}_{k}^{(k)}, ..., \bar{x}_{n}^{(k)}$ where each average is over $k$ consecutive values. This "moving average" generally gives you a sense of how the series is changing, but in a "smoothed" fashion. Now, first-order differences are a different thing to this. The (backwards) first-order differences are the values: $$\nabla x_t = x_t - x_{t-1}.$$ By taking the first-order differences at different time points you get a sequence of differences $\nabla x_2, ..., \nabla x_n$ that show how the time-series is changing each period. The moving average and the first-order difference are two different things, but it is useful to note that they can be interacted with each other in useful ways. For example, if we take the first-order difference of the moving average , we get: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \nabla \bar{x}_{t}^{(k)} &= \bar{x}_{t,k} - \bar{x}_{t-1,k} \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_{t-i} - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_{t-i-1} \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{k} \Bigg( \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_{t-i} - \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_{t-i} \Bigg) \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{k} ( x_{t} - x_{t-k} ) \\[6pt] &= \frac{\nabla_k}{k} x_{t}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ We can see that this is $1/k$ times the $k$ -level difference of the series values (which is a useful demonstration of the fact that using the moving average causes the changes in the values to be "smoothed").
