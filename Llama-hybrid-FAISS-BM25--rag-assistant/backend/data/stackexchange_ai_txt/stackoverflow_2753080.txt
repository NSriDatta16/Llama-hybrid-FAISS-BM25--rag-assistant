Usability - How to edit favorites?

I'd like to get some opinions about about usability in the following case: Target group people from 30-50, low to middle internet affinity. App: I have a website with login. Visitors can save interesseting pages in their fav-box for fast access. Here the actual question: How to edit this favorites? Is it better to give the visitors direct access to drag/dropn and delete their favs or is it better to have an edit button so they have to activate the edit mode before? The fav-link would look like this > | link text to click | icon-drag | icon-delete | thx for input TC
