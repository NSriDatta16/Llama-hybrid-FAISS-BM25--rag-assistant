Testing machine learning models using a different set of labels

I have a dataset with 119 features and 228 samples. I have trained my classifier using a particular set of labels (0 and 1). Now I want to test how the model is performing to external data. There is not a single dataset out there with the same labels (0 and 1). But my supervisor really wanted to look for external validation of our model. That prompted me to look of other test datasets with the same feature set but a different label. I found one such dataset with 55 features overlapping with my train set. But the labels for the new test set are 67% correlated with my train labels. Should I test my model on this new data?
