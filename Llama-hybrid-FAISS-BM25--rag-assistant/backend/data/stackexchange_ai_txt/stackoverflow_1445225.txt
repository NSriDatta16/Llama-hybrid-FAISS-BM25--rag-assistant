Refactoring DB Migrations in Ruby on Rails

When project grows up, the number of migrations starts to be pretty high, and as I look back, I see many migrations that could be refactored. Like merging create_posts and rename_posts_to_responses into create_responses . Is this a bad habbit or should I encourage refactoring migrations?
