Assessing Repeatability of a Multivariate Measurement

I have a measurement that was taken 10 times on a sample. The measurement has roughly 11K points. If you're curious, I'm looking at mass spectrum data. I want to determine the repeatability of the spectra. I am looking at either using ANOVA to do this, or using a PCA to determine how close the PC coordinates (PC1, PC2) are to each other. Would either of these options give a good measure of repeatability for this application or is there another method that would be better? I've looked at this post and I've eliminated co-inertia analysis since it is used to compare only two multivariate data sets. Not sure how to use option 2 in the accepted answer and option 3 seems like using PCA.
