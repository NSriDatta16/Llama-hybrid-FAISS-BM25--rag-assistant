It looks to me that it's saying both of these indices have the exact same properties and just have different Keynames, having two indices will create extra storage space as well as run-time to inserts (there is no reason to do this that I can think of) more detail on the topic can be found here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-index.html the PRIMARY one is created by phpMyAdmin I believe and it appears the index one was created manually, but is a duplication of work.
