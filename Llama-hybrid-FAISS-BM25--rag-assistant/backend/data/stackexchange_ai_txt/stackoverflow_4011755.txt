Hopefully, your MYSQL database has a primary key? If it does, set the value of each to the primary key of the item. For example: SQL id desc 1 "dressmaker thing with mannequin" 2 "dressmaker thing no mannequin" Form PHP echo " ".$query['desc']." "; When form is submitted, re-query the database for the desired description. You'll be doing this re-query anyway to retrieve prices and such, yes? The reason this is happening is that spaces are discouraged in HTML attributes. You shouldn't have an attribute like value='this attribute is spaced' .
