3d game engine suggestions

I am developing a 3d shooter game that I would like to run on Computers/Phones/Tablets and would like some help to choose which engine to use. I would like to write the application once and port it over to Android/iOS/windows/mac with ease. I would like to make the application streamable over the internet. The engine needs some physics(collision detection) as well as 3d rendering capabilities I would prefer to use a scripting language such as Javascript or Python to Java or C++(although I would be willing to learn these if it is the best option) -My desire is to use an engine that is Code-based and not GUI-based, an engine that is more like a library which I can import into my Python files(for instance) than an application which forces me to rely on its GUI to import assets and establish relationships between them. This desire stems from my recent experience with Unity3d and Blender. The way I had designed my code required me to write dozens of disorganized scripts to control various objects. I cannot help but think that if I had written my program in a series of python files that I would be able to do a neater, faster job. I'd appreciate any suggestions. The closest thing to what I want is Panda3d, but I had a difficult time working with textures, and I am not convinced that my application can be made easily available to mobile phone/device users. If there is a similar option that you can think about, I'd appreciate the tip.
