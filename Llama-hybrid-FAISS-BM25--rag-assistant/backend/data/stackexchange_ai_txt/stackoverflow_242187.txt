Drag drop block edit in place html

I required to write a small web application that allow customer to select predefined layout template in html and be able to modify it. The application need to allow customer to add block text to pre defined area and images. The block texts need to be able to reorder based on customer need. eg. move up , move down or move to sidebar. THe complete layout will be able to convert to table layout and inline css due to email program doesn't like div & css. I don't know where should I looking for the information to make this happen, could anyone show me how to do this. Thank you
