Can a decision tree automatically detect the effect on the dependent variable from the product/quotient of two independent variables?

For example, when I use the xgboost algorithm, there are two continuous variables X1 and X2, do I need to specify the product X1*X2 explicitly at the beginning? Or the algorithm can automatically pick up the effect of the X1*X2?
