Since this thread has been deemed to be a definitive "how to interpret the normal q-q plot" StackExchange post, I would like to point readers to a nice, precise mathematical relationship between the normal q-q plot and the excess kurtosis statistic. Here it is: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/354076/102879 A brief (and too simplified) summary is given as follows (see the link for more precise mathematical statements): You can actually see excess kurtosis in the normal q-q plot as the average distance between the data quantiles and the corresponding theoretical normal quantiles, weighted by distance from data to the mean. Thus, when the absolute values in the tails of the q-q plot generally deviate from the expected normal values greatly in the extreme directions, you have positive excess kurtosis. Because kurtosis is the average of these deviations weighted by distances from the mean, the values near the center of the q-q plot have little impact on kurtosis. Hence, excess kurtosis is not related to the center of the distribution, where the "peak" is. Rather, excess kurtosis is almost entirely determined by the comparison of the tails of the data distribution to the normal distribution.
