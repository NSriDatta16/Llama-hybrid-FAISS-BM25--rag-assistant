This is exactly how the iPhone touch delegation works. It calls touchesBegan: , touchesMoved: and touchesEnded: . To draw the lines, you need this code: CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); [current set]; CGContextSetLineWidth(context, 4.0f); for (int i = 0; i And with the help of this code, you should be ready to make it. If you need any help, just comment on this or make another question. CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; [self.points addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:pt]]; [self setNeedsDisplay];
