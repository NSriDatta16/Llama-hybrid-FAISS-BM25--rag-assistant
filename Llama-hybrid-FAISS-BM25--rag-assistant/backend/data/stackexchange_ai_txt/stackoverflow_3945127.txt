Repcached issue

Anyone using repcached? Basically, I am experimenting with it in order to use it for storing sessions there, while providing failover with its buildin replication Basically, I have 2 nodes running centos 5.4. The replication works fine wi\hen testing it and running some benchmarks with ab. However, I am doing the below test. I am having the 2 nodes started and replicating and start an ab test. While the benchmark is running, I take down one of the node, just to check the fail over. At that point apache's error log starts printing [Fri Oct 15 21:39:02 2010] [notice] child pid 2941 exit signal Segmentation fault (11) It seems that some requests fail during the fail over Anyone encountered such behavior? Thanks
