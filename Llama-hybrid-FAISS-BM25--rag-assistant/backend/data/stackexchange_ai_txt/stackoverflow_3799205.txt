Sorry, I do not know the particularities of static libs used here, but here are some other thoughts I remember from other platforms. First of all, the problem appears to be that the class information isn't fully available to the runtime system, hence the error. Ergo, the static lib either doesn't include the needed information or the linker doesn't pass the information on. In the latter case, you're toast unless you can find extra linker options that enable such a feature. Hence, read the linker manual to see if there are related options. In the former case, you could first look at the exported symbols with a tool (I believe "nm" can do this) to verify that the class name and its structure desciption is part of the symbols in the lib. I don't know how it has to look like, but maybe Google helps. Another thought: Is that particular class being referenced by the main code? If not, the linker might not include it in the final code because it figures it's only used inside the static lib's environment and is thus not needed elsewhere. Hence, try to see if declarations either in the compiler's or linker's command options, or pragmas in source code, allow you to make this class globally known. Good luck!
