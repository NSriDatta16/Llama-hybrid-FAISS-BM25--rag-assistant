I have the same exact question as you -- so far the best CMS I've come across for data collection from forms is Concrete5 ( http://concrete5.org ). Any time you use their "form" block, the submissions are sent to the "Reports" section on the back end of the dashboard. I don't love their organization method, but it's the best I've seen so far, and it also lets you dump to a file.
