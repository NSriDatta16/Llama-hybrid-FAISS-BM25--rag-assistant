Although you indicated that you would not want to use different library or framework, it is worth noting that all good Java streaming parsers (Xerces for Sax, Woodstox and Aalto for Stax) do make location information available for all events/tokens they serve. Although this information is not always retained by higher-level abstractions like DOM trees (due to additional storage needed; performance isn't big concern since location information is always tracked as it is needed for error reporting anyway) this may be easy or at least possible to fix.
