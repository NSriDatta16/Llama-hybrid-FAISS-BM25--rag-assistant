Is Cassandra suitable to use as a primary data store?

I'm evaluating a storage platform for an upcoming project and keep coming back to Cassandra. For this project loosing any amount of data is unacceptable. So far we've used a relational database (Microsoft SQL Server), but the data is so varied and large that it has become an issue to store and query. Is Cassandra robust enough to use as a primary data store? Or should it only be used to mirror existing data to speed up access?
