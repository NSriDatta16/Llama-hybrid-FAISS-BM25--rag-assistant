Imposing Constraints on SVM Regression

I am trying to model time series data that looks similar to the made up data below Sales Store MainSales Distance Temperature Date 100 'Main' 100 0 25 20181120 80 1 100 5 25 20181120 65 2 100 10 25 20181120 80 'Main' 80 0 20 20181121 75 1 80 5 20 20181121 70 2 80 10 20 20181121 ..... Sales ~ f(MainSales, Distance, Temperature) Relationship is non-linear and I was hoping to use something like SVM regression with RBF kernel. My questions are Are there any problems with using a subset of my dependent variable as a feature? The fitted model is not very good at picking up the fact that Sales = MainSales when Distance = 0. Is there a way to force this relationship in SVM (somewhat like rewriting the equation and forcing intercept to 0) If 2 is possible can I do it using SVMLib? Is there a better kind of model for this? It looks to me somewhat like a dimension reduction but incorporating other variables I am ultimately interesting in predicting Sales for other shops when given Sales in the main shop as well as other related data.
