When would a 3-layer Neural Network perform better than a 2-layer with the same number of parameters?

I'm interested in knowing what is the benefit of having 3 fully-connected layers in a Neural Network instead of 2. Many deep Neural Networks such as ImageNet do this. Why is this superior as compared to having 2 layers with the same number of parameters? (i.e., more neurons in each layer)
