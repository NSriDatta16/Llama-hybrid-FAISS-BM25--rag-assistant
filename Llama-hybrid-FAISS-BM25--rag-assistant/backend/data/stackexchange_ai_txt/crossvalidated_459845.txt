The Anova table shows whether effect of the individual treatment methods significantly differ from that of the rest of the treatment methods as a whole. In other words. the F values is calculated as a ratio between the average of the sum of the squares of individual treatment methods to the average of the squares of the residual. The intercept in the linear regression denotes treatment factor 1. I would suggest the model with the treatment factor would of good fit. I would also suggest you to group the treatment factors other than 8 and 9 into a single factor and rerun the analysis. It may give you some clarity.
