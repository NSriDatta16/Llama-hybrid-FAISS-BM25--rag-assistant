Build ASP.net headered control

Currently I'm working on a extensive form, which I'd like to organise by grouping input fields in groupbox-like panels. These panels have an header, a minimize and pin icon. Also inner controls should be able to perform two-way binding to the FormViews datasource. I can't find any builtin asp.net control that does the job. What is the best way to accomplish this feature request? Any examples available on this (can't find a decent one)? Many thanks!
