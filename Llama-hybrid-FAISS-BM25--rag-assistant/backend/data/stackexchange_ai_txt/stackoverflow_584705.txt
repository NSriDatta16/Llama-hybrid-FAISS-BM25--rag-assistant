Are you looking for any particular constraints on a subtree? If not, a simple traversa l should suffice for identifying subtrees (basically treat each node as the root of a subtree). I believe you'll find that the API you'll want for a tree varies a great deal by your particular application -- so much that generic implementations are not very useful. Perhaps if you could tell us what kind of application the tree will be used for, we could provide particulars. Also, if you're just using a tree for data storage, you might want to ask yourself why you need a tree. That answer should also answer the question in my previous paragraph.
