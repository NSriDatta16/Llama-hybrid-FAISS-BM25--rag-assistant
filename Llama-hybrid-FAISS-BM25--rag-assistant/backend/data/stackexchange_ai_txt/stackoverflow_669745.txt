Screen scrape web page that displays data page wise using Mechanize

I am trying to screen scrape a web page (using Mechanize) which displays the records in a grid page wise. I am able to read the values displayed in the first page but now need to navigate to the next page to read appropriate values. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... I am able to get through all the links but when I try this:- links = (row/"a") links.each do |link| agent.click link.attributes['href'] # This fails agent.click link # This also fails end Reason is that agent.click expects the URL as an argument. Is there a way where we can read all the values when they are displayed page wise ? If not how can we have such a click action when the href is a postback and not a URL??
