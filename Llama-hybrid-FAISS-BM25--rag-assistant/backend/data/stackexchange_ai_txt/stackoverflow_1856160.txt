Catch Id (INT AUTO INCREMENT) of a Record after INSERT INTO Statement

This is my first time I use MySQL as datastorage for my C# Application, as I've seen that there is no UNIQUEIDENTIFIER type as in SQL server I decieded to use INT with AUTO_INCREMENT, my problem is now if I execute a INSERT, how may I get the ID of the Record I just added. My quick and dirty solution has been to execute a SELECT MAX(ID) FROM table Statement. But this doesn't seem consistent. I belive there is a better solution something like mysql_insert_id() (PHP). Any Idea how to resolve this in C#?
