Is it fast enough? That totally depends on your site, of course. For a trivial or prototype site it'd be fine, but I certainly wouldn't want to deploy a DOM-templating solution on a complex, high-traffic site. You won't be able to generate HTML-compatible-XHTML this way; you'll have to choose between saveXML which produces pure, non-IE-compatible XHTML, and saveHTML , which creates HTML4. CDATA elements like style and script may also need some attention. DOM calls are also very verbose for content creation, like creating nodes in JavaScript without the benefit of helper functions or frameworks. I'm not sure the resulting code is going to be that readable, in comparison to PHP templating. You can make PHP templating ‘cleaner’ in a simpler way by using a consistent markup tree, treating PHP structures like ... as if they were XML start and end tags, and always nesting and indenting them consistently in the ‘well-formed’ style. See eg. this question for some discussion.
