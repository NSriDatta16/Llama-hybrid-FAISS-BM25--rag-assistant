With SQLite, creating the tables yourself is a good approach. You don't need to be making your installation instructions for your customers any more complex than they already are, and if the database is entirely internal to your application, they probably don't even care what format it is in, so long as your software is reliable and fast. Firefox, for example, uses SQLite for its internal storage these days, and they never bother the user to create databases. And users like it that way. :) But I wouldn't worry too much about creating the database immediately prior to referencing the tables: instead, I would place the creation logic at application startup or installation time, whichever is more appropriate. Where are the CSV files created in your application now? Are they created afresh, every single time they are referenced? Or are they created in initialization or installation routines too?
