When we say extract a causal DAG from a multivariate time series, what does it actually mean?

I am from CS background and as part of my PhD, I am doing a project where I need to used causal inference to construct a causal DAG (directed acyclic graph) from a multivariate time series data. As I am new to causal inference, I am not understanding whether it is possible to get a causal DAG from a time series data like from a tabular data (where I can use algorithms like FGES to find out the causal relationship between features). I have referred the following papers but I am still having difficulty to understand what a causal relationship in a multivariate time series means. Does it mean to have relationship between multiple features or how the past value of the feature can affect the future value of the feature. https://paperswithcode.com/paper/neural-granger-causality-for-nonlinear-time https://paperswithcode.com/paper/amortized-causal-discovery-learning-to-infer
