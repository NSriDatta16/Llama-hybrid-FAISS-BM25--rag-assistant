If you are a beginner to the time Sseries topic: I would advise you to someone, who has the same charm as Josh Starmer: He is known under the channel ritvikmath: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY-j2Wof51c&t=6s You should check if your series is stationary by applying visual, global/local tests of rolling windows (e.g. mean,variance) but the better would be a statistical test. Thus, I would advise you to check this video, and the video on white noise If you then still dont know how to deal with your time series, we are pleased to help you. But I would advise to first look into a few of his incredible vids.
