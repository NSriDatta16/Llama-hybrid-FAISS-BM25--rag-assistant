How to prevent script loading in different domain

I have that can be loaded in several domains. I want to know if there is a way to control the domains it will be loaded on. To clarify: My script is server-side rendered, so basically I can return empty string if the requested domain is invalid. This is to prevent from other sites embedding my script. Thanks!
