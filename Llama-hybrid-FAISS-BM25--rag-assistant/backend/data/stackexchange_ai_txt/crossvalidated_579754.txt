Note that the variation of the imputed unobserved values should be higher than of the really observed ones, because in addition to the variation the values would have even if you had measured them, you should also capture the uncertainty about what the values would have been, if they had been measured. The obvious way to get such a reasonable level of variation in the imputed values is to use multiple imputation for time series data (for which there are several available tools such as Amelia , which also has a R package - but in principle you could fit any Bayesian model and predict the missing days from the posterior predictive distribution). The main trick would be to find good representations of the input data to capture the cyclic nature of the data (e.g. by creating categorical calendar month (or week) features, categorical "hour of the day" features, or perhaps cyclic spline representations of minute in the day, day of the year etc.) that let the imputation model realize that it should impute in part based on the same time periods in previous years and times on other days. Additionally, you might want to provide the imputation model with additional data that may not be as granular as the day you are interested in, but might help it (in part due to not being missing for the days for which you are imputing), e.g. ground-level wind speed predicted for the region by the national weather service, or perhaps national or regional wind power generation on the day or the week and things like that, which you can obtain.
