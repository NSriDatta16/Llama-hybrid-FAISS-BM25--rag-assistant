forecast product demand in one week using machine learning approach

I'm trying to predict product demand in store. The predictors I have include price, competitor's price, store ID, date. My target variable is sales volume (in a particular store). What I need to predict is sales in a store one week in advance. I'm thinking about how I should approach this problem. The goal is to predict sales one week in advance, I'm a little confused about how I should use predictors for prediction. How I should do the model validation (for predictions one week in advance). How can I incorporate seasonality in the model if I use random forest... Really appreciate it if anyone can help clarifying this. Thanks a lot!
