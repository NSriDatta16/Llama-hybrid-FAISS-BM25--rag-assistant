Bayesian model for the reliability of a manufacturing process with noninformative prior

We have a manufacturing process $M$ with an unknown reliability $R \in (0,1)$ , and, at the end of it, an automatic tool that sorts the good and bad products with a known efficiency of $E \in (0,1)$ . Here is what I intend by 'reliability': Let us denote by $X$ the random variable fabricated by a manufacturing process that represents the quality of a product and that can take on values in the set $\{ 'good','bad'\}$ . Then, if the latter process has a reliability of $R$ , we have $\mathbb{P}(X = 'good') = R$ . We can show that the final reliability $R_f$ of $M$ is given by: $$ R_f = \frac{R}{R + (1-E)(1-R)} \ \ \ \ \ (1). $$ This is equivalent to $$ \mathbb{P}(X = 'good'|R) = R_f = \frac{R}{R + (1-E)(1-R)} $$ The question is how to estimate $R_f$ since $R$ is unknown? My first step was to suppose that $R \geq 0.5$ since it is a necessary condition for $R_f \geq E$ and that we can strongly hope that $M$ performs better than $0.5$ . My second step was to set a uniform prior $p_R$ for $R$ on the interval $(0.5,1)$ . Then, this leads to: $$ P(X = 'good') = \int_{0.5}^1 \mathbb{P}(X = 'good'|R) p_R(r) dr $$ $$ = \int_{0.5}^1 \frac{r}{r + (1-E)(1-r)} \cdot 2 dr $$ $$ = \frac{2}{E} [r - K\ln(K+r)]\big|_{0.5}^1 $$ $$ = \frac{2}{E} \cdot \left(0.5 + K\ln\left( \frac{K + 0.5}{K + 1} \right) \right) \ \ \ (2) $$ where $K = \frac{1-E}{E}$ . Can one of you challenge a bit this result? is it a good idea to use the uniform prior as a non informative prior or other priors can be more appropriate? Furthermore, something seems strange. Why, when $E$ goes to zero the expression (2) goes to infinity? This should be never larger than one.
