PCA on repeated measures data

I have five dependent variables in my study. All measuring listening effort, but has different constructs (some DVs not correlated). I have measured these five variables on same subjects at 6 different SNRs at two presentation levels (total 6*2=12 conditions). I would like to run PCA on this data to reduce number of dependent variables and understand how the variables are related to each other. Can I do that considering I have repeated measures data is the question. Can anyone please help me understand why I should not run a PCA in this case if that is inappropriate? Thanks for any help!
