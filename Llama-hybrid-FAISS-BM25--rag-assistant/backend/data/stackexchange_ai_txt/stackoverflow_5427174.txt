Your web server would serve the widgets via a GET request, and would expect a key=xyz parameter to be passed. Your server would check that the key is valid before returning the widget response. The problem is that the customer would need to send the key from the JavaScript on his client's machine. Therefore, all of your customer's clients will know the customer's key. This means it is unreasonable to expect your customers keep their key a secret. I believe what Google Maps does is it associates each key with a domain. If you are embedding the widgets in an iframe, you should be able to check the Referer header to check that indeed this request is coming from the customer's website, and not some other website that ripped off the customer's key. That seems quite secure (it would not be possible for any other website to host your widgets without paying for a key). The only remaining question is: what use is the key at all? Why not just use the Referer to authenticate the sites that are allowed to access the widgets, and not make them go through the hassle of providing a key. I can't seem to think of a reason it is needed. Perhaps someone can think of it in the comments.
