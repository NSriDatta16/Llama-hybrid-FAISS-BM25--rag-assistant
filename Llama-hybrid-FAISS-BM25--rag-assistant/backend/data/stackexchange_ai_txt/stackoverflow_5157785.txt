I had a similar problem and was able to resolve it. I had the content of the site passing through PHP. When I viewed it as a raw HTML file, it would display the characters properly, but if I passed it through PHP (in my case, by using auto_prepend_file), it would turn the characters into question marks. The solution was to turn OFF detect_unicode in the PHP settings. In my case, I just edited the .htaccess file to include the line: php_value detect_unicode "0" ...and the Chinese characters began displaying properly. There might be an equivalent solution using ini_set(). Hope this helps.
