Quick GUI development for a simple app / trivia game

What would be a good tool/IDE/app to build a GUI? Platform: preferably Windows, but can get away with Linux Details: I am an embedded C programmer tasked with writing a simple game for New Year's Party...(some party) Game logic is very simple, grab args, alter string, display string on screen (command line version done..). However, the interface should look "cool" with preferably some transitional effects when changing values, and some neat visual ways of changing said values. I have a designer(not a programmer) friend who'll help with layout. Having said all that, what would be your advice on how to build the GUI? Hand coding would seem counterproductive here. EDIT: In a nutshell, I am looking for some WYSIWYGish tool to drag around entry boxes/buttons/whatnot and add a nice background picture, then glue it with my logic code.
