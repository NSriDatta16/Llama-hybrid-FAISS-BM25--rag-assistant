Your question about Bayesian Time Series falls perhaps into Bayesian state-space models ( Bayesian Filtering ) and the problem could be formulated under the same structure. Within Bayesian state-space models, under the assumption of linearity, you could structure you dynamics as in a Kalman Filter (the "easiest" you can get). $$ x_{k+1} = Ax + w_k \\ y_{k+1} = Hx + v_k $$ where, if you assume the latent variables are the weights given to the AR factors (down until $t-n$): $$x_k = x_{k-1} = x = \begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} = a$$ and $$H = [y_{k} \quad y_{k-1} \quad .. ] \dot \quad a$$ A Bayesian state-space model gives you: the possibility to fine-tune the weight given to the latest measurements the possibility to have the weights on the AR factors adapted in response to new data Your questions seemed concerned about fine-tuning how much weight should be given to the latest measurements. If we model the measurement noise $v_k$ where $v_k \sim N(0, e_v)$ "smaller" (*) than the model uncertainty, the filter will rely on the latest measurement and update the AR factors $a$ faster in response to high prediction errors You can see how some AR, MA and ARMA models can be refactored into state-space models here (*) lot's to say about this - I am trying to convey the idea here.
