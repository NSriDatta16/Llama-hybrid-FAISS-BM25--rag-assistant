jQuery: set value of table cell inside div

I have a floating div which contains a title and I want to change that title. I tried this: $("div#dragTitle3").text("New Title"); But the title is actually in a table inside the div. This is the table: Announcements I want to know how I can change the title without entering the whole table's code when I set the new table.
