I don't know if your network graph is common amongst other GitHub projects, but it has only only one issue: The main reference line (top block one) is not linear. Meaning anyone pulling from it some time ago is likely, when he/she finally update its local copy, to apply the " RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE " paragraph if they want to apply their local work on top of the new history. Other than that, long-lived branches (like the bottom red one) are always harder to merge (but off course, much easier than with Subversion). Nothing major though.
