If you want to continue doing predictions in R, just serialise the fit object to disk and load that into your R session whenever you want to do some new predictions. The same would work for the logistic regression model as well. For this I would use saveRDS() , but save() would work too: saveRDS(fit, "my-fitted-rf.rds") ## or via save save(fit, "my-fitted-rf.rda") Then in some new session, load randomForest and then load your fitted model library("randomForest") ## if used saveRDS fit Then you can do predictions: predict(fit, testing) save() stores the object with its name, but serialising via saveRDS doesn't. That can be an advantage if you already have an object fit in the workspace: save() would overwrite it...
