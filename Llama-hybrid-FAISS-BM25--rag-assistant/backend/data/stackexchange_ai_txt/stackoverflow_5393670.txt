How should I (intelligently) store and archive large xml files for a data import

We've got a rails app that processes large amounts of xml data imports. Right now we're storing these ~5MB xml docs in Postgres. This is not ideal given that we use each xml doc once or twice for parsing. We'd like to have an intelligent way of storing and archiving these docs, but not overly complicate the retrieval process for the sake of space. We've considered moving the docs to Mongo (which we're also using), but then aren't we just artificially boosting the memory requirements of our Mongo db servers? What's the best way for us to deal with this?
