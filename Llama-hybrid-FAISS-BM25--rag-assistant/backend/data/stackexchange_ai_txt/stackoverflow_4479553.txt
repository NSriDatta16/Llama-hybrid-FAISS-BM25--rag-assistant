You're making good progress. You don't need the static_cast s in averageGrade . printResults is missing most of its function signature. In sumGrades , gpa and gender should be local variables, not parameters. You also want to compare to the character literals 'm' and 'f' , not variables named m and f with random contents. Streams should ALWAYS be passed by reference, they can't be copied. When reading from a stream, you should test the stream itself in your while loop, not eof() . Did you have a question?
