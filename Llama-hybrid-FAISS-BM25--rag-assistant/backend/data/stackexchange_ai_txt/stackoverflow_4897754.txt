How to fix "Apple is not currently accepting applications built with this version of the SDK." error for distributing an iOS SDK 4.2 app

This is very similar to a couple of other questions on stackoverflow, but they all seem to be from last year and referring to lower version numbers. I have: xcode version 3.2.5 A distribution build with Base SDK = Latest iOS (currently set to iOS 4.2), iOS Deployment Target = iOS 3.2 I've tried the following without much luck: Deployed to a device (not the simulator) Setting the iOS Deployment target to 3.0, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2 Cleaned my xcode cache Deployed through Application Loader and Organizer Did a clean build Reinstalled xcode Tried finding a version of the SDK I'm sure iOS 4.2 should be out of beta now , so I don't think this is the issue either. Any other ideas? Is there any way of getting more information about the versions of the SDK that apple want? Very frustrating indeed!
