One sample case test on means

A recent reporter indicated that waiters and waitresses at casual dining restaurants make an average of $\$100$ per night in tips with a standard deviation of $\$15$. Maureen works in a casual dining restaurant and doesn't think this is correct. She feels she makes much less than this in an average night. Over the next five work nights, she computes her tips and the average is $\$95$. Does Maureen make significantly less than what the report stated at the $1\%$ level of significance?
