Detect drag and drop operations in an external application using .Net

I need to detect drag and drop operations in an external application , is it possible? I thought of writing a hook to detect these operations. Can anybody point me in the right direction as far as which messages or api functions I could attempt to hook to detect the Drag & Drop events? I want to do this in C#. Thanks in advance.
