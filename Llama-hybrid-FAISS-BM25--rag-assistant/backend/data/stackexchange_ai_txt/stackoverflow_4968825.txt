My rule of thumb is that the data must somehow be in the model, either as a ready to use SelectList or at worst in some container that can easily be turned into a SelectList using a LINQ-to-object call. The bottom line is that the view should never contain any non trivial code. EDIT (answer to your comment): I try not to put too much code in models. Models are more like a simple bunch of data gathered by the controller and used by the view. Regarding simple and/or common things such as the days of week, I believe an HTML helper is the most elegant solution. See WayneC's answer in this question .
