Genetic algorithms(GAs): to be considered only as optimization algorithms? Are GAs used in machine learning any way?

As a quick question, what are genetic algorithms meant to be used for? I read somewhere else that they should be used as optimization algorithms (similar to the way we use gradient descent to optimize the best parameters search with a linear regression, neural network...). If so, why are these GAs not so much present in machine learning (or at least I did not see it too much in the literature)?
