In your post, what you are describing is feature selection. You can find many posts on methods for feature selection. Here are two popular posts Algorithms for automatic model selection A more definitive discussion of variable selection What most data scientist/statisticians see as dimension reduction is methods of actually condensing the information in your $m$ variables down to $p$ variables where $p Using principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection Two algorithms/methods that are commonly used for dimension reduction are principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Random Projection . I assume your goal is to select features for a regression model. Depending on your goal/research question, dimension reduction by PCA, or otherwise, may or may not be necessary. Often, interpretability is lost when using dimension reduction, so sticking to other methods of feature selection may behoove you if you'd like to keep interpretation in your statistical results.
