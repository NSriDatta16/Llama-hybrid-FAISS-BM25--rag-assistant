If the proportion of illegitimate sales were known to be the same in all stores, then your problem would be strictly a statistical one. As it is, it's first and foremost a matter of content knowledge: on what bases are you able to estimate the proportion in this store as compared to in others? Do you have any other evidence to bring to bear on this situation? Others more skilled in Bayesian methods will be able to give you specific steps to take so that you can create a credible interval for the proportion in the store in question.
