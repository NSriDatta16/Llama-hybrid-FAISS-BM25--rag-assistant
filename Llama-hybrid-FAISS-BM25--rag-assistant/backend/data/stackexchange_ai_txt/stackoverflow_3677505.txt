I ran into a similar issue when trying to make the helper to change visually (by toggling a class) when dragged over a droppable. Like you, I found the out event didn't fire when I was expecting it to. Through some trial and error, I solved the problem by adding the class on the over event, and removing it on the deactivate event. $("#droppable").droppable({ over: function(event, ui) { ui.helper.toggleClass("over", true); }, deactivate: function(event, ui) { ui.helper.toggleClass("over", false); } });
