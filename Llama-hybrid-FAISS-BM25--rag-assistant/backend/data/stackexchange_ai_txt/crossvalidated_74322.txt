Analyzing installation rates, not quite binomial. Tried bootstrapping. Is there a approximate binomial approach that would be better?

I'm analyzing a data set of installation rates of lighting fixture projects and want to determine the expected installation rate and the confidence interval. Projects have various numbers of fixtures intended to be installed and the most common rate is 100% followed in frequency by a handful of 0% and then a small number of rates besides 0 and 100%. The distribution of the sample data looks like this: In many ways it seems like this data should follow a binomial distribution except for the variable number of fixtures in each project and the possibility of values other than 0 and 1. As a result of this confusion, I simply bootstrapped the average installation rates, weighted by project size, and arrived at this distribution of results. Is this a reasonable approach, or is there a better way to treat this as an approximate binomial distribution with weights for project size, or use a non-parametric approach? Thanks in advance for any assistance...
