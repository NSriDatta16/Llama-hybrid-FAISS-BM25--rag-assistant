Extrapolation of expected value in multivariate regression

Consider a random variables $Y, X, Z$ . Denote by $f$ a function of the expectation of $Y$ : $ f(x,z) = \mathbb{E} [Y\mid X=x, Z=z]$ . Define a marginal function $$g(x) = \mathbb{E} [Y\mid X=x] = \int f(x,z)dF_Z(z).$$ Given an iid sample from $(Y,X,Z)$ of size $n$ , we can estimate $f$ by many different machine learning methods. My question relates to the best technique to extrapolate function $f$ or $g$ outside of observed values. As for the function $g$ , my idea would be to use simply the largest $k values and use linear model on them to extrapolate linearly function $g$ outside of the support. Or even better, put weights on all values, putting much more weight on large values and negligable weight on small values. Do you have some reference for this? If $f$ is multivariate, how can we do this somehow optimally? $g$ , we want to estimate the black line outside of support." />
