Cherry pick an australian address from a page of text

I am trying to parse a prose paragraph for anything that might resemble an address. I have a database of addresses I am matching against and these are the only addresses I am interested in. I'm using a lamp server but technology specific answers aren't what I require right now. More of a question of how. Can anyone provide ideas? Perhaps Regex? or perhaps I should use a database of cities/states etc? Thanks.
