In the interface builder, is the ViewControler is properly bound to the viewController variable in your AppDelegate class? In your AppDelegate.h, there should be something like, IBOutlet UIViewController *viewController; In the interface builder, open MainWindow.xib, right click the App Delegate item and see whether some value has been assigned to the viewController attribute. If not, drag the 'dot' to the your ViewController item in interface builder.
