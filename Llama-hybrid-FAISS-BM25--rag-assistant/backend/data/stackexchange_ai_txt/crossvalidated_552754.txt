Aggregating many correlations

I have measurements of covarying time-series. $X$ and $Y$ both vary in time, but I am interested in finding the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ . I have around 1500 measurements (individual timeseries) for $X$ and $Y$ and am trying to find their correlation. Obviously I cannot simply find the correlation coefficients for $X_i$ and $Y_i$ individually, and then average them (as per the answers in this question Averaging correlation values ) Additionally I cannot use the linear model suggested in that question because I am not simply plotting the correlation of many $Y$ s against 1 $X$ . Can anyone suggest where to go from here? Timeseries pair of $X$ and $Y$ are independent and come from a single individual in the population. Simply aggregating all of the points into a giant dataset is not suitable for this reason either. I'm using statsmodels in Python, but am also happy to use R. Edit: Is it correct to group all of my data into a dataframe with columns: X, Y, ID where ID is a dummy variable for each timeseries. Then I can use any package I want to fit a linear model like X ~ Y + C(ID)?
