Can the k-nearest neighbor algorithm tell you how many clusters there are among predictors?

I recently did a short course on machine learning in R and found the k-means and k-nearest neighbor techniques extremely interesting. Forgive my naivete if this is all wrong, but it seems like the drawback of k-means is that you need to know in advance how many clusters you want to extract from among the data. What I want to know is does the k-nearest neighbor algorithm tell you how many clusters it uses to make its predictions ?
