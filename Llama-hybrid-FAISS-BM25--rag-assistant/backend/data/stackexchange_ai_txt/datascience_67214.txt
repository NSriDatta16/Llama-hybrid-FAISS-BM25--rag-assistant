Importance of Variance in Machine Learning

Selecting a column from a Dataframe, plotting its Histogram using matplotlib and then finding the variance is the steps that I have to take for this part of a project. The final goal of the project is detecting anomalies in data. I understand the part of plotting the data in form of a graph to understand it better. On the other hand I’m not sure why finding the variance of this column is so important. Would really appreciate if I get any information regarding this. I know the definition of variance but just can’t seem to understand the usage and importance of it in this project.
