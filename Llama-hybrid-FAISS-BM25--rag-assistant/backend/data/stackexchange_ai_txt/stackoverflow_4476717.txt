This is a pretty open question as there are so many areas to pick apart. However, for average security, I would at least recommend changing the following. Number 2: Don't use the same salt. This means if the salt is compromised so are all the hashed values. I would recommend one way encrypting the password. Users would rather reset it than know it could be reasonably decrypted. Number 5: Don't forget about SQL Injection. Far more important than LIMIT 1 . Check out mysql_real_escape_string()
