Sorry, but I don't believe the current API allows you access to this data. If you need access to performance counters, you could add your own collection service - but this feels like reinventing the wheel a little. You could, of course, always get your web roles and your hosted service to all talk to a storage account - one that the outside system knows nothing about.
