You have two options to make columns draggable. First is to make all the columns draggable in the DataGrid. You can do this using the draggableColumns property on the DataGrid class. Set its value to true. The second is to set the draggable property on the DataGridColumn class. In both cases, you would drag the columns using the column header. If you want to be able to drag a single cell, there is no way to do this that I know of.
