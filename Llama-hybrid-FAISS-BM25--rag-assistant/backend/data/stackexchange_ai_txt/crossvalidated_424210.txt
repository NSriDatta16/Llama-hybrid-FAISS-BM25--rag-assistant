I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do, but can you fit a pooled logistic regression model ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2281238 )? In this case you would only include 1 during the interval of the terminal event -- it would not repeat after the event has occurred. You would include time in the model in a flexible manner (e.g., expanded using splines).
