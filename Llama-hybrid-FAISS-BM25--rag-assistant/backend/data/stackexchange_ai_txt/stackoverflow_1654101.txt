data storage and retrieval in the database

in PHP while using a form the details what we enter has to be stored in the database... is it like the data gets stored using any encoding scheme in the database...bcoz when i use a different language except English the storage shows some absurd codes in the DB...but when I retrieve the data..it comes as I had enetered in standard English...
