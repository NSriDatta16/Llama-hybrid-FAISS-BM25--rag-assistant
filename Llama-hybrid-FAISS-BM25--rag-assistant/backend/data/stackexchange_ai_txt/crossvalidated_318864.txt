A clear cut answer would depend on the time series, actual transformations and clustering algorithm you have in mind. Reason is most clustering algorithms are based on different similarity function and this metric is based on the transformations themselves. For example transformations that change scale(log) and clustering that based on euclidean distance are "losing" information. Or a transformation that use binning( SAX ) of the time series and a cosine-similarity based clustering might be a bad mix too. Practice wise I would go with option number 2. In my experience there exists a little number of transformations which extract the most relevant characteristics out of your time-series. These transformations would be most apparent when looking at each clustering result separately. If I find any realted atricles on this, will add to my answer. Hope this helps,
