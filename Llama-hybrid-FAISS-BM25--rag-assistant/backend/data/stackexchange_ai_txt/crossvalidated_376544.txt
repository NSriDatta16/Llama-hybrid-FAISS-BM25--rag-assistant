I have some hints for you and I suggest you work from there. I might have made errors as well. If you need more help or find an error, leave a comment. First we write the probability mass function for a having the result $N$ on a single die: $$prob(N_i)=1/6,\, \text{with }N=1,2,3,4,5,6$$ This is a Discrete Uniform Distribution . All results are equally likely since the die is fair. Now consider the result of summing the faces of 25 rolls of the die and taking the average. The average $S$ is given by the sum of $N_i$ with $i=1,...25$ over 25 where the $N_i$ are i.i.d. distributed as above. $$S= \frac{N_1 + N_2 + ... +N_{25}}{25}$$ So we ask what is $prob(S>4)$ . For that you first need the probability distribution of $S$ . Here is where the hint with the Central Limit Theorem comes in handy. It tells us that we can approximate the density of $prob(S)$ can be approximated as Gaussian with $$prob(S) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2/25)$$ where $\mu$ is the expected value of the uniform distribution from above and $\sigma^2$ is its variance. You can calculate them using the information on this Wikipedia page. EDIT If you do not want to use the Gaussian approximation, have a look at the Bates Distribution as suggested by @wolfies. Do you think you can take it from here?
