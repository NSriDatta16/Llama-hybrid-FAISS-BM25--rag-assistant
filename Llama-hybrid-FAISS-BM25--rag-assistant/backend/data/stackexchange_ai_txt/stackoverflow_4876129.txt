Its pretty hard to figure out what you are trying to do, but I think you have two different layouts, each of which has a different radio button. I think you want them to have opposite status, so that when a user checks one, the other will appear unchecked? If so, one way to do this is to save the state of the checkboxes to SharedPreferences . Whenever the user changes the setting of a checkbox, save its state into SharedPreferences . Whenever you load one of your Activites you can then read the value from your preferences and set the UI to match. Data Storage SharedPreferences reference
