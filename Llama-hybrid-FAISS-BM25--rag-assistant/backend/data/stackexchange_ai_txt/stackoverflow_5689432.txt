#include using namespace std; struct Node { int item; // storage for the node's item Node* next; // pointer to the next node }; Node* addNode(Node*& head, int data , int& count) { Node * q; // new node q = new Node; // allocate memory for the new mode q->item = data; // inserting data for the new node q->next = head; // point to previous node ?? how would i do that? ( am i doing it correctly?) count++; // keep track of number of node head = q; return q; } int main() { int a, count=0; int data; bool repeat; Node *head= NULL; //^^ assuming thats creating the first node ^^ do { cout > data; addNode(head, data, count); cout >repeat; } while (repeat == true); // assuming this is the print function while(head != NULL) { cout item next okey i tried adding a new element in the list how would i move the head around like a LIFO memory (stack) so the last element is on the very top.. any help would be appreciated ! The pointers and the nodes are messing with my brain lately ....
