Ordering a MySQL Query by Most Common Words in a field

I've always wondered about this, and now a client is wondering whether it's feasable: I have a list of sports, broken down like such: Boys Ice Hockey Boys Tennis Girls Ice Hockey Girls Tennis ...etc And they want it to sort like: Boys Ice Hockey Girls Ice Hockey Boys Tennis Girls Tennis ...etc I'm just wondering if this is possible by simply altering the query. Unfortunately, I cannot set the sports to be be gender non-specific and have their gender set as a seperate field. I cannot edit the database in any significant way. I figured the best way to approach the problem is a "most words in common" query, but I have no idea how this would be done. Thanks in advance for any help you guys can offer! UPDATE: The client ended up dropping the request, however, I would have approached it most likely as the accepted answer. Still not a completely satisfying way of doing things, but I'm not sure there is a more "elegant" solution available in MySQL.
