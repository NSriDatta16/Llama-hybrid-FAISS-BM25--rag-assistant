C# AS3 MMO Socket Server/Client

I'm making a micro-mmorpg as a project. I'm making the server using c#, and the client is Flash AS3. How should I organize the client-server messaging system? I want a client to be able to send a message to: all clients in room, the server, a specific client. Should I have some sort of client ID or is that already built in? Should my messages(XML) have a to/from tag? I was thinking of holding a map of movieclips in the game where the key is the clientid and the movieclip is what it points to, so that way the server can say: clientId has disconnected, and then my game can get the avatar by the clientId and remove it from the display list etc. So would this be a good way to do it? Thanks!
