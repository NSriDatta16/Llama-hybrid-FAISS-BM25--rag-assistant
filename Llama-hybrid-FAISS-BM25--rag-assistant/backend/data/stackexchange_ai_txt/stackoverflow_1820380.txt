If you must use browser detection...try using something like jQuery's .support functions. Check WhatIsMyUserAgent or some similar site for what Ubuntu's Firefox builds are actually sending. I believe Firefox is supposed to be in the FF UA string on Ubuntu...but I know for a fact Gecko is in the string, as that's the rendering engine used.
