The Variational Ensemble Learning approach to ICA can do this "automatic relevance detection". It automatically turns off components that are not required to improve the bound on the Bayesian Evidence. Have a look at the thesis of James Miskin available here , which introduces the technique. This is implemented very eligently in Java by John Winn (another PhD that implements Bayesian Ensemble Learning via a message passing Algorithm). To learn the technique, I decided to implement Winn's algorithm in c++ which can be obtained from here (active development).
