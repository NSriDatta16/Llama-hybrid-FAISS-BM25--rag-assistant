machine learning techniques for longitudinal data

I was wondering if there were any machine learning techniques (unsupervised) for modelling longitudinal data? I've always used mixed effects models (mostly non-linear) but I was wondering if there are any other ways of doing this (using machine learning). By machine learning, I mean random forest, classification/clustering, decision trees and even deep learning, etc.
