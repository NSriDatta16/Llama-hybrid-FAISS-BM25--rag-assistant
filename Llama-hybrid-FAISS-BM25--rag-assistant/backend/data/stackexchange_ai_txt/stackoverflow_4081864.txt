Do bots' user agents always have "http" in it?

Is it safe to assume that all bots' user agents always have URLs in the user agent strings? I, of course, compare the user agent against the list of bots, but the idea here to do a preliminary check before check it against a long list. Perhaps if I could reword my question better, is there any valid non-bot, non-crawler, non-spider or any non-filthy creature that has a URL in the user agent?
