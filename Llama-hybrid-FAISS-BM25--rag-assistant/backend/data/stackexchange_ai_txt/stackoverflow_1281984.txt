LinQ to SQL data insert issue

I have two tables Settlement and Violations.SettlementID is primary Key in Settlements table and foreign key in Violations. In my dbml file I dragged and dropped both the tables and the association is set. In my VB.net code when I try to insert records into db it is not giving option to add values Violation collection into Settlements I am trying to read an xml file with Settlements and Violation and insert into SQL. But only Settlement table is getting inserted with records. I am not able to add _v to settlement s as it is not listed. Please help Dim Orders As XDocument = XDocument.Load("c:/inetpub/violations.xml") Dim _Orderss = violations. . For Each _settlement In _settlements Dim s As New Settlement s.CamisID = _settlement. .Value s.DocketID = _settlement. .Value s.RespFName = _settlement. .Value s.RespMName = _settlement. .Value s.RespLName = _settlement. .Value s.DispDate = Date.Parse(_settlement. .Value) Dim _violations = _settlement. . For Each _violation In _violations Dim _v As New Violation _v.DocketID = _settlement. .Value _v.ViolationInfo = _violation. .Value _v.violationCD = _violation. .Value _v.Severity = Integer.Parse(_violation. .Value) _v.Point = Integer.Parse(_violation. .Value) _v.Occurence = Integer.Parse(_violation. .Value) Next _db.Settlements.InsertOnSubmit(s) _db.SubmitChanges() Next
