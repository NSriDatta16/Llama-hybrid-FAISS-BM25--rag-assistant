Note: In Keras , every SimpleRNN has only three different weight matrices, and these weights are shared between all input cells; In other words, for all five cells in your network: \begin{align} h_t = tanh( w_{h} h_{t-1} + w_{x} x_{t} + b_h)\ ; t= 1..5 \end{align} For a deeper understanding of recurrent networks in Keras , you may want to read this eloquent article: Mohit Mayank - A practical guide to RNN and LSTM in Keras .
