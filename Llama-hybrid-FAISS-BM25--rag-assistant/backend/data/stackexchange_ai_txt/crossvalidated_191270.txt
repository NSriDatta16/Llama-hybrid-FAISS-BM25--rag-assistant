Principal component analysis to reduce the number of observations

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) seems great to reduce the number of variables, but is it also good to reduce the number of observations? Here is an example: reflectance measurements were taken from the same plant at a given time. Measurements were taken from different wavelengths. There are missing values in the data because something doesn't look right in 20 reflectance measurements. Missing values were omitted. set.seed(1) my.data The ultimate idea is transforming the reflectance data from thousands of wavelengths into one or few PCs. Then, someone could use it as a response variable: PCA1 ~ treatment . set.seed(1) big.data The idea is having a data frame like: plant date treatment PCA1 1 1 A y1 2 1 B y2 3 1 A y3 4 1 B y4 1 2 A y5 2 2 B y6 3 2 A y7 4 2 B y8 Then, fm Can PCA be used for something like that? Is there any better approach to reduce the number of observations?
