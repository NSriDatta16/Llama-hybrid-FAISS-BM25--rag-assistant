Your question could be addressed in a few different ways. The traditional test of hypothesis is designed to rule out possibilities, not necessarily prove them. In this case we can use $H_0: p=0.5$ as the null hypothesis and see if the data (the 490 out of 900 heads) can be used to reject this null hypothesis by computing a p-value. If the p-value is less than $\alpha$ then we reject the null, but a p-value $>\alpha$ does not mean that we can say the data supports the null, just that it is consistant with the assumption that the null is true, but in truth the null could be false, just the truth is a value of $p$ very close to $0.5$. The "equivalence" approach would be to define unbiased not as $p=0.5$ but rather choose a small region around 0.5 to consider as unbiased $ 0.5-\epsilon Another approach would be to use a Bayesian approach where we start with a prior distribution on the true proportion $p$ including a point mass at 0.5 and the rest of the probabilit spread accross possible values. Then combine that with the data to get a posterior. If the posterioun probabilit of $p=0.5$ is high enough then that would support the claim of being unbiased.
