Typically I have seen that done just by extending the last line forward, although this obviously can be quite dangerous because of the nature of that local fitting and extreme values near the end points. There may be some advanced techniques for it or you could take some notes from time-series literature and 'dampen' the last line or combine it with a global measure for the trend. So you use that last line averaged with the overall slope of a simple regression or something to try and keep your last local measure in line. These are all just off the cuff suggestions but no matter what you do extending it outside of your fitted x-value range is possible but dangerous.
