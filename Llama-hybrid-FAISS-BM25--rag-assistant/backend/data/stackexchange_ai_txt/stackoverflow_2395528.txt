If you have non-SAS files in the destination directory, you can pipe a command such as dir /od /b to a data as illustrated in this question . If all the files are SAS datasets, create a libref to the directory and try proc sql noprint; select memname, crdate into :newestdata, :createdate from dictionary.tables where libname=upcase(" ") having crdate=max(crdate); quit; %put &newestdata; %put &createdate; Unless there are data sets which have the exact same creation time stamp, the &newestdata and &createdate macro variables should contain the name and creation date of the latest data set.
