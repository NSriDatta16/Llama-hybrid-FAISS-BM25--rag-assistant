VB Syntax to declare a single model in MVC (to leverage strongly typed views)

I'm trying to avoid the use of magic strings as much as I can, but I can't find the correct syntax for VB to bind a single model like is shown in this c# example . Can anyone point me in the right direction? (currently the below says "expected end of statement" under the Model text) EDIT: A simple directcast was need (sorry for the dumb question)
