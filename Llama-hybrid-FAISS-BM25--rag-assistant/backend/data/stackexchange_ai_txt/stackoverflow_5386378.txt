Help using JAVA URL in a Google Web Toolkit project

I'm trying to implement java URL into my gwt project. This is what I've done so far in terms of experimenting, trial-error, etc: HTML: John Mathew's Google AJAX Search API Sample google.load('search', '1'); google.setOnLoadCallback(function(){ var searchControl = new google.search.SearchControl(); searchControl.setResultSetSize(google.search.Search.LARGE_RESULTSET); searchControl.addSearcher(new google.search.WebSearch()); var drawOptions = new google.search.DrawOptions(); drawOptions.setDrawMode(google.search.SearchControl.DRAW_MODE_TABBED); searchControl.draw(document.getElementById("content"), drawOptions); }, true); google.load('search', '1', {language : 'en', style : google.loader.themes.SHINY}); google.setOnLoadCallback(function() { var customSearchControl = new google.search.CustomSearchControl('*insert google cse id*'); CustomSearchControl.setResultSetSize(google.search.Search.FILTERED_CSE_RESULTSET); customSearchControl.draw('cse'); }, true); Loading... document.writeln('search engine 2'); Loading... document.writeln('search engine 3'); Now both parts of the javascript generates a google textbox and button. Upon entering information, it will return results. This isn't what I want. I would like to obtain the results for me to manipulate and play around with. So I did a bit of research and discovered PHP get_file_contents() and JAVA URL(). I've never had PHP experience so I went with Java (there is JQuery get() but I am confused on how to implement and couldn't find examples). To understand how Java URL() works, I created a Java project and learned of this code: URL urlsearch = new URL("*insert website*"); BufferedReader buffreader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(urlsearch.openStream())); String HTMLdisplay; while ((HTMLdisplay = buffreader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(HTMLdisplay); } buffreader.close(); It works exactly how I wanted as it retrieves the html page source of a page (example: http://www.bing.com/search?q=gygax ). To implement this, I created a project based on how http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html instructs thus in the HTML code above there is the line . The command that links the two is in the class onModuleLoad(): // Associate the Main panel with the HTML host page. RootPanel.get("customSearch").add(mainPanel); This sounds a bit confusing so I'll summarize a bit: using Google Widgets on my .java I created a textbox and button when I run it as a web application. When you click the button, it is suppose execute the java url code and retrieve the pagesource on what it queries. Instead I get these errors: [DEBUG] [test_project] - Validating newly compiled units [ERROR] [test_project] - Errors in 'file:/C:/*file path*/Test_project.java' [ERROR] [test_project] - Line 92: No source code is available for type java.net.URL; did you forget to inherit a required module?

MY QUESTION: How do I overcome these errors that prevent me from using JAVA URL in my GWT project?
