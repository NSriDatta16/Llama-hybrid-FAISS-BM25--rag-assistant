Welcome to the site. I am not sure what you mean when you write "averaged the rows from each country". You can't average countries. If your data set is a random selection of the world's population (lots of luck a true random sample of that!) then you can say, for each name, what proportion are from each country. You can also say, for each country, what proportion of people have each name. But I don't see any sort of average you could take here.
