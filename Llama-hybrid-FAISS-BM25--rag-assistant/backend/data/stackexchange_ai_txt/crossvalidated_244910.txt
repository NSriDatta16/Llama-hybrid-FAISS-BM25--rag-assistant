TLDR: in this case $\bar{X}$ is always a gamma random variable of a certain form. But when $n$ is large, this particular type of gamma random variable "is close to" a (degenerate) normal random variable. The expectation of a $\text{Gamma}(\alpha n, \theta /n)$ random variable, the way you have it parametrized, is $\frac{\alpha n \theta}{n} = \alpha \theta$. The variance will be $\alpha n \theta^2n^{-2}$. This is the distribution of $\bar{X}$ for any integer $n$, small or large. So, to answer your question, $E[\bar{X}] = \alpha \theta$ even for small $n$. You don't need a large sample to get results about the mean and distribution. But if you do have a large sample, it's approximately normal. That's because the MGF looks different now after you take the limit. It's the MGF of a normal (see here ) with mean $\alpha \theta$ and variance $0$. Or in other words, $P(\bar{X} \in A) \to \delta_{\alpha\theta}(A)$. This agrees with intuition because, in the case of the normal, the parameters represent the mean and variance, and you get these numbers when you take the limit of the gamma rv's mean and variance in the above paragraph.
