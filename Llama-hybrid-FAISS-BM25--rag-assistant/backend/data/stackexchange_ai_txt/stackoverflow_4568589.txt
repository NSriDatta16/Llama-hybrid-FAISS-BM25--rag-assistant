sql insert statement with a lot of same where clause and one different where cluase

I m sry if the title is not clear. Here's my proble. I created a new table which will show total, average and maximum values. I have to insert the results into that table. That table will have only 4 rows. No Appointment, Appointment Early, Appointment Late and Appointment Punctual. So.. I have sth like.. insert into newTable select 'No Appointment' as 'Col1', avg statement, total statement, max statement from orgTable where (general conditions) and (unique condition to check NO APPOINTMENT); I have to do that same thing for another 3 rows.. where only the unique condition is different to check early, punctual or late.. So..the statement is super long. I wanna reduce the size.. How can I achieve that?
