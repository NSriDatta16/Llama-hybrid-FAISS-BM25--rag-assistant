Sentiment analysis with continuous scale for responses

I am trying to create a sentiment analysis system using deep learning (with R). I have a review base of customer reviews which for each review the customer make a mark (from 0 to 10). How can I do this, using marks in the range 0..10? Is it possible? In some tutorials, I see that authors use 0, 1 or -1 (0 for neutral, 1, positive and -1 for negative), and I'm not sure how to adjust to marks in the range 0..10.
