I can see myself trying to work in such environment since I always develop using my IDE, some papers on my desk and some different notepad/vim opened files with different snippets and thoughts of different sections of code/software. I'm not saying the interface has to be exaclty like Code Bubbles, but something that gets the idea. ...but I need to really test it, and feel it. I think a mix of Bubbles and a traditional IDE in some way is the way to go. Fact is: it's really interesting to see people inventing things trying to improve our development way of working (like Zen Coding in web development, just to give an example), and, even if this approach fails, some ideas can be borrowed to other projects. Seriously, what I'm expecting to happen in the future is the day I'm going to use a keyboard and a responsive multitouch interface, dragging items and sections of code across an ide, designing and programming at the same time using my hands for drawing in a screen and my keyboard: something like an iPad for programming. (There are some really good comments about this Code Bubbles video on youtube, it's a good idea to check it out).
