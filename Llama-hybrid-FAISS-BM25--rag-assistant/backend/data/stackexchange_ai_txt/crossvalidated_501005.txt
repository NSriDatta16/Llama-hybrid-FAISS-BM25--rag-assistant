you can create an arbitrary covariance matrix from the Wishart distribution using the stats function rWishart (included in base R) and then transform it to a correlation matrix p The Wishart distribution takes two parameters: the degrees of freedom $\nu$ and the scale matrix $\Sigma$ . To understand how these influence the result, condier $X_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N_p(0,\Sigma)$ ,then $$ S = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\nu X_iX_i' \sim W_p(\nu,\Sigma) $$ That is, S follows a Wishart distribution on $p\times p$ matrices with $\nu$ degrees of freedom and $\Sigma$ as scale matrix. As seen, if $\nu$ is larger than $p$ , then $S$ will be positive definite a.s.(P). Furthermore, $$ E(S) = \nu \Sigma $$ which means that on average, the random draws S will approach a value proportional to the true population parameters $\Sigma$ in probability. This rate of convergence depends on the value of $\nu$ , so if $p$ is very large, try to keep $\nu$ close to $p$ , otherwise the random draws would be close to each other.
