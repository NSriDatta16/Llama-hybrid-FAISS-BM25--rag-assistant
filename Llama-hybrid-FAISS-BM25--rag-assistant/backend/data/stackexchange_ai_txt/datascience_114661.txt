Sklearn vs Pytorch vs Tensorflow vs Keras

I just need to understand the differences between sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow and keras in terms which implements traditional machine learning algorithms ( Linear regression , knn, decision trees, SVM and so on) and which implements deep learning algorithms. Moreover, which is considered the more efficient for implementing traditional machine learning algorithms and for implementing deep learning algorithms ?
