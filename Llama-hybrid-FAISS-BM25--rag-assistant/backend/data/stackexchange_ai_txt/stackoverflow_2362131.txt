From the Ruby code perspective, the map is pretty elegant and straightforward. From the algorithmic point of view (to address the computer-science tag), it seems a solution to this problem cannot be better than going through the whole array once (i.e. a map here), so it will take as much time as to process each hash in the array. @Vlad: Compacting the returned array depends on what will be done with the array, right? :-)
