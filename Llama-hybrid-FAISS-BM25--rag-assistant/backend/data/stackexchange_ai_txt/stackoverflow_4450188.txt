NSURLDownload class is available on MacOS only, on iOS you should use NSURLConnection. From docs : iOS Note : The NSURLDownload class is not available in iOS, because downloading directly to the file system is discouraged. Use the NSURLConnection class instead If you have large chunk of data to download and want to avoid memory issues you can use NSFileHandle class in connection delegate to write received data directly to disk instead of keeping it in memory.
