Creating an Drop Pin MKPinAnnotation supporting dragging like the Drop Pin in Maps App

I wonder if it's possible to create an MKPinAnnotation in a Custom MKMapView, which answers to touch and drag just like the "Drop Pin" annotation in the Maps App. I would like a way to drop a pin at a location given by the GPS. Then let the user fine tune the exact location by touching the Pin and dragging it right, if the GPS is a bit too inaccurate. Any help is appreciated, or information if this is impossible with allowed SDKs.
