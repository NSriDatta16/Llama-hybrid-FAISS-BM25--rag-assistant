Seasonal Time Series Forecasting and MASE

I am creating a a number of forecasts for sales at various levels of data aggregation, based on the properties of the products (eg. is it in a bottle or a can). I plan to create multiple models and then review the outputs before selecting a forecast - I would like to use MASE as a comparison metric. I have monthly data that is seasonal (M = 12). Initially, I will be calculating HW Additive, Multiplicative, Damped and a Naive forecast models. I have 3-5 years of data available depending on the series, and would like to forecast 12-24 months into the future. If I decide that my test data will be the final 12 months of data, when calculating the MASE should my denominator consider all naive forecasts up until the final period N? Or only until N-M? Does the numerator use all the error values up until N (ie. all training and test data...?) There is a desire to have the model reflect the most recent trends - What will the impact be to MASE if I 'overfit' my model by using all of the data up to M as my training set? What is the best method to check the fit of the model against the last 12 months. For reference I am not using R or Python for this so I really need to understand from first principles how to write the model.... Apologies if these are silly questions, I am relatively new to forecasting - but am loving it! :)
