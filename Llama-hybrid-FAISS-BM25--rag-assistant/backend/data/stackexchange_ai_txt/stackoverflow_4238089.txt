Is there a better way to express this fluent registration in Windsor?

Basically I would like a way to express: Find all classes with base class AbstractDataService<> and resolve them by their interface and not by their base class. I currently have this and it works but it isn't very elegant: container.Register(AllTypes.Pick() .FromAssembly(typeof(AbstractDataService<>).Assembly) .If(Component.IsInSameNamespaceAs(typeof(AbstractDataService<>))) .WithService.FirstInterface()); Is it possible?
