Analyze a time series to predict a value

I have about 50 observations where every observation is composed of a time series of an index and a value Y. Is it possible to use the time series to predict the value Y? What do I need to study to work on that data? Adding information about my data: I'm studying in the agriculture sector. My time series are composed of NDVI values taken every 5 days (the NDVI is an index that measures the vigor of a plant). At the end of the season, every plant produces Y kg of fruit which is the yield. My objective is trying to forecast the yield based on the time series of NDVI. I have tried to do a regression with the sum of NDVI (for example the sum of 4 acquisitions), single acquisition in some key moments, the sum of all the period analyzed... against the yield. I have done these tests because I have only basic statistical skills but I would like to deepen further in this subject. If needed, I can work with R and Python.
