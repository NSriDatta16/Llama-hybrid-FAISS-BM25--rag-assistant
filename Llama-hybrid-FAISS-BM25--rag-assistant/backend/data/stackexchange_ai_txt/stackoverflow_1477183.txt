You should ask this in the suds's mailing list. This library is under development, is open source, and the authors are very keen to get feedback from the users. Your code looks fine, this could be an error of the wsdl itself or of the suds library, therefore I encourage you to ask the author directly (after having checked with other wsdls that your installation is correct).
