Hide All But First Matching Element

I am using jquery to sort through multiple paragraphs. Currently I have it set to show only paragraphs that start with a current letter. But now, I would like to consolidate further. If the text between the paragraph tags has multiple instances, I would like all but the first hidden. This is what I have so far but, it is not working. var letter = ' ' function finish(){ jQuery('p').each(function(){ if(jQuery(this).text().substr(0,1).toUpperCase() == letter){ jQuery(this).addClass('current-series'); jQuery(this).html(letter + ' '+jQuery(this).text().slice(1)+ ' '); } else{ jQuery(this).hide();} }) } Update: Sorry guys, I know this is kind of hard to explain. Here's a basic example: The selected letter is B The values returned are: Ball Ball Ball Boy Brain Bat Bat Each of these values is in a paragraph tag. Is there a way to consolidate to this? Ball Boy Brain Bat
