R examples for Durbin & Koopman "Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods"

I was wondering if anyone has ported the examples from Durbin & Koopman "Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods" to R? You can find RATS code for the examples online and obviosly SsfPack/Ox but no signs of an R companion for this book...
