OK. Can you try the following - remove the AssemblyResolve event. We will now use web.config runtime configuration to resolve this assemblies. In the configuration add the following: I can't explain to myself why the two approaches - AppDomain.AssemblyResolve and this runtime AssemblyBinding give different results when dealing with PageBuildProvider . I was looking around the PageBuildProvider class to find any clues about what is happening, but still no luck. I'll probably look further into this as it got my attention and will post here if I find any solution. Let me know if this solution with web.config file works for you. The only caveat is that you can't use resources to store your assemblies. You need to store them on the file system, any folder that is under the project one - as is currently with ReferencedAssemblies folder.
