Are you sure row locking is turned off? In my case, turning off row locking reduced bloat by over a 100 megs when working on a 5 meg file. (in other words the file barley grew after turning off row locking to about 6 megs). With row locking on, the same operation results in a file well over 100 megs in size. Row locking is a HUGE source of bloat during recordset operations since it pads each record to a page size. Do you have ms-access installed here, or are you just using JET (JET is the data engine that ms-access uses. You can use JET without access). Open the database in ms-access and go: Tools->options On the advanced tab, un-check the box: [ ] Open databases using record level locking. This will not only make a HUGE difference in the file growth (bloat), it will also speed things up by a factor of 10 times. There also a registry setting that you can use here. And, Are you using odbc, or an oleDB connection? You can try: Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset With rs .ActiveConnection = RsCnn .Properties("Jet OLEDB:Locking Granularity") = 1 Try the setting from accesss (change the setting), exit, re-enter and then compact and repair. Then run your test importâ€¦the bloat issue should go away. There is likely no need to open the database using row locking. If you turn off that feature, then you should be able to reduce the bloat in file size down to a minimum. For furher reading and an example see here: Does ACEDAO support row level locking?
