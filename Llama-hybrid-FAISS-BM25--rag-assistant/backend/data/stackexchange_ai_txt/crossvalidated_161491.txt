How to evaluate the final model after k-fold cross-validation

As this question and its answer pointed out, k-fold cross validation (CV) is used for model selection, e.g. choosing between linear regression and neural network. It's also suggested that after deciding on which kind of model to use, the final predictor should be trained with the entire data set. Here my question is: how can we evaluate the final predictor? Is it sufficient to just use the average of the k accuracies obtained during k-fold CV?
