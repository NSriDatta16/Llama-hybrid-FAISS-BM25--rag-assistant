You might try the for loop as others have suggested. It'll need profiling, but you could also try eliminating method invocations and branching: Y = _average[sample]; minY = minY + ((Y-minY) & (Y-minY)>>31); maxY = maxX - ((X-maxX) & (X-maxX)>>31); sample++; Make these changes only if the performance gain is really critical for you, since the maintainability of the code degrades with similar constructs.
