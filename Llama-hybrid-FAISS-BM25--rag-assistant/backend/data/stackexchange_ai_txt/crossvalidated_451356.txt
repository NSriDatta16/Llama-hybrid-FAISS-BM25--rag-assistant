In what situations is a one sample T-Test superior to a two sample T-Test?

I'm trying to make a case for more use and respect of one-sample t-test in medical studies (which are generally looked down upon, wrongfully so imo). I see that in general medical studies prefer at least two samples, an intervention and a control. I personally see that this can in some cases be inferior to a one sample T-Test, but I want to know if I am right by asking the experts here, and to see if there are other cases than the following where one-sample tests can be superior. In one case that I can think of where a one-sample t-test analysis is superior (and again, I'm seeking for validation, as well as other ideas), it is when the control of a two-sample test is a small enough population (compared to the intervention group) that it can adversely affect the confidence of the result. Also, and this is a function of experimental design so it should be avoided, if the conditions for the control vs intervention are too different (time, location, operator, etc) it can introduce more and more disparate unanticipated variables than simply comparing a one-sample with a standard condition. Again, this should be avoidable by proper DOE but it does suggest that two-sample can become more troublesome if not done right. By the same token such a research may invest more confidence in the bogus result than they would if it were just a one-sample test. It also seems like the advantages of a two-sample T-test tend to go away as the population for a one-sample T-test goes up (especially as it gets very large), and as the averages for all other variables for that population (eg. weather, opinions, dispositions, diets, age distribution, etc) approach that of the average or standard values. Am I making sense here, or just in my head ... I'm sorry I'm not doing a very good job of explaining my thoughts. This can be done by simply increasing the population, or through validation studies elsewhere by other parties where problematic variables (times, place, operator, equipment, coincidental conditions, etc) have enough natural variation to cover most situations.
