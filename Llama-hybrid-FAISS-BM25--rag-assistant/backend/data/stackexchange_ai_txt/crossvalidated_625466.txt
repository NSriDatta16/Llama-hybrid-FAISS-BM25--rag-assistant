Both linear and logistic regression are convex optimisation problems and have same behaviour. If the 2nd derivative of the objective at the minimum is positive definite, then the minimum is unique, otherwise you have multiple solutions. L2 regularisation ensures uniqueness The only difference is that logistic regression may have a solution at infinity - the so called perfect separation case.
