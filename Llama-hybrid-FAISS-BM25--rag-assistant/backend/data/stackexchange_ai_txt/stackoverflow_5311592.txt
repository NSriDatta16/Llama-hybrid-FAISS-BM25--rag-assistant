You are probably going to have to go down the custom route for your "Game" code - rather than using a CMS, although depending on your experience, you may be able to leverage a framework (e.g CodeIgniter) to speed up some of your DEV time. This type of site would be pretty language agnostic, however it would depend on the actual numbers of users you are looking at as to the most scalable solution / set of techniques to deploy. One of the biggest considerations you are going to have to look at would be the design of the data model, and the platform that this sits on. If you want to be processing near to realtime updates, you are going to want to focus your efforts on making the DB queries / processing the most efficient possible.
