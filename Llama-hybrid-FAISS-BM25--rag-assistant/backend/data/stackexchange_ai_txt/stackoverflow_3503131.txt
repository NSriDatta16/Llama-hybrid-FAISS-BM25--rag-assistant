The installed DLLs are always searched first, even if you add the DLL by browsing. The path in the properties window (for your added reference) would have shown the "installed" version instead immediately after adding the reference to your copy. A build machine would not have the toolkit installed. You could uninstall the toolkit and organise the DLLs yourself if you really need that sort of behaviour.
