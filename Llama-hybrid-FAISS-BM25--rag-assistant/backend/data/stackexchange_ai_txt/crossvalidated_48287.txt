How would you preprocess data for SVD?

I am computing SVD on a matrix which is the empirical version of $E[XY^{\top}]$ for some $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}$ and $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$. I am wondering if there are standard ways to preprocess $x_1,\ldots,x_l$ and $y_1,\ldots,y_l$ before doing that (other than subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation). This is related to the question here: "Normalizing" variables for SVD / PCA .
