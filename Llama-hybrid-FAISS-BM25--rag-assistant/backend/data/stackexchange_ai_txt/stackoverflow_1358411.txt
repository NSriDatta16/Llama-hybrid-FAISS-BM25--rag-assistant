get average Datetime from DB and subtract one Date from another

How to get an average time from an Datetime field via the Entity Framework ? How to subtract one Date from another ? I am thinking of something like: ObjectQuery visits = myentitys.Visits; var uQuery = from visit in visits group visit by visit.ArrivalTime.Value.Day into g select new { Day = g.Key, Hours = g.Average(visit => (visit.LeaveTime.Value - visit.ArrivalTime.Value).TotalMinutes) }; to get the average residence time of an visitor grouped by Day.
