Should I use Observer or Events when just one object needs notification?

Now that I learned to use Observers two questions came to my attention: 1 - Is it common to use Observer Pattern to notify just one object about changes? 2 - When just one object need to be updated it's better to use an observer or an event? Or there are cases when just one notification is needed that Observers are more recommended?
