Probability of a finite union of non-disjoint events derivation

Using only the axioms of probability, derive the following result using induction: \begin{align} \Pr\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) = &\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i) - \sum_{i I have began the proof by showing that it holds for $n = 2$ , and have assumed it holds for $n \le k$ for some arbitrary $k$ . Now it just comes to showing that it holds for $k + 1$ : \begin{align} \Pr\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i\right) &= \Pr\left(A_{k+1} \cup \bigcup_{i=1}^kA_i\right) \\ &= \Pr(A_{k+1}) + \Pr\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i\right) - \Pr\left(A_{k+1} \cap \bigcup_{i=1}^kA_i\right) \end{align} where the last term can be written as: $$ \Pr\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^k(A_i \cap A_{k+1})\right) $$ This is where I am stuck and cannot simplify the expression to get the desired result. I am positive I am on the right track with the "proof", but do not know what result or axiom to use to continue Any hints to how I can continue will be appreciated.
