It sounds like 'novelty detection' is what you might be looking for. There is a scikit library for this. It generates a one-class model and predicts whether new observations fit into the one class or not. For further reading, I would like to refer to this link: Novelty detection scikit-learn There you can also find an example using a SVM classifier.
