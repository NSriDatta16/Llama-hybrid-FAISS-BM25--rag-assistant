The most generic approach would be to wrap up the offending includes and store and restore the macros previous definition. This, however, is compiler-dependent. This is how you could do it with VC: #pragma push_macro("NULL") #include #pragma pop_macro("NULL") Alternatively, set the macro to what you need it to be afterwards: #include #undef NULL #define NULL 0
