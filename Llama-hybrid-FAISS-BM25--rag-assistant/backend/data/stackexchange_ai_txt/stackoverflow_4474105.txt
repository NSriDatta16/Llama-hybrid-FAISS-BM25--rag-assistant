How do I implement Data Retrieval from a website in objective-c?

I want to write a program in Objective-c that grabs some sports stats off a website and stores them in such a way that I can run some statistical analysis on them. I have a little experience with objective-c but have been working with java more recently and have forgotten a lot of the basic organization of the objective-c language. I was wondering if someone could recommend: the best way to store data for this purpose? the best way to go about getting data from the website and what classes I will need to override/implement to do this? more specifically: I want to download the website's contents, and sieve through the HTML code, but am not sure how to go about this. I just sort of need a starting point because I am a little overwhelmed right now. Thanks in advance to this helpful and thoughtful community, which I look forward to being a part of.
