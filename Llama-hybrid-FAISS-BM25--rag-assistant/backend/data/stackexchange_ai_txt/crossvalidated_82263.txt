Where to go for introduction to introduction to Machine Learning?

I'm watching a Machine Learning course offered by Alex Smola at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJbGrQ93CA 14 minutes in and im confused. At that part he starts to explain Linear Regression. I've watched other introduction to Machine Learning courses and also feel lost. I have difficulty understanding the equations even when their explained. I feel I've missed something. I understand there is no silver bullet and im not looking for one but for someone who is starting in this area and feels that the introduction is too difficult are there recommend resources I should be reading/watching to get up to speed in this area ? I find other algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering much easier to understand but maybe im not understanding at good enough level if im finding this course so difficult.
