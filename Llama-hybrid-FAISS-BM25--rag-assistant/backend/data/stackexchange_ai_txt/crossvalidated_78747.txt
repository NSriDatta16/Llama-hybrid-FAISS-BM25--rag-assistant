Neural network for prediction

I am working on neural networks for a regression problem in R using packages like nnet , caret etc. I have split my data into train, validation and test. My doubt is does the train() function in caret package for R takes care for validation set also. From what I understand, After training the nnet model, you need to keep checking with validation data set, to avoid overfitting or overlearning i.e restricting the number of iterations. Then we have to tune for the decay parameters and size of hidden layers and finally apply it on the test data set. Is there anything wrong with the understanding? FYI. Here is the code that I am implementing Y=read.csv(file="./dolcan.csv",header=T) ratio=as.integer(0.5*nrow(Y)) ratio1=as.integer(0.75*nrow(Y)) traindata=Y[(1:ratio),c(2:ncol(Y))] valdata=Y[(ratio:ratio1),c(2:ncol(Y))] testdata=Y[((ratio1+1):nrow(Y)),c(2:ncol(Y))] ## Train the network and tuning the number of nodes and decay maxout= max(traindata[,1]) # to scale the output mygrid
