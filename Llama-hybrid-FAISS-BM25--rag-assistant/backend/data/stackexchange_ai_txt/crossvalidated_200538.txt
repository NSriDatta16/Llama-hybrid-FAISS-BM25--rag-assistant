From your comment, you tell the PCA+Ranker your two classes. It then picks variables that will most reliably split your samples into those two classes. You then run clustering with those variables and it breaks those samples into two classes. What you've essentially done is turned this into a supervised problem, then tested on your training data. In this case, you're essentially looking at in-sample accuracy, which can easily be 100%.
