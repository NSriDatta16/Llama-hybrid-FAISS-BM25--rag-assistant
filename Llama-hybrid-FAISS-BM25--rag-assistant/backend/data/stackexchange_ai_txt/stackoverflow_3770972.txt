Getting maven and git to work

I have recently began delving into git and maven. I have a system that has several module sets and this is stored in various git repositories, I need this to be pulled down into the same workspace and run various maven goals. I was wondering if anyone else has run through this setup and provide tired and true way of doing this. I would apprecaite tutorial and solution you have come up with on your bouts with maven and git. Please and thank you. GC.
