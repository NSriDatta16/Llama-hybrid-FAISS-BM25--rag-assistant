Current user agents send back the values in the order of the fields as presented to the user. This means that you could (theoretically) drop the prefix/suffix altogether and sort it out based on the ordering of the values. You'd get something like /?name=Tom&gender=M&name=Jane&gender=F&name=Roger&gender=M I don't know how your framework returns that, but many return it as lists of each value name = [Tom, Jane, Roger] gender = [M, F, M] If you pop an element off of each list, you should get a related set that you can work with. The downside to this is that it relies on a standard behavior which is not actually required by the specification. Still... it's a convenient solution with a behavior that won't be problematic in practice.
