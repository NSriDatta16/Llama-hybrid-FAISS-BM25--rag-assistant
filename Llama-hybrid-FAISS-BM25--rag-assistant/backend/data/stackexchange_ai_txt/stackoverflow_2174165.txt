C# syntax: Placing the interface's name in the implementation's declaration

I came across some interesting C# syntax that I'm not familiar with in the source code for the Composite Application Library for WPF 's DelegateCommand class. There are some method declarations which are prefixed with the ICommand interface name, and they do not have accessibility modifiers specified. For example: bool ICommand.CanExecute(object parameter) { ... } What is this syntax called and where can I read more about it? I assume there's an implicit public , but I can't figure out what the benefit of specifying the class name is. My guess is that it might just be there for organization.
