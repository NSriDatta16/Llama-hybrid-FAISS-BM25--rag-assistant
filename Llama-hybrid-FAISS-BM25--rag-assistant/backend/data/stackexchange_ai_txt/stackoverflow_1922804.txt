After going over your comments and your code again, with some effort I was able to understand and reproduce the problem you are talking about. What you're missing is the line: e.Handled = true; In your Window1_DragOver event. Add that and it will work the same for both DragDropEffects.Move and DragDropEffects.Copy . Why it worked for DragDropEffects.Copy without setting e.Handled in the first place is anyone's guess. Undocumented conditions lead to undocumented behaviour. I'm going to very strongly recommend that next time you post a code sample containing the minimum possible code to reproduce the problem. I apologize for the original confusion, but nevertheless it was very hard to figure out what was going on in this one.
