You should use Assert to validate programmatic assumptions; that is, for the situation where you're the only one calling that method it should be an impossible state to get into The Assert statements will allow you to double check that the impossible state is never reached. Use this where you would otherwise feel comfortable without validation. For situations where the function is given bad arguments, but you can see that it's not impossible for it to receive those values (e.g. when someone else could call that code), you should throw exceptions (a la @Nathan W and @Robert Paulson ) or fail gracefully (a la @Srdjan Pejic ).
