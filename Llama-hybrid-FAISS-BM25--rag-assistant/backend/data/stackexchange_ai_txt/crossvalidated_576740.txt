How can we find a unique (suboptimal) solution to an optimisation problem with a very large search space?

A standard linear and unconstrained optimization problem has the following form: $\max_{x} f(x)$ , For example $f(x) = cos(x)+sin(2x)$ , with $-1 \leq x \leq 8$ . The gradient $=0$ will allow finding all the minima and maxima. But the gradient will not find the unique (and suboptimal) one, the one nearest to $x=4$ . A search method can look for the unique one, but for large search spaces (i.e. neural networks) this is impossible. Second question: How do you formulate uniqueness mathematically, in an optimization problem, e.g. as a constraint?
