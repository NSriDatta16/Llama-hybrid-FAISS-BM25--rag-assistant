A few questions you have to ask yourself: Do you do any kind of user agent redirection to mobile sites? Are you using any content management system? Have you entered anything in Robots.txt? Do you use meta tag's (robots)? Check out the IIS Search Engine Optimization Toolkit . You can use it to perform easily a full analysis of your website. Installation is very easy using the Web Platform Installer . If you have still problems, you can ask your question too on the Google Webmaster forums
