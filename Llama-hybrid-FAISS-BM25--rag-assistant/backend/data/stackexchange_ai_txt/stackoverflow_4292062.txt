Problem with cookies in httpClient in Zend Framework

I create the httpClient in Zend framework to make page requests. I am trying to add a cookie but it does not seem to work according to the data which I get. Can you please tell me what am I doing wrong? $httpClient = new HttpClient(); $httpClient->setConfig (array( 'timeout' => 30, 'useragent' => "Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; ru)Version/10.62", 'adapter' => 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Curl', 'curloptions' => array ( CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT => true, ), )); $httpClient->setCookieJar(); $cookie = Zend_Http_Cookie::fromString('abc=1000; ' + 'domain=.abc.ru; ' + 'path=/; ' + 'expires=Wednesday, 28-Feb-12 20:41:22 UTC'); $httpClient->setCookie($cookie);
