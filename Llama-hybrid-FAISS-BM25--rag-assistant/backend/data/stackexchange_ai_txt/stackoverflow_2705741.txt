frameworks for coding a php library?

there are plenty of frameworks for coding MVC web applications. this time im going to code a library (think of Doctrine or Solr) with a bunch of class files. u just include a bootstrap or a class file and you are ready to use my classes. i have never tried to code a library before and intend to code one for learning purpose so that i can use various design patterns i have learned. are there any great frameworks for this, how i should organize the different class files, where i can put configuration files and so on? tutorials or other information would be great too. thanks UPDATE: its just in general, not something specific. im wondering if there is a "pattern" just like for web applications (MVC): should it be one file he includes and that file will include all other class files? should it be a class file he includes or a so called bootstrap file? in short, i need to know how to code a library so every developer could use it the open source way
