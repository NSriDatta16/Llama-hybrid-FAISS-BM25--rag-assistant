Use regression as coefficient in another regression

I am interested in conducting a time series regression, such that: $RV_{t+1} = \alpha + (\beta_0 + \beta_1 RET + \beta_2 RV_t)RV_t + \beta_3 RW + \beta_4 RM$ . Is such a regression possible in Python or R? I have seen it in a few papers, and it is apparently estimated through simple OLS, so I feel like I am missing something. Two papers where this is seen: Conditional Volatility Persistence - Wang and Yang (2018); Exploiting the errors: A simple approach for improved volatility forecasting - Bollerslev, Patton and Quaedvlieg (2015).
