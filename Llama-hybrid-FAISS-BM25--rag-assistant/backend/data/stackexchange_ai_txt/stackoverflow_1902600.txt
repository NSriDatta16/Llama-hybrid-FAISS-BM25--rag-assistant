Apple has an introduction at Safari Reference - Using Canvas and more details in the DOM Reference . In general, the iphone canvas support is excellent and very useful. EXCEPT for the missing text rendering, which I have heard will be available in a future OS upgrade. While waiting, you can use Jim Studt's Canvas Text Function to display simple text on the Canvas. For an example of how it looks, check out the Night Sky iPhone webapp which draws lines, text and images on the Canvas as well as saving and loading it from localStorage.
