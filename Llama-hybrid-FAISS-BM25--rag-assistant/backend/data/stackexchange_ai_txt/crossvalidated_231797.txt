Sample size determination for a 4000 population

I'm trying to determine the sample size to use in a 4000 elements population experiment. To do that, I conduced an experiment in a similar population (50 elements) to compute its standard deviation. The methodology is described below: For each element, I have two different solutions (solutions A and B); I'm evaluating a particular aspect of this solutions (in this case is the total area of an integrated circuit); I find the percentage of optimization in this parameter. For example, for the 1st experiment I have found this two values: 20um² (solution A) and 15um² (solution B). So solution B is 25% smaller then A. Following this methodology, I produced a Table of optimizations. Something like this: X | Opt (%) ------------- 1 | 25 2 | -10 3 | -5 ... | ... 50 | 10 So I take the mean and the standard deviation of this results and found an optimization of 5% (average) with 22% of standard deviation. Now I have the formula below to determine the sample size of a 4000 population for a new experiment: $$ n = Z^2\sigma^2 N/[(N-1)e^2+Z^2 \sigma^2] $$ Where $n$ is the sample size, $Z$ is related to the confidence, $N$ is the size of the population (4000) and $e$ is the error. My question is: is that ok to use σ = 22% of my previous experiment? Notice that is a similar population. Computing n considering Z = 1.645 (confidence of 90%), e = 5% = 0.05, σ = 22% = 0.22 and N = 4000, I found n = 51,76 . Rounding up, my sample size is 52 for a 4000 population. Is that ok? Any thoughts?
