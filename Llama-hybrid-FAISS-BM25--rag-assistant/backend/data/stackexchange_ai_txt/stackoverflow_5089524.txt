crash after jointDef.Initialize in box2d cocos2d

I have a ship and a dock and would like to have a joint connecting them when I press on the dock - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *myTouch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [myTouch locationInView:[myTouch view]]; location = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:location]; b2Vec2 locationWorld = b2Vec2(location.x/PTM_RATIO, location.y/PTM_RATIO); if (_dockFixture->TestPoint(locationWorld)) { b2DistanceJointDef _myJDef; _myJDef.Initialize(_shipBody, _dockBody, _shipBody->GetWorldCenter(),_dockBody->GetWorldCenter()); (b2DistanceJoint*) _world->CreateJoint(&_myJDef); } } As soon as I click on the dock, cocos2d and the IPhone Simualtor crash without a log in the concole.... I'm a newbie, what might be wrong? Should I also post the code of the two bodies?
