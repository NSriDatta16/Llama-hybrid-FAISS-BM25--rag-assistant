How do I compare the co-efficients of two binary logistic regression models?

I have data on Liver Disease Patients, with the response variable being whether the patient has liver disease or not(1 or 0) and 7 predictor variables, such as age, gender, protein levels etc. Now, the purpose of my study is to first conduct binary logistic regression on the entire data and check for the significant traits. Next, I need to split the entire data with respect to age(the two groups being 40) and fit binary logistic regression on both groups. Next, I need to check if the co-efficients from the regression equations of these two groups are same or not. How do I do this? I'm allowed to use the softwares R and Minitab for this purpose, by my curriculum. I'd be glad if anyone could suggest some ideas.
