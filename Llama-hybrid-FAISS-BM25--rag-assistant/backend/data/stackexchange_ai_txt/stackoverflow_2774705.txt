Configurable products do not use any of the information from simple products apart from the attribute values on which the configurable product is pivoted. That means that Descriptions, Prices, Images and other data can be changed in the simple products, and the configurable products will not be changed whatsoever. Unfortunately, hacking the price of a product in the Magento cart is difficult, as it is refreshed from the record every time the page is loaded, so what you're trying to accomplish isn't going to happen any time soon. Your best bet might be to write a short script that will grab the simple product prices and update the configurable product record periodically. This would not need to hack through the Magento logic to work. Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
