Is there a way to define XAML elements as non-printable?

I have chunks of XAML displayed on my screen that I make printable with a print button inside that chunk, something like this: But when this chunk prints out, I don't want the print button to be printed, so I hide it before I print and make it visible again after I print, like this: private void Button_Click_Print(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { PrintButton.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; PrintDialog dialog = new PrintDialog(); if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true) { dialog.PrintVisual(PrintableArea, "Print job"); } PrintButton.Visibility = Visibility.Visible; } This works, but when the print dialog appears, you see behind the print dialog that the print button disappears and then reappears again, which is just a little unconventional UI behavior that I would like to avoid. Is there a way to keep elements visible on the screen yet hide them from printing? e.g. something like this (pseudo-code): Pragmatic answer: Ok, I solved this particular issue simply by changing the visibility only if they actually print, but it would still be nice to know in principle if there is a way to set "printable visibility" in XAML so this issue doesn't always have to be taken care of in code like this: private void Button_Click_Print(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { PrintDialog dialog = new PrintDialog(); if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true) { PrintButton.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; dialog.PrintVisual(PrintableArea, "Print job"); PrintButton.Visibility = Visibility.Visible; } }
