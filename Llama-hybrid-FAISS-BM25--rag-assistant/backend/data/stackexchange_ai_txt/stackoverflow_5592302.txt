test a recordset for values to exclude

Hmmm...crappy question, but I didn't know how to phrase this: I have a sweet jquery drag and drop page where someone can drop category names from a list of all categories onto an item. This is then saved in a db lookup table with itemID and categoryID. So far so good. When it comes to editing the item I can populate the list of categories already applied easily. Now I want to populate the list of categories leaving out those that are already applied to the item. This is where I am stuck. e.g. if the list of 26 categories matches each letter of the alphabet (to make this easy) and the item already has categories B D and E applied, how can I then just display categories A, C, F, H, I etc leaving out the applied ones. I don't want to have to lpop through the applied category array for each category item in the list - seems like a waste of resources. Is there some way to use and array_search type function? I hope this makes sense without being over complicated.
