What happens when y_true is all 0 in dice loss?

A deep learning model is being trained using the above loss function, Dice coefficient. In training, "1 - $L_{dice}$ " is applied as a loss function. The model takes several images as input including samples which have all 0 target values and samples which have some target values(e.g. 1). The question is, Will the loss function work well even when true values are all 0?
