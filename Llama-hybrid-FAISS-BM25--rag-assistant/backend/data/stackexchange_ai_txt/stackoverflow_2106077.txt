How to alter the rendering of links in ASP.NET MVC?

Our designers have come up with button styles for an application which require the addition of tags inside the tags of our links. In ASP.NET we implemented this by adding an App_Browsers entry for Link Buttons. How would I go about doing this in ASP.NET MVC? I've contemplated creating my own versions of all of the various HTML helper functions for creating ActionLinks and RouteLinks but this seems to be quite a 'brute force' way of doing things. Is there a nice elegant way of doing it? I know we could write some simple jQuery to do it, but we'd rather have the markup coming out of the server correctly in the first place.
