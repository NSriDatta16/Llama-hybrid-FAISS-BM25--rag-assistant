Yes, this is possible. You'll need to leverage mx.managers.CursorManager . There's no way to replace the cursor graphic, but you achieve this by adding a new cursor to the manager with a high priority: CursorManager.setCursor(myCursor, CursorManagerPriority.HIGH); In the above example, myCursor can be a JPEG, GIF, PNG, or SVG image, a Sprite object, or a SWF file. Additionally, setCursor accepts two additional parameters, xOffset:Number = 0, yOffset:Number = 0 , which you can use to, well, offset the image from the actual pointer position, if you need to. Re: Your comment: I believe you're correct. There's no way I know of to override a components hover cursor other than some event foo. Keep in mind that it is the most recently added cursor with the highest priority (to the `CursorMangager, of course) that gets displayed.
