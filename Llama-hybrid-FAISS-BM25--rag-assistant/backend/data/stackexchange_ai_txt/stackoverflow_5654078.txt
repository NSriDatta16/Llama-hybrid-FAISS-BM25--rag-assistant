SQL Server 2008: complex Insert

I have a table called Employees : BeginYear | EndYear | Name 1974 1983 Robert For each record in Employees I need to insert each year into a new table called EmployeeYears So: For Each Record in Employees For i as int = Begin Year to End year INSERT i, Name into EmployeeYears Any Way to do this in SQL...possibly with cursors?
