How do I create a Linq expression that creates groups of max 100 objects

I have a LINQ expression that groups customers from an Azure Table Storage by partition. Because Azure only supports batch operations with max 100 entities at a time (and entities in a batch much have the same PartitionKey), I need each group to contain a maximum 100 entities. //How to complete this LINQ expression var groups = customers.GroupBy(c => c.PartitionKey)....; //Do some Azure table storage magic in parallel Parallel.ForEach(groups , customersInGroup => {...}); How do I complete my LINQ expression, so each group contains max 100 customers? That is... if the customers collection eg. has 142 customers with the same PartitionKey, i want to create two groups... one groups with 100 customers and one with 42 customers.
