For left censoring , if $T_i$ occurs before the time you started observing, then you only see $U_i$, the time you began observing. $$ T_i \leq U_i \Rightarrow Y_i = U_i $$ Otherwise, $T_i$ occurs after you begin observing, and you see $T_i$ itself. $$ T_i \geq U_i \Rightarrow Y_i = T_i $$ In both cases you end up with the larger of the two, that is, the maximum. For right censoring the roles of before and after get switched, so all the inequalities reverse. Consequently, the maximum becomes a minimum.
