There is no obvious reason as to why SharePoint limits the storage of the datetime datatype as it does now. In SQL Server, the smalldatetime columns allows date in the range from 1/1/1900 - 6/6/2079 and the datetime columns are ranged 1/1/1753 - 12/31/9999 So there's no range from 1/1/1900 - 12/31/8900 and I haven't got the slightest idea why the limitation exists. To make things even worse: SQL SErver 2008 has a smalldatetime2 and datetime2 type (the really just added a 2 to the name :/) wich allows any date (1/1/0000 - 12/31/9999) but even SharePoint 2010 on a SQL 2008 has the same limit And Kit: using a single line of text is a very poor substitu, as there is no way to validate the values entered by the user
