PCA and Gower's Distance

I have a dataset with nutrient information about different ingredients. There are a total of 70 nutrients (numeric features) and 3 categorical features for a total of around 550 ingredients. I am currently using Gower's Distance to calculate the dissimilarity between the ingredients. Because of high dimensionality as well as incorporation of new features in the future, I wanted to understand if some dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for the numeric features (or any others as well) would be appropriate for my current usecase?
