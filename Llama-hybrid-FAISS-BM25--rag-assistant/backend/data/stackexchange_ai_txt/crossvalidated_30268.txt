A possible way around this is to use an offset: Achim Zeileis says (here: http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg69617.html ): If it is a ratio of (integer-valued) counts in the numerator and some known denominator, say ratio = count/denom then one standard approach would be to fit glm(count ~ ..., offset = log(denom), data = ..., family = poisson) because this corresponds to log(count) = x'beta + log(denom) log(count/denom) = x'beta And here is how to do it with MCMCglmm: http://markmail.org/thread/66hxxbikx5a4yzam#query:+page:1+mid:dgrpip73futd3vok+state:results
