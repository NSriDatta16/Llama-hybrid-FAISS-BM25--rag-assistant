Not entirely sure whether this is an acceptable solution within your constraints, but you will have to show the elements to drag to them, so I would suggest unhiding the elements when the drag starts. That way they wont be visible until they really need to. You could do something like this: $('.listOfDraggableItems').draggable({ start: function(event, ui) { $('.dragbox').each(function(){ $(this).find('.dragbox-content').show(); }); } });
