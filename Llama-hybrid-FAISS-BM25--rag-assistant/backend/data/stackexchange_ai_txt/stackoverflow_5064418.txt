Print the footer as Page X of Y when using RtfWriter2

I am creating a .doc file using RtfWriter (itext-rtf-2.1.4.jar) & com.lowagie (itext-2.1.5). Earlier when I was creating PDF I was able to print the footer showing "Page X of Y" by capturing the events of closing of documents and the newpage events which is set while creating PDF in the class using the following code: PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("Sample.pdf")); MyPageEvents events = new MyPageEvents(); writer.setPageEvent(events); Where MyPageEvents is the class file that catches the events of pageending and document closing etc....on which it would set the required header and footer. This worked very well with PDFWriter but when I started creating .doc file using RtfWriter2 it does not support the events.... RtfWriter2 writer = RtfWriter2.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("Sample.doc")); MyPageEvents events = new MyPageEvents(); but the it does not reorganize the method writer.setPageEvents() as the PDFWriter did... Is there a possible way around to get the footer to display Page X of Y (Here X is current page while Y is the total number of pages in the document)
