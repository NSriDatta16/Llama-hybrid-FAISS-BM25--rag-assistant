How do I measure the time elapsed when calling a WCF Webservice?

We want to track the time taken by a web service call between a client and the server. This time should not include the time taken by the server to process the request. The idea is that we want to see how much time of a web service call is lost due to the actual transfer trough the network. Does WCF already offer something in this direction? Of course I could just add a timer on the client and subtract the server processing time but that wouldn't be very elegant.
