Calling web services from powershell: "Server did not recognize the value of HTTP Header SOAPAction"

I am attempting to call a web service from a powershell script. I am not the author of the web service, nor do I know much about web services. (I'm only ramping up in PowerShell, as well.) The vendor of the web software has provided me with a .wsdl file. I ran wsdl.exe against it, then csc.exe against the .cs file that was generated, in order to produce proxy .dll files. In my powershell script, I am instantiating an object, setting its url property and attempting to call one of the methods: [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom("$ProxyDllPath\VendorProxy.dll") $myVar = new-object VendorObject $myVar.url = "http://servername/serverdirectory/serverfile.asmx" $myStuff = $myVar.GetStuff() When I execute this, I get the exception: Exception calling "GetStuff" with "0" argument(s): "Server did not recognize the value of HTTP Header SOAPAction: ." At C:\users\xxx\desktop\xxx.ps1:56 char:55 + $myStuff = $myVar.GetStuff I have taken a network capture of my call and see: POST /serverdirectory/serverfile.asmx HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; MS Web Services Client Protocol 2.0.50727.4927) Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 SOAPAction: "" Authorization: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAAt4II4gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAbAdAAAADw== Host: servername Content-Length: 0 The WSDL description for this webservice is: I'm afraid that I don't really understand the exception; as I said, web services is not an area where I claim competence. How can I determine the soap action the server requires, and how do I configure my $myVar to use that soap action?
