The majority of features, especially in physical sciences, have names, definitions, values and units (s, m, kg, etc.), not only names and values. Knowing this, it is easy to manually or even automatically create new features basing on the units. It makes no sense to add meters to seconds, but (x1^2+x2^2+x3^2)^0.5, where x1, x2, x3 are the space coordinates of the same unit is potentially a very valuable feature (distance). Scaling before the ~creative feature engineering stage successfully destroys these (hidden for many) dataset properties and decreases the chance to find new valuable features.
