Implementing ACL in Crystal Reports 2008

My team have been working on implementing reports using Crystal Reports 2008. We are faced with the following problem: We need to be able to organize the reports into groups (representing the various departments in our workplace). The groups will have access to only the reports which they are authorized to. Is there any way to define the groups and associate the reports to the groups. Is this something that Crystal Reports 2008 provides out of the box? Also, can additional custom metadata (like attributes) be associated to the reports? Any suggestions appreciated
