restoring problems

I tried to use the canvas tag to allow users to draw shapes, but drawing a new line causes all other lines to disappear. Try It (copy+paste to the textarea and click the "Edit and Click Me >>" button) . I should mention that this problem exists in all 5 most popular browser (including IE7,8 and IE9beta). The code: // (click and drag the mouse to draw a line) It's probably a save/restore mistake, but I can't find it. I have tried 2 different forums: w3schools MSDN but nobody could tell what the problem is.
