If your existing report is printing 1 user per sheet, I would assume this is because it is grouped by user and either the New Page Before option is checked for the group header section, or the New Page After option is checked for the group footer. If so, and if the group footer section is suppressed, then alternate pages can be skipped by unsuppressing the (blank) group footer section and checking the New Page Before option for that section. (If the group footer section is already visible and contains data, create a new, blank footer sub-section at the end of the group footer section and adjust the new page options accordingly.) If not, please can you supply further details as to how your report is organised?
