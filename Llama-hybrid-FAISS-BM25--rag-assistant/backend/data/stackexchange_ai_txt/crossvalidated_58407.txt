Variance of a time series fitted to an ARIMA model

I think this is a basic question, but maybe I am confusing the concepts. Suppose I fit an ARIMA model to a time series using, for example, the function auto.arima() in the R forecast package. The model assumes constant variance. How do I obtain that variance? Is it the variance of the residuals? If I use the model for forecasting, I know that it gives me the conditional mean. I'd like to know the (constant) variance as well. Thank you. Bruno Update 1: I added some code below. The variance given by sigma2 isn't close to the one calculated from the fitted values. I'm still wondering if sigma2 is the right option. See figure below for time series plot. demand.train
