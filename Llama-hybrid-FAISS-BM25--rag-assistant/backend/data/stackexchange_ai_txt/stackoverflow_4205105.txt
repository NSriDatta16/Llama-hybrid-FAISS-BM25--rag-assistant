whats the difference between machine learning and statistics?

in the Turing lecture 2010 Christopher Bishop talks about machine learning undergoing a revolution because statistics is being applied to machine learning algorithms... but then its like all machine learning algorithms are all statistical algorithms.. whats the real difference between the two? why are they separate courses in most universities?
