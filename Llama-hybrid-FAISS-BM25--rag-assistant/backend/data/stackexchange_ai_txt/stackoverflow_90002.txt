What is a reasonable code coverage % for unit tests (and why)?

If you were to mandate a minimum percentage code-coverage for unit tests, perhaps even as a requirement for committing to a repository, what would it be? Please explain how you arrived at your answer (since if all you did was pick a number, then I could have done that all by myself ;)
