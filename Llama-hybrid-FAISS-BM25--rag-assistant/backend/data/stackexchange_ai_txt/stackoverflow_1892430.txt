I have started writing a NN implementation using C++ and found that I didn't know enough about the maths involved in the beginning. What ended up hapenning was that it was too hard to refactor the code as I was tweaking the calculation model. Eventually I gave into MATLAB as it was definitely a better companion to learning how neural networks work. I was able to make huge changes to the algorithm using a few key strokes and graph the results too. Perhaps my experience would have been better if I had used an already built matrix computation framework. Considering that's how you do 3D there should be a few really optimized libraries out there for most languages. Heck you might as well leverage Direct3D or OpenGL for that, but I am sure there is something more suitable for Neural Networks out there. I guess I am not providing much information on what you should do. I can however tell what you should not do - and that's trying to write matrix manipulation code yourself.
