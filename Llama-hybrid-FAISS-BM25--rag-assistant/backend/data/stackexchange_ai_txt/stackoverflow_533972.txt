It is technically possible meaning it will work but you probably won't survive for long. Especially if you're not in the local network but getting to the server over the internet, even the DSL line won't help you much. I've tried to work with Visio in that fashion in the local network and in the end I just brought my laptop with the local installation to stabilize my mental state. Today when many people are so discrete as even not any mouse will suit them because it is either not sensitive enough or oversensitive, trying to switch to the remote desktop mode will virtually teleport you in stone ages. Remote desktoping is pretty useful when you only need to connect for short periods of time to manage things. It is not really meant to organize remote software use. It will work but you won't like it.
