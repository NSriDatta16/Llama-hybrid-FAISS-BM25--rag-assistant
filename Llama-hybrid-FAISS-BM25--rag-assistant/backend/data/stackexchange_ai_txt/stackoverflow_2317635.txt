I don't think it is a good idea to have two different builds for the App Store. This would mean that you have to do all the organisatorial overhead in iTunes Connect twice. For example an update with all the screen shots and textual descriptions have to be submitted twice. Also you do not have a chance to ensure the release of both submissions will be synchronous. Why don't you provide a setting to the user where he can choose the country he wants to use your app for?
