PCA on train and test datasets: do I need to merge them?

I have train and test data set to work on. I would like to apply PCA to reduce dimension. Do I need to merge train and test data sets together before applying PCA? Or I should apply PCA on train data set, select reduced dimension, and work on reduced data set for both train and test data set?
