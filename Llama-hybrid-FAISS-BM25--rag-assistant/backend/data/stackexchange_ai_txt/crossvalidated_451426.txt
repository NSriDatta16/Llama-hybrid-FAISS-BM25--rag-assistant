It is possible to do Bayesian cluster analysis using a distance matrix, see this paper . It's fairly common to use correlation as a distance measure for clustering (obviously you must use $1-\rho$ rather than $\rho$ as high correlation implies similarity). As for a way to account for the uncertainty in posterior samples, I'm less sure. I would lean towards something like what Pedro suggested; to cluster each posterior sample and then do some form of averaging. However, given 2 levels of uncertainty, and the inherent variability of clustering algorithms, that could get very messy. I don't know that you would get sensible or interpretable results from the latter approach.
