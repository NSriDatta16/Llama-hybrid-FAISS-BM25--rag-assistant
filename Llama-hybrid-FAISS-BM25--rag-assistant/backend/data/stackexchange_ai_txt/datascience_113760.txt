I majored in Economics, and I immediately agreed with the first response. Hotel revenue management and airline fares don't have one of the "given" needs to apply even common-knowledge economics models... they do not have price transparency between competitors. Rather than bore you with the explanation, I think this is a great way to "get" why you should change your topic unless you (seriously) want to spend a few months studying the economics of these two industries: Priceline and hotel tonight. Both airlines and hotels are on popular sites that operate in a way where the customer agrees to a price (usually there are "clues" to what you're sort of gambling on with hotels), then pays, and then finds out what they bought. It's not to milk the consumer, it's that companies rely on opaque pricing to be competitive in the market. Again, it sounds like I don't know what I'm talking about without the econ models, but that's because they deviate SO much from common-knowledge supply and demand, it would be wasteful. Just think about the existence and success of priceline and hotel tonight. I think it's important to always remember what your data represents. The comments above are probably excellent ideas for other projects. But remember what your data is about! It's so important in data science! Those will not work due to the subject matter of your data. I am trying to be helpful.
