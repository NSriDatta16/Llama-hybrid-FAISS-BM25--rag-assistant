You know your data better than I do, but it seems to me that (venue_id, band_id, date) would be the most likely key for VenueSchedule. (venue_id, band_id) would imply that each band could only play each venue once or that the date wasn't needed. I would advise you to be cautious about the use of a surrogate key as suggested by other replies here. Firstly, a surrogate key won't do the same job as the compound key: it won't maintain data integrity because a surrogate won't stop the same venue, band, date combination being inserted more than once. That would create potential update anomalies and could lead to inaccurate results. Secondly, on the information given it isn't obvious why you would even need a surrogate key or how it would be used. If the table is being referenced elsewhere then you might want to use a surrogate for that - but if you have no use for it then a surrogate key would just be extra weight and complexity in storage and indexes for no good purpose at all.
