Categorical Feature Embedding When a Specific Feature Can be Present in Multiple Fields

Goal : I own a restaurant that specializes in spaghetti, and I want to build a neural network that predicts overall customer satisfaction (output variable) of different spaghetti sauce recipes, based on all of the factors that go into spaghetti sauce (e.g., ingredients, cooking temperature, cook time). Question : I would like to use Categorical Feature Embeddings to represent the different ingredients that go into the spaghetti sauce in each recipe, but because there is no domain-specific reason to order the ingredients in any manner, I'm not sure how to correctly generate the Categorical Feature Embedding vectors for each ingredient. Example : Let's say that I consistently have three ingredients that I toss in the sauce at the same time in the cooking process: [ , , ] and the total options of ingredients are: ['sweet sausage', 'ground beef', 'white onion', 'red onion', 'garlic', 'clove'] Some specific scenarios would be: ['sweet sausage', 'white onion', 'garlic'] ['clove', 'ground beef', 'red onion'] ['clove', 'white onion', 'garlic'] ['white onion', 'ground beef', 'clove'] ['sweet sausage', 'ground beef', 'clove'] In the last example above, there is no domain-specific reason to not order the ingredients like ['ground beef', 'clove', 'sweet sausage'] instead. I would like to create a Categorical Feature Embedding numeric vector to represent each unique ingredient. But because there is no domain-specific reason to order the ingredient combinations in any particular way, I'm interested in learning different approaches of how others would go about transforming the data to feed into a Tensforflow model for feature embedding if each ingredient has the possibility of landing in any of the three ingredient fields of the dataset. Disclosure : The example above is a total made-up scenario to illustrate my problem. I am not a great cook and you probably wouldn't want to eat my spaghetti sauce, regardless of the ingredient combination. :)
