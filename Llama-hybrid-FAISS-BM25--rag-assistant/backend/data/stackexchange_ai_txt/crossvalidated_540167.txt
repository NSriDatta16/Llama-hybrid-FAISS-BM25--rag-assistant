Difference between ensembling models and using one model as a feature in the second model?

I have 2 models - one is a generative model (a model which assets the parameter of some distribution for each individual object needs to be predicted, and does not learn from any data ), and the second is an XGBoost (which of course learns from training data). I wonder what is the difference between - Ensembling the 2 models (i.e - run them both, and then combine their independent results) Adding to the XGBoost model a feature , which is the result of the generative model What's the difference between the 2 options? When do I choose which one?
