Consider a binary logistic regression model to predict the probability of being in that segment vs. not in that segment. Compute measures of relative explained variation for all the predictors, where are the set of characteristics (numeric or categorical) that you want to examine for different distributions for those in the segment. This can be based on relative likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ statistics or a new relative explained variation measure described here . Use regression splines to allow numeric variables to act non-linearly.
