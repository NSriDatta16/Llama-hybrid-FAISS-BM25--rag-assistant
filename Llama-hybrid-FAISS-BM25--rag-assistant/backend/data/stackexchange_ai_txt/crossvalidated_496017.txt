Is it possible to use a Variational Autoencoder as a Feature Extractor like a standard CNN?

I have looked at autoencoders as feature extractors and I wondered if a variational autoencoder could also be used in the same way. For standard autoencoders you would just use the encoder-network, but since the VAE has the mean and deviation in the bottleneck-layer I am not quite sure how to use the VAE as a feature extractor. I would like to use a VAE as a feature extractor so that I can for example replace a VGG-Network for feature extraction with it. Are there any advantages/disadvantages for using different parts of the VAE as a feature extractor?
