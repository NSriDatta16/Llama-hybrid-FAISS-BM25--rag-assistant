It looks like the final version of Xcode 4 is not respecting the ORGANIZATIONNAME setting (either the old one, or the new one with com.apple.dt.Xcode. This sucks for me, because I have my company name in my address card, but I'm not doing Xcode work for my company. Thus, I don't want my actual company name to get inserted in my source files. I want the value I set for ORGANIZATIONNAME. Update : It looks like it partially works. I had shutdown Xcode before setting the value, then I restarted it, and created a new project. I saw that it was still using my company name from my Address Book card, and not ORGANIZATIONNAME. But then I created some new files in the project (File>New File...) and when they were created, they DID have the value from ORGANIZATIONAME. So, it looks like the code there is at least two bits of code that fill in the file template with the company name, and they are pulling from different locations.
