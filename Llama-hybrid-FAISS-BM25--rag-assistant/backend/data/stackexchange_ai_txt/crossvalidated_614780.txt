Stationarity in an interrupted time series

I am using proc autoreg in SAS to conduct an ITS analysis and I have a question about stationarity. Proc autoreg is able to perform the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), the Phillips-Perron (PP), and the KPSS test for stationarity. I believe I have a good understanding of the difference in their interpretations between them. My question is whether I test for stationarity across the interruption. For example, if I had a 36 month study period with an interruption at month 25, would I look at stationarity as separate parts (months 1-24 and 25-36) or as a whole (1-36)? My thought process is, that the interruption would likely cause it not to be stationary and thus ran separately. The code I am using is the following: proc autoreg data=one; model outcome = /stationarity=(kpss=(kernel=qs auto))stationarity=(phillips); where 1
