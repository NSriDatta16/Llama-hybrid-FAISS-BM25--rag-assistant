Strategies for evaluating models similar to yours (from Ecology) are discussed in this paper "Facilitating Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis of Agent-Based Models: A Cookbook Using NetLogo and R" by Thiele et al, 2014. It is about, well, Agent-Based Models and R, but the theoretical aspects are generally applicable. Just by chance I have read this last weekend. Found it easy to read. For a fast but maybe suboptimal strategy, what about Latin Hypercube Sampling? , see sect 2.25. Have not tried it myself, though.
