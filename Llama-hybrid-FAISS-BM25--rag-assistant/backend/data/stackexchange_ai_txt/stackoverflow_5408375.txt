Access Facebook App's Main Account Wall

We created an application profile using our company's Facebook account. Today, I've just finished integrating the application login, user login and also able to get user's info using oAuth and Graph API. Now I'm in the process of integrating Wall posts to one of our pages in order to encourage interaction between members. As I do that I noticed that I was fetching our Application Profile's Wall Posts instead of the Main Account. QUESTION: Is it possible for me to fetch and write to our FB Main Account's Wall instead of the our App's Wall? Thanks in advanced.
