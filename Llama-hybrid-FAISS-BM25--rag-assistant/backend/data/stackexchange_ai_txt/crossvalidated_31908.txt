What is percentage of variance in PCA?

I am trying to understand Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I found a webpage on PCA that introduces it and the concept of the percentage of variance. However, I am very confused about what "Percentage of Variance" (POV) means. Here are the questions I have: Is there a formal definition or mathematics formula to define "percentage of variance"? Do we only use POV for calculating PCA? Is POV used somewhere else? Is POV the same as "Proportion of Variance Explained"? (There are many similar terms online which really confuse me.)
