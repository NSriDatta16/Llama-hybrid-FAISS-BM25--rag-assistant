I work for AppMobi, which has a competing product...but the end result is very similar. We've had a bunch of people submit iOS apps (including us) with no issues. The only time problems arise is due to content or application specific problems, not with how it was built. As to jquery mobile (along with jqtouch and others), the uiWebView lags behind Safari with updates and performance, so it may run fine with Safari but slower in the container. That's one problem everyone deals with. I'd encourage you to look at http://zeptojs instead, since it's smaller and aimed at mobile devices, with an attempt of being jquery compatible. I'm always testing javascript frameworks and have not found a cross platform UI based one that's performed acceptable. plug And I'd encourage you to check out http://xdk.appmobi.com if you are just doing html/js/css based apps.
