The most common way to capture and store packets in linux is through libpcap . You can use standard sockets to send the packets or generic libraries ( boost::asio ). You can accomplish the same using wireshark . I believe wireshark will allow replay and/or injection. As far as arp poisoning, you will probably have to do that directly with arp packets yourself.
