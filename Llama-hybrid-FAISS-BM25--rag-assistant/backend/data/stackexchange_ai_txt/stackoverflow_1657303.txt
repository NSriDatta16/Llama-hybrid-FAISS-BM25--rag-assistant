I'm not quite sure what kind of game you have in mind, but PHP in itself is not the right programming language or technology for writing the 2D aspect of the game. You claim to have experience with CMSes, which is good, because this can be used/adapted to CRUD game state and entities. But for the graphics, consider using Flash or similar technologies. Mabye just plain javascript with the new html5 canvas, and a php backend. And about frameworks, although i do not have experience with any of them, there are plenty for flash and a simple google search revaels lots of active experiments and research for javascript game engines.
