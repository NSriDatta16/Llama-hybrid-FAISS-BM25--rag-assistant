Stratified logistic regression with log link

I noticed the other day that I can mimic a stratified logistic regression using a meta-analytic approach at least when there is only one stratification variable with two different values. This is the aggregated data I use with metabin from the package meta. > dmeta verum_event verum_N plac_event plac_N sex 1 25 50 30 100 0 2 30 80 25 70 1 I get the following (leaving out the heterogeneity stuff) > meta::metabin(verum_event, verum_N, plac_event, plac_N, data=dmeta, sm="OR", method="Inverse", comb.random=F) OR 95%-CI %W(fixed) 1 2.3333 [1.1585; 4.6996] 47.5 2 1.0800 [0.5547; 2.1027] 52.5 Number of studies combined: k = 2 OR 95%-CI z p-value Fixed effect model 1.5574 [0.9611; 2.5236] 1.80 0.0720 Using an expanded data set d > car::some(d) y trt sex 55 0 0 0 62 0 0 0 65 0 0 0 83 1 0 0 131 1 1 0 137 1 1 0 168 0 0 1 178 0 0 1 210 1 0 1 218 1 0 1 I get with clogit: > summary(clogit(y ~ trt + strata(sex), data=d, method="exact")); â€¦ exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 trt 1.557 0.6421 0.9612 2.524 exactly the same. Well, almost. But the SAS proc freq results are exactly the same as the meta-analysis. I expected as much since stratified analysis is computing the effect in each stratum separately and combine them afterwards. Which is also what a meta-analysis does. However the same approach does not work with relative risk (for risk differences the jury is still out). As I don't know of any way to compute stratified relative risks with R (is there one?) I rely on the SAS output which says RR lower upper 1.1595 0.9585 1.4027 But the meta analysis looks different: > meta::metabin(verum_event, verum_N, plac_event, plac_N, data=dmeta, sm="RR", method="Inverse", comb.random=F) RR 95%-CI %W(fixed) 1 1.6667 [1.1083; 2.5063] 51.8 2 1.0500 [0.6879; 1.6026] 48.2 Number of studies combined: k = 2 RR 95%-CI z p-value Fixed effect model 1.3338 [0.9945; 1.7890] 1.92 0.0545 Why do these two methods agree when using the logit link but don't when using log link?
