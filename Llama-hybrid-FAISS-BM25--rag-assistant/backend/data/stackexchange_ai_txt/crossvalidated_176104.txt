If you want to cluster the categories , you only have 24 records (so you don't have "large dataset" task to cluster). Dendrograms work great on such data, and so does hierarchical clustering. I'd suggest to: flatten the data set into categories, e.g. taking the average of each column: that is, for each category and each skill divide number of 1's in the skill / number of jobs in the category. try different similarity measures, including Manhattan and Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence. use hierarchical clustering, and visualize the dendrogram.
