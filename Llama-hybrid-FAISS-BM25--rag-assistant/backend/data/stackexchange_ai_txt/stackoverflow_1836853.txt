Machine learning challenge: diagnosing program in java/groovy (datamining, machine learning)

I'm planning to develop program in Java which will provide diagnosis. The data set is divided into two parts one for training and the other for testing. My program should learn to classify from the training data (BTW which contain answer for 30 questions each in new column, each record in new line the last column will be diagnosis 0 or 1, in the testing part of data diagnosis column will be empty - data set contain about 1000 records) and then make predictions in testing part of data :/ I've never done anything similar so I'll appreciate any advice or information about solution to similar problem. I was thinking about Java Machine Learning Library or Java Data Mining Package but I'm not sure if it's right direction... ? and I'm still not sure how to tackle this challenge... Please advise. All the best!
