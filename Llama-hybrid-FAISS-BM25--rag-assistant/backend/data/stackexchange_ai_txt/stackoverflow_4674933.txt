Merging two tables the rails way

I'm using Rails 2.3.5 with ActiveRecord, ruby 1.8.6, mysql (2.8.1) I have two tables A and B with the exact same column structures. A is on a separate server from B. I want to take the entire contents of B and add them to A so A = A + B Any elegant methods? I thought about taking one record at a time from B and just adding it into A, but that doesn't seem that great..
