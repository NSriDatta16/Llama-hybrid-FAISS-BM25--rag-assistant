JSEclipse Alternatives in Ganymede

I've been having a lot of problems with JSEclipse in Ganymede, but I haven't had much luck finding an alternative that's compatible with Ganymede (eclipse 3.4). All I'm really looking for is code-highlighting. Anyone have any good alternatives, or do I just need to suck it up and get on with it?
