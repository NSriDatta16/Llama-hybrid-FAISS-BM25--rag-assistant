Are you talking about steganography ? This would be taking some hidden message (could be an executable file) and hiding it in an image file. Obviously, the image file will bloat up a bit, but I think this is what you're talking about. The Wikipedia page has a few tools that are out there like StegFS and or MP3Stego . Update Upon re-reading your question, do you just want something that'll be a two color image with one color representing 1s and another being 0s? So the binary sequence 0110 1101 1010 1101 would produce an image like: wbbw bbwb bwbw bbwb
