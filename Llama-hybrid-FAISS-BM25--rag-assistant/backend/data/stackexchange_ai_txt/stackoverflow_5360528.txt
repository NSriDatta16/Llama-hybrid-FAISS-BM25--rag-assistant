Javascript with Smarty & Google Maps API

Being the absolute java newbie that I am, I've tortured myself getting to where I am. But, I did it. And, I couldn't be more happy! But... I have one last and final issue. I'm using Smarty. Smarty writes the dynamic javascript for me to load my map's markers. I need to include my header and footer .tpl files. My header.tpl has a and but my maps code depends on the and being where it is. The part of the code is the problem. I absolutely can not figure out how to execute my javascript without this "onload" code. Can someone give me a tip? All I really need is to know how to launch my javascript code without it being dependant on the tag. Here's my code and thank you SO MUCH in advance! {* {include file="header.tpl"} Book Buyers - Accounts Map {if $userlevel == 5} Admin User {/if} Hello, {$name}! html { height: 50% } body { height: 50%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px } #map_canvas { height: 50% } *} {foreach from=$getMap key=k item=v} var buyer{$k} = new google.maps.LatLng {foreach from=$v key=k item=latlng} {if $k == "lat"} ( {$latlng} , {else} {$latlng} ); {/if} {/foreach} {/foreach} var marker; var map; function initialize() { var mapOptions = { zoom: 5, mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP, center: warehouse }; map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map_canvas"), mapOptions); marker = new google.maps.Marker({ map:map, draggable:false, animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP, position: buyer5 }); {foreach from=$getMap key=k item=v} marker{$k} = new google.maps.Marker({ map:map, draggable:false, animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP, position: buyer{$k} }); {/foreach} } {include file="footer.tpl"}
