How to obtain decision boundaries from linear SVM in R?

I am in need of a package that can give me the equation for a linear SVM model. Currently I'm using e1071 like so: library(e1071) m = svm(data, labels, type='C', kernel='linear', cost=cost, probability=FALSE, scale=scale) w = t(m$coefs) %*% data[m$index,] #Weight vector b = -model$rho #Offset However, I'm not sure how e1071::svm() selects positive and negative classes, so I think this might screw up with different data sets. Can anyone confirm how this function decides which class is positive and which one is negative? Also, is there a better package for this?
