Model that predicts probability of correctness of another model

Problem: Given a neural network for image classification with $1000$ classes, the objective is to create another model which will output the probability of the neural network giving the correct prediction for a specific input image. Thoughts: My ideas so far have been: Creating a convolutional network and training it with raw images together with a label which indicates if the first NN predicted it correct or not. Creating a fully connected network and training it with outputs of hidden layers /features of the first NN instead of the raw image, together with the labels as before. Creating a fully connected network and training it with the top-k outputs of the softmax layer of the first NN together with the labels. The first method yielded an accuracy of $0.51$ , the second $0.58$ and the last one $0.79$ . Can you suggest another method (or a modification of one from the above) which can achieve greater accuracy?
