Model stability in cross-validation of regression models

Given multiple cross-validation folds of a logistic regression, and the resulting multiple estimates of each regression coefficient, how should one measure whether or not a predictor (or set of predictors) is/are stable and meaningful based on the regression coefficient(s)? Is this different for linear regression?
