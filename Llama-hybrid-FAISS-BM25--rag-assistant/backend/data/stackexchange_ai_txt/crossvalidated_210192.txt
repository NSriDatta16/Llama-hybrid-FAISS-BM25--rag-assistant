There is a topic in geostatistics called Exact Downscaling. The main goal here is to estimate a property at a smaller scale than the observations. Also these observations may or may not be overlapped (does not really matter). Please take a look to this paper: http://www.ccgalberta.com/ccgresources/report07/2005-101-exact_reproduction.pdf In this paper, they show a method to downscale the observations using geostatistical techniques. They show that by correctly calculating the cross-covariances between different data scales (point vs block) the kriging estimate is still valid; such that the average of estimated values at smaller scale is equal to larger input data. Basically, in order to calculate the estimate values in any scale, you just need to calculate the covariance function between the input data, target scales and cross-correlations correctly. At the Gaussian Process, the assumption is that estimation is being done at the same scale as input observations. So these are the steps: 1- Calculate experimental variogram from you data. 2- Fit the variogram model to your experiential variogam. You may need to account for directional anisotropy here. This is the covariance function that in GP is calculated by maximum likelihood method. 3- Calculate all the covariances and cross covariances between input data and target scale. There are numerical receipts for this step. The idea is that by discretizing the blocks into finite points, you can calculate the average covariance. The overlap data should be taken into account here. 4- perform Kriging and calculate the estimate values. GP is very related topic to geostatistics. However, geostatistics is not limited to Gaussian processes. There are many other methods to estimate or simulate a random process.
