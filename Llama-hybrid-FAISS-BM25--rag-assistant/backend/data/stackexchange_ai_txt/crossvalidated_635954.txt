ADI and CoV - Move thresholds based on dataset?

I am currently working on demand forecasting. During my research online I came to know about methods used to classify demand which helps us to focus on series which have better forecasting ability etc. So, the classification of demand happens mainly based on Coefficient of Variation (CoV), Average Demand Interval (ADI). This leads us to analysis like ABC XYZ segmentation and demand classification like - Intermittent, Lumpy, erratic, Smooth etc. does all the above approaches work makes sense only when they have fixed thresholds like I often see in online are fixed and they all use the same threshold cut-off (at least based on my exposure of articles online). You can refer here and here 1.Smooth demand (ADI = 1.32 and CV² = 0.49) 4.Lumpy demand (ADI >= 1.32 and CV² >= 0.49) So, my question, a) should these thresholds be alerted to reflect our dataset? For ex: Can I run a 1D-Kmeans clustering on CV and identify the natural breaks in my data to come up with XYZ segmentation or demand classification ADI or CV**2? For ex - I get 0.95, 2.6 and 3.31 as CoV value limit for X, Y and Z. Average CoV is 1.67. Is this right thing to do or should I just stick to fixed limits given online? b) Should we compute average sales only by considering the active period (non-zero sales time periods) or full time period (using time periods when customer was inactive)
