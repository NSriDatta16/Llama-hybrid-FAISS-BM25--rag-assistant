to load data from a table with 1.000.000 rows in C# using a firebird db takes on a Pentium 4 3Ghz at least 8 hours Everybody's been assuming you were running a SQL query to select the records from the database Something like select * from your_big_table / Because that really would take a few seconds. Well, a little longer to display it on a screen, but executing the actual select should be lightning fast. But that reference to C# makes me think you're doing something else. Perhaps what you really have is an RBAR loop instantiating one million objects. I can see how that might take a little longer. But even so, eight hours? Where does the time go? edit My guess was right and you are instantiating 1000000 objects in a loop. The correct advice would be to find some other way of doing whatever it is you do once you have got all your objects in memory. Without knowing more about the details it is hard to give specifics. But it seems unlikely this is a UI think - what user is going to peruse a million objects? So a general observation will have to suffice: use bulk operations to implement bulk activity . SQL databases excel at handling sets. Leverage the power of SQL to process your million rows in a single set, rather than as individual rows. If you don't find this answer helpful then you need to give us more details regarding want you're trying to achieve.
