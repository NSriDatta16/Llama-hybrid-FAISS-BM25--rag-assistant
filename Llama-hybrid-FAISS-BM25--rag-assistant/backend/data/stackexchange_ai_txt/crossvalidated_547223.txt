Eight years of data is a lot to work with. Using a test set may well be enlightening. For instance, you could train various models on the first six years of data, then assess them using the seventh year. Then retrain them and forecast all models out into the eighth year. Then take a look at how well the holdout performance in the seventh year correlates with the holdout performance in the eighth year. It may well be that choosing the model that performed best in the seventh year did not lead to the model that would perform best in the eighth year. Similarly, try this exercise earlier in your data, e.g., with a 5/1/1 or even a 4/1/1 split. Also, consider seasonal exponential smoothing in addition to SARIMA. And think about averaging the forecasts from multiple models, which often improves accuracy.
