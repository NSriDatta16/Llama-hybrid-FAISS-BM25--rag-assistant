One thing I'd like to point out is that the data don't have to look perfectly Gaussian to come from a normal distribution. The main thing is that so long as they aren't very skewed, or there aren't outliers a large distance from the typical range of values in the data, it's fine. Unless you have a huge amount of samples from a process where the measurement noise comes from a large number of small sources (such that the errors tend to cancel out -- this process is what generates a Gaussian distribution --), the data will likely never look like a perfect bell curve. Even when they do, they can actually be non-Gaussian! See Rand Wilcox's book on Robust Estimation and Hypothesis testing for more on that.. In any case, nothing about what you've shown in that plot would lead me to use the Kruskal-Wallis over ANOVA, so it's fine. Hypothesis tests for normality are also bunk. Though you didn't mention them here, I'd like to pass on that bit of info. See Is normality testing 'essentially useless'? and What is wrong with tests of normality? Also you should look into Bayesian inference. Stan is easy to learn and available in Python :)
