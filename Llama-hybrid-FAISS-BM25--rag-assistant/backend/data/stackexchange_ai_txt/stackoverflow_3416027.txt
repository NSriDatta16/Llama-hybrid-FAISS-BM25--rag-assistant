attachment_fu rmagick on phusion passenger

I am getting so much pain with setting up rmagick on Passenger . Iâ€™m developing a rails web application that has image processing feature using imagemagick. the image processing feature is working 100% on development using mongrel, but once i deploy it to production which uses phusion passenger I get the error uninitialized constant Technoweenie::AttachmentFu::Processors::RMagickProcessor i have successfully installed the following gems: 1.) rmagick (2.13.1) 2.) imagemagick this is the code from the model has_attachment :content_type => :image, :storage => :file_system, :processor => 'Rmagick', :resize_to => '300 x 400', :max_size => 2.megabytes, :thumbnails => { :thumb => [85, 95], :geometry => 'x50'}
