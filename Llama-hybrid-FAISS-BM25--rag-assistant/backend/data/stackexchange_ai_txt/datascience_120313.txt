Making a netcdf data using xarray

I am very very new to the world of data science as I only started using it in my new job so I would really appreciate help from the community experts (maybe also in simple words :)). I am trying to build a dataset comprising data extracted from a NetCDF data file. The data extract would contain n number of images each of 25x25 size in 17 channels. The idea is to save them as a new data file or object (it could be NetCDF but there is no restriction as long as it is readable by xarray). I am unable to find a way to achieve this because, in xarray, you have N-dimensional data, and to each point in this N-dimensional data there is a label attached. So how do I save 25x25 images with 17 variables (channels) in one dimension (axis of length n, the number of images) so that when I pass the index of the axis (nth image), it returns as dataArray of 17x25x25. Thanks in advance.
