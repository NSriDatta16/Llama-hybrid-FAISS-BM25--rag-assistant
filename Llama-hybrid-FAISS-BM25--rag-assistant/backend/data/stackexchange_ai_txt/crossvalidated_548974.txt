What are some of the most successful applications of Bayesian prediction/estimation?

What are some of the most successful applications of Bayesian prediction/estimation? Bayesian confuses me occasionally because depending on the context the usage of priors may seem like redundant. Especially if there's no "prior knowledge" that could be put into priors, then it seems that it does not add anything to "non-Bayesian".
