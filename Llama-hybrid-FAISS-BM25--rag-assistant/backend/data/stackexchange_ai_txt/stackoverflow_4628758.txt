The method uses Linq to project some values from the DB into a list of integers - you may want to test that it does that correctly. I would split the code into two - the data retrieval and the projection (Linq query) - you could then test the linq query with mock data , without needing to mock the database. I would also say there is little value in unit testing data access code.
