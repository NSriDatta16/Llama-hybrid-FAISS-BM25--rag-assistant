Your problem is here: $\pi$ is an array of 1s and 0s , representing the predicted outcome labels as a result of the logistic regressions. That's incorrect. The $\pi$ values should be the predicted probabilities of class membership returned by logistic regression. See the explanation of the formula in the table on the UCLA web page that you cite. Logistic regression does not return class membership assignments. It sometimes appears to, based on a hidden assumption of p = 0.5 for categorization after modeling. But even if strict assignments are needed, that's not necessarily the best cutoff choice. Your formula is related to the accuracy of the classification (at the chosen probability cutoff) which is not a good choice for evaluating classification models of any sort. The numerator of the second term in that formula, with $\pi$ values correctly taken as probabilities, is the basis of the Brier score , the mean-square error between observations and predicted probabilities. That's a strictly proper scoring rule , which you might consider using on its own. Chapter 8 of Frank Harrell's course notes covers several ways to evaluate the quality of logistic regression models.
