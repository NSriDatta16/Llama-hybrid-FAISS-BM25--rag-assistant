Interested in optimizing the number of appointments based on the counts of two features

Key Facts: Currently have a regression model (XGBoost) that takes 85 features and predicts the number of appointments. There are two features that I am particularly interested in optimizing 2 features. Lets call them, Value A and Value B Problem: To provide a recommended strategy, I'd like to optimize Value A and Value B to maximize the number of appointments. Questions: How would I do this since i'm just trying to optimize 2 of 85 features? Should I just simulate increasing/decreasing these two features within my test set? I'd them predict the number of appointments for each variation and use the global maximum. I know very little about optimization so any help would be much appreciated.
