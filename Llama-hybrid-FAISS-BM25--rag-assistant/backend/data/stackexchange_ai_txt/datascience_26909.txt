Gradient Descent in logistic regression

Logistic and Linear Regression have different cost functions. But I don't get how the gradient descent in logistic regression is the same as Linear Regression. We get the Gradient Descent formula by deriving the Squared Error cost function. However in Logistic Regression we use a Logarithmic Cost function instead. I think I am lost here.
