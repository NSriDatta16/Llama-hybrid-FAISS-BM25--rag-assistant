Open Organizer in Xcode (Window > Organizer). Does your iPhone's name appear there? If not, is your phone plugged in :)? Also, some people have had this issue when installing multiple versions of XCode - if your phone also doesn't show up in iTunes, reinstall iTunes to address this. If it does show up, click on it. Look at the provisioning profiles. What do you see there? Do you see one that matches your app?
