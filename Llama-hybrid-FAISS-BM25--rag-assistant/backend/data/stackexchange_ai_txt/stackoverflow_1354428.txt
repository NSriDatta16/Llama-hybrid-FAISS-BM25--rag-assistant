Drupal best practices for custom admin section

Is this a common task in your Drupal work when you're asked to create a custom admin section in Drupal for your content? For instance, you have a few content types and user wants not only to view them, but to search using different filters, to add new items - all inside the same admin subsection. In essence, this is classic search/grid/record screen/pages and while in typical Drupal distribution content management screents are kind of scattered around, I am talking about more organized spage, e.g. in which Grid (View) also has "Add new" link and you don't have to scroll to "Create content" menu which relates to a different section. What is your experience and opinion in this relation?
