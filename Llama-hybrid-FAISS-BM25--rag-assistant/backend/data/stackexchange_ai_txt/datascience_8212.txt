Looks like you have two problems: time-dependant predictive modeling and feature engineering. 1) Time-dependant data Key words: create a model which should be able to predict the future level of a rider in professional cycling The future Level of the Rider. That means there is current Level. And Level in the past . And the history of Level change in time for each Rider. The problem you are trying to solve is time dependant. Your source data can look like: 2) Build a variable to predict Second. You should build the target feature. This Rider Level (Class). As far as I understood: the overall rider 'level' can be a function of his 'classes' in each particular race types and... the race 'observation' class is a kind of function of {Category, Race Type, Parcours, Distance, Position} So the only thing you realy need to predict is race result.
