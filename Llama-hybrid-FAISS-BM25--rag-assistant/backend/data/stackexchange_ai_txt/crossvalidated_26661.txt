Justification of aggregation in multi-level model - ICC in SPSS

I am running a multi-level model on data which is set out with one row per individual survey return, each with Individual ID and Organisational ID as columns. There are variables which can be aggregated in to group, but I first have to justify this aggregation, and believe I have to use ICC(1), ICC(2) and Rwg. Although I can find a lot explaining what these are, I cannot seem to figure out how to do this with my output in SPSS. I at first believed it came from the output of a one-way ANOVA, but have since been told it should be two-way for ICC(2) as this is a two-level multi-level model. Can anyone help me on this one? I can't see how I can do a two-way ANOVA as I surely only need to use the Organisational ID and aggregating variable in question and two-way requires three variables? Any help would be very gratefully received. Thanks!
