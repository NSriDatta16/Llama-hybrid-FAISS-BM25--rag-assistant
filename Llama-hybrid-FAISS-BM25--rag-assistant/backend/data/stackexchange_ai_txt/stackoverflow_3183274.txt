@Orion Edwards You know how you right-click on a project, select "Dependencies" and tick the boxes for the dependencies? This still affects building in VS2010, but MSBuild pays no attention to it. This is definitely not correct, and does not happen in the general case (or everyone would be at our door). Please open a Connect bug, so we can look into this and fix it. Thanks -- Dan/msbuild.
