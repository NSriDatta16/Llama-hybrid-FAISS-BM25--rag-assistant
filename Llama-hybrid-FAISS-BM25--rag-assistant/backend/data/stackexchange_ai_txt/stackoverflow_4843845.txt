There are ways to embed assets into a Flex application, however most people use this for images or other visual assets. I do not believe that jar is supported. Java and ActionScript are very different and you wouldn't be able to load a jar inside the flash player and execute it as a program or run commands against it. If this is an AIR application, you may be able to do something using NativeProcess . But, such an approach is not the same as embedding a jar file in a Flex Application. It is taking your file and wrapping it up in an AIR installer and then communicating with that file as it runs natively on the machine.
