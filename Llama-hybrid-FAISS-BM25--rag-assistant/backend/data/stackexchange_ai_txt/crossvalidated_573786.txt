In the structural change literature this is also referred to as "monitoring" structural changes in linear regression models. A set of classic techniques is available in the strucchange package in R and the corresponding papers/vignette/manual gives further pointers to the literature. The techniques would usually monitor both intercept and slope. Given that you assume that your slope is stable and sufficiently well known, you can reduce the problem to a univariate setting, though. Namely, you can compute the residuals, in your example E = Y - X,and then monitor for level-shifts in E only. For this you can also use the monitoring techniques from the structural change literature but also control charts (such as EWMA etc.) from the statistical process control literature. The main difference between these is that the techniques try to control different properties of the procedure: type-I errors (in monitoring) vs. average run length etc. (in process control).
