Closed form for the variance of a sum of two estimates in logistic regression?

In logistic regression with an intercept term and with at least one dependent variable which is categorical, is there a closed form for the variance of the sum of the intercept and the coefficient of the categorical variable, or do you have to sample from a multivariate distribution with the means and variances of the intercept and the coefficient to get a reliable measure of the variance of this sum? $P(y) = \frac{exp(y)}{1 + exp(y)}$ $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \epsilon$ where x is categorical. Would the formula for the variance of a sum (of two random variables) be applicable here? $Var(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}) = Var(\beta_{0}) + Var(\beta_{1}) + 2Cov(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1})$ The reason I ask, is that in this comment I got the impression that no closed form existed for the variance in question, and the advice was to sample from a multivariate distribution with the means and variances of $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ set.seed(1) dependent.var |z|) (Intercept) -1.791759 0.4082482 -4.388897 0.0000113927 independent.varRed 1.752539 0.4951042 3.539737 0.0004005255 > vcov(my.fit) (Intercept) independent.varRed (Intercept) 0.1666666 -0.1666666 independent.varRed -0.1666666 0.2451282 The logit of TRUE for a "Red" case is $ \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \approx -0.039$. Is the variance for this estimate exactly vcov(my.fit)[1,1] + vcov(my.fit)[2,2] + 2 * vcov(my.fit)[1,2] [1] 0.07846154 ? Or is this only an approximation, and a more accurate measure is to be found by sampling, e.g. library(MASS) var(rowSums(mvrnorm(n = 1E7, mu = coef(my.fit), Sigma = vcov(my.fit)))) [1] 0.07842985 ? In this simple example, the sampling method does not seem to provide more accurate estimates of the variance (using 1E7 samples). Here it is stated that "There is a correspondance between the covariance matrix of the fit parameters and Δχ2 confidence regions only for the case of Gaussian uncertainties on the input measurements.". Is that a reason against relying on the closed form above, or is there perhaps another reason for the advice to sample instead of deriving the variance analytically in cases like this? EDIT: (In response to the answer given by StasK). The advice I originally got was to simulate from the full model, not from the vcov() , so here is the code to simulate from the full model: library(arm) sim.i
