This situation is typically conspicuous when you perform data cleaning, you must be clear about the data structure (highly balanced or unbalanced) before performing it. After all, it means that using the PCA before data cleaning tend to explain more variability of the data with less dimension. To answer your question more precisely, could you tell me what classifier(s) are you using? By the way, the formula of variance captured by component k is: $$\frac{\lambda_k}{\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i}$$ ,where $\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge......\ge \lambda_n \ge 0$ is the variance captured by each component.
