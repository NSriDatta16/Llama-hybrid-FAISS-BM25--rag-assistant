What you see is the expected behavior. SSH is waiting for bash to finish execution. If you omit the "bash" as the argument to ssh-agent, then ssh-agent goes in the background like you expect it to. So, perhaps you meant to run: ssh -v user@address "ssh-agent" looking at pstree output shows more clearly what is happening. |-+= 09556 root /usr/libexec/launchproxy /usr/sbin/sshd -i | \-+= 09557 root /usr/sbin/sshd -i | \-+- 09560 root /usr/sbin/sshd -i | \-+= 09561 root bash | \--= 09562 root ssh-agent bash
