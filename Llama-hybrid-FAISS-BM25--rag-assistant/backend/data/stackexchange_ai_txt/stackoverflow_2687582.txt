If you're asking about including JavaFX script inline in an HTML file, I do not think that's possible. However, if you just want to have a JavaFX widget on a web page, then yes. Use something like this: javafx( { archive: "HelloApplet.jar", draggable: true, width: 150, height: 100, code: "hello.HelloApplet", name: "Wiki" } ); Code from Planet JFX
