Binary Logistic Regression?

I have a yes/no dependent variable; independent variables are also a combination of yes/no variables and one 3-level sexual identity variable. Also hoping to control for for 2 of the yes/no variables and one categorical variable. What analysis is appropriate? Should I be looking at binary?
