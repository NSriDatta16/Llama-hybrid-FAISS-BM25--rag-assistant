How much Java should I have learnt before trying Android programming?

I have been seeking beginner learning books in Android, and of course found out that I should learn Java first. So I began studying Java and now I am quite comfortable with objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and just moved onto Layouts in Swing as well as Swing Features. But I am starting to wonder.... do I know enough about Java now? Can I start programming Android yet? Of course I can keep going in Java, but have been itching to begin programming Android apps. Any definitive answer here about how much Java I need to know before Android? Thanks so much!
