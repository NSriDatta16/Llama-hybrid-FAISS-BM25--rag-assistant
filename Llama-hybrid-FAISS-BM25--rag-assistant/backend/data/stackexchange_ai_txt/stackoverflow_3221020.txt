My belief is that at the very minimum you should be look at 2.0 and above. Anything after 2.0 is additional functionality to the core and you shouldnt be using anything below this. As a developer I believe that you should use the newest version possible as Microsoft puts a lot of effort (and invests a lot of money) to add new features to the framework. I understand that from a management point of view it is not always easy to justify moving to the latest and greatest but realistically you're not rewriting your codebase when you update to a newer version - for older (2.0) applications you can just convert your project and voila - you suddenly have access to a lot of features you didnt before. Organizations must remember that their code is an asset like any other and requires regular maintenance. Updating frameworks is part of the evolution of your applications and is a valuable (and relatively small) investment.
