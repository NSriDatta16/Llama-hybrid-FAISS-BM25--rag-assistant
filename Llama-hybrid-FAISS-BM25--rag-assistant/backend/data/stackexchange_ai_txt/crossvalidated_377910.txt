Machine learning books covering neural networks / cnn / GAN

I'm not an expert in machine learning. Is there any textbook (with a decent amount of mathematical rigor) that cover the subjects neural network / convolutional neural network / GAN network? I've the Mitchell - Machine Learning but it is a bit old and it doesn't cover CNN and GAN. Even a list would be fine so I can check by myself which one is more suitable.
