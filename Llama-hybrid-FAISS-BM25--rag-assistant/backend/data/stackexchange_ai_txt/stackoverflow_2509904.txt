Immutable generally means "does not change". Persistent generally is taken to mean "stored on permanent storage medium". However, the Wikipedia article you mention seems to take the two words to mean very similar things (but not exact same). In fact it states: A persistent data structure is not a data structure committed to persistent storage, such as a disk; this is a different and unrelated sense of the word "persistent."
