In some formulations of multi-class ROC AUC, it is the case that the AUC estimate is sensitive to relative class frequencies, but this is not true of all mutli-class ROC AUC formulations. Moreover, the ROC AUC formulation in the binary classification case is not sensitive to relative class frequencies. There are numerous performance measures which are sensitive to imbalanced data, such as accuracy, but insensitivity to class imbalance is one of the very appealing advantages to ROC AUC. This paper develops the idea that binary ROC AUC is insensitive to class compositions, with extended discussion, with the basic idea being that ROC is all about the rates, rather than the absolute numbers of each class. Because ROC analysis measures the relative ranking of examples, class imbalance doesn't change the ROC curve. In the multi-class case, there are a couple of ways to represent the problem. The class-reference formulation, for example, is sensitive to relative class frequencies. Alternatively, there is a method of combining all 1 vs 1 ROC AUC estimates that is not sensitive to class compositions. This is developed by Hand & Till (2001).
