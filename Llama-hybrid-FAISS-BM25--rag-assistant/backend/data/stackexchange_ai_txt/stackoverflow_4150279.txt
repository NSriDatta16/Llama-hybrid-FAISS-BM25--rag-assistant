Yes, if you know whether (and how!) your regex is delimited. Say, for example, that your string is something like aaaaa...aaa/b/aaaaa where 'b' is the 'regular expression' delimited by the character / (this is a near-basic scenario); what you have to do is scan the string for the expected delimiter, extract whatever it's inbetween delimiters (paying attention to escape chars) and you should be set. This, if your delimiter is a known character and if you are sure that it appears an even number of times or you want to discard the rest (for example, which set of delimiters are you considering in the following string: aaa/b/aaa/c/aaa/d ) If this is the case then you need to follow the same reasoning you'd do to find any substring in a given string. Once you've found the first regexp, keep parsing until you hit the end of the string or you find another regexp, and so on. I suspect, however, that you are looking for a 'general rule' to find any string that, once parsed, would result in a valid regular expression (say we're talking about POSIX regexp-- try man re_format if you're under *BSD). If that is the case you could try every possible substring of every length of the given string and feed it to a regexp parser for syntax correctness. Still, you have proven nothing of the validity of the regexp, i.e. on what they actually match. If that is what you're trying to do I strongly recommend finding another way or explaining better what you are trying to accomplish here.
