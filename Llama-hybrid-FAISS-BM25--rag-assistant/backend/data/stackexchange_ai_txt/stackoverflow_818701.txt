I think your reasoning is sound and it's the way I would go as well. Basically what you're talking about are bridge/adapter/facade classes. They are (imho) more flexible and easier to understand than XSL templates. The third reason isn't really one because XSL support involves nothing more than uncommenting a PHP extension. I'm also glad to see you want to do this via the DOM extensions (or equivalent library) rather than writing XML as text, which introduces all the escaping issues and whatnot you'll avoid your way. Personally I also think that XSL templates are more fragile to change (by virtue of them being somewhat more cryptic to the vast majority of programmers) so if your superset format ever changes (which, let's face it, it will) you'll potentially need to change all your templates. Of course you may have to do this with code too but code will probably be easier to maintain.
