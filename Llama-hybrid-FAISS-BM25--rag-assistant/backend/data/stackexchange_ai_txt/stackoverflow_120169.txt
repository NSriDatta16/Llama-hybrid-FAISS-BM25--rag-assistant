Adam Cogan recommends creating a patch table that is used to record each and every update beyond your initial release. Instead of changing your schema through SSMS or Enterprise Manager make sure you script each change...both applications allow you to script your changes and then not apply them. Save the scripts to files (probably add them as resources) and then simply check the patches table each time you application runs. Adam has some rules to better SQL databases here http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSQLServerDatabases.aspx
