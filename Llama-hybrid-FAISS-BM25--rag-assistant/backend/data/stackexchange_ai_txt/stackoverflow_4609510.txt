You'll need IComponentContext or ILifetimeScope for most purposes. These are automatically provided by Autofac, so all you need to do is take a (constructor) dependency on one of them and the current instance will be injected. Both interfaces provide the standard Resolve() operations, while ILifetimeScope extends IComponentContext by adding methods for starting new nested lifetimes. Components that want to use the services of the container to access other components need to do so within their own scope, rather than the 'global' IContainer , so that the correct instance can be returned. E.g. within an HTTP request, the injected IComponentContext or ILifetimeScope will be the one for the current request. Most problems that require an injected context can also be (often more elegantly) overcome using Relationship Types - see: http://autofac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/resolve/relationships.html .
