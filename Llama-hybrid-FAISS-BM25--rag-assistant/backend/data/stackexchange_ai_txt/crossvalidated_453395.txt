You want to calculate the average height of persons. An online algorithm that implements this keeps track of the total height of the persons the algorithm has seen, and the number of persons the algorithm has seen. An update is achieved by adding to these totals, while the average height at any point can be calculated by dividing the total height by the number of people measured. This is a very simple online learning algorithm.
