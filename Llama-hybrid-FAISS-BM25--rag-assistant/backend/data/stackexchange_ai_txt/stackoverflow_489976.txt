I have been wanting the same thing. I have been testing a basic layout system for win forms and found that the mono Mac version of WinForms is not 100% complete like drag and drop has not been implemented and is slow. From my own searching GTK# has the best support across all platforms. The other way is to split the UI for each platform i.e. WinFoms, GTK# (linux) and Cocoa (cocoa#/monobjc).
