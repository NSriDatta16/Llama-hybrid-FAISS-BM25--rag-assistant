Gibbs sample from AR(1) of exogenous input

I am trying to fit a model where there is a sequence of exogenous "shocks", $X_1, X_2, ..., X_T$, and a AR(1) of these shocks explain $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_T$. Specifically, Data (known): $X_1, X_2, ..., X_T$ $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_T$ Priors (known): $\phi = 2 \phi^* - 1$, where $\phi^* \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$, "persistence" parameter, between $(-1, 1)$ $\beta \sim N(\mu, v)$, "shock strength" parameter Model: $E_t = \phi E_{t-1} + \beta X_t$ $Y_t = E_t + \epsilon_t$, $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, 1)$ Unknown parameters: $\phi$, $\beta$, $E_0$ My question is, what is the easiest way to sample $\beta$ and $\phi$? It seems that if I am allowed to use $E_{t-1}$ when sampling from $\phi$, it becomes a bit easier, as: $Y_t = \phi E_{t-1} + \beta X_t + \epsilon$ $\implies \phi E_{t-1} = Y_t - \beta X_t - \epsilon$ $\implies \phi \sim N(\frac{Y_t - \beta X_t}{E_{t-1}}, \frac{1}{E_{t-1}^2})$ However, since $E_t$ is known deterministically from $\phi$, it seems that if I am conditioning on it I must choose a deterministic value for $\phi$. So I have two questions: How do I best fit this model using MCMC? How do I condition on a deterministic auxiliary variable within a Gibbs sampling step?
