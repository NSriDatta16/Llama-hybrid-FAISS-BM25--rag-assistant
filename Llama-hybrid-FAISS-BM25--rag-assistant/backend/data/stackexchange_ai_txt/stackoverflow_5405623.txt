Beautiful concise statement from Andreas Jung: Yes, you can not get a consistent snapshot of both the blob storage and the Data.fs. From the consistency point of view: using blob storage + Data.fs is broken-by-design :) David Glick adds: If you copy the Data.fs and then rsync the blobstorage, and make sure that the db doesn't get packed while that's happening, the backup should be fine. You may end up with some extra blobs that are not referenced by the Data.fs, but that's no big deal. (From the thread at http://plone.293351.n2.nabble.com/question-about-using-repozo-and-blob-storage-td5016465.html ) The same goes for FileSystemStorage.
