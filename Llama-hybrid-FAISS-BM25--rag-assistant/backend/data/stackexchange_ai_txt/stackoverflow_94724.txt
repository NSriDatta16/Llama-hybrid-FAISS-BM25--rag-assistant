J2ME coverage tools

I need to estimate the code coverage of a test set. The tests are run on a J2ME application, on a physical device. MIDP 2.1, CLDC 1.1 and JSR-75 FileConnection are available. As J2ME is (roughly) a subset of J2SE, tools using java.io.File (like those listed in the only answer so far..) can not be used. This is mainly to identify pieces of code the tests do not touch at all. It would also be nice to be able to combine the report data arbitrarily afterwards, so I can see how much a new test actually increases coverage. Are there any alternatives to Cobertura4j2me ?
