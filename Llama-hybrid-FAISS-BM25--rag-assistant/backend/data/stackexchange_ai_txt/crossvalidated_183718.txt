Recurrent neural network for object tracking & position filtering?

Would a recurrent neural network be appropriate for object tracking tasks? Mainly I will have 3D feature vectors $(x, y, t)$ where $x$ and $y$ are the positions of an object in the image and $t$ is either the current timecode or a number indexing the current frame being processed. Since $x$, $y$ always have noise and are just "approximately" located in an image the network would have to do some de-noising. Finally the object should be tracked and the next feature vector $(x, y, t_{t+1}$) estimated. I guess a Kalman filter would perform quite well for this problem but since the image sequences will have highly different noises (based on lighting and the object to be tracked) I assume an architecture which can learn those additional features would perform better?! My first idea was using an Elman network to keep it simple...however I would highly appreciate any input on this topic because I do not want to "waste time" on solutions just to notice that they barely work later on. I also read about recurrent neural networks mimic a Kalman Filter's behaviour but I have no experience whatsoever in which scenarios this would be helpful or producing good results. Any experience, advice, literature or somehow related post is welcome :)
