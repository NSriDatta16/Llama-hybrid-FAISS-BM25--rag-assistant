I think what you want is an "Area", just right click your project and select add -> Area and name it admin. That will create following structure: Areas ->admin ->controllers ->models ->views You might also want to checkout these sites: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee671793.aspx (or if you like videos more) http://elegantcode.com/2010/03/13/asp-net-mvc-2-areas/ both should offer a good overview of the areas concept.
