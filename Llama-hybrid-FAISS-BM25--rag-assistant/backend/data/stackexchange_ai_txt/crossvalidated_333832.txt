What is the meaning of results produced by auto.arima() function of R?

I already posted the same question on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49298634/how-to-interpret-results-of-auto-arima-in-r but some one pointed to ask it on here. I would appreciate any relevant help. Let I have a time series X and I used fit followed by fcast . When I do print(summary(fcast)) , I get a result having number of variables (snapshot of an example is attached). What is the meaning of each variable (specially, highlighted in red boxes)? If someone can explain in simple terms, it would be great. What is the meaning of getting -Inf and Inf for MPE and MAPE respectively? What is meaning of Lo 80 , Hi 80 , Lo 95 , and Hi 95 ? Can I say that it is 80% likely to have actual value equal to Forecast+Lo 80+Hi 80 ?
