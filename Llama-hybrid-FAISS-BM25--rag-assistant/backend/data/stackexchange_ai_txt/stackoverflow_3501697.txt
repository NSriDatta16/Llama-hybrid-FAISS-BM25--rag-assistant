I managed to find a workaround: after the first click on a custom UITableCellView I create a new UIView to put on top of the window that intercepts another touch+drag. The other touch creates a UIImageView that copies the undelying clicked cell as a Image. This UIImageView can be dragged around along the UIView and then dismissed when necessary. When I end the touch I look if it ended up a another cell, if so I get its indexPath and compute a coherent action
