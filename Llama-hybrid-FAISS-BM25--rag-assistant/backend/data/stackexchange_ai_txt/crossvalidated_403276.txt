As I and @RobertLong noted in comments, scaling categorical variables would not be a good (or effective) solution to your problem. You probably just face a practical problem with finding the solution, based on the combination of the form of your model, your data, and the default settings used by glmer() . The default settings for a function in a statistical package just might not work in particular situations. That's an important lesson for a beginner to learn. There can be convergence issues with lme4 functions, some of which may just be false-positive warnings. These are related to the choice and settings for the optimizer used to find the solution. This answer on this site from Ben Bolker, a major contributor to that package, discusses a similar recent example with lmer() . Further complicating the issue, optimizer defaults have changed among versions of the package. That answer also provides further hints about how to deal with such issues. It's not clear why your professor would tell you to "avoid using optimisers." The (restricted) maximum likelihood methods used to solve mixed models require some optimization method to find the solution. There are different choices for the type of optimizer to use and choices for optimizer settings, which are typically hidden within the standard defaults. Your success with bobyqa indicates that you found an optimization that works better than the default. There is nothing wrong with that.
