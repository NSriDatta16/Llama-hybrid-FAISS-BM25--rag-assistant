Yesod is a Haskell web framework for productive development of type-safe, RESTful, high performance web applications. Yesod leverages Haskell's type system to turn runtime bugs into compule-time errors, for example to avoid XSS attacks or character encoding issues. Yesod contains several DSLs for templating ( hamlet for HTML, julius for Javascript, and cassius or lucius for CSS), to store data ( Persistent ), for routing , etc.
