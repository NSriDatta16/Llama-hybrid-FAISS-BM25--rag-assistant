handling drag and drop and context menu events cross-platform in java

I am building a small GUI application where I use drag and drop internally on custom components. Now I want to have context menus on the components which have drag and drop enabled. Now my question is, how do I properly distinguish between these two events. For context menus there is an API function, but for DnD I did not find one. I used mouse down to trigger DnD, but with that for example on Windows context menus stop working because they are triggered on mouse up.
