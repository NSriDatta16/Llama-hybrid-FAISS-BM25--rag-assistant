Gishu - whilst this might seem to be a "generally not to be encouraged practice" Here is one reason you might want to do it: The standard behaviour for text boxes when they get focus is for the caret to be placed at the same position that it was when the control lost focus. If you would prefer throughout your application that when the user tabs to any textbox that the whole content of the textbox was highlighted then adding a simple handler in the resource dictionary would do the trick. Any other reason where you want the default user interaction behaviour to be different from the out of the box behaviour seems like good candidates for a code behind in a resource dictionary. Totally agree that anything which is application functionality specific ought not be in a code behind of a resource dictionary.
