Separate the business logic from the UI and ensure that the UI code takes less than 10% of the total? Separation of concerns is the main goal of TDD, so that's actually a good thing. As far as 90% coverage goes ... well, best course is to review extant literature (I'd focus on Kent Beck and Bob Martin), and I think you'll find support for not following a mindless coverage percentage (in fact, I think Uncle Bob wrote a blog post on this recently).
