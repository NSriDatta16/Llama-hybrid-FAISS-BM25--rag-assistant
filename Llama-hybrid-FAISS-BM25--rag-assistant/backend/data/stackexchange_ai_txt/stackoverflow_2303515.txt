It's because static initialization is a completely different animal than runtime initialization. The initialization of x is—by its nature in your example—dynamic. But it is written as a static initialization. This comes mostly from compatibility with decades of C practice. One way of resolving such a construct is to compiling initialization code for each module which runs before main(), like #pragma startup does in some implementations. But really, how often does the declaration module not know what the initialization values are?
