Thanks for the replies! I myself believe that the marketplace will gain momentum once there are more Android phones on the market, though my biggest fear is that it'll end up like Xbox Live Indie Games were 90% of the games are of below avarage quality, which of course affects it's reputation in the gamer community. One thing I don't understand is why there isn't some kind of pre-approval before letting the application or game onto the market place. I understand that they want the people not the company to decide what should be allowed to be uploaded, but then they could let the users be the reviewers so that there is atleast some quality checks before release.
