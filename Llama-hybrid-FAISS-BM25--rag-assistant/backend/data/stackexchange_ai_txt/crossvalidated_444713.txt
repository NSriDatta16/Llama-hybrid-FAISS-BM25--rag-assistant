Why is my meta analysis OR and 95% CI less precise than my study results?

I am trying to perform a simple weighted average meta analysis of 2 odds ratios from 2 studies (I will be adding more studies when I get the results). However, when I meta analyse using the METAFOR package in R, my combined result is far less precise than both of the actual studies which doesn't make sense to me. Can someone shed some light? The image shows the study results and the output result of the random effects meta analysis (this result doesn't change if I use fixed effects).
