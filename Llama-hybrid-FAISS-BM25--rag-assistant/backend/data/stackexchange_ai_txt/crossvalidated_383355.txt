Binary Loss Function

Currently I am working on Lasso Logistic Regression and in the book by Bulhmann et.al (2011) page 48, it is claimed that the binary loss classification function is given by, $$ \rho(f,y) = log (1+exp(-(-2y-1)f)) $$ where $$ p(x) = (1+e^-2f)^-1$$ Anyone has managed to solve this because I am not able to solve it, I have tried substituting in $$ y'log(p(x))+(1-y')log(1-p(x)))$$ where $$y'=(y+1)/2 $$
