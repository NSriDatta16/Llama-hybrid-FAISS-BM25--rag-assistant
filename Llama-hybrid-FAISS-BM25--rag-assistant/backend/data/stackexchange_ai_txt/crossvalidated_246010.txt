Although it is not specifically on logistic regression, Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis is recommended. Chapters 4-6 cover "Introduction to Generalized Linear Models", "Logistic Regression", and "Building, Checking, and Applying Logistic Regression Models". Previous chapters could also provide some background about discrete distributions and statistical inference that might be helpful to understand models in the subsequent chapters.
