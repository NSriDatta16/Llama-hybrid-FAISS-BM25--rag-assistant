MS SSAS OLAP cube can be used in several storage modes: Relational (OLAP) - the data and metadata stays in your DB and few more materialized views are added. May or may not be faster. Hybrid (HOLAP) - metadata and (pre-calculated) aggregations are stored on a new server running a SSAS instance. This should speed-up all the queries using aggregations, like "total employee hours for last year by month", but queries which drill-through to specific records may be as before. Multi-dimensional OLAP (MOLAP) where all your data plus metadata and aggregations are copied to the SSAS server. This is usually the fastest, but duplicates storage. Before starting this, you should consider optimizing you table layout for reporting and analytics, in other words use a data warehouse (DW) -- put your data in a Kimball star dimension and fact tables. Then you load the DW using ETL(SSIS) periodically and point your reporting and analytics to the DW. It may be that you do not need to use SSAS at all -- SQL queries running against a star table layouts are usually considerably faster than against a normalized DB --operational database. If this is still too slow, build SSAS cubes on top of the DW. Once you start loading your DW, you may be able to remove records form your operational database, making it faster for every-day use. To summarize, my rule-of thumb would be: 1. Build a DW and set your ETL process 2. Try T-SQL reports against the DW, it may be good enough. 3. If still slow, build SSAS cubes (on top of the DW) in HOLAP mode and use MDX to query them.
