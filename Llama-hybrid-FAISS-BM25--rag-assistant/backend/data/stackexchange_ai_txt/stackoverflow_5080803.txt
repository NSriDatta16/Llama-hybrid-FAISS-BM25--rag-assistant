There is of course no magic formula for learning Java, any more than there is of learning any complex highly intellectual skill (don't pay any attention to the fresh young graduates you write "expert level Java" on their resumes). The best way to learn is to give yourself challenging programming projects to do with the new language. However books are a very useful supplement to learning through experience. Your first task should be to work through all the general purpose Java Tutorials , and any of the specialized ones you are interested in. Once you have done that, the most respected general Java book is unquestionably "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch. If you have read and fully digested that then you are well on the way to being able to call yourself a competent Java programmer.
