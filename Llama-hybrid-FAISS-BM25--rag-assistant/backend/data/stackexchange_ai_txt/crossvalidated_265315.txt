There is no fixed standard model in the deep learning. This why there are many different CNN models. Sometimes, The pooling can play some learning role as in Here . I have seen many papers where they apply the activation function or add some bias terms to the pooling layer. The pooling can be average pooling, max pooling, L2-norm pooling or even some other functions that reduce the size of the data. The state of art result on CIFAR 10 here used novel pooling method called Fractional Max-Pooling.
