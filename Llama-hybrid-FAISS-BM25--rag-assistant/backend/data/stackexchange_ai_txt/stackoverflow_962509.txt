There is no CSS only cross-browser solution for that. The relevant properties were first introduced in CSS3 . Some user agents may have already implemented it. For instance, in Webkit you can use the -webkit-marquee* properties . In Gecko, setting -moz-binding: none works as well, though its original purpose is different. Otherwise, hiding all marquee s at all indicates users not to use that element since it's no longer working. Anyway, you can replace all marquee elements in the DOM to span s with JavaScript.
