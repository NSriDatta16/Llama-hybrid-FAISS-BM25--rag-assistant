Get Average Using LINQ

Hoping someone can help me with the LINQ syntax to calculate an average. For example, I have the following LINQ query: var rates = from rating in ctx.Rates where rating.Id == Id select new { UserId = rating.UserId, Rating = rating.Rating }; If 10 records are returned, I need to calculate average on the Rating field. It is defined as as a Double in my DB. I am using LINQ to EF. So I would be assigning the UserId, MiscId, and the Rating would be the average on the records returned. I am passing one object back to the client code.
