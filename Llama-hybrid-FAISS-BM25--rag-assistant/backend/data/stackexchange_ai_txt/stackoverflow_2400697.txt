Capture Touch Event on UITableViewCell and after enter didSelectRowAdTindePath method

I want to personalize my UITableView changing background when user tap on a specific cell. I've a dedicated ViewController for each cell and if I implement touchesBegan method in this viewController i can change my cell background without any problem. The problem is that the method "didSelectRowAtIndexPath" of the UITableView is no longer called. How can I call it manually? I am in another viewController and I have no access to that method. or how can propagate to the touch tableView? Thanks a lot
