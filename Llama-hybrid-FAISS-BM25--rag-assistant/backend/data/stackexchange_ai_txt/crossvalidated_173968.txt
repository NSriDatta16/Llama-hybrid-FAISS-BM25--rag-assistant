Difference between training and test data distribution

The basic assumption in machine learning is training and test data follows same distribution. But in reality this is highly unlikely. Covariate shift address this issue in which training and test distributions are different. Can someone clear the following doubts regarding this ? How to check whether two distribution are different statistically ? Can kernel density estimate (KDE) approach be used to estimate the probability distribution to tell the difference ? Lets say I have 100 images of a specific category. Number of test images is 50. I'm changing the number of training images from 5 to 50 in steps of 5. Can I say the probability distributions are different when using 5 training images and 50 testing images after estimating them by KDE?
