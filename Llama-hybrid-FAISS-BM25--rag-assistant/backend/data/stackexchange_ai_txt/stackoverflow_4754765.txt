I've never done it, but theory and practice say that converting the RGB values in the image and the palette to luminanceâ€“chrominance will help you find the best matches. I'd leave the alpha channel alone, as transparency should have little to nothing to do with the 'looking better' part. This xmass I made some photomosaics for presents using open-source software that matches fragments of the original image to a collection of images. That seems like a harder problem than the one you're trying to solve. One of them programs was metapixel . Lastly, the best option should be to use an existing library to convert the image to a format, like PNG, in which you can control the palette.
