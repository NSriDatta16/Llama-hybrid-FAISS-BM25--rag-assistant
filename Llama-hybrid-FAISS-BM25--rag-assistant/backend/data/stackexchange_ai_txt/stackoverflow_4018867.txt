What would make you try (or not try) a new programming language?

I've been designing a pragmatic programming language for 5 or so years, and it probably won't be released for several more years (probably until after my current and next startups succeed or fail). In the mean time, I have two questions that may prove interesting: 1) What attributes of a new programming language could entice you try it on your next project? 2) What attributes of a new programming language could prevent you from trying it on a project? (i.e. no libraries, ...) To make sure this question isn't a philosophical debate (thus getting closed by admins), please describe your own tool selection predicates, rather than theorize about the broader population's preferences :) Thanks!
