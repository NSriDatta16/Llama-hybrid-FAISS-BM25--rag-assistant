Does Intellisense support xs:key/xs:keyref?

Consider this XML fragment: and an xsd that describes it: ... Now, this almost works, ie. languages in the list are forced to be unique and that 'default' attribute has to refer to one of the languages in the list. I also get Intellisense support for both 'id' and 'default' fields. But I would like Intellisense to propose only languages from the list in xml file for the 'default' field - not all from the availableCultures type (after all they are the only valid ones). How do I do that? Why do I suspect this should be doable? Because when writing the above xsd file Intellisense displayed "mstns:availableCultures" in the drop down list for 'type' attribute of 'xs:attribute' element. What I don't know is whether this can be done using xsd alone or I would need to write some kind of VS package/add-in.
