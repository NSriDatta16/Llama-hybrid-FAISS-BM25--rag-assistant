The biggest difference I see between the communities is that statistics emphasizes inference, whereas machine learning emphasized prediction. When you do statistics, you want to infer the process by which data you have was generated. When you do machine learning, you want to know how you can predict what future data will look like w.r.t. some variable. Of course the two overlap. Knowing how the data was generated will give you some hints about what a good predictor would be, for example. However, one example of the difference is that machine learning has dealt with the p >> n problem (more features/variables than training samples) since its infancy, whereas statistics is just starting to get serious about this problem. Why? Because you can still make good predictions when p >> n, but you can't make very good inferences about what variables are actually important and why.
