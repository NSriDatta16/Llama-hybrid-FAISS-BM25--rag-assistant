How do I interpret a variable that is significant in a multinomial logistic model but not in an ordinal logistic model?

After fitting a multinomial and ordinal logistic models, an interesting results shows up. This is the multinomial logistic regression: And this is the ordinal logistic regression: As you can see, the Female dummy variable is small and insignificant in the ordinal regression while in the multinomial regression the same variable is significant and big. I understand that the ordinal regression has limited the cumulative probabilities to have their own slope. How does the female variance get lost in a model with less variables? Does the constant for the cutoff1 provide any hints?
