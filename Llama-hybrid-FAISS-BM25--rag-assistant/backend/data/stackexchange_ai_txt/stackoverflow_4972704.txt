You know you're in brainy territory when generating XSLT fragments it the "dumb way" :). I would be inclined to store the changes only as a separate XML document and use an XSLT as the reconciliation mechanism, as opposed to storing them as fragments. Simple example: User changes the "title" attribute, and generates this document (internally): test And then you have your standard XSLT which applies all of the existing elements as attribute changes.
