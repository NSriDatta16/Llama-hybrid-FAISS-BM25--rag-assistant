Working with neural networks since two years ago, this is a problem I always have each time I wan't to model a new system. The best approach I've found is the following: Look for similar problems that have also been modeled with feed-forward networks and study their architectures. Begin with that configuration, train the data set and evaluate the test set. Perform pruning in your architecture and compare results in the data set with the previous results. If the accuracy of your model is not affected so you can infer that the original model is overfitting the data. Otherwise, try adding more degrees of freedom (i.e. more layers). The general approach is to try different architectures, compare results and take the best configuration. Experience gives you more intuition in the first architecture guess.
