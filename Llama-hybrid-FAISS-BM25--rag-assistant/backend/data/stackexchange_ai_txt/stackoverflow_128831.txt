Song 1 by Artist 1 WHOA THE ITEM IS BEING DRAGGED!! There are no items in this playlist yet... is my Front end, and in the back end I'm just getting a datatable object and binding it OnLoad of a Non postback... ReorderList1.DataSource = ds.Tables[1]; ReorderList1.DataBind(); Do I need to set the datasource again when the items are reordered?
