Algorithm Recurrence formula

I am reading Algorithms in C++ by Robert Sedgewick. Basic recurrences section it was mentioned as This recurrence arises for a recursive program that loops through the input to eliminate one item Cn = cn-1 + N, for N >=2 with C1 = 1. Cn is about Nsquare/2. Evaluating the sum 1 + 2 +...+ N is elementary. in addition to this following statement is mentioned. " This result - twice the value sought - consists of N terms, each of which sums to N +1 I need help in understanding abouve statement what are N terms here and how each sums to N +1, aslo what does "twice the value sought" means. Thanks for your help
