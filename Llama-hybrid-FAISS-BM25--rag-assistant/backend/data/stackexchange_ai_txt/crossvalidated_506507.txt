I wouldn't really use R2 for NN comparisons. I would instead use the name of the forum and look at your cross validation MSE (you could use cross validation R2 but I would just use the raw MSE) or RMSE. The issue is that you can, with NNs or Random Forests or other non-parametric models, get inflated R2 values. The 'best' NN then is the one which minimizes your average MSE values across all test folds. So I wouldn't say that a model is a 'good' model or not, just that it is the 'best' or most 'useful' of the ones you tried. And even for a linear model, a model with a R2 of .95 is, in my experience, still a 50/50 if it is any better than a model of the same data with an R2 of .9 so I would never really say a model is good based off of it alone.
