try cross-validation on training data, cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fit (prediction error) to correct for the optimistic nature of training error and derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance (eg : k-fold), check accuracy (Precision/recall/f measure) and then use this classifier on test data.
