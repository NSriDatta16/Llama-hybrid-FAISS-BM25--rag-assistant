Mean of the variables in GLS estimation

I have a time series whose regression is as: $$ Y_t^* = \beta_1X_t^* + e_t $$ where $Y_t^* = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$ and $X_t^* =X_t-X_{t-1}$ . So $\hat\beta_1 = $$ \sum(X_t^*- \bar{X}^*)(Y_t^*-\bar{Y}^*)\over \sum(X_t^*- \bar{X}^*)^2$ . What is the value of my $\bar{Y}^*$ and $\bar{X}^*$ in that equation? Is it $0$ since $X_t$ and $X_{t-1}$ share the same observations?
