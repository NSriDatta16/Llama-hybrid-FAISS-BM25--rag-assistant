Here is a JavaScript implementation of Markdown, which (according to the commit comments) adds support for RTL languages, namely Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, Thaana. And it seems trivially easy to add more languages. https://github.com/hasenj/showdown/ It's based on Showdown, http://attacklab.net/showdown . It seems to automatically understand whether or not to render the text from right to left. Consider this code snippet: (from the very first commit at GitHub) var p_tag = " "; var rtl_p_tag = " "; // Check for RTL paragraphs: paragraphs that start with a character // from an RTL script. // RTL scripts are: Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, Thaana // Unicode ranges reference: http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~tomw/java/unicode.html var first_char = str.charCodeAt(str.search(/\S/)); //first non-white-space char if(first_char >= 1424 && first_char Hope this helps, Magnus
