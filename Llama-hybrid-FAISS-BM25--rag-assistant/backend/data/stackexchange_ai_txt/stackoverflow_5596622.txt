Using FragmentTransaction with a DialogFragment

So I've created a DialogFragment that is shown as a dialog via this technique Now that it's launched and upon a user interaction within this popup I want to slide in another fragment to this dialog. I'm trying to do this via FragmentTransaction.add() where I give it the id of one of the containers in this layout. At this point I get: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No view found for id 0x7f09013f for fragment As a quick test, I tried to push it onto a container id not in the dialog but within the main backing activity and that worked just fine. Is there something about DialogFragments and its container ids that does not allow for FragmentTransactions? As a stopgap I've told my transaction to hide the current DialogFragment and show this new fragment, but the animation/display is a little jarring so I'd really like to sort this issue out. Thanks
