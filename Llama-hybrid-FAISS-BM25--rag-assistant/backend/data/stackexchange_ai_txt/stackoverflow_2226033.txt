Not sure what you exactly want to do but I have used Apple's example in the iPhone App Programming Guide (Handling Events in an Annotation View) to implement the draggable pin. It has a partial code but tha may be enough for you to figure it out. Basically, you must subclass the MKAnnnotation and MKPinAnnotationView and in your CustomAnnotationView class you have to implement delegate methods to handle touch events, as shown in the Apple example. There was a bit of filling out or modification needed because the code snippet was not complete, but I have reproduced the behaviour of the pin on the Apple's iPhone Map app exactly (except that I did not implement the right accessory button). In it, the pin feels like it is hovering. So, I suspect that you have no need for the hovering image you have mentioned. I also presume that by providing a BOOL property, you could make the pin draggable or "fixed" programmatically. Does this help?
