is this HTML test for prospective grad assistants too difficult?

I am wondering if the ability to hand-code HTML a rare skill and if the HTML test I give prospective assistants is too difficult? I ask because I work for a university and my department employs graduate assistants to help with the Web site. It's an extremely easy and well-compensated job that involves only rudimentary HTML, SQL, and ColdFusion which is our server-side scripting language. I wouldn't describe any of those languages as particularly challenging to use, yet every semester, I have such trouble finding candidates who can code basic HTML. I give them a very simple HTML exam and hope that at least one will do well enough on it for me to have confidence in their ability, but I'm always dissappointed. I am wondering if my HTML test is too difficult? So below is my test, which I designed specifically to check their HTML skills, not necessarily because it's the best way to render this output. I give the applicants a printout of the HTML test as rendered by a browser. I explain that the image resides in the same folder as the file they are creating, so just use a relative image path. I tell them not to worry about meta tags, not to use font face tags, just let the default system fonts render, and not to worry about matching the colors exactly with hex codes. I also tell them that there's more than one way to render the HTML and to use the simplest, plain HTML 4.0 way, not CSS, XHTML, etc. I'm looking for something along these lines, but variations are acceptable. I am also expecting that it will take anywhere from 10-30 minutes on the outside: EDIT: here is the image that I give them as a printout, with identifying aspects blocked out as I don't want to embarrass any of the applicants who might stumble across this. I also took out the HTML that was here earlier since everyone was so distracted by how terrible it was that the comments on the horror of the HTML were more numerous that those about the difficult of the test: alt text http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh319/_MissViolet_/ebay/HTMLTest2.jpg But I always get back something like this, which is maybe not outrageously wrong, but demonstrates that the applicant does not follow directions, is not neat nor meticulous, and does not produce HTML that I'd consider correct, especially considering it took more than an hour. That seems rather slow for a file that isn't much more than 30 lines of code. This test has never been completed without the candidate asking me if they can use Dreamweaver (no) or look up information on the Internet (yes, after they've failed to do it on their own). These are people who have HTML listed on their resume as a skill, who claim to have created Web sites in the past. So I am wondering if my test is too difficult or if it's just that our CS grad majors aren't very capable? Should I make the test easier, if possible, or just accept that our applicants are not particularly skilled? BTW I am not asking about the correctness of the HTML test itself or whether CSS is a better way to render the same output, just about whether it's too hard for someone who has listed HTML on their resume.
