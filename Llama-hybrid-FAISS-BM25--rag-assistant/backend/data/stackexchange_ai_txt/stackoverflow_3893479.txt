The major issue IMHO here is the length of the documents. I think I would call it phrase classification and there is work going on on this because of the twitter thing. You could bring in additional text performing a web search on the 30 words and then analyzing the top matches. There is a paper about this but I can't find it right now. Then I would try a feature vector approach (tdf-idf as in Jimmy's answer) and a multiclass SVM for classification.
