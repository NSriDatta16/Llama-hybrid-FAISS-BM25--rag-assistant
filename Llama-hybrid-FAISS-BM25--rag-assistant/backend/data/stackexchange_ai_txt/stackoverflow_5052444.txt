I don't have a full answer for you, but this should help immensely: http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/PowerManagement/PowerManagement-211/pmset/pmset.c What you'll want to do is schedule a kIOPMAutoWake . Find that constant (not a variation thereof) in the code and start reading. It's not THAT long. You can probably even use pmset directly, but that would be pretty inelegant. As for elevating, Apple talks about it in Secure Coding Guide .
