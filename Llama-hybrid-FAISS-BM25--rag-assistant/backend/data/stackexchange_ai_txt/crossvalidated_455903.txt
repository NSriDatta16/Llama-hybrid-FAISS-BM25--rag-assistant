Itâ€™s an issue with the particular software, maybe not a bug, but at least a matter of how the software performs, not neural networks themselves. Consider training an MNIST network in Keras. You can have stellar out-of-sample accuracy when you have more than 60,000 $^{\dagger}$ weights, so certainly a neural network model allows for more weights than observations. $^{\dagger}$ There are 60,000 training images in the MNIST data set.
