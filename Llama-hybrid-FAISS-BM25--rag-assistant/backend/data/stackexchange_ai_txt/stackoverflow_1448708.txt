AH! HAL really pises me off. Looks like it caches settings for last inserted medium. So, before I had anything in my burner, output looked like this: $ lshal | grep write_speeds storage.cdrom.write_speeds = {'4234', '2822', '1764', '706'} (string list) After I inserted blank DVD: $ lshal | grep write_speeds storage.cdrom.write_speeds = {'11080', '5540'} (string list) Maybe it helps to someone, HAL #fail
