Lets suppose we can calculate the distance from one noun to another in the following way. Use the Worldnet (which I guess you know), and utilize a function that exists, but you can build it yourself, that counts for how many points of the taxonomy of words you need to get from one word to another (for example from cat to dog you might have 4 but from nail to music you might have 25) Then using this numbers calculated among the nouns of the sentences just invent a metric (for example use simply the average of distance between the nouns, or use the minimum distance between the nouns) that will help you carry on your task.
