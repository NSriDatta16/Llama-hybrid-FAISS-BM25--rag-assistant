plot logistic regression line over heat plot

My data is binary with two linear independent variables. For both predictors, as they get bigger, there are more positive responses. I have plotted the data in a heatplot showing density of positive responses along the two variables. There are the most positive responses in the top right corner and negative responses in the bottom left, with a gradient change visible along both axes. I would like to plot a line on the heatplot showing where a logistic regression model predicts that positive and negative responses are equally likely. (My model is of the form response~predictor1*predictor2+(1|participant) .) My question: How can I figure out the line based on this model at which the positive response rate is 0.5? I tried using predict(), but that works the opposite way; I have to give it values for the factor rather than giving the response rate I want. I also tried using a function that I used before when I had only one predictor ( function(x) ((log(x/(1-x)))-fixef(fit)[1])/fixef(fit)[2] ), but I can only get single values out of that, not a line, and I can only get values for one predictor at a time. I am using R. Edit: I have added a contour plot over the heat plot (using geom_contour in ggplot2), which produces this: I'd like to have a line that actually predicts the cutoff point in a fine-grained way; right now for the independent variables I have stimuli at points 40, 45, 50, etc. but I would like to see a line that predicts, e.g., that when x=32 and y=36 that's the threshold for 50% positive responses. It could be a curve or it could even be a straight line (whose slope might help visualise the relative contributions of the two factors), but I'm not looking for a pure description of the cells which are >50 vs
