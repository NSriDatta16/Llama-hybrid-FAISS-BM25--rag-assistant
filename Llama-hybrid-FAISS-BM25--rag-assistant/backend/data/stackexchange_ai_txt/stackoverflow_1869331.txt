Set a custom subclass of UINavigationBar in UINavigationController programmatically

Does anyone know how can I use my custom subclass of UINavigationBar if I instantiate UINavigationController programmatically (without IB)? Drag a UINavigationController in IB show me an under Navigation Bar and using Identity Inspectory I can change class type and set my own subclass of UINavigationBar but programmatically I can't, navigationBar property of Navigation Controller is readonly... What should I do to customize the navigation bar programmatically? Is IB more "powerful" than "code"? I believed all that can be done in IB could be done also programmatically.
