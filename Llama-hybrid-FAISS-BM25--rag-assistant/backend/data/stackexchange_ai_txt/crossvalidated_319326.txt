Tuning parameters using inflection points

Assume a Machine Learning model has one real hyper-parameter. In many cases the hyper-parameter is chosen to be value at which the curve of a validation measure (MSE,etc) with respect the hyper-parameter has an inflection point, see this for a discussion. Is there any mathematical intuition behind this turning method?
