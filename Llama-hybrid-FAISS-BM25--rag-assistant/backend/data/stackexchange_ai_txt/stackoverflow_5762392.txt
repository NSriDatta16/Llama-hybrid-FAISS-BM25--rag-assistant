Generally it does not make much sense to speak about operations on numbers in one specific base or another. Rather, you decode your numbers to a more useful or generalized representation (e.g. a string of decimal digits) and then perform work, re-encoding your result for storage as necessary. The Math_BigInteger library facilitates this. You will of course still have to first decode your base64 data to a base usable by the class, i.e., binary, decimal, or hexidecimal.
