Twitter and Groupon are basically rich HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications on the front-end. "Rich", because they heavily leverage Ajax and CSS 2 & 3 and are highly interactive (through the use of JavaScript). ASP.NET is a fine choice for powering such a website. Your team will need to be experts at: Cross-browser, cross-device HTML. A social networking site also requires a level of support for low bandwidth users and definite support for different accessibility requirements. A good JavaScript library (or libraries) such as jQuery , YUI , etc. CSS 2 and CSS 3 (and HTML 5 is around the corner). Caching mechanisms for handling high traffic. Asynchronous methodologies (JavaScript is fine) for presenting interactive, dynamic content.
