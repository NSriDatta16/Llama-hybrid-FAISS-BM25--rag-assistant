There are 32 different equally probable outcomes of 5 throws, of which two have absolute value of sum of throws equal to 5, 10 have 3, and 20 have 1, so total sum of all these cases is $5\times2 + 3\times10 + 1\times20 = 60$ . To get average, we need to devide 60 by number of total cases which is 32. $\frac{60}{32} = \frac{15}{8}$ . That is expectation of sums, average is sum divided by 5, so if you want to get expectation of averages, then you divide expectation of sums by 5 and get $\frac{3}{8}$ .
