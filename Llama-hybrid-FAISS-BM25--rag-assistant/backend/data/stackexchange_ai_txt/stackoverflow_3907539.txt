How do I get the div background to change when I mouse over a link - using jQuery?

I need to be able change the position of a background image in a containing div when I mouse over a link within that div. Here is the page : It is the two blue play buttons mid right. I had it working before but it is broken and I can't get it to work properly. Here is the html: Secondary headline goes here to say something you want. This needs to grab their attention. Here is the jQuery: $(".h-video").hover(function() { $(this).closest("div").css({ 'background-position': 'top center' }); }, function() { $(this).closest("div").css({ 'background-position': 'bottom center' }); }); I would appreciate any assistance. Thanks.
