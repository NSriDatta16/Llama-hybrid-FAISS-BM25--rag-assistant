You can write your code for SQL Server and then switch to Devart LinqConnect . For example, you can create a LINQ to SQL model using Entity Developer (in VS integration mode or in standalone mode), then change the connection to the MySQL-specific one and run Update Database from Model wizard (don't forget to select the Regenerate Storage check box). As a result, you will obtain a MySQL database, having structure identical to the SQL Server one.
