PCA is not a clustering method. But sometimes it helps to reveal clusters. Let's assume you have 10-dimensional Normal distributions with mean $0_{10}$ (vector of zeros) and some covariance matrix with 3 directions having bigger variance than others. Applying principal component analysis with 3 components will give you these directions in decreasing order and 'elbow' approach will say to you that this amount of chosen components is right. However, it will be still a cloud of points (1 cluster). Let's assume you have 10 10-dimensional Normal distributions with means $1_{10}$, $2_{10}$, ... $10_{10}$ (means are staying almost on the line) and similar covariance matrices. Applying PCA with only 1 component (after standardization) will give you the direction where you will observe all 10 clusters. Analyzing explained variance ('elbow' approach), you will see that 1 component is enough to describe this data. In the link you show PCA is used only to build some hypotheses regarding the data. The amount of clusters is determined by 'elbow' approach according to the value of within groups sum of squares (not by explained variance). Basically, you repeat K-means algorithm for different amount of clusters and calculate this sum of squares. If the number of clusters equal to the number of data points, then sum of squares equal $0$.
