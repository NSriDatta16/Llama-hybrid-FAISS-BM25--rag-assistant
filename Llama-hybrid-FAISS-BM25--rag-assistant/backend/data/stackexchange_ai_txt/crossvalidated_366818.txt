How to engineer binary vectors (representing store layout) into new variables (for predicting store sales)?

Suppose we want to predict store sales with store layout. The raw data contain a binary vector for each store representing the configuration. For example, when it has a table, a counter, and a shelf, etc., its layout vector is $(1,1,1,...)$. When it only has a counter, the vector will be $(0,1,0,...)$. Adding or deleting different element will impact store sales differently since it alters different aspects of the layout. For example, adding a counter to a store with table $(1,0,...)$ should be different from adding it to one without a table $(0,0,...)$. The question is: How should we engineer the binary vectors for each store into predictors? My starting thoughts are: 1. use PCA to convert the binary vector into the PCA feature scores; 2. construct a distance matrix and run clustering, from which we can calculate the distance between each store's layout and the nearest cluster centroid. Are there other ways and what would be the "best practices" for dealing with this type of problem?
