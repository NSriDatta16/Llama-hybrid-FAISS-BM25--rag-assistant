Feature engineering a license plate price data

Target = price. Suppose I have license plates in the form {letter}-{number}. For example, 'A-12345', or 'K-343' Letter can be any letter from A to Z, and numbers from 2-5 digits long. Here are some of the features I am extracting, but I would like some more ideas. It's common knowledge that plates with more digits tend to be more expensive, So # digits is an obvious feature. Plates with a specific pattern tend to be more expensive, '12345' or '44544' , will be more expensive than '19428'. I am not sure how to capture this. Number of unique digits divided by the number of digits, will probably capture the latter pattern but not the former. I need more ideas basically.
