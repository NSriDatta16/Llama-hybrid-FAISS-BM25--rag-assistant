php function foo(array $arg = NULL) -- why the array and NULL?

I've seen the following a few times lately: function foo(array $arg = NULL) { ... } My question being why make the default of $arg NULL when it will be just cast into an array? Why not do: function foo(array $arg = array()) { ... } I know it doesn't really make much difference--it's mostly just reading code--but why encourage PHP to be changing data types all the time. I've seen this a lot in Kohana.
