You seem to want regular json communication ( dataType is "json" instead of "jsonp" and server_list.php sends json), but you're setting jsonp options. Remove the jsonp and jsonpcallback lines. Setting jsonp to false does not mean you disable it! When these two lines are commented out, everything seems to work fine .
