The data model is suitable for caching, but because you don't have an explicit control of the cache (you can fault a data object but it may remain in the memory), it's recommended to separate very large binary objects. Store them as resources on the filesystem, and manage their links (URLs or paths) in Core Data. Also if you do store large files in Core Data, you should use SQLite storage.
