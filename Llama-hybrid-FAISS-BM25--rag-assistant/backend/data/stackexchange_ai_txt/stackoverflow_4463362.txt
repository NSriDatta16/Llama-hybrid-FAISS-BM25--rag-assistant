How can I guarantee a Dialog will be re-formed after canceled?

I have a dialog that pops up some information on a list, when a long click is performed. The information depends on which list entry the click is performed on. However, I'm noticing that when I view the information, and close it (Via calling it with a dialog.cancel() command), that the next time I open the dialog, it doesn't bother to get the information again, it just pops up the same dialog that I saw before. Any tips for overcoming this problem? Thanks! Some further information. The dialog is generated using a showDialog(int) command. From there, it is called through an onCreateDialog(int) command in a master activity. EDIT: I managed to get this to work by using the removeDialog(int) command in the onClickListener of the Dialog (It just removes itself when it dies). I can't for the life of me find a more elegant solution, but I'd much prefer one. Thanks guys! Edit: NM, realized the answer was already posted here... Thanks again!
