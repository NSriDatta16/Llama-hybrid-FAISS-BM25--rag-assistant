Sending collection of items in ASP.NET MVC

I've got two classes in my MVC project Order and Product . Because Product can be ordered many times and Order can have many products I've got third entity which is OrderedProduct . It joins those two entities in many-to-many relation. Now what I'm trying to do is to let user to make an order by putting products from the drop down list to the box and then to save my order. Also client have to fill some fileds in the Order entity such as Address data etc. All I want is to have it all on one single page. User can add as many items from dropdown as he like, then he can add whole order. To make it easier to visualize look at this picture: Now the problem is how to implement such behaviour in my MVC app. Should I build a ViewModel that combines Order class and list of Product or use partial view for Product classes? Also which is my main problem , how can I (in elegant way) retrieve the full list of chosen products or at least product id's in the controller after POST request? In this case how can I specify that what I'm sending is a collection of ids? It's simple to add one object, but what about whole collection? This is the place when I do not fully understand asp.net MVC, so please give me some bright ideas ;) Greetings to you all, thanks in advice for all your answers!
