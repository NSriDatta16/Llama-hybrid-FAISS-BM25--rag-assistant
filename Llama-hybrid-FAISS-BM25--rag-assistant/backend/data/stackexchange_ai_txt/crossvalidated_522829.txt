What is meant by Low Bias and High Variance of the Model?

I am new in this field of Machine Learning. From what I get by the definition, Bias : It simply represents how far your model parameters are from true parameters of the underlying population. $$ Bias(\hat{\theta}_m) = E(\hat{\theta}_m) − θ$$ where $\hat{\theta}_m$ is our estimator and $\theta$ is the true parameter of the underlying distribution. Variance : Represents how good it generalizes to new instances from the same population. When I say my model has a low bias, it means by model parameters are very similar to the true underlying parameters that generated the population. So it should also generalize well to new instances from the same population. So how it can have a high variance?
