Drupal Views: Render Null Result for Relationship as 0

I have a View configured in Drupal to return nodes, sorting them by their average vote in descending order. For the purpose of the View, the value of the average votes is a Relationship. I noticed that nodes with no votes are displayed after nodes with a negative average. Nodes with no votes should have an average of 0, but I believe the MySQL JOIN is causing NULL values to be returned (as there are no matching rows in the joined table, since a row is created after the first vote is cast for that item). I discovered that with MySQL it is possible to output all values that are NULL in a column as another value with IFNULL(column_name,'other value') . I feel like I would need to modify the Views module in order to obtain this functionality, but I'm hoping that there is some sort of option that returns NULL values in a relation (a relation doesn't exist for the item) as 0 instead of NULL , so that I can properly sort the nodes. The modules I am using include Views, Voting API, Vote Up/Down, and CTools. Thanks.
