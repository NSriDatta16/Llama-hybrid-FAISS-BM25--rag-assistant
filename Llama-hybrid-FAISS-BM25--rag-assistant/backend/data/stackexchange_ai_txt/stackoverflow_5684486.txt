I don't specifically know why PHPUnit won't collect this coverage data for you. It might have something to do with how it uses (or doesn't use) XDebug. You can get around this by using a test coverage tool that has no dependencies on how PHPUNit or XDebug work. Our PHP Test Coverage will collect test coverage on any function in any PHP script it has been told to track, regardless of how that function is executed. It should have no trouble providing coverage data on executions of functions invoked by PHPT.
