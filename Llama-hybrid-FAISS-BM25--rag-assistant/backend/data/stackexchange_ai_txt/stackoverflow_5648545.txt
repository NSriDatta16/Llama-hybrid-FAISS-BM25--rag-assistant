The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium which develops Web standards. The W3C was founded in 1994 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at MIT in collaboration with CERN, with support from DARPA and the European Commission. The W3C is based at a number of host organizations including MIT, ERCIM, Keio University, and Beihang University. Specifications developed by the W3C are released under its Patent Policy . This encourages innovation and adoption of such standards by enabling them to be implemented on a royalty-free basis. A list of all standards and drafts published by the W3C can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/
