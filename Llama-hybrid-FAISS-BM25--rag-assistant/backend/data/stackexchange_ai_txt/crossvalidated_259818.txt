... because logarithmic scale enables us to search a bigger space quickly. In your SVM example, we do not know the range for the hyper-parameter. So, a quicker way is trying dramatically different values, say, 1, 10, 100, 1000, which come from a logarithmic scale. In addition, I think log scale search is the first step. Suppose that we found C=10 is better than C=1 or C=100; then we can focus on that scale to try a better value. Another reason is for "regularization" parameters, such as C in svm. It is not too sensitive. In other words, we may not find too much difference with 10 or 15, or 20, but results would be very different from 10 to 1000. That is why we start with log search.
