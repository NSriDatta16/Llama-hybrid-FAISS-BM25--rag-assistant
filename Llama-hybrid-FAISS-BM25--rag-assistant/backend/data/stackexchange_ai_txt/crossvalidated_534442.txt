Just to make it clear, the procedure given in your first paragraph is train/test split followed by a cross-validation. Nested CV is obtained by looping through the train/test split multiple times. This is to get more stable performance estimates, and it has diminishing returns as the data gets bigger, and may not be worthy of the complexity. But, with small data sets, it can be of paramount importance. You get to use the entire data you have as part the training process (so the inner CV would essentially get to see all the data at some point). Yes, but the main duty of the outer process is to stabilize the performance measurement. Note that, nested CV is sometimes used in hierarchical model selection, e.g. the outer CV loops through the algorithms (random forest, logistic regression etc.) and the inner CV loops through the hyper-parameters.
