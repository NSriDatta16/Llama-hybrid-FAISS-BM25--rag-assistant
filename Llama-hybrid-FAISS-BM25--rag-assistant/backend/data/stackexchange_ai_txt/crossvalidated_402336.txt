Speaking from a professional perspective (not an academic one), and based on having interviewed several candidates and having been interviewed myself many times as well, I would argue that deep or wide knowledge in stats is not considered as a "must know", but having a very solid grasp of the basics (linear regression, hypothesis testing, probability 101, etc..) is essential, as well as some basic knowledge of algorithms (merging/joining tables, dynamic programming, search methods, etc...). I would rather have someone who understands very well how to apply Bayesâ€™ rule and who knows how to unit test a python function, than someone who can give me a fancy explanation of how Bayesian optimization works and has experience with Tensorflow, but doesn't seem to grasp the concept of conditional probability or how to sort an array. Beyond the basics, most good companies or teams will quiz you on what you claim you know , not what they think you should know . If you put SVM on your resume, make sure you truly understand SVM, and have some experience using it. Also, good companies or teams will also test your hands experience more so than the depth of your theoretical knowledge.
