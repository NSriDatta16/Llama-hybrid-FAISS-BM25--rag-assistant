Direct multi-step forecasting an integrated time series from a stationary model

I am new to time series analysis. But I am well versed in data science and machine learning. One thing that confused me was modeling the data. For example, I want to create an LSTM or regression model, I have stationarized all my variables (first-order differences). My dependent variable/target is stationary and I can now predict $t+1$ , but my goal is to predict value $t+8$ with the data at time $t$ with a model $$ \Delta_8 Y_{t+8}\equiv Y_{t+8} - Y_t=\beta X_{1t}+\beta X_{2t}+....+\beta X_{10t} $$ (direct multi-step forecast). My question here is whether it is the right approach to forecast the change between the target variable ( $\Delta_8 Y_{t+8}=Y_{t+8} - Y_t$ ) , i.e. its value now and its value eight hours later? According to time series approaches and theories, does summing differences/deltas cause stationarity, unit root or any other time series related problem?
