Do you need the whole records, or just the IDs? The IDs are easy... var ids = firstQuery.Except(secondQuery); EDIT: Okay, if you can't do that, you'll need something like: var secondQuery = ...; // As you've already got it var query = from or in TblOrganisations where or.OrgType == 2 where !secondQuery.Contains(or.PkOrgID) select ...; Check the SQL it produces, but I think it should do the right thing. Note that there's no point in performing any ordering in the second query - or even the join against TblOrganisations. In other words, you could use: var query = from or in TblOrganisations where or.OrgType == 2 where !LuMetricSites.Select(m => m.FkSiteID).Contains(or.PkOrgID) select ...;
