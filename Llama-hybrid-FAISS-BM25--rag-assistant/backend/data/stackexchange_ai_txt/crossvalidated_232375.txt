Kolmogorov's work on Foundations of Theory of Probability has the section called "Relation to Experimental Data" on p.3. This is what he wrote there: He's showing how one could deduct his Axioms by observing experiments. This is quite a frequentist way of interpreting the probabilities. He has another interesting quote for impossible events (empty sets): So, I think that if you're comfortable with these arguments, then you must admit that you're a frequentist. This label is not exclusive. You can be bi-paradigmous (I made up the word), i.e. both a frequentist and Bayesian. For instance, I become Bayesian when applying stochastic methods to phenomena which are not inherently stochastic. UPDATE As I wrote earlier on CV, Kolmogorov's theory itself is not frequentist per se. It's as compatible with Bayesian view as with frequentist view. He put this cute footnote to the section to make very clear that he's abstaining from philosophy:
