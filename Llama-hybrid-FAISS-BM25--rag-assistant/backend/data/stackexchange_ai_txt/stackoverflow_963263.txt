It's already been mentioned, but I will say it again: jQuery. The strength of jQuery is not just the ability to make a simple AJAX call or the great UI extension library. In my humble opinion, the best part of jQuery is how you can easily handle the return data. jQuery easily allows you to navigate XML just like you can HTML. For instance, say you get back an xml request: (: Borrowed this XML document from a MarkLogic training file :) Barnyard Dance! 1993 Hippos Go Berserk! 1996 jQuery can retrieve all the year elements with this simple command: var years = $("year"); //Ok, lets act on each element instead $("year").each(function(index, value){ alert("Element " + index + " = " + value); }); /* OUTPUT Element 0 = 1993 Element 1 = 1996 /* Try doing that in normal Javascript! Furthermore, the way jQuery is designed is simply beautiful. The founders encourage extending the framework by adding the ability to create extensions into the core of the library (sure you can always just edit the Javascript file, but what happens when there's a critical update to the framework). Another great reason to use jQuery is its compatibility with other Javascript frameworks. By default both Prototype and jQuery use the "$" sign to refer to the main library object. Only jQuery adds the functionality to remove this reference so it can coexist with Prototype. jQuery makes JavaScript enjoyable.
