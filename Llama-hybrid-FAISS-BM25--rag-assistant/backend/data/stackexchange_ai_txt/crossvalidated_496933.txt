1.What is the need/usefulness to have age squared in the regression? When you add an interaction term, you assume that the effect of a variable on the outcome varies accordingly to different levels of another variable. When you add a squared term, you are basically interacting a variable with itself. In this case, that means that the marginal effect (one unit change effect) of age will vary accordingly to different ages. That is, the average effect of a change of age from 18 to 19 on income will be different from the average effect of age when it changes from 35 to 36. So, basically, it is useful to have age squared because usually the effect of age on income varies depending on age itself. This phenomena was first documented by Jacob Mincer in the 1950s , and it is still widespread tested (and often confirmed) in economics and social science. So from a theoretical standpoint, it makes sense total sense to test age as a quadratic term. Of course you should also test for a model without a quadratic term, but probably the model with the quadratic term will have a better fit. 2. Also, is this the easiest/correct way to calculate the diff in earnings from age=35 to age=36? It might be the easiest way, but it is not the right way. The way you calculated might give you a good estimate, but it depends on the convexity of the effect of age. Put it simpler: since you added the interaction term, you assumed that the marginal effect of age varies for different ages. Thus, the $\beta_2$ coefficient represents an average effect of age, that is not the same for all age levels. The correct way of doing such calculation is through the margins command (which you need to run after you ran your regression): margins, at (age = (35(1)36)) You can also see how the marginal effect of age changes across the distribution of age itself. Assuming that age is coded between 18 and 64, you can execute: margins, at (age = (18(1)64)) marginsplot This will also plot the varying effect of age on the dependent variable for different age levels. 3. R squared is higher for the second regression and I'm struggling to understand why? As Jens already answered to you the $R^2$ is dependent on your dependent variable. So if you do some sort of non-linear transformation of your dependent variable, as taking the log of it, your $R^2$ may change.
