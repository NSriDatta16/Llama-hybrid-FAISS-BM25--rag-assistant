AUC depends on random splitting

I have around 1500 data samples, 10-15 features and I am training Logistic Regression for binary classification. Data is not "very clean" and I makes some imputation. I split data into training and validation set. For splitting 80/20, based on simulations, I got AUC 66-67. For splitting 70/30 it becomes worse, like 62-64. What could it be? What is the adequate strategy of splitting?
