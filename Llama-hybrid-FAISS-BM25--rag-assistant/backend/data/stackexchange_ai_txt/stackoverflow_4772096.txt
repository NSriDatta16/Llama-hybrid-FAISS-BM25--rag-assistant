Document storage in phpmyadmin vs website folder?

What is the best way to store documents that saves space? By letting user documents to be stored in phpmyadmin db or by creating folders and letting user upload documents there? I want to allow scans like pdf and images and also word docs and .txt files. Also, how will i go about uploading documents? Any tutorials i can use? New to this. Thanks!
