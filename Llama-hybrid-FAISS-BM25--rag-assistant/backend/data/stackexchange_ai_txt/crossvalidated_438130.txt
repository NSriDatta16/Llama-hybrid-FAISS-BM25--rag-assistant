Although it seems like there is a full factorial design embedded in here, you actually just have seven distinct experimental conditions. Instead of trying to parameterize this with several variables, just use one variable representing experimental condition. Then test your hypotheses using contrasts. For example, if you want to compare low groups to medium conditions, you can compare the average of the low groups to the average of the medium groups (i.e., by taking the average of the corresponding regression coefficients and testing whether the difference of the average differs from zero). You can also specify certain interaction tests using this method. Depending on the software you use, it may be easier to specify this as a oneway ANOVA than as a regression.
