Mod_rewrite rewriting things it's explicitly told not to

I have the following rewrites in my .htaccess: Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On RewriteRule \.(css|jpe?g|gif|png)$ - [L] RewriteRule ^index/error/([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?error=$1 [L] As you can tell, it's supposed to not rewrite any .css/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.png files. Despite that, it's doing so. What's really odd is that the line below it, the one that redirects /index/error/whatever to index.php?error=$1, is working perfectly. Is there something wrong with my regular expression? Is there a better way to do this? TIA. EDIT after many attempts at fixing the problem later: I actually found a different, (in my opinion) more elegant, certainly simpler way to do this. My problem was that my file contained a pointer to my CSS file as href="./css/styles.css". The styles.css file is never, ever going to move. So, I just changed the href element to be an absolute URI ( http://www.mysite.com/css/styles.css ) instead of a relative URI. Problem solved! Thanks to everyone who posted for their help.
