"that works on all browsers" I don't think there is such a thing as ANYTHING "that works on all browsers". But your options would include (as stated above) sIFR, though you'd only want to use that for headlines, at most. More recent browsers can support @font-face css "embedding" of fonts. Some online web services that will allow you to license type for that (either commercial or free fonts) and also make the CSS/JS needed include: http://www.kernest.com http://www.typekit.com and there are others as well. There's also Cufon, which is a javascript based solution.
