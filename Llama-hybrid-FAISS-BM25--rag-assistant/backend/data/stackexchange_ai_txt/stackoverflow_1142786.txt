Default Value Storage

I have the following three tables: Item Code ItemCode (many to many relationship between Item and Code) And then I have the following sample data on the third table: Item | Code -----+----- 001 | A 002 | A 003 | B There's a possibility that a new Item is added but does not have a code yet. I will assign a default code for this Item, say "Z". My question is, which is better: adding an entry in the ItemCode table every time a new Item is created (with the code value to "Z") OR retrieve the default value from configuration file (and keep the ItemCode table clean from default value entries) Additional consideration : the default code will always be returned, regardless whether an Item have been assigned a Code or not. So the result from the above data would be: Code A: Item 001, Item 002 Code B: Item 003 Code Z: Item 001, Item 002, Item 003
