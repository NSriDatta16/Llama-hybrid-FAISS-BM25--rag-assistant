Which machine learning algorithms can be used for trajectory classifications?

I am working on project for clustering of air objects based on their trajectories. Like I would like to train a model on a dataset of different flying object's trajectories so later I can predict what type of object is based on trajectory data. Now trajectory data include 4 things (Altitude, Longitude, Latitude, and Time). So based on set of such dataset we may be able to classify objects like plane, rocket, missile, etc. What I cannot figure out is which algorithms can be used? I first thought about SVM. Later I thought "Long Short Term Memory" can be used. But I am not very sure. And I am new to machine learning. So any help is appreciated.
