Tanenbaum's Structured Computer Organization is a good book about how computers work. You might find it hard to get through the book, but that's mostly due to the subject, not the author. However, I'm not sure I would recommend taking this approach. Understanding how the computer works can certainly be useful, but if you don't really have any programming knowledge, you can't really put your knowledge to good use - and you probably don't need that knowledge yet anyway. You would be better off learning about topics like object-oriented programming and data structures to learn about program design, because unless you're looking at doing embedded programming on very limited systems, you'll find those skills far more useful than knowledge of a computer's inner workings.
