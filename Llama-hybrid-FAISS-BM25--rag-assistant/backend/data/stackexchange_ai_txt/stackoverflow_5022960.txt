Try adding /opt/local/PEAR to your php.ini file include_path. //Before: include_path='.:/usr/lib/php' //After: include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/opt/local/PEAR' You may also need to restart your web server afterwards for the changes to take effect. And as RobertPitt comments, this can also be done at runtime without access to the php.ini file.
