Your equations relate inputs to outputs. Machine learning methods (universal function approximators) do the same and in fact have been used to solve systems of equations. I have seen random forests do the tasks that your words describe. They can be used to rank the value of the inputs in describing the outputs in an ensemble sense. You can then use your judgement to discard some of the less informative values and continue.
