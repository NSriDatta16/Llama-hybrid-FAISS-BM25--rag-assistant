There's a good discussion of information criteria in Gelman et al's BDA 3. If you're proceeding along Bayesian lines, the general solution is to calculate expected predictive log likelihood on holdout data. (This is because the notion of integer number of free parameters breaks down under constraints on the contents of those parameters. We have to instead ask questions like, "how much information does the model itself carry.")
