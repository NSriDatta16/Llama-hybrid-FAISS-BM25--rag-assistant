You can't make a phone call or send an SMS without user interaction on a stock iOS device. You might be able to use some sort of instant messaging service API instead. You can use the AVAudioRecorder class to detect average sound levels. If you want peak levels (and enough signal discrimination to help reject false positives), you will probably have to use a lower level API (Audio Queues) and some DSP code.
