Finding degree of polynomial in regression analysis

I am working on a machine learning project where I am trying to fit a curve on data. Unfortunately the date has somewhat high feature vector. So, I can't really plot them on a 2D or 3D space to guess how the shape of the data looks like. So, other than hit and trial, does there exist a mathematical way to find degree of polynomial that might best fit my data. I mean I do know that I can look into a least square error for each degree and then choose the one with the minimum error, but then it will be a double optimization problem as the first optimization loop would consist in finding a set of weights for the curve that fits the data, while the second loop would be used to check the degree. Any suggestions?
