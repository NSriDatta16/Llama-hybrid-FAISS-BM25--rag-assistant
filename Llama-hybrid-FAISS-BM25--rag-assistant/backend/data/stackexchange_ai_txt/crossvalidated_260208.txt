Benefits of SVM as a tool for digit recognition

I am quite new to digit recognition, and I have noticed that many tutorials use the SVM classification, for example: http://hanzratech.in/2015/02/24/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-opencv-sklearn-and-python.html http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html I would like to know if there are any (domain specific) benefits for that tool, compared to e.g. Deep learning neural networks Classification based on k-means Thank you for any comment. Clarification, why SVM is a wrong tool for digit recognition, will be appreciated, too.
