Prevent delete in Django model

I have a setup like this (simplified for this question): class Employee(models.Model): name = models.CharField(name, unique=True) class Project(models.Model): name = models.CharField(name, unique=True) employees = models.ManyToManyField(Employee) When an Employee is about to get deleted, I want to check whether or not he is connected to any projects. If so, deletion should be impossible. I know about signals and how to work them. I can connect to the pre_delete signal, and make it throw an exception like ValidationError . This prevents deletion but it is not handled gracefully by forms and such. This seems like a situation that other will have run into. I'm hoping someone can point out a more elegant solution.
