Can I turn CONSOLE logging on/off depending on a system variable?

We maintain an application wide system variable [debug=true|false], I want to disable all CONSOLE appenders in log4j upon startup when the system variable debug is false. Is the best way just a programatic scan of the appenders? Or is there a more elegant approach that I don't know about perhaps? Any primer on scanning the appenders would be welcome also if that's the right approach.
