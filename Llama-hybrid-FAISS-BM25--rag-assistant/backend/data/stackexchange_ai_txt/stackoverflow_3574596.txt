Does it not show the Default.png at all, or just after a short period of time ? Not at all: Try setting a new Default.png in the Organizer After short time: When hitting build and run your app needs some time to start up, because the debugger is linking itself to your app, this causes a delay of a couple of seconds where your default.png is not displayed.
