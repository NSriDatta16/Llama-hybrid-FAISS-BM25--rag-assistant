I don't see how the question in your example is sensible. The slope of the values is the slope of the values. Using a logistic link function then you get the slope of the logit of the values. There's no under or overestimating. The more interesting case in your (our) field is that of interactions in accuracy. You might want to read Dixon (2008) as one of the more recent papers on this problem. It also addresses many of your fundamental concerns. In general, in cognitive and perceptual psychology a logit link function is better than any other standard link. If you want to know the true effects of your independent variables, (i.e. whether they interact or are additive, whether they are linear or curvilinear) then you would need to know better the true underlying model. Since you probably don't know that logistic regression is probably better than almost anything else and vastly better than just analyzing meaned accuracy scores. The primary consequence of doing this is contradicting other findings where mean accuracy scores were put into an ANOVA or regression. * EDIT* Now that you've added some data it looks like you're trying to model a floor effect that shouldn't be there. At some point the task becomes impossible. It looks like that already happened at your level 4 difficulty. Modelling level 5 is useless. What if you had a level 6 or 7 difficulty? It looks like a logistic will fit points 1-4 pretty well. And, you should be looking at residuals to assess fit, not just the curves overlaid.
