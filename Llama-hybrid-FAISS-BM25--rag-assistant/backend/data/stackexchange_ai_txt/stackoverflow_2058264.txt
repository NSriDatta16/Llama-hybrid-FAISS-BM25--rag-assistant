Excel spreadsheet like library in Swing (=improved JTable)

I'm searching for a free, open-source if possible, Java swing library that improves the existent JTable (which is very simple). I want to do an application with a spreadsheet similar to Excel one. Without the formula but with copy/paste functionalities (multiple paste if multiple selection), column reorganizing, etc... I've found some, like JGrid (Jeppers) but is to simple. Or KTable, NatTable, NebulaGrid but they are for SWT :(. QuickTable seems cool but the free version has an advertisement text display above the grid...
