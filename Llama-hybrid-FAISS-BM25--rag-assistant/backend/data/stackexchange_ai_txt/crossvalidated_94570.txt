Is segmented (piecewise) regression possible with a dichotomous dependent variable?

I have created a model of American cities with a dichotomous Y variable using logistic regression. I have theoretical reasons to believe that the model will differ significantly between larger and smaller cities. I have shown this using arbitrary breakpoints, but wanted to know if a segmented (piecewise) regression strategy can identify a breakpoint for me in a model with a binary dependent variable. (I have used the "nl" command successfully in Stata for a different project when the Y was continuous.) Can I use this strategy to statistically identify a breakpoint? Or should I build the case for a number I pick otherwise? Many thanks.
