How to choose similarity measurement between sentences and paragraphs

Problems 1. How to find appropriate measurement method There are several ways to measure sentence similarities, but I have no idea how to find appropriate method among them for my data (sentences).

Sentence or paragraph based If it is possible to acquire both one sentence and a paragraph which includes the sentence, which is more accurate to measure the similarity among sentences or paragraphs? What I tried so far 1. I've tried to use one of the libraries to measure the similarity. However, I'm struggling how to find more accurate method to measure similarities. original = 'New York is a noisy city where hamburgers are famous.' test = ['Berlin is a nostalgic city where sausages are famous.', 'Both New York and Belin are noisy cities, but hamburgers are famous in New York rather than in Berlin.'] import spacy nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") doc1 = nlp(original) for doc2 in test: doc2 = nlp(doc2) print(doc1.similarity(doc2)) 0.8682034221008 0.5078180005337849 Same as sentence based, it was figured out there are several methods to measure the similarity between paragraphs. But there is no crew which is better (generally high-peformance) to compare sentence or paragraph base. Related Question on Stack overflow: How to compute the similarity between two text documents?
