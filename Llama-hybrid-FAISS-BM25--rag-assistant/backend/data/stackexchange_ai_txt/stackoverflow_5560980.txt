Linq-to-SQL fails to reflect changes in one stored procedure

I exposed several stored procedures via linq-to-SQL. After some time I realized I needed one more column returned by those procedures, so I changed the procedures, deleted them in the design pad, and dragged again. I do see the new column exposed in all my procedures except one - its helper class did not change at all. When I execute that stored procedure directly, I do see the new column. What am I missing? Closing and reopening VS did not help. Cleaning the solution did not help either. The only workaround that actually worked was to rename the procedure. Is this a bug in linq-to-sql or am i missing something? TIA
