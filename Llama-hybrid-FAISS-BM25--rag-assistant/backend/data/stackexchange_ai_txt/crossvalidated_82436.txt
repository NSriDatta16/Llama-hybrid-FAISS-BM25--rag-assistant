What type of regression to use with 1 to 10 scale dependent variable?

I am a bit new to analytics. I have this survey dataset with the attributes below. Independent variable: a. Are we trustworthy? (Value: 1 to 10) b. Do we offer solutions that you need (Value: 1 to 10) c. Are we proactive (Value: 1 to 10) d. Do we provides consistent quality of service (Value: 1 to 10) e. Do we provide exceptional service (Value: 1 to 10) Dependent variable: How likely you will recommend us to others? (Value: 1 to 10) Here I want to do a regression between the DV and IV. Previously I have done logistic regression in R language for binomial outcomes and continuous IVs. But this scenario consists of entirely ordinal data. How can I regress this data and find some relationship? Please share your ideas on useful techniques to solve this. Apart from regression, is there any another method?
