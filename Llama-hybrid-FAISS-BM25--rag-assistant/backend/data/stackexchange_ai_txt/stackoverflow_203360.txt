I stumbled across JcReport today, which I think does exactly what you are looking for. At least, it handles the reports in a combined way; suppressions are still tool-specific. This tool claims to support automatically integrating the output of PMD, CPD, FindBugs, CheckStyle, and Cobertura into a single HTML report. I haven't tried it yet, but definitely intend to soon.
