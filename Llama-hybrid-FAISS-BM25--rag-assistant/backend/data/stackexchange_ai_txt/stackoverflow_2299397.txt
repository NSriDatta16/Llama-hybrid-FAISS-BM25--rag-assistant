How to get the currently focused menu item ID?

I want to display info when my mouse cursor is on an item in my menu by using SendMessage() to my statusbar. How do i get the current menu item ID ? I suppose they use same ID's as my Visual Studio shows in the menu editor. I found these on msdn but none of them seems to serve my needs: WM_COMMAND WM_CONTEXTMENU WM_ENTERMENULOOP WM_EXITMENULOOP WM_GETTITLEBARINFOEX WM_MENUCOMMAND WM_MENUDRAG WM_MENUGETOBJECT WM_MENURBUTTONUP WM_NEXTMENU WM_UNINITMENUPOPUP
