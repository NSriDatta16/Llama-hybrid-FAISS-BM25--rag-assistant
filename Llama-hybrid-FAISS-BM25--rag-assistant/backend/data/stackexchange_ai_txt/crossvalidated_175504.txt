How to do data augmentation and train-validate split?

I am doing image classification using machine learning. Suppose I have some training data (images) and will split the data into training and validation sets. And I also want to augment the data (produce new images from the original ones) by random rotations and noise injection. The augmentaion is done offline. Which is the correct way to do data augmentation? First split the data into training and validation sets, then do data augmentation on both training and validation sets. First split the data into training and validation sets, then do data augmentation only on the training set. First do data augmentation on the data, then split the data into training and validation set.
