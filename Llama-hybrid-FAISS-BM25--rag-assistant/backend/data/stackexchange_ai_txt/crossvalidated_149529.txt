The predict() and fitted() methods for tobit objects compute the estimates for the latent mean $\mu = E[y^*] = x^\top \beta$. Additionally, the scale parameter $\sigma$ is available as $scale in the objects: mu The probability of a non-zero observation is then $P(y > 0) = \Phi(\mu/\sigma)$, i.e.: p0 The conditional expectation of the censored $y$ given that it is non-zero is $E[y | y > 0] = \mu + \sigma \cdot \lambda(\mu/\sigma)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the inverse Mills ratio $\lambda(x) = \phi(x)/\Phi(x)$: lambda Finally, the unconditional expectation is $E[y] = P(y > 0) \cdot E[y | y > 0]$, i.e.: ey If you want to visualize everything together in a time series style plot: plot(y, ylim = my.range) lines(mu, col = "slategray") lines(y.star, col = "black") lines(ey0, col = "green") lines(ey, col = "blue") The reason that the predict() method for tobit objects does not provide all of this automatically is that for all the distributions other than the normal / Gaussian, the relationship is not that easy. But maybe we should at least support the normal case.
