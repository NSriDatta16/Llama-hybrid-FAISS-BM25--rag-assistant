//Please explain the follwing set of line var func = tool[ev.type]; // Set func to the tool object's member // named 'event.type' // Will set func to undefined if no function is // found in the tool object if (func) { // if a func was found then call it. func(ev); } Note that the tool hash object is being used to hold function references, not scalars such as 1, "a string", etc. A feature of Javascript is that you can create, save, pass functions at runtime. Added Thank you @Chris Morgan for pointing out that an_obj['unknown_key'] == undefined, not null. Also note that foo['a_key'] is the runtime way of saying foo.a_key -- the 'a_key' member of the object 'foo'. And finally, Javascript does not have hashes. It has objects which work reasonably well as the Hash type found in other languages. Added some more (after looking at all of the code, not just the part in question). The code is creating an object tool . It has a number of members: started flag mousedown , mouseup and mousemove functions The snippet of code is trying to locate the function that matches the event's type. So in this case, the object tool is being used as an object, not as a hash. I've updated the first part of the answer appropriately.
