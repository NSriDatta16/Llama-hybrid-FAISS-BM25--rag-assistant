Okay, this can be resolved in numerous ways. First of all, I would suggest that you save the file to a *.txt, to have some plain text to parse. Then, your friend will have to be really consistent during the writing, because what you will create, (text parser) will need consistency. Make some rules like : Title on first line, then 2 linebreaks; All the paragraphs separated with 1 linebreak; Then 3 linebreaks after the last paragraph; After that, load the file, and parse it using the rules above. {enjoy}
