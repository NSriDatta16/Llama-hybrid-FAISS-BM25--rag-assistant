get_dump() leaf value and AUC

I have used Xgboost fitted a model with AUC around 0.73 and I printed out my last booster: booster[599]: 0:[userkn_hometypecnt If I am right, the leaf value is the value of logodds and it can be changed into a probability with the sigmoid function. However in the last booster all the leaf values changed to around 0.5 probability. Which means all the samples will be marked as good/bad cases half and half? So it's no difference with a random guess at a binary classification? Am I right or any other opinions are quite appreciated!
