ARMA model selection: in-sample vs. out-sample accuracy measures

I have a time series for 1000 days for many firms. I am interested to know, in general, on what basis I should select an ARMA model (the nature of my problem restricts integration order to 0). Should it be based on a predictive measure (e.g. MAE, RMSE) or AIC/BIC (measures of the closeness of a model to the unknown data generation process)?
