Infinitesimal generator

I have been studying continuous time markov chains through Dobrow's book. Everything went fine until the author introduced the concept of infinitesimal generator, which he refers to as $\textbf{Q}$ . More specifically, i cannot figure out a statement regarding the diagonal entries of $\textbf{Q}$ , which is derived as shown below: $$ Q_{i i}=P_{i i}^{\prime}(0)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0^{+}} \frac{P_{i i}(h)-P_{i i}(0)}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0^{+}} \frac{P_{i i}(h)-1}{h} $$ which equals (this is where i got stuck) $$\lim _{h \rightarrow 0^{+}}-\frac{\sum_{j \neq i} P_{i j}(h)}{h}$$ Why does the $\text{-}$ (minus) sign appears in the last equality? Why does $$\lim _{h \rightarrow 0^{+}} \frac{P_{i i}(h)-1}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0^{+}}-\frac{\sum_{j \neq i} P_{i j}(h)}{h}$$ I don't get where the summation comes from. Furthermore, $\textbf{P}(t)$ is the transition function with respect to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) Finally, $$ P_{i j}(t)=P\left(X_{t}=j \mid X_{0}=i\right) $$ Note: $$ P_{i j}(0)=\left\{\begin{array}{l} 1, \text { if } i=j \\ 0, \text { if } i \neq j \end{array}\right. $$ Can someone help? I am really struggling. Thanks in advance, Lucas
