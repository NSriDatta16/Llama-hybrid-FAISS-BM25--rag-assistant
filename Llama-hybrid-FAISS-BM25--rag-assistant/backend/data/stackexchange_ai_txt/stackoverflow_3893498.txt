IMO, as of right now with the current functionality available in databases, the file system is the better choice. The file system has no limit on the size of the files and with content this could easily be files larger than 2 GB. It makes the database size much smaller which means less pressure on memory. You can design your system to use UNCs and NASs or even cloud storage where as you cannot do this with FILESTREAM. The biggest downside with using the file system is the potential for orphaning files and keeping the database information on files in sync with the actual files on disk. Admittedly, this is a huge issue but until solutions like FILESTREAM are more flexible, it is the price you have to pay.
