In regression, what is the limit of independent variables?

After having taken the Coursera Data Science specialization, I am faced with my first "practical" problem which I plan on solving with some sort of regression. This is my first real world, business-problem application of what I've learned. The plan is to predict customer attrition for our hotel/hospitality client by analyzing reservations (and the rate codes, room types, promotions, applied to the stays) and Recency, Frequency, Monetary-type values. The way I understand it, I would set up my training data set for logistic regression (to predict the probability of attrition), and each independent variable needs to be continuous. So in the case that my independent variables are nominal in nature I would pivot those nominal values to be a series of columns with a value of either "0" or "1". For example if I had three customers who made reservations with promo codes "FUN" "FAM" and "WKND" respectively, my training data set would look like 3 records with three additional columns, something like: "FUN_USED" , "FAM_USED" and "WKND_USED" Is this a correct way of thinking? My concern is that if I need to pivot these independent variables to columns I could easily end up with hundreds of variables from which I build my prediction function. Thanks for the help - I'm sure I violated some codes of conduct here, so please correct me where I've gone astray.
