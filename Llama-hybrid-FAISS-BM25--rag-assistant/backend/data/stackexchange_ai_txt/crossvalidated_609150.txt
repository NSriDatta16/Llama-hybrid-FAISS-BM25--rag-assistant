That is a bad idea If you use parameter estimates from your data to form your "prior" then it is not really a genuine prior distribution, since it formed using the data. This then leads to violation of Bayes' rule in the updating process, and means you are not using a genuine Bayesian model. Such a method will typically "bias" the inference by "double-counting" the data --- i.e., using it once to form the prior and then again to update from the prior to the posterior. In particular, use of this method will mean that you are exaggerating your effective sample size by double-counting the data.
