There is no "best" template. Window-based is the most basic, while View-based starts you out with a view and a view controller. I'm with Shaggy Frog on renaming xib files to not have "controller" in the name. However, I like to create groups to logically separate functionality, and in those groups I place view controller code along with the xib files those view controllers use. Then you know what belongs with what. I also like a create a top-level "Application" group into which I put the app delegate, main xib file (if any), pch file, info.plist, app icon, Default.png and other things related just to the application so they are all easy to find - after you add a number of files each of those things can get lost in giant lists of stuff. Basically organize things so you can find them, a structure that makes sense to you might not to someone else.
