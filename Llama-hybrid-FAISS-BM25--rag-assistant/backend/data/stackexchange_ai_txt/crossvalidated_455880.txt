how to model data with repeated measures but a low number of random-effect levels

I want to model the productivity of a beech forest in relation to satellite-based indices of photosynthetic activity and meteorological variables. I have data for five years on the number of seeds collected in 30 plots of one square meter. The plots are distributed in three sampling areas: 10 plots per location. My predictor variables are repeated in the 10 plots within each sampling area. I know that is advised to have >5â€“6 random-effect levels per random effect in order to build a mixed model. So in my case running a mixed model does not seem adequate. An alternative approach can be to average away the pseudoreplication within each sampling area and carry out my statistical analysis on the means. Yet, I am afraid that the averaged values may not be independent between sampling areas because most variables (dependent and independent) are synchronized (e.g., the temperature does not vary much from one valley to the next one) What type of analysis should I run? Is my sample size too little to run any statistical analysis? Thank you very much! PS: please find below the structure of my data frame 'data.frame': 150 obs. of 8 variables: $ sampling_site: Factor w/ 3 levels "A","B","C": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ year : Factor w/ 5 levels "2013","2014",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ plot : Factor w/ 30 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... $ Ncounts : int 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Nseeds_sum : int 286 139 66 129 68 109 101 230 32 NA ... $ temp : num 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 ... $ prep : num 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 ... $ evi : num 0.161 0.161 0.161 0.161 0.161 ...
