When do we calculate the population parameter instead of sample statistics?

When do we calculate the population parameter instead of sample statistics? If there is a this kind of case which statistical tool should we use population parameter or sample statistics? A car company wants to know the average age of cars of their brand that are still on the road. How would you define the appropriate population? Will the car company calculate a population parameter or sample statistic? Why?
