magento sales_order_place_after observer

I'm trying to write an observer that will export order data when an order is placed. I haven't written any modules before. Basing my implementation on this article: http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/0_-_module_development_in_magento/customizing_magento_using_event-observer_method so far I'm just trying to trigger some dummy code to write to a file. I'm not getting anything showing in my log, and the file's not being modified. The apache user has permission for the directory. I've disabled configuration caching in the Magento settings. I'm a little confused on some of the naming conventions; I just tried to follow the example. Anyone know where I'm going wrong? in magento/app/etc/modules/Feed.xml: local true in magento/app/code/local/Feed/Sales/etc/config.xml: Feed_Sales_Model singleton sales/order_observer export_new_order in magento/app/code/local/Feed/Sales/Model/Order/Observer.php: Magento 1.4 on Debian Lenny with Apache2 if it should matter for any reason.
