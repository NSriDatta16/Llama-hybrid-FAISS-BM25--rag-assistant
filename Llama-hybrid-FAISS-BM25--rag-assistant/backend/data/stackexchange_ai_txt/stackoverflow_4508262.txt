The option is run through a filter that replaces HTML entities, so even if you were to run a filter on that option(which is possible), WordPress replaces the HTML entities, meaning HTML wouldn't work... For example, add this code and watch what happens. add_filter( 'option_blogdescription', 'html_blog_description' ); function html_blog_description( $option_value ) { $option_value = ' Test text '. $option_value; return $option_value; } There aren't any hooks i can see that specifically deal with this option and convert the entities, else i'd have ideas about unhooking that action from the description. I think the only solution you really have is to run str_replace over your calls to fecth the blog description. This would mean updating all your calls for bloginfo( 'description' ) with a rountine that performs string replacement on the content. eg. $description = str_replace(' web ',' web ',get_bloginfo('description')); echo $description; Sure it's not ideal, but i can't currently see a more elegant way(though i'd be happy for someone to prove me wrong).
