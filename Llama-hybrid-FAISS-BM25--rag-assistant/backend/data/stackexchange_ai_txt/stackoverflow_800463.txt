C# Create a hash for a byte array or image

Possible Duplicate: How do I generate a hashcode from a byte array in c# In C#, I need to create a Hash of an image to ensure it is unique in storage. I can easily convert it to a byte array, but unsure how to proceed from there. Are there any classes in the .NET framework that can assist me, or is anyone aware of some efficient algorithms to create such a unique hash?
