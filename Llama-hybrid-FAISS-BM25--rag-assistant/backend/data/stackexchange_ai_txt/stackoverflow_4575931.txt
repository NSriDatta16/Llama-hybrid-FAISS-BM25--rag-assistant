Save list of CGPoints using NSUserDefaults

I have a bunch of CGPoints from a CCTMXLayer I want to save to NSUserDefaults but cannot seem to figure out an elegant way of doing so. Originally I was hoping to save an NSDictionary with an NSMutableSet for a value containing several NSValues (valueWithCGPoint). From what I can tell neither NSMutableSet or NSValue is supported by NSUserDefaults. At this point I am considering saving the x&y values of the CGPoint as a string and just converting it back and forth as needed.
