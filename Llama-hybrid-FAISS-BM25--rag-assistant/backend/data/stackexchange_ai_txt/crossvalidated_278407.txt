Approaching a multivariate regression problem with multiple observations over days

Assume for every $Y_{n*1}$, there is a covariate matrix $X_{n*p}$. The goal is to predict $Y'_{n*1}$ when new $X'_{n*p}$ becomes available. What complicates the matter is that I have $k$, let's say 20, examples of such $X,Y$ pairs in my training data set. If there was only 1, then I could do a Principal components regression, or Random forest, etc. But I am having a hard time understanding how to approach this problem. If I concatenate them, I would get $X_{(k*n)*p}$ and $Y_{(k*n)*1}$, but this won't be useful for predicting $Y'$ when new $X'_{n*p}$ becomes available. Ideally, I would like to reduce $X_{n*p}$ to a lower dimension, and use the resultant for regression.
