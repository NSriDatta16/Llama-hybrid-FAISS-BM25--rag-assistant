You can do: TMonitor.Enter(fMemberTable); try // Do your stuff finally TMonitor.Exit(fMemberTable); end; Please note this is a SPIN LOCK, not a true critical section. Very practical if you're not going to have a lot of collisions, but if threads block each other regularly, you might want to fall back to the critical section. The spin lock is, by definition, a busy-wait lock. but I'm not sure what version of Delphi introduced this and you don't have version-specific tags.
