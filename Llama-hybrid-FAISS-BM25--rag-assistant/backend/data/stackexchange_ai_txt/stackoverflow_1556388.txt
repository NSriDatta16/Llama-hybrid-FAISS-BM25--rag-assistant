The display of those two HTML fragments look identical to me on iPhone Safari (also iPhone OS 3.1.2). Is there any CSS being applied to SPAN tags? [Edit: I see the difference now; you won't see any difference if both examples are on the same page.] [Added:] By explicitly setting the size, it appears you can get consistent text size between the two. For example: div, p, span { font-size: 24px; }
