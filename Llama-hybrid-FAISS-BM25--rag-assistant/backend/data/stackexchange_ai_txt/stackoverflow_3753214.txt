Why do you need a FiscalYears table? If your organization's fiscal years always start on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30, you can use a function to determine the fiscal year for a given date. Public Function Fy(ByVal pDate As Date) As Integer Dim intYear As Integer Dim intReturn As Integer intYear = Year(pDate) If pDate > DateSerial(intYear, 9, 30) Then intReturn = intYear + 1 Else intReturn = intYear End If Fy = intReturn End Function And simple functions to return the Start and End dates for a given year. Public Function FyStart(ByVal pYear As Integer) As Date FyStart = DateSerial(pYear - 1, 10, 1) End Function Public Function FyEnd(ByVal pYear As Integer) As Date FyEnd = DateSerial(pYear, 9, 30) End Function You can then determine how many fiscal years are included in a given date range by: Fy(EndDate) - Fy(StartDate) But I may be totally off base because you said "Start Date = 6/30/2009 And End Date 10/2/2010" spans two years. However, this expression returns 2 (3 years): Fy(#10/2/2010#) - Fy(#6/30/2009#)
