How to handle certain types of anomalies in the input when using CNN

I am trying to perform binary prediction in a problem where the measurements come from objects that are spatially ordered as a grid and there is a physical meaning to the neighborhood on the grid. I thought to use convolutional networks and use a topology that reminds pixel segmentation where each object is like a pixel (i.e. that gives a label per object at the output). each type of measurement will be a distinct feature map My questions are regarding how to handle the input features: - assume the measurements are in the range [0,10] . - The grid of object is not a rectangle. need to pad it. what's the most proper value to put on the margins ? - Some of the measurements are missing. is there a common practice on how to fill in the missing data in this case ? - Some of the measurements include outlier values (e.g. close to 100). what's the best way to handle outliers in this case ? I would eventually want to use CNN so looking for most appropriate pre-processing techniques to handle the above for that model.
