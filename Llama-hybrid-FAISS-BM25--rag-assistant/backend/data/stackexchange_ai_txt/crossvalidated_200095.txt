Machine Learning- apply on Time Series Analysis with multidimensional features

I am trying to make predictions on weather forecast (which is a time series analysis problem) with multiple features on each time unit (say temperature, humidity, etc). So my data become like this: Day 1- temp(1), humidity(1) Day 2- temp(2), humidity(2) Day 3- temp(3), humidity(3) If I want to arrange each row vector as individual training example, how should I arrange the order of data? Would it be the following? temp(1), humidity(1), temp(2), humidity(2), temp(3), humidity(3) It seems not quite right intuitively. I have been thinking of using recurrent neural network such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines but it seems to be too difficult for me to implement. (I am using Neuroph with Java which is easier for me as I am not very familiar with programming).
