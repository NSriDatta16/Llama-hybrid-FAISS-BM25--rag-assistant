The units on the rate, say $\lambda$, should be messages per hour. First, do you have the right units? Trivially, $$\frac{22 \text{ messages}}{5 \text{ hours}}=\frac{22}{5} \text{ messages/hour}$$ Next, your $\lambda$ should be the average number of messages per hour. With a little thought on how an average is calculated, you should be feeling pretty decent.
