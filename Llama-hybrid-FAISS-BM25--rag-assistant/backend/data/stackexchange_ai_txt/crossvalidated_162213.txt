Calculating new averages

I'm studying for a midterm in my basic stats course and came across a question that I'm confused with how it's solved. A manager at a local gas bar has 13 staff members. The average hourly wage for the employees is $10.55 per hour. One experienced employee, who was making $12.50 per hour, quit because they were offered a better job. They were replaced with two employees, each getting a starting wage of $9.00 per hour. What is the new average hourly wage for the employees at the gas bar? The way I attempted to solve this was: $\frac{(12*10.55) - 12.5 + (9*2)}{13} = \$10.16$ However it's not one of the possible choices: (A) $10.97 (B) $10.19 (C) $10.28 (D) $10.82 (E) $10.68 Can anyone point out what I did incorrectly? As pointed out in the answers section I miss calculated N. The formula should be: $\frac{(13*10.55)-12.5+(9*2)}{14} = \$10.19$
