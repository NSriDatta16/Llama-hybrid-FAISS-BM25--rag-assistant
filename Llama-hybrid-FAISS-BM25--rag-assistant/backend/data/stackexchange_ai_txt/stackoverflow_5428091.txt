Are you using an mdpi screen? If so then your device is having to take the drawables from drawables-hdpi and scale them down, which would likely cause them to blur. You might try also copying the -mdpi resources to your drawable-mdpi folder, which would allow the framework use your drawables without adjusting for screen density. Edit - now that I think about it, I'm not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screen had a greater dpi than hdpi.
