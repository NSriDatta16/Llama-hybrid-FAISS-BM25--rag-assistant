Visual Studio is already perfectly capable of doing that; just drag the "Edit.GoToFindCombo" to the toolbar, if it's not already there. (Press Ctrl+D if it is, to activate) and type ">of s" for all files starting with the letter 's'. (source: aaronlerch.com ) The GoToFindCombo is more powerful than this though, you can set aliases ">alias $aliasHere $SomeCommand" for virtually every command in Visual Studio. For example, to make an alias for find in files you type ">alias ff Edit.FindinFiles"
