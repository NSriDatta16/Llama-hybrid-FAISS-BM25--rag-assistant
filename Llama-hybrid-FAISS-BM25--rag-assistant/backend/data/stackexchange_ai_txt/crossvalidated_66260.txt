Even if you include it, it's irrelevant. It would cancel out between the numerator and denominator when you apply Bayes' theorem and you'd be left with the same posterior equation given in the paper. I haven't read into this enough to determine whether the multinomial is really necessary in this likelihood function, but it's pretty common practice for Bayesians to ignore scaling terms like this since they cancel out anyway. To demonstrate, consider the following model: Prior: $p(\theta_i)$ Likelihood: $k*p(X|\theta_i)$ (where $k$ is a scaling term made explicit for this demonstration) Then applying Bayes rule gives: \begin{equation} \begin{split} p(\theta_i|X)& = \frac{k*p(X|\theta_i)p(\theta_i)}{ \sum_{\theta} k*p(X|\theta)p(\theta) } \\ & = \frac{k*p(X|\theta_i)p(\theta_i)}{ k*\sum_{\theta} p(X|\theta)p(\theta) } \\ & = \frac{p(X|\theta_i)p(\theta_i)}{\sum_{\theta} p(X|\theta)p(\theta) } \end{split} \end{equation}
