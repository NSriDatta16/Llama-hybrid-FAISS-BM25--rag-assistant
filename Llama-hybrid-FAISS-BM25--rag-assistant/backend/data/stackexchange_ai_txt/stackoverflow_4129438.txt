GCC is going to have the best support of the choices you've listed for the simple reason that it comes standard in GNU and is the target of Linux. It's very unlikely any organization would use the other three beyond possibly supporting some horrible legacy application. Other C compilers you might look into include: Clang : an up-and-comer, particularly for BSD and Mac OS X Visual Studio Express : for Windows programming Intel Compiler Suite : very high performance; costs money Portland Group : another high-performance commercial compiler; used typically for supercomputers PathScale : yet another commercial high-performance compiler
