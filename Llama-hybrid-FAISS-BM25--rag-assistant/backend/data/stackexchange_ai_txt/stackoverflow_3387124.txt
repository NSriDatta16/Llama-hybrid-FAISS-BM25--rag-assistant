I suggest you have a look at the Yii Framework . It is very well-designed and was written with performance in mind. They've heavily focused on optimising their code for use in combination with an opcode cache like APC - no other framework has shown the same level of performance improvement when used with APC. Outside of performance, the framework also offers lots of built-in support for security (secure sessions with HMAC, SQL injection prevention, XSS prevention, etc.), forms, user input validation, caching, authentication/access control, and JQuery integration. If you're an intermediate PHP programmer who is not experienced/confident enough to build your own framework, then Yii is a really good place to start as the code is very elegant and imho the programmer made some great design choices while writing the framework - simply reading through the Yii code makes for a great way to learn about how to design/write good PHP code. Just my two cents...
