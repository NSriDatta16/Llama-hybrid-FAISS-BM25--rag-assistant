Cyclomatic Complexity is just one composant of what could be called Fabricated Complexity. A while back, I wrote an article to summarize several dimensions of code complexity: Fighting Fabricated Complexity Tooling is needed to be efficient at handling code complexity. The tool NDepend for .NET code will let you analyze many dimensions of the code complexity including code metrics like: Cyclomatic Complexity, Nesting Depth, Lack Of Cohesion of Methods, Coverage by Tests... including dependencies analysis and including a language ( Code Query Language ) dedicated to ask, what is complex in my code, and to write rule?
