On Linux there are two common used locations for storing variable data. /home/user/.application If every user needs it's own storage this is usually done in the users home directory. The path for your storage in the users home directory should be ENV["HOME"] + "/." + $application_name /var/lib/application If all users share the storage, or the application is intended to be run by only one user (most daemons), /var is the right place to store all kind of data. /var/log for logs /var/run for pid's /var/lock for lock files /var/www for httpservers /var/tmp for not important but persistant data /var/lib for all other data The path for your storage in /var should be "/var/lib/" + $application_name Make sure, the permissions for this directory are such, that you don't have to let your application run as root.
