I'm not aware of any method which would handle that but you can simply implement it yourself. Just capture the current time in seconds and in the onPause() method do the same. Then just subtract the first saved time value and the last saved value and you should know for how many seconds the application was running. There might be another more elegant solution I don't know of tho.
