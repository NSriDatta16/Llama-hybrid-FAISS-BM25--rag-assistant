TeamCity and CuriseControl works well for any projects,but here is why you would like to choose TeamCity:- Ease of setup: During setup we found TeamCity easier to setup and use especially compared to CruiseControl. We did not need to edit XML files or massively configure individual build machines like CruiseControl. Ease of extensibility:TeamCity stands out in its ease of extensibility too. If we find that builds are waiting in the queue too long, we can add more computers as agents. The only additional work on our end is registering the new computers with the TeamCity server and installing msbuild and subversion. Interaction with Subversion: One can check how many and what changes were committed to subversion since the last build, who started a build etc.
