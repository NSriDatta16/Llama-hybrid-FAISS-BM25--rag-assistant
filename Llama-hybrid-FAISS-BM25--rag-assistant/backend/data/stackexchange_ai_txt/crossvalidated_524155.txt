The term 'filter' can have many meanings in science. Science is messy and terminology can be used in different ways between disciplines and even within disciplines. Filtering as I encounter it most, being in the acoustic field of Neuroscience is in the context of: signal processing , where signals, often time series of measurements, are filtered in terms of frequency, including but not limited to: the classical analogue filters (e.g., Wiener filter)and their current digital counterparts, FFT Filters, Impulse filters, wavelet analyses, moving filters and so on. But as you say, it's also used in other fields, such as in Neuroscience as in your linked abstract where it's used as a term to express the weight change in neural signals. Often signals are funneled in the brain, like in the thalamus. The thalamus is sometimes referred to as a filter as well (although that's disputable). In anyway, in the awake state the high-frequency sensory inputs are funneled and passed through to the brain. During sleep, however, the various sensory inputs (barred smell) don't pass through the thalamus but are swamped by thalamic low-frequency waves. In a way, the peripheral inputs are filtered out by the thalamus helping the brain to maintain the sleeping state. It's as such applied in many other fields, like in Statistics to filter data Machine learning to make predictions based on large data sets etc. But it's also used in colloquial language, think coffee filters and particle filters in industry.
