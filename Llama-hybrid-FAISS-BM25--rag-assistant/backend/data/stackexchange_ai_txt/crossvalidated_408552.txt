When you count documents, you assume that of word occurs at least once , this is enough for you to make decision. For example, if you see "Viagra" in some e-mail you can be relatively sure that it is a spam. You would also count documents if you don't expect specific words to appear multiple times in documents (i.e. when it wouldn't matter much). It is the opposite with counting words, if more occurrences would make you more convinced to make some classification, then you would count them. Example may be an e-mail that mentions "lots of money" multiple times, if you wouldn't know anything else about it, then the significant count of such phrase might make you think that this may be some kind of scam . In many machine learning applications people use both kinds of counts, by using TF-IDF encoding .
