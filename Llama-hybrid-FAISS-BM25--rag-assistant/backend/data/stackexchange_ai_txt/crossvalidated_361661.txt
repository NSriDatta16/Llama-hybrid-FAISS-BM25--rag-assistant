The name for this phenomenon is omitted variable bias , with over 300 posts on this site. Your intuition is close to correct but not completely accurate. I find this answer by @Gung to be a good point of entry into discussion about the problem. Strictly, if an omitted predictor variable* is uncorrelated with the other predictors in standard linear regression, then there should be no bias in the estimates of the coefficients of the others. In practice, there is almost always some correlation among predictors. Also, there may be bias in the intercept if the sample at hand was biased in terms of its inclusion of values of the omitted predictor. This becomes even more of a problem with logistic regression or survival analysis with Cox regression. In these cases omitted variable bias is essentially unavoidable, even if predictors are uncorrelated. This page is a good place to start. *As discussed on this page the term "independent variable" can be misleading in many contexts.
