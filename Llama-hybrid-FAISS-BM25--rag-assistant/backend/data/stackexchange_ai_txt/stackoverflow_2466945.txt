If dragging items from the palette duplicates them, without removing them from the palette , then the answer is the appendTo option of the draggable plugin . This specifies the container to use during dragging. In my case I created a new div outside the bounds of the dialog and specified that as the dragging container. This allows the element to be drug beyond the bounds of the dialog window. To move items from the palette onto the workspace , I used the techniques from this similar SO question .
