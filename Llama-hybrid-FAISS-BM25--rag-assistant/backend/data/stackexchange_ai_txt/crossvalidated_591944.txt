Which metric to use to evaluate and compare meta models?

I'm developing meta models based on Zero Inflated Model ( sklego.meta.ZeroInflatedRegressor ) That is, they are models that have two tasks to perform: Train a classifier to tell us whether the target is zero, or not. If the classification is not zero, then... Train a regressor on all samples with a non-zero target. Code example: #build the model model = ZeroInflatedRegressor( classifier=ExtraTreesClassifier(random_state=0), regressor=ExtraTreesRegressor(random_state=0)) r2 = cross_val_score(model, scaled_train, y_train.values.ravel(), scoring = 'r2') Initially, I thought about using RÂ², but I'm not confident in my choice. Does anyone have any suggestions? NOTE: my data are time series. Maybe this makes some difference.
