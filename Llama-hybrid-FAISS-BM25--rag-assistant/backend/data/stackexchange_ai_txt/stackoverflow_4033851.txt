Check out the book "Metaprogramming Ruby" from the Pragmatic Press. It contains a very detailed explanation of this, in a manner that is very easy to read and understand. http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby i can't answer mot of your questions because i don't know python. but the basics of why it's not multiple inheritance is that ruby injects the module into the inheritance chain when the module is included or a class is extended by a module. class Foo include Bar end module Bar end foo = Foo.new this produces an inheritance chain where foo is an instance of Foo and Foo inherits from Bar. it's a bit more tricky than just that, and there are rules for the order in which the inheritance injection occurs. the book i referenced explains it very well.
