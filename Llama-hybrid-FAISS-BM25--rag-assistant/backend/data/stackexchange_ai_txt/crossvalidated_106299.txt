I have found that you just have to experiment by picking an attribute, splitting the data and then testing the results. If there is no real improvement, pick another attribute. Like many things to do with neural networks, there probably isn't a set formula for it as using the correlation is just a heuristic. In my example, I had 29 attributes. I split the data into two based on attribute which wasn't highly correlated to the output at all. The overall accuracy of the neural network improved from 88.3% to 97.7%.
