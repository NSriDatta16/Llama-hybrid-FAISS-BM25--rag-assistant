Cluster-robust standard errors after vglm

I have estimated an ordered logistic regression with the vglm function of the VGAM package in R. Here is a minimalistic example of what I did: library(VGAM) cdata Now I would like to estimate cluster robust standard errors for the groups defined by the group variable. I have tried the package lmtest in combination with sandwich since it is compatible with polr as described in this post , but for vglm it gives the following error: Error in UseMethod("estfun") : no applicable method for 'estfun' applied to an object of class "c('vglm', 'vlm', 'vlmsmall')" Does anyone know how to get cluster robust standard errors for a vglm object?
