css: (ugly class names need to be changed) p.radio { height: 4em; } label.top { display: block; width: 4em; /* or something else */ float: left; text-align: right; padding-right: 1em; height: 4em; } html: Car: Yes No Maybe EDIT: didn't see the other answer. Using a fieldset instead of a paragraph and legend for the "top-level" label seems to be a good idea IMO. EDIT2: according to comments, and I agree, using a list would be cleaner here. The new version would be : css: fieldset { border: 0; padding: 0; } legend { padding: 0 0.5em 0 0; margin: 0; display: block; width: 3.5em; float: left; text-align: right; } ul { margin: 0; padding: 0 0 0 4em; } ul li { list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outer; } html: Car: Yes No Maybe That would be much more elegant. But even with display:block firefox doesn't seem to want to set the width of a legend element. Strange bug.
