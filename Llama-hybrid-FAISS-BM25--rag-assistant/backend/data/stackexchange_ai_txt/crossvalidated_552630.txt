Can I use the mean of the estimates of coefficients for forecasting out of sample? You could, but why? A big selling point of Bayesian modelling is the ability to integrate over uncertainty in the parameters. You would do this by generating from the posterior predictive distribution , namely $$ p(\tilde{y} \vert y) = \int p(\tilde{y}\vert \theta) p(\theta \vert y) d \theta $$ This integral can be approximated by taking estimates of your coefficients and generating data via the likelihood. In Stan, you might right a linear regression and posterior predictive quantities as data{ int n; int p; vector[n] y; matrix[n, p] X; } parameters{ vector[p] beta; real sigma; } model{ beta ~ ; sigma ~ ; y ~ normal(X*b, sigma); } generated quantities{ //Here is the posterior predictive vector[n] y_tilde; for(i in 1:n){ y_tilde[i] = normal_rng(X*b, sigma); } } For each sample, Stan will compute X*b and then draw a gaussian random vairable with mean X*b and standard deviation sigma . If you average each of these, then you get a prediction for each row in X . How do I find the standard error of my regression? Uncertainty in the parameters can be obtained directly from the samples outputted by Stan. can I just plot the result of the residuals of regression against fitted values to see the test for heteroskedasticity? That is certainly one way to check the model.
