Polymorphic many-to-many association error in Ruby On Rails 3

I am struggling with a polymorphic many-to-many association in rails 3. My Article model looks like this: class Article :article_tags, :source => :taggable, :source_type => :person end My ArticleTag model looks like this: class ArticleTag true end My Person model looks like this: class Person :taggable end Finally, my Organization model looks like this: class Organization :taggable end I have a schema which looks like this: ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20110322234836) do create_table "article_tags", :force => true do |t| t.integer "taggable_id" t.string "taggable_type" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" end create_table "articles", :force => true do |t| t.string "title" t.text "content" t.date "published_on" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" end create_table "people", :force => true do |t| t.string "first_name" t.string "last_name" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" end create_table "organizations", :force => true do |t| t.string "title" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" end end I was hoping that this would allow me to create people and organizations relationships from my articles like this: Article.create! Article.first.people.create! and hopefully to be able to access it the other way afterwards by Person.first.articles Unfortunately I get an error when I try to add a person this way: Article.first.people.create! NameError: uninitialized constant Article::person .../base.rb:1199:in `compute_type' .../reflection.rb:162:in `klass' .../association_collection.rb:157:in `transaction' .../has_many_through_association.rb:41:in `create_record' .../has_many_through_association.rb:13:in `create! Any help would be very much appreciated I've tried many alternatives but with no success.
