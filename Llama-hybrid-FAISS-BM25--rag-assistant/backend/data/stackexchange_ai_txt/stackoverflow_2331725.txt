One thing I did for a project was use hash values like this: IDProduct-8185--tab-tech--g-8184 Meaning there were 3 parameters: IDProduct = 8185, tab = "tech", and g = 8184. Then, I'd split by "--" and loop over the resulting array. Probably not the most elegant solution, and works for very simple parameter values only. Better have a look at the BBQ plugin that Sean is suggesting first.
