I don't believe this is such a simple issue as it might appear (or at least did to me). In WPF, I would typically recommend to use a DockPanel control instead of StackPanel . For Silverlight, the problem is worsened by the fact that there doesn't exist a DockPanel control. My one suggestion (that may or may not work) would be to update the Width property of the TextBlock to the ActualWidth property of the parent StackPanel whenever the parent change size. Not the most elegant solution, but it may unfortunately be required.
