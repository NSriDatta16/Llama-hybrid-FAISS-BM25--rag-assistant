From the point of view of survey methodology, independently of the intention behind the poor question design, you could say that the question lacks validity or reliability . In addition, if the question is intentionally vague or subjective (e.g. with political afterthoughts), it is likely unethical . It wastes the respondents' time and trust, and may make them less inclined to answer future surveys. This kind of question can be in contradiction with various ethical or normative principles, e.g. the UN Statistical Commission's Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics : 2. Professional standards and ethics To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. Relative to the bias this kind of question may lead to in decision making, this is not really a statistics question, but more a political one, so off-topic for this website. You could try asking it on https://politics.stackexchange.com .
