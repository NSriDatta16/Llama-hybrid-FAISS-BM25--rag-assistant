What you are looking for might be a Generalized Linear Mixed Model , i.e. a Poisson model with a random intercept to start with. To motivate the Generalized Linear Mixed Model choice, I will provide some background from Mixed Models Theory and Applications by E. Demidenko (below, refer a "cluster" to a particular firm from your data): Often data have a clustered (panel or tabular) structure. Classical statistics assumes that observations are independent and identically distributed (iid). Applied to clustered data, this assumption may lead to false results. In contrast, the mixed effects model treats clustered data adequately and assumes two sources of variation, within cluster and between clusters. Two types of coefficients are distinguished in the mixed model: population-averaged and cluster (or subject) - specific. The former have the same meaning as in classical statistics, but the latter are random and are estimated as posteriori means. and: The Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is an extension of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) complicated by random effects. I believe that you are interested in allowing for random effects for years by firm . This can be obtained with glmer {lme4} function in R : set.seed(1) # Longitudinal data in a "long" format data.sim
