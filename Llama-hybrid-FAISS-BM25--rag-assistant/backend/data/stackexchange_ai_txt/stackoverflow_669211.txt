Some benefits of using Designer: easy to browse the table definitions, constraints etc. graphical tools to show tables and their relationships impact analysis tools generation of DDL for new/altered table definitions Whether this makes its use worthwhile depends on how much your orgnaisation makes use of these benefits. My organisation uses Designer to manage a very large (thousands of tables) database; for a smaller database the benefits may be smaller.
