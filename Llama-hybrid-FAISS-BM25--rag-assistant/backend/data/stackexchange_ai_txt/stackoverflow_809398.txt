Eclipse RCP: How to display source code?

I was wandering if it's possible to open a source code in text editor and display it with decorations (Java for example)? I don't need fancy eclipse editor features, just properly decorated source code with line numbers, it can even be read-only. I read that RCP have many limitations with text editors as it drags behind heavy plug-ins. Can it be done at all? Is it possible to navigate to particular line of code when file is opened? It would be really great if someone would point me out to the right direction or give some examples... Thanks in advance!
