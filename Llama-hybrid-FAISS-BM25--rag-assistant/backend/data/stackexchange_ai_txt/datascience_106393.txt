Models can be benchmarked by absolute values or relative values. Absolute values are frequently used in a business context. Is the model good enough to accomplish a useful task? Relative values are often used for comparing different models and/or different hyperparameters. One of the primary goals of machine learning is prediction. The best way to assess prediction is to see how a model performs on data that the model has not seen during training. You can define the goal of the project. Then see how the model performs on untrained, labeled data related to that goal.
