How to find out seasonality in Time Series Data without looking at the graph?

I've a data which has multiple time series. I want to find the seasonality in the data based on a number as it won't be feasible to check the seasonality by checking the plot. There are around 2505 time series. I explored, but was unable to find any good solution/ approach? Can any expert help me out with this!
