Can I perform logistic regression or any other type of regression on this dataset?

My data set contains information regarding the number of road accidents separated by gender, age, area, and other factors. Can I perform logistic regression analysis using this dataset to predict how likely it is for a person to crash given certain characteristics? I guess my confusion is because I do not have data surrounding those who did not crash. Would the results of my analysis show that everyone is likely to have an accident, considering the data contains only information of those who have? Am I correct in this thinking? If so, is there any other type of predictive analysis that I could perform on this dataset?
