That is a pickle, but it is not as uncommon in the commercial sector as you would think. I heard a statistic once that the average tenure of a programmer industry-wide is about 18-24 months. Normally I would suggest getting more experienced programmers who would require less ramp-up time and only need to be trained on the problem domain/technology updates and not the basics I think your best bet is just to ask for about 30-50% more grad students than it will take to actually perform the job to account for the learning and ramp-up time and invest in some additional resources for testing as this environment is a recipe for mistakes since everyone is learning on the job. Also, this is probably difficult given the academic schedule, but try to stagger the start dates as much as possible to maximize the overlap between employees. Pair-programming teams of new-hires/old-hires might also help increase consistency and supplement the training without sacrificing too much productivity.
