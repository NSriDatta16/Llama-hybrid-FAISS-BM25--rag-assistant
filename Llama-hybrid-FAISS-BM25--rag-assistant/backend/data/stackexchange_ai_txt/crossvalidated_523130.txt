SARIMA vs SARMA model

I've built two time series models using the same data. One model is a SARIMA (1,1,1) (0,0,0,52) model built with at level data and the second model is a SARMA (1,0,1) (0,0,0,52) model built with first differenced data. I expected that the results would be identical. The results are comparable, but not identical, and are generally within about 1.5% of each other. Does this sound like a plausible outcome, or should the results be identical? My code and data can be found on my github repo here: https://github.com/dkent603/General
