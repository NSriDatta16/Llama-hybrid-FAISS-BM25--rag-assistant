This is more a guess than an answer but: Well, there is the simple and non-elegant way, and that is to force all the hyper links to be disabled when the item that is about to be edited gains focus, and then enable them when the item loses focus or the user cancels it. To do this, you could grab the container with the links inside, and loop through them and disabling or enabling them. If the navigation exists in another control entirely, then that control could be set as disabled following the same method of focus and lost focus.
