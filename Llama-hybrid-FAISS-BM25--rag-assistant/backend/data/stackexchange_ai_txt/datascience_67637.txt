How to deal with different length entities in a Keras DataGenerator?

I'm solivng a prediction problem where I need to predict the demand of multiple articles based on their performance during the last 7 days. To get the most out of the data I am trying to implement a rolling window approach where I use 7 days as the training input (x) and the 8th day's performance as the training label (y). As I am using Keras as a deep learning framework, how do I combine this rolling window approach with a custom data generator that feeds my network during training? The different articles have different data lengths (i.e. article A has 200 days worth of data, article B only has 10 days worth of data). I implemented a version where I only use one sample per article but that drastically decreases the amount of data I have for training.
