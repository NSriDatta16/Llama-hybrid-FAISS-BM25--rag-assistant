Had a debate on this a while ago. Standard folderization of your code is good for readability and organization, but when you want to just grab things, the one other way is to use tagging somehow (like by adding tags to the file names or other meta data). Tags work good in the place of folders because you can dig up specific or general things quickly, whereas with folders you need to dig through trees to get specific stuff. Tags: O(n). Folders: O(n^2) Maybe. :P
