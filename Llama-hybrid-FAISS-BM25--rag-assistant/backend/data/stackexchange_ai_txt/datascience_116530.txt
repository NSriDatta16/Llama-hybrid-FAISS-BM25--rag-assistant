In bootstrapping, the sampling is done with replacement . So although each sample is the same size as the original training set, it will contain some duplicated instances and omit other instances. This explains how each bootstrapped sample is both the same size as the training set, but they will all be different. On average, about 63% of instances will be included in each bootstrap sample, and 37% excluded. These excludes instances (the out of bag samples) become the test set for that bootstrapped sample. The overview on this page of the mlxtend documentation tells you a bit more about this.
