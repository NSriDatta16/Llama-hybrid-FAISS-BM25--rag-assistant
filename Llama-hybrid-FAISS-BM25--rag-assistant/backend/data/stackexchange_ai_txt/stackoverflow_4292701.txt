Display the highest result of each group with relevance data?

I have 4 tables like this : "Student" with fields ID, FullName, Gender, ClassID ( "ID" of "Class" ) .... "Class" with fields ID, ClassName "Subject" with fields ID, SubjectName "Points" with fields ID, StudentID ( "ID" of "Student" ), SubjectID ( "ID of Subject" ), ExamPoint The average exam point of a student, is calculated by adding all the point, then divide this result by the number of subjects. If John has Maths 8 and English 4 and Literature 6 then his average exam point is (8+4+6)/3=6. If Mary has Maths 10 and English 5 then her average exam point is (10+5)/2=7.5 I'm about selecting the person who has the highest average exam point in each class then display their name, their class name and their average exam points. How can I do it?
