The characters [ and ] must not appear literally in the fragment of a URI . Here’s the corresponding ABNF for URI (RFC 3986) : fragment = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" Any character that is not listed her must be encoded using the percent-encoding. So Chrome’s behavior is correct. But I guess Firefox is just displaying the characters that are represented by %5B and %5D . And that’s up to the browser.
