Does Min Max algorithm leads to information loss?

Simplifying the question with an example. Lets say I have a time series data and the variables are time, temperature, growth_of_microbe. Now I have observed usually with a higher high of temperature there is an effect on growth of microbe. Sample of the data is as follows | Hour of Day(H) | Temp(T) | Microbe(P) | Min-Max of P(P#) | Why shouldn't P# be? | |:--------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:----------------:|:-------------------:| | 1 | 30 | 12 | (12-1)/(23-1) | | | 2 | 32 | 14 | (14-1)/(23-1) | (14-12)/(14-12) | | 3 | 31 | 5 | (5-1)/(23-1) | (5-5)/(14-5) | | 4 | 33 | 23 | (23-1)/(23-1) | (23-5)/(14-5) | | 5 | 35 | 1 | (1-1)/(23-1) | (1-1)/(23-1) | With respect to the above table, Min-Max uses the lowest/highest data within the total available time rather than the lowest/highest till the time the value is calculated Doesn't this lead to information loss?
