If I understand you correctly, you want to switch back to the former SVN repository as your working copy, and you want to preserve the old SVN history? There are a couple of options available. Push the recent changes from the new Git repository to Heroku, then switch to the old repository and pull from Heroku. This will bring you old repository up to date. Temporarily change the URL in the old repository's config file to point to the local path of the new repository. Pull the recent changes from there, and then revert back to the Heroku URL when done. This will also bring your old repository up to date. The first option is the most expedient, and the second is the long way round. Either way, you will have the same net result of an up to date local repository containing all history. The surplus new repository can be disposed of in either case. Edit: To address your concerns about whether Heroku will care about the origin of the commit, in brief, no the repository on Heroku is another git repository that accepts commits from authenticated users. As long as the credentials are correct, the originating repository does not matter. This is the beautiful thing about DVCS - there is not one controlling or corruptible repository - It is entirely possible for you to now clone from Heroku on another machine and continue work from there. As long as your credentials are the same, the history will show any and all commits you push, but does not care where from. If your desire is to simply use a clean repository to work with, the new one will be the favorite. The old one can be deleted without ill effects. To prove this - check the SHA-1 hashes for a commit in both new and old repositories, and you will see they are identical. The hash is unique for all commits, and can be used to check the code integrity at all times. There will never be more than one change for any given hash. As a side note, the repository is portable in that it is entirely self contained, and can be moved around freely on your storage space, or even be used on external storage such as a USB thumb drive.
