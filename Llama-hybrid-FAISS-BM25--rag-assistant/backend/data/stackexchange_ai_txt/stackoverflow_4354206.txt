Need expert's comment on deciding DB storage or file base

Hi Friends I have an application that stores thousands of text files in database with average of 3KB each. and another table storing brief info about them that searched more frequently. with 140,000 records, my database performance get too slow. I thought that i could store those files on disk that reduce my database size about 80%. these files are stored only for the purpose of display (reading file content and display) but not for any database operation on them. but my website has about 1000 users and I'm afraid if i store those files on disk, it gets worst (disk I/O operation increase, reading files in different session could increase I/O moving hard disk head back and forward plus I can't control reading files in one thread only) any guys has related experience ? Please make this decision for me. THANKS THANKS
