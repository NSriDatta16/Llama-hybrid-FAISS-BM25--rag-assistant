There are certain preferences the user prefers more (all animals are equal but some are more equal than others). These should be specifically optimized for retrieval and application on the interface on login. As the depth of preference goes down, they can be aggregated using whatever criteria and saved as separate columns possibly as arrays(e.g. font preference column includes font type, size and colour and refers to a font table). Also index the heavily used columns using db tooling and redesign to split aggregated columns so that you can identify which element in the aggregation is under heavy demand. All in all user preferences tend to be very static (i.e. are like a habit), do not confuse the user data which is more highly mutable with the preferences.
