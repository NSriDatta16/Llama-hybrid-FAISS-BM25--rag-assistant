I cannot tell you which company is best, but I can mention a class of services/companies that are quite popular that I believe should be avoided. These companies run simple scripts (probably just NMAP) against the subject IP and gather superficial information to report possible vulnerabilities. One popular firm in this category is Scan Alert's "Hacker Safe". Last year I wrote a post about my experience with this particular company: Is Your Site Hacker Safe? The problem with Scan Alert, McAffee, etc., is that they simply scan a site for version strings and known vulnerabilities. No regard is given to the fact that some services, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, will backport security fixes while retaining a prior version identifier. Worse, the actual detection of live vulnerabilities is not attempted so actual security vulnerabilities remain undetected while false positives are distracting attention. If I truly needed to know if my application or system where vulnerable to attack I would retain the services of a reputable penetration testing consultant. I would not trust automated testing but actual experts who will attempt to exploit any vulnerability my application/system may have.
