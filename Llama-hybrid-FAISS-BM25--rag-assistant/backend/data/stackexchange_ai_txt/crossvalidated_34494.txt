How to handle missing data in a logistic regression using SPSS?

I have a data-set of genetic variants which I'm trying to use as predictors for a simple phenotype, and for starters I use a binary logistic regression in SPSS. I have around 900 individuals, and for each individual around 50 variations and a phenotype. However, I get an unreasonably high amount of removed values when I run the analysis (there is some missing variants data all over the entire table), i.e., only around 50% of my measurements are actually used, and I can't find the exclusion-cut-off SPSS uses for this anywhere. Does anyone know the cut-off that SPSS employs in this? Or does it remove a measurement once it finds a single missing variant?
