In one article , Hern√°n indeed writes "Consistency may seem so obvious as to hardly deserve any attention. As a consequence, the condition of consistency is often taken for granted [...]" Then, he goes on to demonstrate why it's not so simple. Problems can in particular arise in observational studies, where the "treatment" $A$ , e.g., gender, might not be unambiguously linked to an intervention. It is then hard to conceive what is meant by a statement like "had the person been assigned to the other gender", i.e., by an expression like $$ Y_{A=0}|A = 1. $$ What is the interveining assignment mechanism of gender here that we are interested in? Is a change in name enough? (If we are looking at hiring discrimination from CVs, that might actually be enough) Or do we need to think of a person with all the same personality charachteristics, but different biological sex? Or a person born to the other sex and raised accordingly, including all socially learned gender roles? The same ambiguity makes it unclear what in this case we even mean by $$ Y_{A=0}|A = 0. $$ There is no well-defined invervention $A$ , and hence no well-defined causal contrast. Practically, this has downstream problems for data analysis, like the selection of adjustment variables. It is also linked to problems in evaluating the positivity assumption (see the article). In short, evaluating the consistency assumption guides us towards well-defined causal questions. Edit: See also the way more elaborate response here .
