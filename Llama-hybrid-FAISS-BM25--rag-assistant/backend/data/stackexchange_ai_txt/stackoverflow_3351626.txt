CSS: Where is a tag being applied?

I'm working on a website for a volunteering organisation whose parent organisation ordered us to implement a rebranding and gave us several css sheets. My problem is this: A page is structured like so: Heading blah blah blah From what Firebug tells me, the first paragraph is being given a p.intro property that is making it larger. What tool can I use to discover where the tag is being applied? There is nothing that specifies any css tags in the page. Kind Thanks!
