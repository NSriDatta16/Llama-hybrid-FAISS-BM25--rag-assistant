Is it effective to use one hot encoding of categorical data as input to PCA for anomaly detection?

I have a mixture of numeric and categorical inputs, the categorical inputs are relatively low cardinality (perhaps 10-15). I want to use PCA for anomaly detection, but am not sure how best to encode the categorical attributes. Will one hot encoding work, and if not, what should I try?
