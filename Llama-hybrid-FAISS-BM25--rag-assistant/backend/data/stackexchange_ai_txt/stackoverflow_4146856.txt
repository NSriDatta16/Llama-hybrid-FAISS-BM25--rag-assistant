How to stop update value of slider while dragging it?

I've slider that its value is bind to some property, and the property updates it all the time. While dragging the [thumb on] slider I want to stop this update value of slider from binding, until user finish it's dragging. Is there any property on Slider to do that, or I need to write code for that? Thanks in advance!
