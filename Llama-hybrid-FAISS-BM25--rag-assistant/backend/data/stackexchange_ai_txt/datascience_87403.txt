This depends largely on the software. sklearn classifiers will know not to treat label-encoded data as ordered; that said, most/all of them will take the raw string data just fine (and in many cases will use a LabelEncoder internally, for computational efficiency). If you one-hot encode multiclass data, sklearn will generally think your problem is multi label instead of just multiclass, and your results will be different. See also this SO question . But, in contrast, most neural network implementations will expect multiclass targets to be one-hot encoded in advance, and presumably you'll want to use a softmax activation on the final layer.
