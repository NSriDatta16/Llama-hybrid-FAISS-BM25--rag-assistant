Many To Many Query In EF Keeps Returnning Empty Results

I'm using EF 4 with POCO and lazy loading and proxy creation disabled (due to serialization requirements). I have two tables that have a many to many relationship using a third cross-reference table. In EF, the cross-reference entity does not exist and I have one to many navigation properties on both sides of the entity relationships (as expected). However, when I use the naviation property of one of the entities that I have confirmed via SQL Manager queries to have data, I get an empty result set. Has anyone else run into this? If so, any advice on how to resolve would be most appreciated. Thanks!
