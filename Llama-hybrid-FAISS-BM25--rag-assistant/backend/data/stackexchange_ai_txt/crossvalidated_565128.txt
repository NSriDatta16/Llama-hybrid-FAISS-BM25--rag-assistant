Binomial test p-value matches Bayesian posterior probability

I recently observed, for the binomial distribution, an equivalence between the frequentist significance level and the Bayesian posterior probability, as I describe below. I would like to know if this is part of a more general pattern that applies to a larger class of distributions and tests, and whether this has any bearing on the choice of Bayesian prior, and on the relationship between frequentist probability and Bayesian probability. Let $p$ be the Binomial probability parameter, $k$ the number of observed successes, $n$ the number of trials. The p-value of the binomial test for the null hypothesis $p is: $$ \alpha = \sum_{l = 0}^{k} \binom{n}{l}p_0^l(1-p_0)^{n-l} = 1 - I_{p_0}(k + 1, n - k)\,, $$ where $I_q(\alpha, \beta)$ is the incomplete regularized beta function. If I assume $\mathrm{Beta}(1, 0)$ as the Bayesian prior for $p$ , the posterior distribution is $\mathrm{Beta}(k + 1, n - k)$ , and the posterior probability that $p > p_0$ is: $$ \mathrm{Prob}[p > p_0] = 1 - I_{p_0}(k + 1, n - k)\,, $$ i.e. it matches the p-value of the frequentist test.
