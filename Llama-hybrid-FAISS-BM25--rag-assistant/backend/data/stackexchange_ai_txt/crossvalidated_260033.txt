Does random forest ever ignore any attributes?

In any possible scenario, such as: If the attribute values are totally random If the attribute values are all equal (like all 0) If almost all attribute values are missing (or let's say all of them are missing in a hypothetical case) etc. P.S: I know that it (like any other algorithm) considers different importances for each attribute, but I'm asking if it ever decides to remove an attribute from its trees, if the attribute is a very bad one.
