how to solve quadratic programming in SVM

In SVM we have $$\max_{\alpha}1^T{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}{\alpha^T}Q{\alpha}$$ $$s.t.\quad{\alpha^T}y=0,\quad{\alpha} \ge0 $$ If we have 3 data points and 2 dimensional example in SVM the Q matrix become(symmetric matrix in quadratic form): $$(Q)_{ij}=y_iy_jx_i^Tx_j$$ $$ \begin{bmatrix} y_0y_0x_0^Tx_0 & y_0y_1x_0^Tx_1 & y_0y_2x_0^Tx_2 \\ y_1y_0x_1^Tx_0 & y_1y_1x_1^Tx_1 & y_1y_2x_1^Tx_2 \\ y_2y_0x_2^Tx_0 & y_2y_1x_2^Tx_1 & y_2y_2x_2^Tx_2 \end{bmatrix} $$ and alpha matrix(the dimension depends on how many points in this example 3): $$ \begin{bmatrix} {\alpha_1}\\ {\alpha_2}\\ {\alpha_3} \end{bmatrix} $$ after multiply $$\frac{1}{2}{\alpha^T}Q{\alpha}$$ as a result something like: $$ {\alpha_1}^2-6{\alpha_1}+9+{\alpha_2}^2+2{\alpha_2}+1 $$ and subject to $$ {\alpha_1}y_1+{\alpha_2}y_2+{\alpha_3}y_3=0$$ $$ {\alpha_i\ge0} $$ How do I solve with Quadratic Programming? In svm it is so different form classic quadratic programming problem I don't know how to solve with the constraint because it has y value
