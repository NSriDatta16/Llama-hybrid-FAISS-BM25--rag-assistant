Neural Networks output range in simulation

I am learning some model based on examples ${((x_{i1},x_{i2},....,x_{ip}),y_i)}_{i=1...N}$ using a neural network of Feed Forward Multilayer Perceptron (newff) (using python library neurolab). I expect the output of the NN to be positive for any further simulation of the NN. How can I make sure that the results of simulation (testing) of my learned NN are always positive? (how I do it in neurolab?)
