iPhone SDK: AVAudioRecorder metering -- how to change peakPowerForChannel from decibel into percentage?

The AVAudioRecorder in the iPhone SDK can be used to get the peak and average power for a channel, in decibels. The range is between 0db to 160db. What is the calculation used to convert this into a scale between 0 - 10 or something similar that can be used for an audio level meter?
