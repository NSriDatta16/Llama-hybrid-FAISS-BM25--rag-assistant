for($i=0;$i There are indeed array iterator functions which support what you need, and also simply looping thorugh an array with next() / prev() etc works fine but the solution above is more elegant It doesn't work with foreach because foreach creates a copy of references and doesn't set the array pointers in the array itself. Here is a sample which can be used for associative arrays using array iterator functions: $arrayobject = new ArrayObject($array); $iterator = $arrayobject->getIterator(); for($i=0;$i seek($i); $thisValue = $iterator->current(); $iterator->seek($i+1); $nextValue = $iterator->current(); $percentageDiff = ($nextValue-$thisValue)/$thisValue; }
