Is it necessary to simulate unbiased coin in using frequentist approach for determining if coin is unbiased?

I’m trying to determine the best way to detect if a coin is unbiased, given some desired alpha. I understand basic probability/statistical inferencing, but there’s some information out there that confuses me. In particular, I was reading the wikipedia article on this checking whether coin is fair . For the Bayesian approach, the wikipedia article indicates “The probability for an unbiased coin (defined for this purpose as one whose probability of coming down heads is somewhere between 45% and 55%)” . This seems kind of arbitrary. Here’s how I would have done this (and then I want help comparing with the wikipedia approach): Choose an $\alpha$ (probably $\alpha=0.05$ ) Simulate the coin in question using bootstrapping to estimate the sample mean. Each bootstrap sample is a binomial distribution. (assume some number of tosses “ $n$ ” for each bootstrap sample). Compute “ $N$ ” binomial distributions to get $N$ bootstrap samples. By central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample means will be Gaussian Because sample mean and sample variance are unbiased statistics, this Gaussian distribution will be parameterized by: mean of sample means mean of the sample variances Compute the confidence interval for this Gaussian distribution of the sample mean based on the given $\alpha=0.05$ . If 0.5 falls within that confidence interval, then coin is unbiased, otherwise biased. I have a few questions about my approach: Does the desired alpha affect “n” and/or “N” in my bootstrap sampling? If so, how? If not, then how to choose these numbers? It doesn’t seem necessary to simulate the unbiased coin, since we are testing the null hypothesis that the $\mu=0.5$ , and the variability in an unbiased coin is captured in the confidence interval. Correct? Related : How to reconcile the frequentist method with assessing the fairness of a coin?
