Relitve path for MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0 not working

I have this code which works but I need to stop using http in the string as it sometimes is on a https servers. Hence my wish to change it to a relative path e.g. Url = "../../path/to/file.asp" but when make the change to this code we get this error. msxml6.dll error '80072ee6' System error: -2147012890. I am sure I missing something simple. Anybody got any ideas? Working code fragmant Url = "http://" & Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_NAME") & "/path/to/file.asp" Set HttpReq = Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0") With HttpReq .Open "POST", Url, false .setTimeouts 30000, 60000, 30000, 120000 End With HttpReq.Send (RequestXml)
