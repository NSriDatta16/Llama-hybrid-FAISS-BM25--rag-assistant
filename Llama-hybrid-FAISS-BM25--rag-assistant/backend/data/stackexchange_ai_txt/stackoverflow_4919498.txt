STL vectors are unmanaged templated methods. In theory you can calculate the offsets to the corresponding methods of vector do some code generation and call it. You cannot use DllImport because the STL vectors are a template only library which are not exported methods. You could of course write a C style wrapper to call specific methods like int GetSize(vector *vec) { return vec.size(); } But you do not want to do that because the many managed unmanged transitions needed for this will bring your application to a sudden halt. If you need to manipulate stl vectors your best bet is to use managed C++ and call from C# into your Managed C++ dll to manipulate the vectors as you like. In many companies the usage of Managed C++ was banned becaus people did not pay attention to the cost of managed unmanaged transitions which did cause C++ to loose its main asset: Speed.
