How to create SQL Server stored procedure returning an array?

Sorry for this maybe foolish question but i'm newbie to SQL Server. Here structure of my table of divisions at organization: id int(16) -- simply unique id sub_id int(16) -- this id of parent division in this table (if zero, than it don't have parent) name VARCHAR(200) -- name of division I need to create a simply procedure which return me all id of subdivisions in some division (with top division id too). I think i need array with subid's in loop, but i don't know how to create array in SQL Serve o_0 (omg.. array exist in (T)SQL language ? =). Help please. Or maybe another way to get it?
