I used Mathematica for years and still found it easier to learn Matlab from scratch in order to do an image processing project . The thing that makes Matlab better here is that many state-of-the-art image algorithms have code available. For instance, for content-based image retrieval you need to extract content features, and vl_sift library does that. Also, you can bundle your Matlab library to run as a stand-alone executable, and I don't know if that's possible with Mathematica.
