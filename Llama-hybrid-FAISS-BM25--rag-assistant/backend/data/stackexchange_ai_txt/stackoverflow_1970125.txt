It depends. As Aaron mentioned, everything you store in viewstate has to be uploaded from the client back to the server. For an int er net site this normally makes viewstate an incredibly bad place to store tabular data. For an int ra net site where the client likely has 100Mbs upload bandwidth that's not as big a deal, and Viewstate may be a better place; this is especially true if the database query to rebuild this data is expensive. That said, a lot of intranet sites are eventually ported to support home workers and suddenly find themselves working in internet situations, so you may still want to keep internet-like performance limitations in mind. In this case, if your database query ends up being a bottleneck you might consider either an indexed/materialized view or even separate table(s) where you can insert this data temporarily for quick retrieval to help speed things up on that end.
