The GWT compiler generates another permutation file for each instance of runAsync() Permutations are also created for each language, user agent, etc., so if your app calls runAsync() twice, targets six user agents and is localized to 10 languages, you'll have 180 permutations: (initial + 2 split chunks) * 6 user agents * 10 languages Each permutation corresponds to one GWT-generated cache.html file. For example, one of these files may contain the initial download JS for Firefox in French. Another may be "chunk 2" for Safari in German.
