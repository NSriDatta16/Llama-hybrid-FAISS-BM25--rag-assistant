Calculating probability for bivariate normal distributions based on bootstrapped regression coefficients

Dear all, I was encouraged to ask this question here as well as on stackoverflow and would be very appreciative of any answers... Due to hetereoscedasticity I'm doing bootstrapped linear regression (appeals more to me than robust regression). I'd like to create a plot along the lines of what I've done in the script here. However the fill=int is not right since int should (I believe) be calculated using a bivariate normal distribution. Any idea how I could do that in this setting? Also is there a way for bootcov to return bias-corrected percentiles? sample script: library(ggplot2) library(Hmisc) library(Design) # for ols() o temp bootcov(temp,B=1000,coef.reps=T)->t2 return(t2) } dlply(o,.(ai,Gs),function(x) reg.s(x))->b.list llply(b.list,function(x) x[["boot.Coef"]])->b2 ks i1 & x$Intercept j1 & x$bc plott plott
