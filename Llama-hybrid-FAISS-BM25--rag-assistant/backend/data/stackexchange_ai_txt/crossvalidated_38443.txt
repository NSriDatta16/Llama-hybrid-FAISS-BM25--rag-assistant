I would not apply weights. Include a term for "site" in your logistic regression. It would not need to be a random effect, as Andrea suggests above. A fixed effect could be appropriate, depending on the number of sites and how they were chosen. I think the algorithm "understands" that different numbers are involved and adjusts accordingly. Weighting takes place where the raw data are not involved but only a mean (or proportion) from each group is recorded. You then need to weight the means by group size. However if the sites are fairly heterogeneous, and the bulk of your data comes from only one, it might be wiser to limit the analysis to that one site.
