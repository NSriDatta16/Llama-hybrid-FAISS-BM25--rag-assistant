Why not able to get the 'Run on Server' option for JSF jsp page on eclipse, weblogic, JBossTools?

I am trying to run a JSF 1.2 application created using Eclipse Ganemede and JBoss Tools on WebLogic 10.0 MP1 I have created a simple JSF helloworld application and have added a simple JSP. I have configured a weblogic domain and a server using the JBoss Tools plugin through eclipse. When I right click on the JSP file I can only see "Run Configurations..." options and NOT "Run on Server..". I do get this ('run on server') option when I right click on the application in the eclipse, but it doesn't run the This is strange as in another JSF application on the same eclipse workspace, i am able to 'run on server' the JSP pages by right clicking on them. Can anyone suggest a solution for this ? Thanks. Ankit
