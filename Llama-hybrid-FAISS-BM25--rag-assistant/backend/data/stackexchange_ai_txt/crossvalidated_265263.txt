Under what conditions can I make a bounding argument when I have weak instruments?

The model of interest is $$ y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon $$ In the population, $E[\epsilon|x_1]\neq 0$ and $E[\epsilon|x_2]\neq 0$, so OLS estimates of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are biased. Suppose that I know, from theory, that the bias will be downward for $\beta_1$ and upward for $\beta_2$. I've got instruments $Z$ ($N\times k$ where $k\geq 2$) that satisfy the exclusion restriction (they are uncorrelated with $y$ except through their effect on $x_1$ and $x_2$) but that only weakly satisfy the inclusion restriction of being correlated with $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is a weak instrument problem. Following Stock and Yogo , I calculate the Cragg-Donald statistic. The matrix isn't singular, so I'm not under-identified. But the minimum eigenvalue is well below the Stock/Yogo critical values. In short, my instruments are fairly bad. Now, say that $\hat\beta_{OLS} = [0,0]$, and $\hat\beta_{2SLS} = [2, -2]$. I can easily defend an assumption that $\hat\beta_{OLS} - \beta = [-, +]$. I have read that weak instruments bias 2SLS estimates toward the OLS estimate. So can I therefore claim that $\hat\beta_{2SLS} = [2, -2]$ is a lower bound to $\beta$? Seems too easy. Let's recast 2SLS as linear control functions: $$ x_1 = Z\gamma_1 + \eta_1 $$ $$ x_2 = Z\gamma_2 + \eta_2 $$ The control functions estimator is $$ y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \delta_1\hat\eta_1 + \delta_2\hat\eta_2+ \epsilon $$ and we know that $\hat\beta_{2sls} = \hat\beta_{CF}$. Say that $Z$ is a weak set of instruments because it is mis-measured. That would mean that $\gamma$ is too small (attenuation), and thus the variance of $\hat\eta$ will be too big. Could I say that $\hat\eta = \eta + \mathcal{N}(0,var)$? If so, then my control functions estimator has mismeasured regressors. Given that these mismeasured regressors are correlated (by assumption) with the endogenous variables $x$, estimates of $\beta$ will be biased because of attenuation in $\hat\eta$. If I'm willing to assume that $cov(\eta_1, x_1) 0$, then it follows that $\beta_{CF}$ will be biased upwards and downwards, respectively. (I think that all of the above require (or at least are simplified by) an assumption that $x_1\perp x_2$) Am I missing something? Are there additional assumptions that I need to make the above hold? Under what conditions could it go wrong? Also, assume that $\beta_{CF}$ is statistically significant (i.e. different from zero) after accounting for uncertainty in the first stage. Assuming that $\beta_{CF}$ is bounded as above, could anything make my interval estimates increase rather than decrease?
