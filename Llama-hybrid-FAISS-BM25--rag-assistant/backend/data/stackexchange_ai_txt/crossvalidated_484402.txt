Transposed convolution layer in a CNN

So I've seen a convolutional neural network that uses the traditional convolutional layers, but then after the down-sampling of the input and some pooling layer, they've added a transposed convolution layer which up-sample the resulting input. without any context I'm wondering why such thing could be beneficial/useful to add a transposed convolution layer? and if so when should one use this? I know my question is out of any context but I thought that maybe there is some general reason behind this.
