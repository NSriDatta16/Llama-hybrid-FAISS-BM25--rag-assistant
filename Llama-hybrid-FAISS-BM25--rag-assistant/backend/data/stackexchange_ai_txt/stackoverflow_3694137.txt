I would consider preparing the data in a way that tries to reduce the number of I/O calls. After knowing that the data is being written in the must efficient way with the least number of I/O calls possible I would consider using asynchronous I/O. If performance is still not good enough then consider adding additional threads to the design. One way that you may be able to reduce the number of writes is to use a structure that combines all data so that one write can be used instead of three. The pragma's would be needed to get rid of any extra padding/alignment that the compiler might added. #pragma pack(push,1) struct PipeData { double _time; long _buffer_len; char* _buffer; }; #pragma pack(pop) PipeData data; int data_len = sizeof(double) + sizeof(long) + ; for(unsigned int i = 0; i
