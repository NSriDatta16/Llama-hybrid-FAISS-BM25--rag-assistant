Goals in TS Analysis from the lesson-slides of M. Dettling: 1) Exploratory Analysis: Visualization of the properties of the series time series plot decomposition into trend/seasonal pattern/random error correlogram for understanding the dependency structure 2) Modeling: Fitting a stochastic model to the data that represents and reflects the most important properties of the series done exploratory or with previous knowledge model choice and parameter estimation is crucial inference: how well does the model fit the data? 3) Forecasting: Prediction of future observations with measure of uncertainty mostly model based, uses dependency and past data is an extrapolation, thus often to take with a grain of salt similar to driving a car by looking in the rear window mirror 4) Process Control: The output of a (physical) process defines a time series a stochastic model is fitted to observed data this allows understanding both signal and noise it is feasible to monitor normal/abnormal fluctuations 5) Time Series Regression: Modeling response time series using 1 or more input series Fitting this model under i.i.d error assumption: leads to unbiased estimates, but... often grossly wrong standard errors thus, confidence intervals and tests are misleading About the stock marked problem: These TS are very volatile, which is difficult to model. For example a change in a law that concerns the company could lead to a change in the TS process... how would any statistical tool predict that? About serial correlation: In contrast to multivariate statistics, the data in a time series are usually not iid, but are serially correlated. This information can also be useful to detect something to be not iid, what is supposed to be, like for example a dirty laboratory instrument
