How to output a generated HTML string to a textbox without paragraph formating

I am generating an HTML string in a WPF application, and I am outputting it to a multiline textbox. Right now the output is wrapping, but is showing up similar to a paragraph. I would like it to be shown as formatted HTML. It wouldn't even have to be very nice formatting, but at least not show a paragraph of HTML. How can I accomplish this?
