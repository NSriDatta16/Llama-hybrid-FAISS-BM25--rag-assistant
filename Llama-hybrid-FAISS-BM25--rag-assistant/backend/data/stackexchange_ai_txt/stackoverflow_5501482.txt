Open Gl Usage in C++ or C#

Hi my teacher has planned to do some programming teaching for us .He said that we have to chose OpenGL and use it to do graphics Stuff. He has given each student liberty to select language of own choice. I have experience with c# but class lectures would be in Visual c++ some students have decided to go for JAVA Some for C++ now i want to ask is that does OpenGL Supports c# ? can we do all the things that are possible in c++ (so that i can translate the Class work in c#) in which language is it easy to deal with OpenGl basically I am not comfortable with c++.
