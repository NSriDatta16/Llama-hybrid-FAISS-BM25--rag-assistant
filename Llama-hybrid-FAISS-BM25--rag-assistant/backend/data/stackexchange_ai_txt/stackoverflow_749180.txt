Default values in a C Struct

I have a data structure like this: struct foo { int id; int route; int backup_route; int current_route; } and a function called update() that is used to request changes in it. update(42, dont_care, dont_care, new_route); this is really long and if I add something to the structure I have to add a 'dont_care' to EVERY call to update( ... ). I am thinking about passing it a struct instead but filling in the struct with 'dont_care' beforehand is even more tedious than just spelling it out in the function call. Can I create the struct somewhere with default values of dont care and just set the fields I care about after I declare it as a local variable? struct foo bar = { .id = 42, .current_route = new_route }; update(&bar); What is the most elegant way to pass just the information I wish to express to the update function? and I want everything else to default to -1 (the secret code for 'dont care')
