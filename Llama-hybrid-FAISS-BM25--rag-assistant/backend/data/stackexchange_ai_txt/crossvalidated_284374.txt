There are many metrics. They are best used in conjunction with visualizing the data appropriately. Among the solutions worth considering are to compare the distributions of the frequencies (regardless of time) to your reference distribution, the uniform one. Theory suggests that the deviations from perfect uniformity--the residuals --should be about the size of the square root of the average frequency. You can exploit that to compare datasets with different absolute frequencies: standardize the residuals (by dividing them by their expected deviations). This has a close mathematical relationship to chi-squared tests. Indeed, we can use the standard Normal distribution as a reference for the standardized residuals, whence the sum of their squares is the usual chi-squared statistic. When it's small--around the number of distinct times or less--you have near-perfect uniformity. That gives you a good reference value for comparison. Let's look at your data from this point of view. Here are versions of your three datasets: We can order these residuals and plot them against the expected values of the first, second, ..., twenty fourth order statistics of the standard Normal distribution. The horizontal deviations of these plots around a diagonal line signal non-uniformity: Notice the chi-squared statistics posted in each plot. The value of $15.8$ at the left isn't even as great as $24$ (the number of data values), perfectly consistent with a uniform distribution. The middle value of $563$ is large. What it means is that although the residuals line up in the plot, their values are too spread out: this is an over-dispersed dataset. Finally, the right hand value of $28000$ is huge. It signals major variations in this dataset. Even more insight can be had by redrawing these plots, each on its own axis, so we can see the details of the variation. Now you can see clearly how uniformly dispersed the first two datasets are. But by inspecting their vertical scales, you can see that the "dispersed" data are spread out around seven times more than the "uniform" data: that measures the over-dispersion. Just about all statistical software produces plots like these: they are called "QQ" (quantile-quantile) plots. This method works well for any dataset. Interpreting the chi-squared statistic becomes a little delicate when the average frequency drops below $5$ or so, but for almost any exploratory application that's no problem.
