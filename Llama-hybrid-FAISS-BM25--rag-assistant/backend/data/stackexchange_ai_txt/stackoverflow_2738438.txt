Matt Cutts from Google answered to More than one H1 on a page: good or bad? (Mar 5, 2009) with: Well, if there's a logical reason to have multiple sections, it's not so bad to have, you know multiple h1 s. I would pay attention to overdoing it. If your entire page is h1 , that looks pretty cruddy, right? So don't do all h1 and then you CSS to make it look like regular text because we see people, who are competitors complain about that if users ever turn off CSS or the CSS doesn't load, it looks really bad. So, you know, it's ok to have a little bit of h1 here and then maybe there's two sections on a page, and so maybe have a little bit of h1 here. But you really should use it for headers or headings, which is what the intent is. Not to just throw h1 everywhere you can on a page. Because I can tell you, if you just throw h1 everywhere on a page, people have tried to abuse that and so our algorithms try to take that into account so it doesn't really do you that much good. So I would use it where it makes sense and more sparingly, but you can have it multiple times.
