Yes, the data is a sequence of observations in time, so a time series is probably the way to go. The first thing I would check is the presence/absence of autocorrelation both on each individual series and between the two (I am pretty sure there are, as the oil price today is very likely to influence oil price in a few days) If those autocorrelations are there, you can then check for stationarity, differenciate the series as many times as you need before achieving stationarity, and then fit a 2-component vectorial (cars bought, oil price) time series model (VAR is often used here) This would be the "orthodox" approach. However, sometimes a "wrong" model can make it just as well. I would try validation techniques for linear regression models (QQ-plots, autocorrelation on residuals tests and so on...). Most likely, you will see that the residuals (which should be just noise) show some recogniseable pattern
