Immediate solution is to add the following rule to #single_content ul margin: 0 0 0 295px; I don't like that because it's fairly absolute, though your site looks glued together well and it shouldn't hurt. I'll look for something more elegant, and if I find it, post it here. EDIT 1: Not much better, but you could add the following rule to the li elements instead: background-position: 295px 0;
