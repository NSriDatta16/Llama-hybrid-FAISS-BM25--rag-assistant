getting boolean properties from objects in jsp el

I have an instance of the following object in the jsp page context: Class User{ private boolean isAdmin; public boolean isAdmin(){return isAdmin} } How can I query the isAdmin property from the EL? This doesn't seem to work: ${user.admin} nor does this: ${user.isAdmin} thanks! -Morgan
