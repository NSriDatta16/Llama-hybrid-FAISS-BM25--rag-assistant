What should we report in our manuscript for negative binomial regression, IRR or OR?

I have applied negative binomial regression analysis for my data in SPSS. However I am not sure what do I have to report. Is it called IRR and CI or odds ratio (OR) and CI like in logistic regression. I have gone through some papers where they have reported beta, standard error and CI. But they have not mentioned anything like more likely or less likely. Can we use terms "more likely", "less likely" here in negative binomial regression? Also, If I report beta how is it interpreted?
