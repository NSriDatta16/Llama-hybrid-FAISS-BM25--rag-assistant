model time series with logistic growth and decay with fbprohet

My time series looks like this: Is fbprohet suitable for this kind of time series or would I be better of using exponential smoothing (e.g. holt) in R? I know how to use logistic rather than linear in fbprohet (mainly R) but the output does not get a nice decay after the change-point. Can I use fbprohet for this and if so which hyper parameters would I have to tune/are the most important ones?
