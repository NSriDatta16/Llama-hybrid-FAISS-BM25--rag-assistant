You can use emulators for all of the mobile platforms you've listed. For the iPhone, if you're on a Mac, you can use the native iPhone Simulator that comes with the iPhone SDK ( available here ). If you're using Windows, you can use this third-party emulator that attempts to render web pages as they would be seen on the iPhone (by forcing a specific aspect ratio and spoofing the user-agent, probably). For Android, you can use the Android emulator that comes with the Android SDK. A word of advice, though: usually, what works in the Android browser will also work in the iPhone browser, since they both use the WebKit rendering engine. For Windows mobile, you'll want to download the Windows Phone emulator available with the Windows Phone developer tools (for new, unreleased handsets), as well as the Windows Mobile 6 emulator (for the majority of current Windows Mobile handsets). Also, Flash won't work on any of the aforementioned platforms (although it will work on Android devices at some point in the future), so make sure that Flash is not integral to your web application's functionality. It doesn't hurt to check out recent mobile browser statistics , either, so you know where to focus your efforts. Hope that helps.
