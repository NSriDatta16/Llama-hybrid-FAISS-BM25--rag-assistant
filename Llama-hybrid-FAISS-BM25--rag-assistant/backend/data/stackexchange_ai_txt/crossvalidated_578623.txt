@maia, brilliant case, imputing the values is indeed not adequate for your data. In contrast, what you'd need is to predict whether the corresponding coral feature is present or absent. Basically, you'd want to predict whether the value is missing or present. From mathematical point of view you can't address this within a plain PCA (or plain SVD) framework. PCA framework is too "narrow" for your case. You'd need a framework that can bear and carry your data and has enough representative power -- you'd better treat your data as a mixture distribution . It is an adequate math framework for your case. BTW, in short, usual PCA/SVD is almost the same as GMM with the single component in the Gaussian mixture. To approach mixture distribution model you may want first to take a look at Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). As of June 2022 the best estimator for GMM is still Mclust in R, e.g. it is still smarter than GMM-estimator from sklearn Python package . The bad news is that none of those libraries are working with missing values like they should out-of-the-box ;-) There is no ready-to-use implementation for distribution mixtures with missing values so far. The world is still young.
