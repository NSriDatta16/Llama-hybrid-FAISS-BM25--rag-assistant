Silverlight3: DataGrid vertical scrollbar missing when binding to PagedCollectionView

I have a Silverlight DataGrid and I have set the ItemsSource to an instance of PagedCollectionView (I'm wanting to paginate my data with DataPagers). I've noticed that the vertical scrollbar disappears when using the PagedCollectionView - which is a problem for me because I have the DataGrid nested inside of a Grid in which the RowDefinition.Height is set to Auto (I want my DataGrid to be as big as possible). Now the DataGrid extends beyond the window. I still don't see the Scrollbar when I set VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Visible" on my DataGrid - just a gray strip where it should be. Does anyone know how I can use PagedCollectionView without having to explicitly specify the height of the DataGrid? EDIT: Woops - this was my fault. I can't remember what I did wrong (I figured out my problem a week or two ago), but it had something to do with me not paying attention to the surrounding layout. Thanks, -Charles
