WPF - Linq moved to constructor is causing null reference exception, how come?

Having been given the all clear to move code from my Page_Loaded method to the constructor (See HERE ), i am now encountering errors on my Linq to entities query. It is now causing a nullreferenceexception and i can't figure out why at the moment. See below for the exception location. public Building() { InitializeComponent(); lvBuildings.ItemsSource = App.ocBuildings; getBuildings(); } private void Page_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { } private void getBuildings() { App.ocBuildings.Clear(); var tehBuildings = from building in App.ents.Buildings where building.Organisations.OrganisationID == App.selectedOrganisation.OrganisationID select building; foreach (Buildings addBuilding in tehBuildings ( Anyone have any ideas? Thanks, Kohan.
