The author of StructureMap has discouraged the use of the XML declaration. Why not declare it with code, like this: ObjectFactory.Initialize(x => { x.For ().Use (); x.For ().Use (); x.For ().Use (); x.For ().Use (); x.For ().Use (); }); That way you won't have to guess about whether things are wired correctly. It's also much easier to maintain and less code.
