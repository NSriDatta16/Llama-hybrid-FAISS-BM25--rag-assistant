The reason for using Monte Carlo methods in the first place is that conventional methods can't be applied when dealing with intractable distributions. If your distribution is such that you consider using MCMLE, then a Bayesian estimation does not have to be easier. One of most common use cases for Monte Carlo is in Bayesian statistics, for approximating intractable posterior distributions. Estimating parameters in a Bayesian fashion you may well end up with MCMC for for approximating the posterior at every iteration.
