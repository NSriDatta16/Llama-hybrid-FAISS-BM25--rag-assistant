Are Neural Networks with a softmax output layer considered Probabilistic Classifiers?

For example, is ResNet for image classification a type of Probabilistic Classifier when we take into account the softmax at the end of the network as part of the network? My intuition points in that direction, given that it estimates the probability of an image belonging to each possible class, and then takes the class with the highest probability.
