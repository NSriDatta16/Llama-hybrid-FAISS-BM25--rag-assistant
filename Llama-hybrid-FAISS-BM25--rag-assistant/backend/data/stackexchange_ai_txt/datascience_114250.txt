Clustering might not be useful since the goal is improving a supervised learning metric (ROC-AUC) and all the data already has labels. It might be better to manually create Melanoma / Not Melanoma categories based on existing labels and then build an end-to-end deep learning system with multi-model information. This would automatically learn to weight the most important features for the task.
