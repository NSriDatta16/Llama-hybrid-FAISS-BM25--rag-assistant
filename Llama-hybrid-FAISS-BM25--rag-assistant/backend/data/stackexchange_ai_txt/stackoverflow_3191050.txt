How to move WPF window above top of screen?

I have a window with the following: Background="{x:Null}" AllowsTransparency="True" WindowStyle="None" Dragging the window by hand beyond the left, right and bottom limits of the screen results in a predictably cropped window. However this behaviour is not the same for dragging it above the top limit. Instead of cropping, it pushes it back down as if there's an automatic If Window.Top . This is probably in place so that users don't lose a Windows titlebar (which is the standard way to drag windows around, and losing sight of that effectively makes it undraggable). I don't need that as my entire window is draggable via Me.DragMove() . So, how do I let a window be dragged above the top limit of the screen ? (This is unrelated to Aero Snap which only occurs if the mouse touches the borders. I'm trying to move the window beyond visible bounds)
