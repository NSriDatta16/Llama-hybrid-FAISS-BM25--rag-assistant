How can I use var_dump + output buffering without memory errors?

I'm using a debugging aid in an application that uses var_dump() with output buffering to capture variables and display them. However, I'm running into an issue with large objects that end up using up too much memory in the buffer. function getFormattedOutput(mixed $var) { if (isTooLarge($var)) { return 'Too large! Abort!'; // What a solution *might* look like } ob_start(); var_dump($var); // Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted $data = ob_get_clean(); // Return the nicely-formated data to use later return $data } Is there a way I can prevent this? Or a work-around to detect that it's about to output a gigantic amount of info for a particular variable? I don't really have control which variables get passed into this function. It could be any type.
