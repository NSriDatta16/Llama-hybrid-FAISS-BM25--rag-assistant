I assume you want to use the Maybe monad for early termination (like break or return in C). In that case you should use MaybeT from the MaybeT package ( cabal install MaybeT ). main = do runMaybeT . forever $ do liftIO $ putStrLn "I won't stop until you type pretty please" line MaybeT is a monad transformer version of the maybe monad. Monad transformers "add functionality" to other monads.
