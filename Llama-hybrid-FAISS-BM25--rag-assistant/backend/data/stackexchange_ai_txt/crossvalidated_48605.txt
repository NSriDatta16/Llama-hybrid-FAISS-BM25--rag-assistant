For those who might be interested in an answer, this comes from a much more knowledgeable source than me (PhD candidate in NLP): When doing multiclass classification, precision and recall are really only properly defined for individual classes (you can average across classes to get a general scores for the entire system, but it's not really that useful; in my opinion, you're probably better off just using overall accuracy as your metric of performance). For an individual class, the false positives are those instances which were classified as that class, but in fact aren't, and the true negatives are those instances which are not that class, and were indeed classified as not belonging to that class (regardless of whether they were correctly classified).
