RNN sequence length and cell size

I am trying to build a RNN model to classify time series. My time series data consist of numbers with length 200. I am using tensorflow, and when i create the placeholder for the data it is like this: inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 200, 1], name='inputs') 200 is the sequence length and 1 is the features, which in my case is 1 feature per time step. And when i create the RNN using GRU cell i use this: tf.contrib.rnn.GRUCell(400) I use 400 as cell size of GRU cell because as far as i know the internal state + the inputs will be used as the new input for the next GRU cell, so i suppose the cell must be input length x 2. Is this logic of mine correct? Is the initialization of inputs correct? BATCH SIZE = None SEQUENCE LENGTH = 200 FEATURES = 1 And is the GRU cell parameters correct? CELL SIZE = 2 x SEQUENCE LENGTH? Or have i understood it incorrectly?
