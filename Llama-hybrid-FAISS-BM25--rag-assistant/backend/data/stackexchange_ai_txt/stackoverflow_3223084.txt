1) Simple answer: you can try this hack, which displays all subcategories: in administrator/components/com_virtuemart/classes/ps_product_category.php, look for the line $allowed = false; if( $depth_list[$n] > 0 ) { change it to $allowed = true; //show all by default if( $depth_list[$n] > 0 ) { 2) I think the real issue here is more your organizational/classification system... it's probably not optimal to be using categories/sub-categories to represent brands/makes as well as types-of-products. I'd suggest you look more into Virtumart documentation and read up on "Product Types" as well as "Product Attributes" -- I think these would be more suited for what you're trying to do (as I believe you can filter cross-category product-search-results by product-types) hope this helps, E
