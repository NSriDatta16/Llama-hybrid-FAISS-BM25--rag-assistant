The difference with the standard burn-in step in MCMC is that the later is usually done blindly, as a fixed fraction of the overall number of iterations, e.g., 20%. Here the burn-in or warm-up step is more actively looking for a reasonable starting point, that is, one that is compatible with the target density. The performance of the approach however depends on the mixing behaviour of the MCMC chain. If it mixes quite slowly relative to the contemplated horizon of a few hundred iterations, the chains will have likely stayed within the attraction basin of the mode found in the previous round. It would be better to consider annealed or relaxed targets during the warm-up, where flatter targets consisting of powered densities (with powers less than one) or partial posteriors (using only a fraction of the data) would be run (and the value of the actual target density monitored nonetheless). The preliminary exploration would be thus more effective and prone to leave attraction basins.
