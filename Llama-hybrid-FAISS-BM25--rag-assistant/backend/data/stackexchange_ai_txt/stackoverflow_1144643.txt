XslTransform.Transform to produce multiple output files

I need to produce multiple HTML report files from an XML data file and I'm using C# (.NET 3.5). I essentially need on HTML report for each of certain child trees in the XML file (but they have to include some parent info). I've decided to use XSLT, because it seems to be the most elegant solution to my problem. I can then use the .NET XslTransform.Transform method to create my HTML files... or can I? From reading on MSDN, it seems that even in .NET 3.5 that XslTransform only supports XSLT 1.0, even though 2.0 has been around for some time. Multiple document output from a single XSLT file only became possible in XSLT 2.0. Is there any workaround for my problem that you can think of?
