As a junior programmer myself, I thought that Id reveal what it was like when I found myself in a similar situation to your junior developer. When I first came out of uni, I found that it had severly un equipped me to deal with the real world. Yes I knew some JAVA basics and some philosophy (don't ask) but that was about it. When I first got my job it was a little daunting to say the least. Let me tell you I was probably one of the biggest cowboys around, I would hack together a little bug fix / algorithm with no comments / testing / documentation and ship it out the door. I was lucky enough to be under the supervision of a kind and very patient senior programmer. Luckily for me, he decided to sit down with me and spend 1-2 weeks going through my very hacked togethor code. He would explain where I'd gone wrong, the finer points of c and pointers (boy did that confuse me!). We managed to write a pretty decent class/module in about a week. All I can say is that if the senior dev hadn't invested the time to help me along the right path, I probably wouldn't have lasted very long. Happily, 2 years down the line, I would hope that some of my collegues might even consider me an average programmer. Take home points Most Universities are very bad at preparing students for the real world Paired programming really helped me. Thats not to say that it will help everyone but it worked for me.
