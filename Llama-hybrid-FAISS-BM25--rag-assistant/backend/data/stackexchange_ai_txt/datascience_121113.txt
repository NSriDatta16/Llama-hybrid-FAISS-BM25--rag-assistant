Most popular frameworks for distributed training of pytorch

I've done mostly single GPU training using PyTorch. I've decided recently I wish to use a distributed approach for model training on a cluster with GPUs. But I'm unsure what framework to use. I gather that, while Spark is often a preferred tool for many distributed computing needs, it doesn't work great with PyTorch. What frameworks are most commonly used? Please rank them so I know which one is most common. I asked Google Bard and it replied with the following: DeepSpeed is a distributed training framework that is built on top of PyTorch. It is designed to scale PyTorch models to large-scale clusters. DeepSpeed includes a number of features that can improve training performance, such as model parallelism, mixed precision training, and pipeline parallelism. Horovod is a distributed training framework that is compatible with a variety of deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch. Horovod provides a high-performance communication layer that can significantly improve the speed of distributed training. NCCL is a high-performance library for collective communication that is used by a number of deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch. NCCL can be used to improve the speed of distributed training by reducing the amount of time spent communicating between processes. PyTorch Lightning is a high-level library that makes it easy to build and train PyTorch models. PyTorch Lightning provides a number of features that can improve the speed and reproducibility of distributed training, such as automatic checkpointing and distributed logging. Ray is a distributed computing framework that can be used to train PyTorch models on large-scale clusters. Ray provides a number of features that can improve the speed and scalability of distributed training, such as automatic resource management and fault tolerance. Fairscale is a distributed training framework that is built on top of torch.distribute. It provides a number of features that are not available in torch.distribute, such as automatic mixed precision training, distributed logging, and distributed checkpointing. Fairscale is a good choice for users who want to take advantage of the latest features and optimizations for distributed training. torch.distribute is a distributed training framework that provides a high-level API for PyTorch. It supports a variety of training patterns, including data parallelism, model parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. I recognize there are different use cases potentially for different solutions, but, just as one can use both Tensorflow and PyTorch yet PyTorch has grown far more common ( source ), similarly, I would imagine all these frameworks aren't used equally, so I'm looking for the most common one so I can follow industry best practices. Let me know! Thanks.
