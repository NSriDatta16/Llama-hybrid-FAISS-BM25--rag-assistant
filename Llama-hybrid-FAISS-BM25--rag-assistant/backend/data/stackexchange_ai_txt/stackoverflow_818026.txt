IT concepts that help/helped you in the "real" world

Which IT concept (e.g. programming) you implement successfully outside the IT world? For example, normalizing databases are relevant to organizing my items. Understanding the real scale of information and search engine forces my to stop accumulating data (books, articles, pictures) and improve the method by which I find relevant information. deciding when to write a script to do repetitive task --> deciding when i spend to much time on processing my salads manually... I know that after all, programming is a reflection of the real world. But some concepts were not tackled until computers did everything 10000000 time faster and bigger.
