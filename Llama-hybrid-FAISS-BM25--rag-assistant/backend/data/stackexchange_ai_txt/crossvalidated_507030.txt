Yes, you can absolutely do this. One of the great things about resampling methods (including the bootstrap and jackknife) is that they really don't care how you came up with your point estimator. One thing to realize, though, is that by using these tools you're estimating the sampling variance of your estimator, which is not generally the same thing as the variance of the bayesian posterior distribution.
