There are a couple of things you can do: First -- don't worry about absolute allocated DB size unless you're running short on disk. Second -- Idera has a lot of cool SQL Server tools, one of them defrags the DB. http://www.idera.com/Content/Show27.aspx Third -- dropping and re-creating the clustered index essentially defrags the tables, too -- and it re-creates all of the non-clustered indexes (defragging them as well). Note that this will probably EXPAND the allocated size of your database (again, don't worry about it) and take a long time (clustered index rebuilds are expensive).
