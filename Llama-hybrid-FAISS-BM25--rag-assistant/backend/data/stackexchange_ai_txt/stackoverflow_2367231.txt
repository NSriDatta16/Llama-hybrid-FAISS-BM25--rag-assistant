Recommendations for a pannable-zoomable view of a single large image?

I want to display a large-ish image, around 800 x 800 pixels. I'd like to be able to pan it in all four directions by dragging with a finger. I'd also like to be able to zoom in and out. I need to be able to know the pan values and zoom values, because I have to draw small text strings at certain locations over the image. For example, if the pan is 100 pixels to the right, I need to know that so I can add that offset to all my elements. Wondering what a good way to do this is. Should I implement it myself in the paint method within a View I implement? Is there some other standard method of doing it? It's essentially like a google maps view, only one large tile, but I have to draw my pins on top of it with pan and zoom, Thanks
