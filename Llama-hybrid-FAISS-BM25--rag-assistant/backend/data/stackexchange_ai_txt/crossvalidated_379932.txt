The p-value is correct, the error lies in your method. If we plot the time series I think this will become obvious. # Data employees As you can see, it should be no surprise that the p-value is very small. Try and imagine how the black line would have to look for the p-value to be ~1. As for paired vs. unpaired. A paired test only works when the two samples you compare are of the same size (for it to be possible to "pair them up").
