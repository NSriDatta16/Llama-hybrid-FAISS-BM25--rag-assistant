What is the minimum sample size required to train a Deep Learning model - CNN?

It is true that the sample size depends on the nature of the problem and the architecture implemented. But, on average, what is the typical sample size utilized for training a deep learning framework? For instance, in a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for a frame-by-frame video processing, is there a rough estimate for the minimum no. of samples required to train the model?
