There's nothing wrong with your code but your sample is incomplete. You do not state where you are calling SomeFunction from. As has already been pointed out by dribeas you must be careful calling virtual functions from your constructor as the virtual tables are only built up as each class in the hierarchy completes construction. Edit: The following paragraph of my reply was incorrect. Apologies. It is fine to call SomeFunction from the constructor of ClassB as the vtable is in place (at least) by the end of the initialiser list i.e. once you are in the body of the constructor. It is not fine to call it from ClassA's constructor of course. Original paragraph: I suspect you must be calling SomeFunction from the constructor of ClassB at which point only the vtable up to type ClassA will be complete i.e. to the virtual dispatch mechanism your class is still of type ClassA. It only becomes an object of type ClassB when the constructor completes.
