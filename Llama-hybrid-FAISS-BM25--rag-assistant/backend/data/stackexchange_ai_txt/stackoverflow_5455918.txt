create view with indexes

I wanted to create a view, that will exhibit the same property as the table it queries from CREATE VIEW Agent_View AS SELECT * FROM Agent_table I want to know if I need to create the same indexes as the Agent_table in the Agent_View also. Do I need to declare the Agent_View as schemabound to create index. Is there any workaround to create indexes without declaring as schemabound ?
