Well, building a parser is pretty complex and you can use regex but that's not the only things you use. I suggest to read the Dragon Book These days, in my opinion, you should use a parser generator because you can do it from scratch but it's not simple nor quick to do. You have to consider, generally speaking, regex and finite state automata for the lexical analysis; context-free grammars, LL parsers, bottom-up parsers, and LR parsers for Syntax analysis etc...etc...
