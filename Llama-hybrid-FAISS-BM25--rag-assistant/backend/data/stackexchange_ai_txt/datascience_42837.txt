Will I be qualified for data science roles with a PhD in Engineering and Machine Learning?

Currently doing a funded PhD in Civil Engineering using Machine learning applications. In essence data driven modelling of a niche area of engineering (to do with some material deformation predictions etc.) I have a years experience working as a Civil Engineer on site, and have a first class MEng in Civil & Structural Engineering. I think I would really enjoy data science, and I am wondering if my PhD will provide a good stepping stone for this? And if so, what are some other things I can do to really make myself stand out as a data scientist?
