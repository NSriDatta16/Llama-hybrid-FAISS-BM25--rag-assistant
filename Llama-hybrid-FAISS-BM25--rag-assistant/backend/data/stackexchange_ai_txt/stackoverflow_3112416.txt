From here: http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=575410 "Excessive nestedjarNNN.tmp files in the tmp directory. The VFS unwraps nested jars by extracting the nested jar into a tmp file in the java tmp directory. This can result in a large number of files that fill up the tmp directory. You can disable this behavior by setting -Djboss.vfs.forceNoCopy=true on command line used to start jboss. This will be enabled by default in a future release, JBAS-4389."
