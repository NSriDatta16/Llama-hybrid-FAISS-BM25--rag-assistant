I think a t-test for independent groups is in order here. Different group sizes can be addressed with a Pooled variance. It is a weighted average of the group-specific variances, with greater weight given to whichever group has the larger sample size. A Pooled variance estimate is used if one is willing to assume a constant variance across the groups. If there is some doubt about the constant variance assumption, then use the Pooled Variance calculation for unequal variance. See the following Wikipedia pages for the exact formulas: Independent two-sample t-test
