It has alot to do with the signature of the function. One of the benefits of using .h files is that when someone comes along and wants to get a sense of what your program/api does, they can look at your header file and get a sense of what operations are being carried out, their inputs and outputs, how everything is going together, etc. If you were to come across a method like int doStuff(int,int) this would be alot less telling than a method with a signature of say: int doStuff(int firstNumberToAdd, int secondNumberToAdd); with the second, you at least get some idea of the operations that are being carried out, and what is happening. This is the idea behind writing self documenting code. If your interested, you may check out Code Complete by Steve McConnell.
