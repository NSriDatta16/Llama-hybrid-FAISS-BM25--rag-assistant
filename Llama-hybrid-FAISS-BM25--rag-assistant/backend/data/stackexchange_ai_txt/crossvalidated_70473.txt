If your outcome variable is dichotomous, then logistic regression is the place to start; linear regression cannot be correct here. In statistics, we call "removing their effect" controlling . To control for variables we simply enter them into the right side of the regression equation. Then the result for exvar will account for those. Whether to include them is a question of model development or variable selection, which is a big topic that has been discussed a lot here. My view is that if you have theoretical reasons to include them, you should include them. However, if the exvar is strongly related to varA, varB or varC you may have problems with collinearity.
