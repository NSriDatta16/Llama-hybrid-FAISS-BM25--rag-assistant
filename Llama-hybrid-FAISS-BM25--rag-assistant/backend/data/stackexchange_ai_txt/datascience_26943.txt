How to initialize word-embeddings for Out of Vocabulary Word?

I am trying to use CoNLL-2003 NER (English) Dataset and I am trying to utilize pretrained embeddings for it. I am using SENNA pretrained embeddings. Now I have around 20k words in my vocabulary and out of this I have embedding available for only 9.5k words. My current approach is to initialize an array of 20k X embedding_size with zeros and initialize the 9.5k words whose embeddings is known to me and make all the embeddings learn-able. My question is what is the best way to do this? Any reference to such research will be very helpful ? I have also asked a similar question later on Stackoverflow, here is the link.
