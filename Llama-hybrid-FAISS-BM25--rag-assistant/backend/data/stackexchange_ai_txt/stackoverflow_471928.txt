Way to have compiled python files in a separate folder?

Is it possible to have Python save the .pyc files to a separate folder location that is in sys.path ? /code foo.py foo.pyc bar.py bar.pyc To: /code foo.py bar.py /code_compiled foo.pyc bar.pyc I would like this because I feel it'd be more organized. Thanks for any help you can give me.
