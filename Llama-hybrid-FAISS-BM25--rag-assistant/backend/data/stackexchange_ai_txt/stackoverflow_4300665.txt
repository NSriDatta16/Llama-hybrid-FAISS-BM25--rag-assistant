there is nothing in the AIR sdk that will do this. it's up the operating system of your file to handle the file icons. i mean, you might be able to assign dynamically generated icons to that file, but you would have to create the icon, write it to your applicationStorageDirectory (ideally) and let your app assign the icon from there, assuming you could find a good way to dynamically change your app.xml file to point to your new icon file, which i don't believe is possible. however, if your operating system can change your file icon, you can call native process on the file to handle the change this way. for example, under Mac OS X, you can both automatically create and assign a new icon for an image file of the image contained in the file by writing the following command in Terminal: $ sips -i FILE_NAME therefore, if you deploy and AIR application for Mac OS X with a native installer, you can call that command on an image file using a Native Process.
