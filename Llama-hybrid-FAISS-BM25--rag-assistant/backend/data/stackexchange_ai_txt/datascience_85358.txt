What is the difference between active learning and reinforcement learning?

From Wikipedia: Active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to label new data points with the desired outputs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. How to distinguish them? What are the exact differences?
