Node classification with random labels for GNNs

I decided to train GCN on the Cora dataset for the node classification task, however, with the random labels, i.e., applying np.random.shuffle(labels) . For the default set of parameters, I am getting an accuracy of around 0.3 for the test set and 0.4 for the train set. I expect that for the random labels, the accuracy would be 1/number of classes . So in the case of Cora: 1/7 = 0.14 . Do you have any intuition why graph neural networks perform better than the random case? I am aware that in [1] authors trained the models on the random labels and achieved perfect results on the train set. However, for test size they still were around the 1/number of classes . I checked simpler models such as RandomForests or SVC and the final accuracy for the test size is indeed 1/7. [1] Zhang, C., Bengio, S., Hardt, M., Recht, B., & Vinyals, O. (2021).
