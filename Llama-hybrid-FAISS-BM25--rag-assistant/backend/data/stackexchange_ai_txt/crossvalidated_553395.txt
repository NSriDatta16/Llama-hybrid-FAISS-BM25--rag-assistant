SARIMA: Determining the integration number

i am working with a time series that after calculating the first difference, it remains non-stationary. When plotting the series I see there is some seasonality at half and end of year. I would like to know how should i determine the parameters of the SARIMA(P,I,Q) model. Should i be looking at the ACF and PACF of the first difference of my series in order to determine P and Q, our should the ACF and PACF be for some adjustment of my series? Finally, i would really like to know how to determine the parameter I. Should i just run the SARIMA for I=0,1,2 and see what is best? In particular, when would I=0? here is my series (after first difference): I'll appreciate any guidence
