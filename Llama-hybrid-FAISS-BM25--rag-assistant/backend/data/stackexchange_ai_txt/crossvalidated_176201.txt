The above answer may be incorrect see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMyXc3SiEqs It seems that average adds up all the combinations of distances between the elements of cluster 1 and cluster 2 - that is n^2 distances added together and then divides by n^2 to the average. Centroid method first computes the average of each cluster within itself. Then it calculates one distance between those average points.
