get predictability of word given sentence in python

I have a paragraph and I want to get the probability (p(word | context) ) of each word, given previous words, for various models (e.g. pre-trained LSTM). Where can pretrained models would allow me to do this? Can someone provide an example as to how to fo this in Python?
