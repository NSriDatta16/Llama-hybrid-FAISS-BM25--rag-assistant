A few words about dependency ranges and SNAPSHOT dependencies (quoting the Dependency Mediation and Conflict Resolution design document): Incorporating SNAPSHOT versions into the specification Resolution of dependency ranges should not resolve to a snapshot (development version) unless it is included as an explicit boundary. There is no need to compile against development code unless you are explicitly using a new feature, under which the snapshot will become the lower bound of your version specification. As releases are considered newer than the snapshot they belong to, they will be chosen over an old snapshot if found. So, to answer your question, the only way to use a SNAPSHOT with dependency ranges is as boundary and you won't get higher SNAPSHOT versions automatically by design (which really makes sense). Personally, I don't like to use dependency ranges because I find that it can lead to build reproducibility issues and makes the build more fragile. I do not recommend them. Just in case, upgrading the SNAPSHOT version typically means that you are releasing some code and the maven release plugin provides support for that (see the Updating POM Versions ).
