I don't believe that it's possible to extend an existing .NET type once it's created. If all you need is a byte[] (in IronPython, I presume), you can do: >>> import clr >>> import System >>> b = bytes([1, 2, 3, 4]) >>> a = System.Array[bytes](b) >>> a Array[bytes]((b'\x01', b'\x02', b'\x03', b'\x04')) However, it's unlikely that IronPython will ever allow access to Bytes' underlying storage (unless CPython does), as it's not safe.
