One possible approach is to organize your files: by projects (like Jonathan's suggestion: loose term for "coherent groups of files" for a common purpose) by packaging type, meaning: simple collection of files (loose and custom organization), or predefined structure of directories (always the same structure for every project, works well for development projects), or zip files (for easy synchronization / backup) I have a zone where I put all important files/projects in compressed file in order to synchronize that directory with its mirror between my different computers (compressed files means less files to synchronize, means a quicker synchronization process. Works for backup too)
