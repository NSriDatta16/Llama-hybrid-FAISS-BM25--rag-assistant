Images and Caching - same image after name change

I've got a mysterious problem with images and caching. In my project I've got 20 photos that elegantly fade in and out with a random function that changes up the order a bit. I found that I didn't like one image in particular, image_1.png and wanted to push it back in the rotation (each time the app starts the images start with image_1.png). So, I swapped the name of image_1.png with that of image_16.png. When I look at image in the project folder and in Resources indeed the images are as they should be but when I run the app its the same old image that starts things out. I have reset the sim, deleted the app from my iPhone, removed the images from the project and reimported them and still the same image. Even odder.. I have an image_0.png that is no longer in the project file at all ... its not even on my hard drive.... but it shows up as well. Do I have a ghost in my Mac or is this just seriously persistent cache?
