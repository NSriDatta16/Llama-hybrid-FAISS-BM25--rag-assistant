Estimate model parameters for a process that can abruptly change at some random point in time

I have two data streams y and x from which I can observe yt and xt at time t. I can always define a specific model yt=f(xt) where f is a non-linear function defined by some parameters, θ. There is a non-zero chance that the state governing this process may change abruptly. In such a case the parameters of the model change but the relationship yt=f(xt) still holds with the new parameters. I can estimate the parameters at any time by fitting the model on a period of training data, as long as the process is in a constant state during the training period. My current approach to this is to fit a model, then monitor the residuals for changepoints, if one occurs then I would need to fit a new model. The problem is that a change point could be the result in a change in a single parameter or subset of the parameters and I loose out on the past information when I fit a new model; not only that but the amount of data that I need to train a model from scratch may be longer than the time between two changepoints in certain cases, and it is really important that I catch the changepoints. What I would like is a model that will tell me at any time what the most likely parameters are, when it is likely that the underlying process has changed, and what the new parameters likely are. My instinct is to use bayesian inference to find something like p(θ|yt,xt, θt-1), but I am not really sure what class of model this would fall under or what type of processes I should be reading about.
