I assume you get this error in calls on the courses object? I don't know very much about how Squeryl works, but I believe that the OneToMany[Course] is a live object. That means that the calls on the courses object need a session since any call may lazily go to the database to fetch data. How you organise this depends on what type of application you use. In a web application it often makes sense to add a filter (first point of entry) to start and stop the transaction. In a GUI client, say a swing application, it's a good solution to start the transaction at the point where you receive the user interaction. That way you get transactions that are not to long and also stretches over calls which you expect to be performed atomically (either fully or not at all).
