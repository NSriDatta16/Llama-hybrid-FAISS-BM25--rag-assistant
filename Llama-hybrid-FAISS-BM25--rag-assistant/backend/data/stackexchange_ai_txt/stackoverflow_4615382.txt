How is the Correct use of ui:repeat tag to build a selctOneMenu in XHTML using JBoss Seam Framework?

This is suppose to be quite simple but I have already spent couple of hours on this without solution. My fragment of code follows: The point is the "Testes" string is correctly printed as many times as the size of carroList.resultList but no options is printed. I get a blank combo. tx in advance.
