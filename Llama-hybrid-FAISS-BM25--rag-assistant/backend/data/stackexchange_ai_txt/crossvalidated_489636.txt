Despite the title -- which is software-specific -- there are some statistical issues within this thread. A probability density necessarily integrates to $1$ over the range of the data. In your case the empirical range is about $1$ or $2 \times 10^{-3}$ or more plainly about $0.001$ or $0.002$ . So the average density should be between $1000$ and $500$ , which checks out visually. Otherwise put, probability density is not probability and isn't obliged to be $ at all. Formal goodness-of-fit tests are in essence a waste of time and effort for sample sizes this large. Even a well-fitting distribution will usually fail a significance test as being discrepant in details. The practical questions are whether the fitted distribution fits well enough for what you want to do next and whether there are other distributions that fit better. This issue has been much discussed on CV. Opinion, backed up by logic and experience: histograms are a mediocre graphical method for this problem. In fact, it is hard to see one distribution at all on your plot. Dedicated quantile plots usually work much better.
