You overlooked this paragraph in the 4. part of the tutorial: In previous parts of the tutorial, the templates have been provided with a context that contains the poll and latest_poll_list context variables. However, the generic views provide the variables object and object_list as context. Therefore, you need to change your templates to match the new context variables. Go through your templates, and modify any reference to latest_poll_list to object_list , and change any reference to poll to object .
