Why are you setting the $_SESSION['username'] variable again on login_success.php You're setting the variables on check_login.php, correct? Here is what I would do On login_success.php print out your session variables to see whats going on. I can almost gaurantee something is happening with your sql query. Set a condition to make sure you're actually getting results. print_r($_SESSION); if(!$_SESSION['username']) die('no session user name'); $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'"; $result = mysql_query($result); if(mysql_num_rows($result) == 1){ $_SESSION['username'] = mysql_result($result,0,'username'); //why do you need this? $_SESSION['permissions'] = mysql_result($result,0,'permissions'); mysql_close(); } else die('no user found'); Also on your checklogin page change the if statement to look for an actual variable in $_SESSION['username'] not just if it is set, I try to stay away from isset(). For the love of god don't store plain text passwords, it doesn't cost anything to implement a secure password hashing scheme. Its super easy to leverage php's crypt() function, also check this out for an open source secure method. http://www.openwall.com/phpass/
