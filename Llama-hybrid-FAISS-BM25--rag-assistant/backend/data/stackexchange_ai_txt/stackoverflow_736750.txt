[...] But I need to create the directories in application directory. I am using: var dir = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath("upload directory");dir.createDirectory(); And I am getting: at runtime::SecurityManager$/checkPrivilegeForCaller() This is a know issue. AIR wouldn't allow you to write to the application directory.
