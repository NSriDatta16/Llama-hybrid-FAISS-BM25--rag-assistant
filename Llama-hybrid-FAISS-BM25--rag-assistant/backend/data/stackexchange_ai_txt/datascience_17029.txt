For learning kernel/filter matrix in convolution layer, we find partial derivative of loss w.r.t. filter matrix and use gradient descent method to update filters. $$ W = W - \alpha\frac{\partial L}{\partial W} $$ Convolutional Neural Networks also use back-propagation algorithm to find partial derivatives of loss w.r.t. filter matrix.
