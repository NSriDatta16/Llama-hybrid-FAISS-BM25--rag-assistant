In addition to the useful comments about image processing, it also sounds like you're dealing with a clustering problem . Clustering algorithms come from the machine learning literature, specifically unsupervised learning . As the name implies, the basic idea is to try to identify natural clusters of data points within some large set of data. For example, the picture below shows how a clustering algorithm might group a bunch of points into 7 clusters (indicated by circles and color): (source: natekohl.net ) In your case, a clustering algorithm would attempt to repeatedly merge small cracks to form larger cracks, until some stopping criteria is met. The end result would be a smaller set of joined cracks. Of course, cracks are a little different than two-dimensional points -- part of the trick in getting a clustering algorithm to work here will be defining a useful distance metric between two cracks. Popular clustering algorithms include k-means clustering ( demo ) and hierarchical clustering . That second link also has a nice step-by-step explanation of how k-means works. EDIT : This paper by some engineers at Phillips looks relevant to what you're trying to do: Chenn-Jung Huang, Chua-Chin Wang, Chi-Feng Wu, " Image Processing Techniques for Wafer Defect Cluster Identification ," IEEE Design and Test of Computers, vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 44-48, March/April, 2002. They're doing a visual inspection for defects on silicon wafers, and use a median filter to remove noise before using a nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm to detect the defects. Here are some related papers/books that they cite that might be useful: M. Taubenlatt and J. Batchelder, “ Patterned Wafer Inspection Using Spatial Filtering for Cluster Environment ,” Applied Optics, vol. 31, no. 17, June 1992, pp. 3354-3362. F.-L. Chen and S.-F. Liu, “ A Neural-Network Approach to Recognize Defect Spatial Pattern in Semiconductor Fabrication. ” IEEE Trans. Semiconductor Manufacturing, vol. 13, no. 3, Aug. 2000, pp. 366-373. G. Earl, R. Johnsonbaugh, and S. Jost, Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J., 1996.
