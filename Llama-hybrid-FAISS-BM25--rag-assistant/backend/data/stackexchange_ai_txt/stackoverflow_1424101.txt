Open source server application for exception handling?

Is there some open source alternative to Hoptoad and Exceptioneer ? We would like to host the exception "aggregation" application at our site. We receive tens of .NET exceptions from users in the field each day. Thus we need a way to organize them, find duplicates and prioritize fixing the exceptions that happen most often. Hoptoad is nice and easy to use, but based on our initial tests it didn't perform too well in matching similar exceptions and it doesn't seem to support storing/displaying all the information we need. I am looking for a tool that could be extended for our needs and deployed on our servers. Any tips?
