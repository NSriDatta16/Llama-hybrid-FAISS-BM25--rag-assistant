How to mask particular segment of images while training CycleGAN?

Say I am using a CycleGAN to generate Zebra from Horse . But for my case, there is also deer present in both of the images, and I don't want to change the deer from my input and keep them the same in output, only changing horse to zebra. So, I guess I have to mask the deer in my training label so that the generator does not learn to change it. How can I achieve that? Does anyone have any idea? (Let's say I have deer/not-deer mask for all my training data)
