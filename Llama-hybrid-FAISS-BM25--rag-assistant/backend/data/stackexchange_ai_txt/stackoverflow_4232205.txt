What is important here is: you need to have your data model well-defined independently of OpenGL . So all the blocks, their positions, rotations, etc- all of this need to be kept in your memory and updated by your CPU code. Then it gets simple: you send your data to OpenGL and have it rendered. Not the other way round: you don't retrieve the information about objects' position from GL. OpenGL is not a storage place for your logic's data.
