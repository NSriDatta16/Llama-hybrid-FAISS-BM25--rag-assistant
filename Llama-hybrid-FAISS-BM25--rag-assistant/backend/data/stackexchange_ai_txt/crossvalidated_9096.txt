Linear or monotonic trend tests--$M^2$ association measure, WMW test cited by @GaBorgulya, or the Cochran-Armitage trend test--can also be used, and they are well explained in Agresti ( CDA , 2002, §3.4.6, p. 90). The latter is actually equivalent to a score test for testing $H_0:\; \beta = 0$ in a logistic regression model, but it can be computed from the $M^2$ statistic, defined as $(n-1)r^2$ ($\sim\chi^2(1)$ for large sample), where $r$ is the sample correlation coefficient between the two variables (the ordinal measure being recoded as numerical scores), by replacing $n-1$ with $n$ (ibid., p. 182). It is easy to compute in any statistical software, but you can also use the coin package in R (I provided an example of use for a related question ). Sidenote If you are using R, you will find useful resources in either Laura Thompson's R (and S-PLUS) Manual to Accompany Agresti’s Categorical Data Analysis (2002) , which shows how to replicate Agresti's results with R, or the gnm package (and its companion packages, vcd and vcdExtra ) which allows to fit row-column association models (see the vignette, Generalized nonlinear models in R: An overview of the gnm package ).
