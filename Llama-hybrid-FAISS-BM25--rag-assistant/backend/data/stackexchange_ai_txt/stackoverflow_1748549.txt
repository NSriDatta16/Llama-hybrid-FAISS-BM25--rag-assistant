A DIV is a block level container. The second example can't contain anything... so my bet would be no (for an HTML4 doctype) If you want to use a dummy element for clearing purposes - have you considered ? Edit There are more effective ways of clearing than using using a block level container. Applying a clear class to is one example - but 'overflow: hidden' on the parent element is usually much more elegant.
