UAProf document of a mobile device can very often be found in the HTTP headers x-wap-profile or Profile , otherwise you can check the Opt headers. See this UAProf info for more information. Here is an example UAProf document for a nokia It seems not all devices will provide these headers, which I guess is the problem you are having. You could also search for it manually on http://www.uaprof.com/ There are other ways to find device capabilities, for example have a look at the WURFL xml document which lists many devices and capabilities. At the moment I am using the WURFL and looking for the device by User Agent string provided, but in some cases the device is missing or a new update has come out affecting the user agent string and it has not been added into the WURFL release yet. So still a fallback needs to be considered... partial user agent string match? UAProf?
