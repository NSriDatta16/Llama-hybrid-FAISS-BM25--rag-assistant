The full paper, for anyone else who wants to look, is here (the citation is in @Ino's comment; I will put it in the text of the question). $\Delta \eta_{it}$ certainly looks like an error term. First, it's the last term in the formula and that's often the error term. Second, in the formula just above it, they also don't define the (different) error term. I admit I don't rememeber ever seeing the $\Delta$ (for change) in the error term this way, but I am not an econometrician. (I added "econometrics" as a tag, so maybe this will attract their attention).
