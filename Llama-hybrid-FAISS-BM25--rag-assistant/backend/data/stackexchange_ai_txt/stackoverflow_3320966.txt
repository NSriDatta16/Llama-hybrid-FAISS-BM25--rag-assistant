How to get past embedding a html form for paypal buttons asp.net

I have some experience of using paypal with an asp.net website, however this issue has me really stumped. Root of the problem: You cant embed the html form for the paypal button inside your page form. Original solution: Originally my website was using multiple aspx pages so I could simply arrange my form tags so that they weren't embedded inside one another. My website now uses a master aspx page which draws in different ascx controls. This means that I do not have the option of arranging the form tags around the page so need a work around. NB. I have looked all over the place for simple solutions but it is a jungle out there, paypal is a nightmare. I did find something on ghost form which is all in c#. Might help... Thanks in advance for any help....
