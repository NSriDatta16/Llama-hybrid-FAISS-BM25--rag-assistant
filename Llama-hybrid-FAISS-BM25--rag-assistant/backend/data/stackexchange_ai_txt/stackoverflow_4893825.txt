Different View Engine for Portable Area

I'm using ASP.NET MVC 2 and MvcContrib 2 portable areas. The consuming application is leveraging a CustomWebFormViewEngine which is derived from the standard WebForm view engine. I want the portable area "Foo" to utilize the standard portable area embedded view engine. How do I go about doing this, without affecting the consuming application? The consuming app is doing this: ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new CustomWebFormViewEngine())); I can NOT do something like the following in the portable area, since that will clear off the CustomWebFormViewEngine from the consuming application: ViewEngines.Clear(); ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new WebFormViewEngine())); So how do I get it so that a given portable area leverages the embedded view engine, but the rest of the application continues to use the CustomWebFormViewEngine ?
