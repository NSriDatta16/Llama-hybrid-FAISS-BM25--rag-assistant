How to shift the start of an array in C#?

I'm trying to reorganize an array based on the first occurrence of a value (thus simulating similar functionality to a circular array.) For example, in the following array I wish the first occurrence of the value 6 to become the new first element, and prior elements to become the latter: So: int[] myArray = {2, 3, 6, 1, 7, 6}; Becomes: myArray = {6, 1, 7, 6, 2, 3}; What is the "best" way to achieve this?
