Chebyshev and similar +/- one sigma intervals refer to arithmetic mean and std, not to geometric ones. If you think your $X$ is lognormal, then construct an "arithmetic" -/+ one $\sigma$ interval for $log(X)$, then exponentiate it to get the CI for $X$. In other words, you have zero chance of constructing an interval with the expected coverage the way you did because for lognormal such interval should not be symmetric around the mean. After you exponentiate, you'll see that the CI became asymmetric wrt the arithmetic mean of $X$.
