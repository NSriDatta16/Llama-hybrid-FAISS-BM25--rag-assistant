When the shallow network has a small number of neurons, how it will need more sum-product?

I am reading a paper, where I am not able to understand the meaning of the following statement, can someone please help. a shallow network requires exponentially many more sum-product hidden units than a deep sum-product network in order to compute certain families of polynomials. On the Number of Linear Regions of Deep Neural Networks Paticuality my question is, when the shallow network has a small number of neurons, how it will need more sum-product?
