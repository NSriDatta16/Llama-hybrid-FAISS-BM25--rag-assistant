jBPM/Seam Recipes?

I'd like to learn a bit more about jBPM and how I can leverage it within my JBoss Seam-based application. I've taken a look at the documentation, and written a couple of basic test applications to get comfortable with it, however I'd like to learn a bit more about best practices and real-world scenarios using jBPM. Does anyone know of any good resources for finding "jBPM recipes" or real-world examples? Things like a user registration system for a website, trouble ticketing, eCommerce order processing, etc. I'd like to see how other people are structuring their business processes to get a sense of what to do (and what not to do) when using jBPM.
