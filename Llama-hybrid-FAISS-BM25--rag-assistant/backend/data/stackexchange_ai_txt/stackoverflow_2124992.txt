What your looking for is just to put the variables in the global scope. I don't know what you mean about "not declared in this scope" errors, because the following works just fine: #include using namespace std; int s1, s2, a[25], b[25]; inline bool del(int n) { int x = s1 + s2; int i; for(i=0;i > s1 >> s2 >> m >> n; for(i=0;i > a[i]; for(i=0;i > b[i]; for(i=m;i As you can see, I've declared them globally and use them in del(). However, this is bad practice and you should be using OOP w/ structs or classes to pass and organize your data.
