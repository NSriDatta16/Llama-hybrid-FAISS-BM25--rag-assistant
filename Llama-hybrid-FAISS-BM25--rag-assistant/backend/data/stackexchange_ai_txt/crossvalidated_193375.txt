Steps in performing a time-series analysis

I'm thinking of running a time series on stock prices and the affect demographic variables may have on them. This would include testing how the size of particular age groups (i.e., 20-39, 40-64, 65+) may affect the price-to-dividend ratio (i.e., stock prices). I was hoping someone might have some advice on the steps to complete. I'm thinking the steps should be: Dickey-Fuller for unit root test test for cointegration (e.g. Johanssen??) structural change (Chow test, or Gregory and Hansen?) for potential rapid increase in 40-64 age group in 1990s. Should I be testing with anything else, e.g., Whites, Jarque-Bera, ADF, Ramsay's RESET test? This is my first crack at econometrics and a time series, therefore naive and unknowledgable, would be delighted to hear how someone more experience would tackle this.
