Advises to organize this in PHP?

I'm developing a CMS for a client where he can only access it with a password. In this site he can edit, delete, create new articles. I use this system: classes called by the "action files" than handle data, process and output them php files that print the html code received from the classes The problem is that with the "action" files. for action files I mean the files that receive the forms data and requests and send them to the classes to handle. Last time I made a single file with a switch with for example "delete_article", "create_article" etc with the relative method to call but this becomes easily a MESS. I was wondering if there could be simplest ways to organize this. Maybe just doing php file for every "action" I wanna do? Please considering I'm just starting with OOP so I could have said a lot stupid things :D
