Dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or Diffusion maps can be very effective because they integrate local distances. If two points differ at a feature by a logical $1$, then this information is fully taken into account; the result won't be affected by the distribution of $1$'s over the entire data set. Also, you are free to normalize your data as you like. (Note however, that how you choose to normalize your data affects the way distances are measured between your data points.) These non-linear methods require more computation time, but in my experience I think $100,000$ points and $1,000$ features will be able to be done within $1$-$2$ days.
