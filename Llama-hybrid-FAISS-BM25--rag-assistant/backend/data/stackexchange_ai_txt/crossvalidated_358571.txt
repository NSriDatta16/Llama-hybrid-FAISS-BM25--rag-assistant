All of the approaches you have mentioned are valid ones: I would go with the last one (timedelta) - in my experience it produces good results. If you don't want to weight some of the intermediate outputs you could use a temporal sample weights from keras and set their weights to almost 0 effectively excluding their contribution to the average loss.
