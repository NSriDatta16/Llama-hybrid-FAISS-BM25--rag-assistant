It is bad idea. Junior or not junior developers should directly impact the code. If ordinary developer can work with your code with minimal start cost, then it will be great proof that your code is maintainable. If novice developer will break something, then your unit testing needs more attention. But if you will keep creating extra artifacts, which are not part of end product, then you as a team on the way of increasing costs with no reason.
