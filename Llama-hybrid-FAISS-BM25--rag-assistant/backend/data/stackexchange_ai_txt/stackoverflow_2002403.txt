Prevent Adblock Users from Accessing Website?

Im one of the Users who use Adblock. And i love it. That question could be interesting for all of us. Once i visited a german developer website, I just saw a jquery fancybox, on that box there was a Message something like this: " You are using Adblock, this site is financed with ads. If you want be able to see the content deactivate Adblock or Remove it. " First i thought WOW thats funny. Im sure there is also an hack for this. Just using another user agent would give you access to the website content or not? ididnt tested but it could be Possible. In Future most Website Owners will prevent Users seeing the content of the site who uses Adblock. How could we implement an Script like the above? nomatter which language we use javascript,php,asp,jsp and how could we hack it? with hack i mean seeing the content without deactivating the Adblock.
