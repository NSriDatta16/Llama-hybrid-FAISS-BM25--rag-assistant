To elaborate on RageZ's answer, getpeername() is returning the source port and address of the other side of your socket. Port 12345 is the address of the destination that you passed to bind(). In general, clients (e.g. telnet, nc, etc...) will not have called bind() on their socket because they don't want to listen for connections. So the OS will assign them an arbitrary "ephemeral" port number. In general, there is little to no utility in knowing the source port of a TCP connection.
