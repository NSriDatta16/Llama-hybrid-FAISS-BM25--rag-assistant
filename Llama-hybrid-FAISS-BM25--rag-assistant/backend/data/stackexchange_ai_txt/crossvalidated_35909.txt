How to model a linear regression based on time?

I have some training set data variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, and $x_5$ and a response variable $y$. But these are time series data. So the for the same set of values of $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, and $x_5$ the response variable $y$ may be different in different observations. Can anyone please suggest me how to model my linear regression in this case? I am learning newly statistics. Please explain in the simplest way possible. I am uploading a picture explaining the same question for more clarity
