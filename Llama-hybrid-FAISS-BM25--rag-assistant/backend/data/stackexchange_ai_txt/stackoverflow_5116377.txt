IIS Metabase GetObject call returning error 424 object required error

We have an ASP Classic website running on Windows Server 2003 and IIS6 which is throwing intermittent runtime error 424 object required. We've tracked this down to the line which initialises the object reference to the metabase as shown below (second line): MetaBasePath="IIS://" & ComputerName & "/" & StorageKey & "/" & DataAccessKey Set ConfigKey=GetObject(MetaBasePath) DataSource=ConfigKey.Get("ODBCDataSource") UserName=ConfigKey.Get("ODBCUserName") Password=ConfigKey.Get("ODBCPassword") I've searched stackoverflow (and the web in general) for any signs of anyone else having this issue but have drawn a blank. Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this? Are there any performance related settings which control the frequency of access to the Metabase? Are there any best practice measure we can employ to improve the efficiency of Metabase access? Are we correct in assuming that we are doing the right thing by hiding our database access details in the Metabase or is this overkill in terms of security? This issue affects us on approximately 1% of page hits. We are looking at a range of actions including checking the patch level of the server software components and potentially adding a loop around the above code to keep trying until the Metabase object is initialised correctly but this would at best be a short term fix in my opinion. Advice most welcome! Thanks, Craig. Additional info: Just discovered that IIS5.0 Isolation Mode is enabled. I'm trying to find out why this was enabled but could this be relevant?
