magento - add links to footer but not to top navigational menu

I want to add links to the footer - such as Customer service etc.. I do this by editing the CMS static block, footer links. However when I do this, they also appear in the very top menu. Anyone know how to add links to the footer without them appearing in the top navigational menu? Regards and thanks, Fiona
