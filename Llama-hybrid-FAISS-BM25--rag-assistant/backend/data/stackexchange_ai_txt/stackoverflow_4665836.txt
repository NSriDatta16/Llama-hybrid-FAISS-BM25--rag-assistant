I saw ur tag on window service, but if your program is developed in windows application and there is no need for a separate window service program. Maybe u want to try using the registry? HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run Adding a program to this registry will allow it to run on startup. However if security is concerned, I would encourage using window service then. Be sure to set your window service startup type to Automatic, user account will be Local System, and check allow user interaction. In the code for service start, launch your program. Of cause this method launch once your computer starts. If a user logout and login again, it will not be launched again. Need additional code to tidy up on this part
