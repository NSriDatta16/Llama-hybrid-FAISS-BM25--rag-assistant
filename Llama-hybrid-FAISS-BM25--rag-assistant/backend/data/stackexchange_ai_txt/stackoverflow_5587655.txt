_Pragma not working

I am trying to use #pragma inside #define . I am doing something like this: // I assume this is a correct syntax. Please point out if it is wrong #define COVERAGE(x) _Pragma (Coverage_tool #x) And then inside the code I am using it as COVERAGE(off) or COVERAGE(on). Here on and off are strings. But when I do this I get a compilation error saying "expected ) near off". I also tried "off" / "on" with quotes (regular strings.) But still same error. Any idea what is the problem?
