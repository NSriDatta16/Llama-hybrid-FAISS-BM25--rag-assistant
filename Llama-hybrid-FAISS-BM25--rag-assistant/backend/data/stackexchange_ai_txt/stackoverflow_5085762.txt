creating formatted PNG 'pages' of document using Java/Scala

I have a document in a scala.xml tree (this is easy to convert to whatever else) that I'd like to take and turn into a series of PNG files. For example, the document might look like this: Paragraph one goes here Paragraph two goes here Paragraph one goes here Paragraph two goes here I'd then like to turn that document into a PNG that looks something like this minus the red lines under made-up words (I'd supply the rules for formatting, typefaces to use, etc etc): And, if possible, longer documents should be able to be "paginated" into any number of PNG files that would flow into the next one after hitting say, 500px of height or something. If there is an existing Java library/package to do this that does any part of this (or a couple that manage to do it all put together)â€”great! Otherwise, I'd like to know where I should start for writing something to do this in Scala (preferably) or Java. Thanks!
