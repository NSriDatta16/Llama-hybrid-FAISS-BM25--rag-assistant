The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Content-Length = "Content-Length" ":" 1*DIGIT An example is Content-Length: 1024 Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of the message-body. In PHP you would use something like this. header("Content-Length: ".filesize($filename)); In case of "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" the encoded data is sent to the processing agent designated so you can set the length or size of the data you are going to post.
