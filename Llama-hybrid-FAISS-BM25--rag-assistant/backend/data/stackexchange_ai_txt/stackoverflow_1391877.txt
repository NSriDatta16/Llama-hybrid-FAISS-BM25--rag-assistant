Simile Timeline

I'm sure many will know of Simile Timeline ( http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/ ), the JavaScript-based widget for embedding interactive timelines into web sites. Timeline is open source software and is licensed under the BSD license. How would I go about using Similie Timeline in a Java desktop application that has no Internet access?
