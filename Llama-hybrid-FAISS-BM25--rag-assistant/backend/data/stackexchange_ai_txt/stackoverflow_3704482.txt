Two workarounds from this page: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=1082a452e274f6db&hl=en Find a working View Source plugin such as "View Source With": http://members.iinet.net.au/~bertdb/ryan/ViewSourceWith/help.html Workaround: Open developer tools. Turn on resource tracking LEAVE THE TOOLS OPEN. Click on Elements. Top half should be page. Bottom half should be source code. Click the Submit button in the top half. Your source code should now update to the proper POSTed source.
