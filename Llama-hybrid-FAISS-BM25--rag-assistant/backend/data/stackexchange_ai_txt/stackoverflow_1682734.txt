DDD confused with Repository Pattern and Reports

I am new to DDD and the Repository pattern, so my understanding of it might be totally wrong. But I am trying to learn it. Having said that I need to create an application, which shows the zones of a store. I create a ZoneRepository for that purpose, which works so far with my few methods. Now in that application I also need to show the distinct styles for that store. The list of styles will be used to drag them into the individual zones. Now my question is where does the styles class belong to, since its kind of a mini-report. Does that "StyleReport" belong into the repository? Does it belong somewhere else? How you know where it belongs to? Please help me to understand.
