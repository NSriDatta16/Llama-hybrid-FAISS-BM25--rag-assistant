If you have only few simple controls after the table then I'd suggest putting them to the table itself and get rid of the unhealthy (in my opinion) combination of table view inside scroll view. You might add the button you are talking about to the table's footer. It may be done in the Interface Builder (drag-n-drop the button to the bottom of the table view) or in the code ( [tableView setTableFooterView:myButton]; ). If your button should be smaller that table's width then put it inside UIView and locate as you need. You can also add table header in a similar way...
