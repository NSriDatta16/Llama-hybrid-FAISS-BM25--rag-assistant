The lmer package's author made a conscious choice not to create p-values for the fixed effects. Some packages do, but he feels that they are doing simplistic calculations that are misleading. (Many statisticians feel that there's a p-value obsession that causes confusion in and of itself, but that's a separate matter.) He addresses the question in: this post. I believe the summary paragraph is: Most of the research on tests for the fixed-effects specification in a mixed model begin with the assumption that these statistics will have an F distribution with a known numerator degrees of freedom and the only purpose of the research is to decide how to obtain an approximate denominator degrees of freedom. I don't agree. I don't understand the issue well enough to paraphrase it.
