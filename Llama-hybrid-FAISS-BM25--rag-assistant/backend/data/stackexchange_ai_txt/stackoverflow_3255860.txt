jQuery moving a div across the screen, bit by bit

So I have this code: $(document).ready(function() { $(document).keypress(function(e) { switch(e.which) { // user presses the "a" case 97: $('#character').css('left','+=40'); } } } The problem is that I can only press "a" once and #character moves only once... I also have jQuery draggable enabled ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ ) with a constrained area around it. How come I can only move the div once with keypress?
