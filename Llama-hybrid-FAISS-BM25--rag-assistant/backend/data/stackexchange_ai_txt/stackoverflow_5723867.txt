ArrayList > runs outofmemory (Java heap space). Any other option?

I am working with ArrayList data structure for dealing with cvs file. My machine is pretty powerful: Memory: 8 GB of Ram Processor: 4 CPUs, each i5 Intel core 2.5GHz In eclipse, I assigned -Xmx5120m (5GB of RAM for the java vm) using the vm arguments panel in Run as->Configuration. I am still getting "outofmemory java heap space" for my ArrayList > if it is more than like 468000 X 108. I am using arraylist because I feel myself most comfortable with it and it makes it easy to process the datas for my purpose. Actually, I am using this 2-dimension array for column-based context, like arraylist.get(i).get(0) where 0 would represent one column. Since I do operations like (replacing a column by an another column, copying a column, inserting a column into arbitrary position in the arrayList etc.. ), I could only think of arrayList because it has amortized constant time for adding or inserting into the arraylist in its average case. So now my question is: Which other datastructures could I use instead of arraylist in order to reach a magnitude of much more than 468000 X 108 (for example, like (833 * 1000000) X 108) and be able to do all operations that I mentioned above? (but I still want to be able to do this on my machine using the capacity that I have) I could think of doing all this stuff sequentially, meaning that processing first 468000 X 108 and write it to a csv file and then again loading into the 468000 X 108 arraylist and writing it to a different file etc... I don't think that I reached the limit of arraylist for my capacity. I would appreciate any kind of help.
