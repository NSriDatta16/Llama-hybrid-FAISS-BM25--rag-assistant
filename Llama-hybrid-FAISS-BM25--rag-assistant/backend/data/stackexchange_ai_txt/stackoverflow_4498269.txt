Do you know thin and skinny controller? So my answer is if you put many line of codes in controller, your code will be messy and hard to unit testing. Really the controller only executing the actions related with current HttpContext, so if you have business logic, data access, encryption,... you must separation of concern. The reason you don't put business logic at here is business belong to domain. So delegate to Domain for processing. Controller must be consider all actions related to HttpContext (Session, ViewData, TempData, User in current thread, Global and Local Resources,... ) and delegated all other actions to other component. Rule of thumb is fat model and thin controller for cook delicious cake(phpcake). Some links you can reference for skinny and fat Controller at here and here.
