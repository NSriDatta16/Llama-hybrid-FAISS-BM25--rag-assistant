Unfortunately there isn't a way around this problem via paypal. Their sandbox will always require you to be logged in to actually demo. Here are the solutions I have taken especially with remote clients. Use Skype or similar service so I can share my screen as I demo how it works. This solution seems to work fairly well, and eliminates the need for them to take the extra steps required. When working on something I want to quick demo for a client and get their take, I have started using http://www.jingproject.com/ It allows me to make a quick video of the process. It uploads it to their server and provides a url I can send the client to watch what I did. Wish I could provide a more elegant solution.
