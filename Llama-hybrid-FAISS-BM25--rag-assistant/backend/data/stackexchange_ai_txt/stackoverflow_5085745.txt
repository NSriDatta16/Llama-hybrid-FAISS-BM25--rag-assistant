Tests are tests. They test things. They don't enforce things. They are useful because you can see what is and isn't working in your application. When you override that name= setter to do something fancy and it breaks on a simple case that you had written a test for, that test just saved your ass. For simple cases like this, going without a test might be okay. It's really rare that you see 100% test coverage in non-open-source applications. Until you learn what you don't need to test, though, it's easier to just write tests for everything you can. If you don't understand Test Driven Development or why you would test, I think you should Google around on the subject a bit and you can get a good taste of what there is out there and why you should use it (and you should).
