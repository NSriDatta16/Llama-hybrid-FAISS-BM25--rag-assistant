Your operator + returns a const object. However, addElement requires a non-const object, which is where your compiler error is coming from. Basically, addElement is telling you that it feels at liberty to modify your Multinumber at will, but the operator + is beginning you not to modify the returned value. You should just return a non-const object, unless there's a good reason not to. You're not returning a reference after all. Of course, if the data in your Set is supposed to be constant and will never be changed, you may as well make addElement take a const pointer, and make sure that it internally deals with const pointers EVERYWHERE.
