Machine Learning Model for Time Series Forecasting

I am using Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models to nowcast/forecast an economic time series variable. However, I would like to extend these models to optimize/customize them for time series forecasting. Does anybody have experience in a similar situation, or is there a paper I could review? Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!
