Here is an excellent startup tutorial on MVC structure at phpro.org: Model View Controller MVC Would you use a template system like twig or just use phtml files like magento does? Above tutorial uses a method for templating system. But you can also modify/improve the templating mechanism as per you needs that you think is more flexible. Would you use some ORM like propel oder just pdo? For serious mvc framework development, it is better to use them. But for educational purpose that isn't a requirement but an additional step if you want to take.
