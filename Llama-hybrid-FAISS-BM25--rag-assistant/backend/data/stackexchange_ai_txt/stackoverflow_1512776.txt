IE6 - Elements won't disappear

I'm having some major problems trying to get images and paragraphs to disappear in IE6, in my text-only style sheet. I've tested the code in Chrome, FF, Opera, Safari, IE7 & 8, and every thing is working everywhere else... (surprise!) but of course, not in IE6. You can view a demo with CSS code in the here http://www.kebo.ca/dev/ . I've trimmed the code down to the bare essentials. There are 2 images (line 59, 70) and 2 paragraphs (line 71, 72) that should not be visible. And they are not in all but ie6. i've also tried -margin, -absolute positioning, NOTHING seems to be working! Note that I've tried every combination of display:none and visibility:hidden to no avail, including making the parent relative and the containing div absolute. no worky! all advice greatly appreciated... thanks muchly!
