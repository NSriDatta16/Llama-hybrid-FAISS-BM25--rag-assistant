NSTableView handles drag-and-drop differently from generic views, which is overall a good thing. It means that you don't have to manually handle the complicated highlighting, cell tracking and inserting behaviours that tables require. A description of what is required can be found here . Basically, you still call -registerDraggedTypes: (generally in your -awakeFromNib method) but instead of implementing the NSDraggingDestination methods, you implement the various data source methods associated with drag and drop, which can be found here . You should not need to subclass NSTableView to implement drag-and-drop in this fashion. Note those are data source methods. You need to hook the table view's dataSource outlet to the class that implements those methods in order for them to be called.
