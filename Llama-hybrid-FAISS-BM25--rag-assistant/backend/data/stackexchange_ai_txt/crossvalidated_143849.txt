Multiple Correlation Coefficient for Time Series?

I am using Pearson's correlation coefficient to calculate the correlation between two time series. Now I would like to calculate the correlation between a set of time series A, B, C and the time series D. It should be a many-to-one correlation (A, B, C-->D). Is there a common approach how to do this? Is it valid to combine A, B and C by summing or convolution and then calculate the correlation between the aggregated time series (ABC) and D?
