To use a mathematical equation as an SVM kernel in Python , you will need to use a machine learning library that supports custom kernel functions , such as scikit-learn . To use your equation as a kernel, you will need to define a custom kernel function that takes in two data points and returns the similarity between them, based on your equation. You can then use this custom kernel function when training your SVM model. Here is an example of how you might define a custom kernel function in Python using your equation: Create a custom kernel function that uses the susceptibility equation def susceptibility_kernel(X, y): # Define your equation here return similarity Create an SVM model using the custom kernel & Fit the model to your data and make predictions # Use the custom kernel function when training your SVM model svm = SVC(kernel=susceptibility_kernel) svm.fit(X, y) For more information and examples of implementing custom kernels in scikit-learn, you can refer to the official documentation : You can also refer to other online resources and tutorials for implementing SVM models in Python, such as this one: Support Vector Machine
