Interpretation of Significance in a Polynomial Model?

I have the following output from a polynomial regression summary in R: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -0.0077708 0.0135952 -0.572 0.568 Oil_Average_pct_change 0.1077766 0.0059876 18.000 How do I interpret the fact that the squared term is not statistically significant? Does this mean that a linear model is necessarily better?
