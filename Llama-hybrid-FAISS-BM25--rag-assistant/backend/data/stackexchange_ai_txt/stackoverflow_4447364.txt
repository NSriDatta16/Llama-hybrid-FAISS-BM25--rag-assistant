I would look at BSON, only because it's getting a lot of attention now, and you should find the serializers well supported. It's also a fairly tight wire protocol, which is why its the focus of a few high-profile nosql dbms's. As far as compression, use whatever your web servers support (probably gzip). The tradeoffs with compression almost always comes down to cpu cycles consumed vs compactness of the compression. But in the end, gzip is a good middle of the road, and all you have to do to use it is turn it on. Yes, POST is the appropriate method. If performance or concurrency become bottlenecks, you can move gzip ( and SSL and authentication and session, and many other things) to a tier in front of your web servers. But my gut is you'll be I/O constrained on the server side. Good luck.
