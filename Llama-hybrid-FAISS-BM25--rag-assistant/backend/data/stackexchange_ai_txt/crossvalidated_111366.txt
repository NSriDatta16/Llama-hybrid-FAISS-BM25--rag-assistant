Doesn't the support vector machine only accept 1 or 0 as input? Or is it values ranging between 0 and 1 No. SVMs accept continuous arguments. Categorical ones are the problem, which can be solved by using dummy variables. The inputs do not have to be bounded, but most beginner guides recommend normalizing all inputs to the interval $[0, 1]$. It is important to ensure that all inputs have comparable scales, whatever that may be.
