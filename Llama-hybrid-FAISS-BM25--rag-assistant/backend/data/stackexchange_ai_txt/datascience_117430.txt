It depends on what your current level of competence and sophistication is in your data analysis journey and how much math and statistics you understand. But if you have already gotten through and understood calculus and elementary linear algebra and either intermediate statistics at the upper division college level (doesn't have to be an actual course you took for credits, just the equivalent rigor of material and time and effort put towards mastering it), i.e. statistical analysis and modeling, using multivariate regressions and that sort of thing or you have gotten through the equivalent level in the machine learning sphere, then HANDS DOWN the best book of this kind I have ever come across is a handbook, and there are like 7 or 8 editions to it I believe called "A Guide to Econometrics." There should be books like this for every technical field in my opinion, it is filled with insights, rules of thumb, tools of the trade, and common Language explanations without the need for proofs about how to do your analysis and what usually happens in practice as opposed to in the textbooks! Beyond that book, I would recommend checking out any of Nassim Taleb's popular books on risk, probability, decision making in the real world, applied metastastiscs, and a host of other things as well. Their titles are: Fooled by Randomness The Black Swan Antifragile Skin in the Game
