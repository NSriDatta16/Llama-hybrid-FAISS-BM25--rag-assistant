Mustache.js render technique

i am trying to use mustache.js to render some JSON in the browser. What i want to do is: Location: {{#locations}} {{.}} {{/locations}} The locations is a js array [["Pend√©li, Attiki, Greece", "facebook"], ["Greece", "linkedin"]] Initially i tried to use {{%IMPLICIT-ITERATOR iterator=loc}} in my attempt to split the data in the view. So i the actual rendering code was {{loc[0]}} But that did n t work altough the loop worked and i got 2 spans but without any content. I think the PRAGMA is what I need but I didn 't figure it out. Any hints ? :)
