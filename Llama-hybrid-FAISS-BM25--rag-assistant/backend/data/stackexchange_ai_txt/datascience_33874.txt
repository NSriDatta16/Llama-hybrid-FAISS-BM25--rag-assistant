How do I convince myself and the students that Excel is insufficient for a serious business student studying data science Create in R a huge data.frame (couple mln rows and hundreds of columns), save it as .xlsx. Show them the time difference in loading it with R, and in Excel on the same machine. Compare basic statistics operations between the two on the same dataset, even plots. Point no. 2-4 on yout list can be done in Excel too, just A LOT more painfully, show them a couple of example of how much simple (and faster) is filtering with dplyr , compared to basic Excel, again on a huge dataset this would highlight the difference. Bonus point if you can come up with a dataset that crashes your PC with Excel going. Also, I'd enphatize the "free-to-use" part of R (or Python). For example, compared to SAS, if you simply want to try one solution (ie some kind of cluster), you load the library, and give it a try, no need to pay more, just for trying. To me that's the beauty of it, you can try for free whatever you need, and often that's key in DS, imagine if you'd have to pay for each library you install.
