There is an elegant solution for this from the following link. http://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/29/current-directory-for-windows-service-is-not-what-you-expect.aspx/ As my service is running both as console/service I just called Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory) before running it as Service E.g. static void Main(string[] args) { if (args.Length == 0) { Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory); RunAsService(); } else { RunAsConsole(); } }
