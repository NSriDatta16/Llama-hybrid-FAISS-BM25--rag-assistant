Create your common code as a static library. Drag the xcodeproj file into the groups and files section of the project you want to use it in. Update the include path to point to the headers of your static library. In the info pane for the project you want to use the static lib in add it as a direct dependancy. This process makes it almost as easy to work with as a regular framework.
