IE8 fbml like button and eot (font embedding)

I have issue with one of site that I developing. Situation is like this: I'm using @font-face generated at fontsquirrel.com, and in every browser, except for IE8 it works fine. In the beginning it worked for IE8 too, but (I guess) after update it stops working normally. This is what's happening, after page is loaded, font on the page stays the same until you mouse over the document, after that it applies @font-face rule. You can see that here: http://devel.2klika.net/fiolic/demo/home.php Also I'm using fbml on that page for fb:like button, this is the code: I figured that commenting out fb:like is solving, sort of, @font-face problem, like this: --> I would like to use that fb:like button if it is possible to make it work with IE8 and @font-face :) I tested this with Windows 7 64bit, IE 8.0.7601.17514 64bit and 32bit If I'm using IE8 in compatibility view it works normally. Does anyone can help me with this issue? Thanks in advance
