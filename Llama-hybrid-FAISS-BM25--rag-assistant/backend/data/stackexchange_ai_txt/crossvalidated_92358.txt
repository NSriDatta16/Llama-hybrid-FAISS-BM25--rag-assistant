There are at least two more use cases for the kind of complex seasonality you have: electricity consumption and call center demand. Both have strong intra-day patterns and day of week seasonality, and at least electricity also has a big yearly effect (call centers probably less so). Both are typically analysed in 5- or 15-minute intervals. And both are active areas of research, so googling for "electicity forecasting" or "power forecasting" or "call center forecasting" may already be helpful. I particularly recommend this paper , which treats quite a few different methods. Unfortunately, what you are interested in is not the point forecast per se, but anomaly or signal detection or monitoring. I don't recall anything like this in the forecasting literature, but there may be something in the signal processing literature. I suggest you use the keywords above and google for "signal detection in electricity time series" and similar. If you don't find anything, I would recommend a simple and dirty approach: look at the Taylor article I linked above, fit one of the models and try to understand residual variance. It is homoskedastic, or does it vary over time, or with the underlying level? Calculate the fit and create some "reasonable" detection band around it, based on your understanding of the residual variance. Raise an alert if recent data are outside this band. You will need to experiment a little, anyway. Good luck!
