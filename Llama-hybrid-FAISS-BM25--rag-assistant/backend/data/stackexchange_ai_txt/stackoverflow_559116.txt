If you're on a Linux or OS X box, you could use Pdftotext (part of Xpdf, found here ). If you pass a non-PDF to pdftotext, it will certainly bark at you, and you can use commands.getstatusoutput to get the output and parse it for these warnings. If you're looking for a platform-independent solution, you might be able to make use of pypdf . Edit: It's not elegant, but it looks like pypdf's PdfReader will throw an IOError(22) if you attempt to load a non-PDF.
