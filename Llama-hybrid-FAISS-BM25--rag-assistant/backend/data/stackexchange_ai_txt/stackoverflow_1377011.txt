Lotus Notes email as an attachment to another email

This is in Notes 8.5 environment. I just wanted to know how to attach an email to another email as real attachment not a "Document Link". I intended to attach an email, so I drag & dropped an email to another email's body but this turned out to be a "Document Link". This is an issue when I deleted the original attachment(an email in this case) and want to open the attachment again. Tried to drag & drop the email to desktop and attach that through the "Choose file" dialog, didn't work either. So how can I do that? I'm trying to get the attachment programmatically.
