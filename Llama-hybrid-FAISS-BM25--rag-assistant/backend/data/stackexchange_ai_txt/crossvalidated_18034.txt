What are the top statistic conferences to follow for applications in machine learning?

What are the top statistic conferences to follow for applications in machine learning? I just had a discussion, regarding that some of the machine learning jargon and buzzwords are not really sound for a top level statistician. So instead of machine learning conferences I would like to follow conferences on statistics (perhaps also journals) for possible applications in machine learning. Perhaps someone could give me a short list of conferences were I could start searching?
