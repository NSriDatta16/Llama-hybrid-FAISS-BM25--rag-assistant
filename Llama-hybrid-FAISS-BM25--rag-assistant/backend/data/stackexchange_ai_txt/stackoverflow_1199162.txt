Is it possible to have yui editor change paragraph style without selecting text?

Is it possible to change the behavior of the yui text editor so that when you make markup changes (via the toolbar bar buttons), for example changing from a paragraph to say a heading or to a list, and you dont have any text selected it assumes you mean the current block that the cursor is in So to change a paragraph to a heading rather than selecting the whole line you just place the cursor somewhere in the paragraph and select heading from the styles drop down.
