No, it does not. As you correctly pointed out, $$ I(A;C|D) = H(C|D)-H(C|A,D),$$ and so $$H(C|A,D)=H(C|D)$$ would imply that $$I(A;C|D) = 0.$$ It's easy to give a counterexample though. Say that $A$ is a random fair heads/tails coin flip (with entropy 1 in bits), $B = A$, $C= B$, and $D = tails$. Note that this is indeed a Markov chain. In this case, clearly $D$ contains no information at all, and $$ I(A;C|D) = I(A;C) = H(A) - H(A | C) = 1 - 0 \gneq 0. $$.
