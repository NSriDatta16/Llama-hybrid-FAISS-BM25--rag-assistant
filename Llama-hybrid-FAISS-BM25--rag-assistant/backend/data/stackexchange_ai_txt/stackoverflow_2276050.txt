Why is Process.PagedMemorySize64 > 0 when there is no paging memory on the machine?

I am runing .net code on a machine with the page file size set to zero. My application logs System.Diagnostics.Process.PagedMemorySize64 and is showing a value > 0. How can this be? The documentation for PagedMemorySize64 reads: The value returned by this property represents the current size of memory in the virtual memory paging file used by the process. What am I missing? Background: I'm doing this trying to determine if I have a memory leak. I'm using a profile that isn't showing any growth, yet the memory values from System.Diagnostics.Process continue to increase. I think that I may be dealing with Large Object Heap fragmentation. My program is displaying a WPF slide show of large images, with fade animation between the images. Any explanation welcome. Thanks.
