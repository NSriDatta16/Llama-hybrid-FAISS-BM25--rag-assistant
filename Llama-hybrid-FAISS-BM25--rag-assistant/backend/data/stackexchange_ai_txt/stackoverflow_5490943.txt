As long as foo is inside a public managed type, you can add a reference to your C++/CLI assembly and use it from e.g. C# just as you would any other managed assembly. The StandardOutputError delegate is already fine. The larger point is, managed types are exported in .NET metadata just by virtue of being managed types and compiling with /clr. No __declspec(dllexport) shenanigans necessary.
