Instead of writing: Calculate(team, calcFunc); You will have to write: Calculate (team, calcFunc); However, you really should know what calculatorFunc is returning --- I'm going to assume that all of the ones you use return the same value type (whether it be decimal or int of float). In which case, you could define it as: public override int Calculator(Team[] teams, Func calculatorFunc) { return teams.Average(calculatorFunc); } Then you have no generics in the declaration at all to worry about.
