Here one can find R-language replication of the model described in the paper Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005). It took me some time to understand PCA in details, cover some basic VAR topics to be able to rewrite in R original matlab procedure (at "2step" directory). In order to use FAVAR one should specify some parameters that goes at the begining of the file. In short, for time-series prediction problem algorithm is simple. One should retrieve the first K principal components from informational series $X_t$ : $\hat C(F_t,Y_t)$ . Then estimate standard VAR model in $(\hat C(F_t,Y_t)',Y_t')$ .
