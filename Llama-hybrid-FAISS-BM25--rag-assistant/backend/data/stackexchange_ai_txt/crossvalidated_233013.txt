From Wikipedia: In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). Isn't the same for classification ? In the end, isn't it the purpose of machine learning ?
