As some of the information you provided states, the two are not the same. I like better the terminology of conditional (on covariates) and unconditional (marginal) estimates. There is a very subtle language problem that clouds the issue greatly. Analysts who tend to love "population average effects" have a dangerous tendency to try to estimate such effects from a sample with no reference to any population distribution of subject characteristics. In this sense the estimates should not be called population average estimates but instead should be called sample average estimates. It is very important to note that sample average estimates have a low chance of being transportable to the population from which the sample came or in fact to any population. One reason for this is the somewhat arbitrary selection criteria for how subjects get into studies. As an example, if one compared treatment A and treatment B in a binary logistic model adjusted for sex, one obtains a treatment effect that is specific to both males and females. If the sex variable is omitted from the model, a sample average odds ratio effect for treatment is obtained. This in effect is a comparison of some of the males on treatment A with some of the females on treatment B, due to non-collapsibility of the odds ratio. If one had a population with a different female:male frequency, this average treatment effect coming from a marginal odds ratio for treatment, will no longer apply. So if one wants a quantity that pertains to individual subjects, full conditioning on covariates is required. And these conditional estimates are the ones that transport to populations, not the so-called "population average" estimates. Another way to think about it: think of an ideal study for comparing treatment to no treatment. This would be a multi-period randomized crossover study. Then think about the next best study: a randomized trial on identical twins where one of the twins in each pair is randomly selected to get treatment A and the other is selected to get treatment B. Both of these ideal studies are mimicked by full conditioning, i.e., full covariate adjustment to get conditional and not marginal effects from the more usual parallel group randomized controlled trial.
