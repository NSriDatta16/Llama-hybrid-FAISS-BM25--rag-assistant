How to most elegantly iterate through parallel collections?

Say I have 2 parallel collections, eg: a list of people's names in a List and a list of their age in a List in the same order (so that any given index in each collection refers to the same person). I want to iterate through both collections at the same time and fetch the name and age of each person and do something with it. With arrays this is easily done with: for (int i = 0; i What would be the most elegant way (in terms of readability and speed) of doing this with collections?
