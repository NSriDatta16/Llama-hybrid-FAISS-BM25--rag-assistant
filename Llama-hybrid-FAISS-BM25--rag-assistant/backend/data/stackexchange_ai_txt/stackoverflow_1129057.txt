The problem is that even though you use malloc to allocate memory for a Fragment structure, you haven't initialized any of the values. The memory returned by malloc is not guaranteed to be any specific value so you must explicitly initialize the struct members Fragment* frag = malloc(10*sizeof(Fragment)); int i = 0; for ( i = 0; i If you want guaranteed initialized memory you should use calloc. It has an added cost of zero'ing out the memory but it may not be significant for your app. Also you should check that malloc actually succeeds :)
