Intuition for MCMC and stationary distribution?

Studying up on Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling and the theory behind the stationary distribution, I want to validate it. Say we have a stochastic transition matrix $p$ describing events in space $\Omega$ . We also have a stationary distribution $\pi$ which is the target distribution from which we want to draw samples. The existence of $\pi$ makes MCMC estimation possible because generating new values of $p$ from $\Omega$ will always result in new values with which we can estimate parameters of $\pi$ per the stationary equation $\pi p = \pi$ . Am I understanding the why of MCMC sampling correctly? I know plain English is less precise than mathematical definitions/ proofs, but I'm hoping to strengthen my understanding of the conceptual framework.
