Is there a name for a differences versus differences plot?

I'm aware of the Blandâ€“Altman plot where the differences between two measures of a given parameter (obtained with two different methods) are plotted against their averages. What I need to plot, are the differences between two measures of parameter $A$, against the difference between two measures of parameter $B$. Both parameters are properties associated to the same physical phenomena (star clusters to be more precise, for example age and distance). Is there a name for such a plot? To make it more clear, this is the plot I'm producing: where $\Delta A=A_1-A_2$. Each of those is the value of parameter $A$, obtained with a different method, i.e.: "Method 1" and "Method 2" (same for $B$). The curves are iso-density lines, for a fitted 2D Gaussian Kernel on the data.
