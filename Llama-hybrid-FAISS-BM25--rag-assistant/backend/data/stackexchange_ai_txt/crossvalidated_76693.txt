Machine Learning to Predict Class Probabilities

I am looking for classifiers that output probabilties that examples belong to one of two classes. I know of logistic regression and naive Bayes, but can you tell me of others that work in a similar way? That is, classifiers that predict not the classes to which examples belong, but the probability that examples fit to a particular class? Bonus points for any thoughts you can share on the advantages and disadvantages of these different classifiers (including logistic regression and naive Bayes). For example, are some better for multi-class classification?
