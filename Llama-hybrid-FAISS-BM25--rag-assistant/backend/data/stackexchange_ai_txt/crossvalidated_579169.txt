Mann-Whitney U Test test valid for percentages (% seagrass cover)?

Is the Mann-Whitney U Test test valid for percentages (not counts, but percent cover of seagrass)? All my data points are average percent cover of seagrass with about 53% of the data being zeros across 8 group levels/columns (4 years x 2 seasons per year). I'd like to test the null hypothesis that there is no statistical difference in median seagrass cover between "dry" and "wet" seasons, for each year. Each value is the average of 10 randomly chosen, independent, observations per site (n=47 sites). I'm working in R. I thought beta regression would work, but learned values can't equal 0 or 1, logistic regression is only for success/failure type data, and my data have unequal variance so I can't do any parametric tests. years
