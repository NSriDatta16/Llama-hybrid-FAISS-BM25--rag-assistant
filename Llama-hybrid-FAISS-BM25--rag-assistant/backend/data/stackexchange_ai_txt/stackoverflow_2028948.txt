For both my website and websites I create for clients I use a PHP script that I found a long time ago. It can be found here: http://www.zubrag.com/scripts/download.php I use a slightly modified version of it to allow me to obfuscate the file system structure (which it does by default) in addition to not allowing hot linking (default) and I added some additional tracking features, such as referrer, IP (default), and other such data that I might need should something come up. Hope this helps.
