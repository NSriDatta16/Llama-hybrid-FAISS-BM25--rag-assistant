I assume you're talking about a transactional database supporting an interactive application, but for what it's worth... OLAP databases used exclusively for reporting and only updated by ETL processes may benefit from a less normalized structure. In these applications you accept the cost of redundant data storage and duplication for the performance benefit of fewer joins and the increased ease of use for (sometimes less technical) data analysts and business analysts. Transactional databases should always be normalized to the extent practical (at least 3NF) and then selectively denormalized only as needed . And the need to denormalize should ideally be based on actual performance testing results.
