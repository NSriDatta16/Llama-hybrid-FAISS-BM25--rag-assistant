Depending on what you actually mean, this might or might not be a problem. If the 50 columns are relatively small in size and each contains a differnt type of data (phone, cit, state, firstname, etc), you are probably fine. If they are things like telephone1, telephone2, etc, you need a related table as this is difficult to maintain and properly query. For instance, suppose you have fifty phone number fields now and the day comes when you need 51, then you have to change the table structure and all the related queries (you aren't using select * in production are you?) Suppose you want to know who has telephone number 111-111-1111, you have to join (or union) to the table 50 times to get the answer. This is where it can hurt performance. The third case is where the 50 columns are each differnt things, but will all together be a large record due to the size of the fields. Understand that databases will let you create a strucutre that is larger than the maximum number of bytes a record can contain, it simply won't let you put more than that number of bytes in the record. Plus longer records tend to create issues in how the data is stored on the disk and may result in slower retrieval. In this case, it is best to create one or more related tables which will have a one-to-one relationship to the main table.
