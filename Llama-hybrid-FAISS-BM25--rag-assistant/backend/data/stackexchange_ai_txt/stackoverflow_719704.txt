You can't rely on being able to set more than 20 cookies per hostname. ETA: But the following link applies to IE, while it is Firefox that doesn't save all cookies. Yes, but the article quotes RFC2109, which also applies to Firefox. As for when you get the error, that will depend on which cookies the browser decides to keep. If it keeps the first 20 cookies set, you'll get an error at cookie20; if it throws away the earlier cookies to make room for the new ones, you'll be left with only cookie80-cookie99 and the attempt to access cookie0 will error. The spec makes no guarantee which cookies a browser must keep when it runs out of storage, so browsers are free to behave how they like, and you should expect different behaviours. What's more, in your example, all the cookies are set in headers of a single response. HTTP headers are not ordered, so there's no guarantee they will be processed in any particular order in the first place. RFC2109's limits generally don't totally reflect reality, but each browser has its own cookie limits and you should in general strive to keep cookie data down to a bare minimum.
