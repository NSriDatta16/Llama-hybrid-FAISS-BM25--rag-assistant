You can use the CommandReference class. Very elegant code and works like a charm. Take a look at: How do I associate a keypress with a DelegateCommand in Composite WPF? It works the same with RelayCommands, but it won't update your CanExecutes since the CommandReference doesn't use call CommandManager.RequerySuggested All you need to do to achieve automatic CanExecute reevaluation is do the following change inside the CommandReference class public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged { add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; } remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; } }
