In C#, Checking string length greater than zero produces error?

This question sounds outrageous, but VS is giving me an error when I check that a string length is greater than zero: options[j]["pdprice"].ToString().Length > 0 Saying: CS0019: Operator '>' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'int' Can someone please explain why I cannot check that an integer length property is greater than zero? I even tried casting the entire thing as an int, but it still complains. EDIT: I like the answer below and will change the code. This is the original slightly modified to "work": newlistitem.Value = options[j][valuefield].ToString() + ((options[j]["pdprice"].ToString().Length > 0 ) ? "/" + options[j]["pdprice"].ToString() : "" ); And yes, it is referencing an old DataSet. We haven't had time to convert the solution to MVC, Linq, etc., but we are working on it. :)
