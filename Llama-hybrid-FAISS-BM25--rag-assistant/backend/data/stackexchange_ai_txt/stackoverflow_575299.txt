How to set UITableView to Grouped?

In an iPhone navigation based app, I want to add a second tableview but have its design available in IB. I've added a new empty XIB and dragged a UITableView onto it. I want to setup the layout through IB. I've created a controller for this tableview and set the File's Owner class in IB to this controller. I linked the tableview to File's Owner as well. I set the tableview to grouped in IB. However, that does not translate at runtime. I still have a plain tableview. In fact, none of the Inspector settings work at runtime. What have I missed?
