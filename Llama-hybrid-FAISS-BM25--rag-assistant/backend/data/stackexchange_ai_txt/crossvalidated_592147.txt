The empirical Bayesian approach estimates the parameters from the data. In the case of the model described, it is an empirical Bayesian model because $\eta$ is estimated from the data. It is also discussed in the passage below the model definition The choice of $\alpha(n) = n$ corresponds to an empirical Bayes model that attempts to account for the uncertainty in estimating the “fixed” parameter $\eta$ with $\bar X$ . This is justified by noting that (4.3) with $\alpha(n) = n$ arises naturally by swapping $\eta$ and $\bar X$ in the sampling distribution of $\bar X$ . However, in the interest of remaining as general as possible, we permit $\alpha(n)$ to be any positive function of $n$ . To learn more when it is ok, check the How is empirical Bayes valid? thread. Your re-parametrization just defines another model, that still has parameters calculated from the data, so is an empirical Bayesian model.
