In broad terms, whether in R, python, or a third language, you want to use the same fitted TFIDF transformer (both the vocabulary and the IDF component) on new data. In python, this is very easy (see scikit-learn). In R, with tm , say, it's easy to specify vocabulary, but you'll probably need to save this vocabulary and the IDF yourself somehow. Hope this is helpful for anyone else looking at this problem and that the broad point (and not specifics of programming) are also clear.
