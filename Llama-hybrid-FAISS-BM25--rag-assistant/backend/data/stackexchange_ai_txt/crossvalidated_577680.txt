How can I analyze large dataset to help non profit with employee salary?

A non profit I am associated with asked me for help with setting employee salaries. I found a form 990 database which had data on things like revenue, number of employees, key employee salary and other employee salary. I have just done simple descriptive analyses and found mean, median, STD, their percentile in revenue compared to what the salary/employee # would be if the percentile was the same ETC. I also took the average/median salary and divided that by the average/median number of employees. I also did a few analyses filtering out high cost of living areas and setting the revenue to closer to theirs. I think there is some useful information for them here, but I was wondering what else I should/could be doing; I am not an expert, not used to working with this much data or with data that is not normally distributed. I am really worried about the large amount of variance making some of these descriptive statistics misleading. Thanks in advance. PM
