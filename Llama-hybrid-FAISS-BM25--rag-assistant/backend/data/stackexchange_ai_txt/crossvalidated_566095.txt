Effect of zero-variance variables on logistic regression

Imagine that due to pipeline/workflow issues a logistic regression model that's in production has some binary variables in it that are positive or negative for all observations in the modeled population. Is there any way for these "constant" variables to affect the model, and what exactly is happening mathematically either way? Do the coefficients simply come out as zero and the variables mathematically drop out of the regression, so that you could add a thousand variables like this and the regression wouldn't be affected? Would this work the same way for linear regression as it would for logistic? Edit: Note that there are some normal varying variables in the model, so these non-varying/constant variables are in addition to those.
