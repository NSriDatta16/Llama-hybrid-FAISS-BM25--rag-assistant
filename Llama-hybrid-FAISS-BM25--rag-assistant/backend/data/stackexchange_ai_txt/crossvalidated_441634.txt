Does anyone know what is beta in Cox-nnet paper?

I was going through the methods in this paper: Cox-nnet: An artificial neural network method for prognosis prediction of high-throughput omics data [1] There they define (Equation 4) $$\theta_i=\boldsymbol{G \circ (Wx_i+b)^T\boldsymbol\beta}$$ $\boldsymbol{W}_{H \times J}$ are the layer coefficients, $\boldsymbol b$ are the biases and $\boldsymbol G$ is the activation function. What does $\boldsymbol\beta$ mean in the context of Equation 4? [1] Ching T, Zhu X, Garmire LX. Cox-nnet: An artificial neural network method for prognosis prediction of high-throughput omics data. PLoS Comput Biol. 2018;14(4):e1006076. Published 2018 Apr 10. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006076
