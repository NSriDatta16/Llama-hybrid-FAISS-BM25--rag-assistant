Here's a summary of what I've learned (thanks to some excellent answers and comments): Object Allocation is NOT the same as Memory usage. The answer to my question about ObjectAlloc's net bytes element is that you shouldn't be paying attention to it - at least not when determining issues with the amount of memory you are using or whats causing it to crash. It doesn't reflect the true memory usage of your application. My amatuerish guess is that ObjectAlloc only shows you the memory taken up by the direct object itself. So if you have an UIImageView, it takes up just a handful of bytes to store the various properties, but it might be pointing to an image in memory taking up a bunch of space. Therefore, looking at ObjectAlloc is helpful only in making sure you're not creating and keeping objects around, it won't give you an idea of how much memory you're using or how much you can use before crashing. MemoryMonitor will give you the total memory usage. You can constrain it to viewing only your app's usage by using the search tool in the bottom right of the Instruments window. Both ObjectAlloc and Memory Monitor (as well as the Leaks tool) are plugins for Instruments - just in case thats not obvious to someone else. You can launch Instruments from within XCode by doing Run -> Start with Performance Tool. Once inside of Instruments, you can open the Library and add new plugins to monitor different aspects of performance.
