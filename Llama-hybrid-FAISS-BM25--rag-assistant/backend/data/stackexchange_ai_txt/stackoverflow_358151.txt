Binding gridviews to viewstate until being able to write to database

I recently began working on a project which has many gridviews on a single page. During creation of a new record, the user needs to be able to add/remove/edit these gridviews and then save to the database at the end. The problem with this obviously is that there is no datasource to bind the data too until after its written to the database. This data represents a 1..* relationship, which is why the gridview data cannot be written to the database until the parent record has been created first. The best way I have found so far to solve this is to use viewstate. This solution however does not seem ideal to me. I am also forced to manually create the gridview functionality with OnDeleting, OnUpdating, etc so that I can manage the binding of the viewstate with the gridview. Does anyone have any suggestions on a better way to manage this situation, it seems like it would be a common thing? UPDATE: Keep in mind this data needs to be around throughout postbacks.
