Hex to Decimal conversion [K&R exercise]

I'm learning C and I can't figure out one of the K&R exercises, the listing: Exercise 2-3, Write the function htoi(s) , which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X ) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0 through 9 , a through f and A through F . I suppose I need to do some recursion here, I just guess that I don't know a lot about the numbering types, and their various conversion methodologies, etc. Could someone give me some pointers on how best to understand it, I'm not looking for someone to hold my hand, but instead direct me to a means of proper understanding so I can write this in the most elegant form as possible, and not with printf("%x", skill);
