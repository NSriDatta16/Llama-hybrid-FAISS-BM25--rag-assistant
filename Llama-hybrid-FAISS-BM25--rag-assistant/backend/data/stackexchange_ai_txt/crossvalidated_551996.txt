correlation between time series and discrete time points

I have a time series of number of students crossing a street on a college campus on a working day. I also have the start times of classes (e.g., 8 am, 8:55 am, 9:50 am etc.) on that campus plotted as vertical reference lines on the plot. The time series has multiple peaks (high points or maxima) that appear to be aligned with the class start times (since students are getting to the classes around start of classes). Is there a way the correlation between the peaks of student numbers at the crossing and the class start times could be calculated ? Or in other words, can statistical evidence of class starts affecting the numbers of students on the crossing be shown ?
