I don't really know much about these APIs (maybe it would be helpful if you clarify what exactly you're doing), but this looks promising: From the Windows Update Agent (WUA) API Reference : IDownloadProgress Interface Seems like you can obtain this from IDownloadJob::GetProgress IInstallationProgress Interface Seems like you can obtain this from IInstallationJob::GetProgress If you don't want to keep polling these objects for new progress, it looks like there is also the following, which your code can implement: IDownloadCompletedCallback IDownloadProgressChangedCallback IInstallationCompletedCallback IInstallationProgressChangedCallback I don't know if this is what you're asking for, but this is my guess. Hope that helps.
