In case anyone else is also watching: A nice explanation is given by Ichimura and Todd (2007) in their handbook chapter, "Implementing Nonparametric and Semiparametric Estimators," chapter 8. Basically, when you "bin" your data, you are chopping the x range up into intervals, $[t_k; t_{k+1}]$ . For each such interval, you construct one new y value which averages among the observations that fall in the bin. But there's a particular weighting scheme which needs to be followed, including the distance of the bins, which I believe has to be uniform (so that $t_{k+1} - t_k = \delta$ for all $k$ ). So I encourage you to check out the paper.
