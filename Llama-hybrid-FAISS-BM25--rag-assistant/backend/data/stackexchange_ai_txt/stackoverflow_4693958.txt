No. The standard only mentions: — static storage duration — automatic storage duration — dynamic storage duration There is no such thing as 'stack memory' in C++. Yet it's common to say that the automatic storage duration variables are 'allocated on the stack' since it's the way it's implemented from computer science point of view. 'The heap' is another term that usually refers to dynamic storage duration but is not mentioned in the standard.
