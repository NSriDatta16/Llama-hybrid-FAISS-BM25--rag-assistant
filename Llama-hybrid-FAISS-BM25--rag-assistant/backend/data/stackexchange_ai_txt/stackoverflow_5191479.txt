Is there any situation where you wouldn't want include guards?

I know why include guards exist, and that #pragma once is not standard and thus not supported by all compilers etc. My question is of a different kind: Is there any sensible reason to ever not have them? I've yet to come across a situation where theoretically, there would be any benefit of not providing include guards in a file that is meant to be included somewhere else. Does anyone have an example where there is an actual benefit of not having them? The reason I ask - to me they seem pretty redundant, as you always use them, and that the behaviour of #pragma once could as well just be automatically applied to literally everything.
