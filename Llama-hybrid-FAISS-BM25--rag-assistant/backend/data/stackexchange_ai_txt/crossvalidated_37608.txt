Framework for Symbolic Classification

Please advise good framework for symbolic classification. I am currently using GPTIPS for that but I belive there are better options. What I am trying to do is following: for set of features of my data I am solving standard symbolic multigene regression and as output for each individual in my generation I receive set of trees, where each tree represents some formula. Each tree in my model encodes new feature in some new space. In this new feature space I am trying to solve classification problem. Currently I use kNN for that, but any other procedure should also apply. So basically I am solving standard classification problem, with additional step of feature space transformation using symbolic regression. Framework can be written on following languages: Java, Matlab, R, Python. I personally would prefer Java or Matlab, to Python or R. Thanks.
