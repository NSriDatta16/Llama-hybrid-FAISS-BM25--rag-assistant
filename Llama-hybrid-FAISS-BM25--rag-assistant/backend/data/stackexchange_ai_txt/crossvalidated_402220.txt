This happens because you are specifying a discrete probability distribution for the outcome - the binomial distribution - but then you are inputting values into the model for the outcome that are not integers. If we round the values for the outcome, the model will be fitted without a warning: > m1 summary(m1) Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) [glmerMod] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: cbind(round(Feeding_Foraging), round(Standing)) ~ poly(hour, 2) * Area + (1 | ID) Data: GLM_df Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.
