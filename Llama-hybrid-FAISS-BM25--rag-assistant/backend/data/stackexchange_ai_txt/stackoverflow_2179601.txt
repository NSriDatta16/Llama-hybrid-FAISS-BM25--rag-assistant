good php framework for fully ajax-based web applications?

i'm developing a web application that focus heavily on ajax. the whole application is just on one page except for the threads that are in traditional pages so they can be indexed. so i have to have very structured JS-codes and i wonder if they are any frameworks out there that are for ajax-based applications. eg. codeigniter, cakephp and others i have read about dont focus on this. they just organize regular php code according to mvc. cause my code starts to be very messy (especially the js code) and i really need some structure here. is there a way to have same mvc + oop structure in javascript? i never heard anyone talking about it. even if i put js codes in separate files, one for each page for example, there are a lot of lines and i feel lost and crunch whenever i have to add some new functionalities. would be great with suggestions and ideas how to structure this up!
