When a user types an internationalized domain into a browser, it's translated to an ASCII form; e-mail, surely, must work the same way (however, I've never received mail from an IDNA domain and I have reason to believe browsers are the only implementors of it). Mailing agents would have to know that when they see Unicode in an address, it must be translated to IDNA form, and then the MX records looked up. I don't think in all of my system administration I've ever accounted for this. Being able to accept something the browser will translate as IDNA in a form element is not something I know how to do. If it is indeed translated to IDNA and a regex attempts to validate it, it should work. I wouldn't be surprised if an international domain fails most e-mail regular expressions, and I think the relevance of such a fail is less than 1%. IDNA is really an "address bar" system, and an awful hack; I would really be surprised if e-mail worked on top of it. Everyone is freaking out like something is changing. It isn't. IDNA is just moving from the domain to the TLD, and business will be as usual like it was before. Don't overthink it, OP.
