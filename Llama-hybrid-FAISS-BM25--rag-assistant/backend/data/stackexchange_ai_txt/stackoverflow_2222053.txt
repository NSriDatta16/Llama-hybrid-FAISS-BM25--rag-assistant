This is strictly MHO, but I personally do not find neither SourceForge's, nor CodePlex's download pages particularly elegant. Take a look at Google Code : clicking a hyperlink initiates download immediately, without asking you to accept a license agreement of any kind, select download mirror or view dozens of banners. It just does what it has to do: allow users to download whatever file they're interested in.
