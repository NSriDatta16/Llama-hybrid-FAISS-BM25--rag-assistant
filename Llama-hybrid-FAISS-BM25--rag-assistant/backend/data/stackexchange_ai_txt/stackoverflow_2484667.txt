Using URI-fragments in Ruby on rails routing

RoR application can generate URL such as /post/10. But now I want to create a site, which works with URI-fragments like gmail. For example gmail uses the following URLs https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#sent https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#label/books I need to generate URL such as /#/post/10, where controller = "post", action = "show", id = "10". Of course it will be good to use standard url-helpers.
