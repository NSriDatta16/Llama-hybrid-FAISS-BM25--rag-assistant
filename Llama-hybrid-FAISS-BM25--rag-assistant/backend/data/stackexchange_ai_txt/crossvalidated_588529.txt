Most SVC implementations will have a "warm start" option, that starts from the dual parameters from the previous training. This is normally useful when performing model selection as you can change the hyper-parameters (e.g. $C$ ) slightly and retraining won't take so long. You can also use warm start when adding new patterns, however you will need to extend the vector of dual parameters and set them to zero for all of the new patterns. I wrote my own SVM solver, so that is easy for me to do, but if you are using a package written by someone else they may not have provided an option for doing so. If it is a fairly small dataset though, it is probably easier just to retrain from scratch with the extended dataset as the saving in time is probably going to be less than the time taken to write the code to implement the warm start, and with more complicated code, there is more to go wrong. The optimal hyper-parameters for the old dataset are probably going to be a good starting point for re-tuning them for the augmented dataset, so you will certainly be able to find some computational savings there.
