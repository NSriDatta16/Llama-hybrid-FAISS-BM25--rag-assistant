CSS Layout - Scrolling doesn't work in side the columns

I'm working to build a CSS layout that has a fixed header, lefCol and Right Col, but the height of the MainCenterColumn (#mainCol) can scroll. Here's what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/DscT6/ The issue with this is, on the mac you can scroll by dragging your fingers on the touchpad. I noticed that the scrolling only works if you mouse is over the MailCol, if your mouse is over the Left or Right Col the page doesn't scroll. Any ideas? Have you seen this? Suggestions? thanks!
