Inject many classes in view model class

I develop wpf app with MVVM design. As MVVM framework I use Caliburn Micro. Service I have in external assembly, and it is injected in view models classes with MEF. Problem in service I have many small class, I try respect SOLID principe. [Export(typeof(IClassA)] public class ClassA : IClassA {} [Export(typeof(IClassB)] public class ClassB : IClassB {} [Export(typeof(IClassC)] public class ClassC : IClassC {} //... [Export(typeof(IClassK)] public class ClassK : IClassK {} Classes count is about 12-15. I need use this classes in view model class. So I use this: public class MyViewModelClass { private interface IClassA _a; private interface IClassB _b; private interface IClassC _c; //... private interface IClassK _k; [ImportingConstructor] public MyViewModelClass(IClassA a, IClassB b, IClass c, ..., IClassK k) { _a=a; _b=b; _c=c; ... _k=k } } I donâ€™t that this way is correct. Or it exist something elegant, simple. Thank for your opinion and advices.
