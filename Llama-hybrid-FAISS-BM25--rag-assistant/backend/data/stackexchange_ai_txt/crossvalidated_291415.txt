Probably the easiest thing to do would be a two-level classification system. At a high level: Train a CNN normally, ignoring the timestamp, to estimate its confidence that the object is present. Decide on the full set of labels at once, taking into account both the timestamp and the confidence score. For example, the scores sequence $\begin{bmatrix}.8 & .6 & .9 & .1 \end{bmatrix}$ might be labeled as $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$, while $\begin{bmatrix}.3 & .6 & .2 & .1\end{bmatrix}$ might get all zeroes. There are several options for this scoring option. You could use something like a conditional random field , or train a little classifier with features as the input score and the adjacent scores, or various other things along those lines.
