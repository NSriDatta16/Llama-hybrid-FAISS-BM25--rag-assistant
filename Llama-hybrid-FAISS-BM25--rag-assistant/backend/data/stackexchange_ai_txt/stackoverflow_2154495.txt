My first approach here would be to use curl on a cron job every n minutes to pull in the html fragment, and then store it somewhere like /var/www/html/site , to save making the http request on each load. I'd then use file_get_contents function to pull the content into the page , with a fallback if the file isn't there (lets say if the file isn't there for example). I'm adding this here mainly as a sanity check - would love to see other approaches to it.
