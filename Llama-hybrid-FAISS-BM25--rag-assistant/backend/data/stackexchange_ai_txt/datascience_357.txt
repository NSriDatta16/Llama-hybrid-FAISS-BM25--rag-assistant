I lead data science teams for a major Internet company and I have screened hundreds of profiles and interviewed dozens for our teams around the world. Many candidates have passed the aforementioned courses and programs or bring similar credentials. Personally, I have also taken the courses, some are good, others are disappointing but none of them makes you a "data scientist". In general, I agree with the others here. A certificate from Coursera or Cloudera just signalizes an interest but it does not move the needle. There is a lot more to consider and you can have a bigger impact by providing a comprehensive repository of your work (github profile for example) and by networking with other data scientists. Anyone hiring for a data science profile will always prefer to see your previous work and coding style/abilities.
