Relationship between cumulative incidence and predicted probabilities in logistic regression

We have a data where the cumulative incidence is around $10\%$ (i.e. $P(Y=1)=0.1$). But when we use a logistic regression (in fact, LASSO), find the predicted probabilities and plot a histogram of the predicted probabilities, it centers around $50\%-60\%$. Is the distribution of the predicted probabilities not going to be centered around the cumulative incidence? Or a difference is expected because the predicted probabilities are $\hat{P}(Y=1|X)$ and are different from $P(Y=1)$? Am I confusing anything here?
