Azure Blob Storage Browser in Silverlight

I would like to make an Azure Blob Storage browser using Silverlight, like CloudBerry Explorer does. I have an Azure Storage account and the keys, but I am still picking which Control I should use to display file list (DataGrid?). For the coding, how can I fetch the file list from a blob container ? p.s. I'm using C# , Visual Studio 2010 , Azure Project Web Role + Silverlight Project
