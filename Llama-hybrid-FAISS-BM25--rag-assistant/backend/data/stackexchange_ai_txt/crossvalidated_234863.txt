Why do Statistics, Machine learning and Operations research stand out as separate entities

It seems nowadays people who work in ${\bf Statistics, \ Machine\ Learning \ and \ Operations\ research }$ all consider themselves as working in data analytics. These three categories try to solve similar problems however through different approaches. Based on my understanding the different features between statistics, machine learning and operations research is as follows: 1) ${\bf Statistics}$ provides the most mathematical rigor, however, to work under rigid mathematics, typically statisticians provide a lot of assumptions. The reason behind these assumptions is mainly to maintain interpretability and mathematical rigor. Statisticians really care about interpreting and checking the results e.g. hypothesis testing 2) The ${\bf Machine \ Learning}$ society seems to be able to work under more relaxed assumptions at the cost of interpretability. Most of machine learning methodologies are based on algorithms. These algorithms need less assumptions and seem to provide better results than similar statistics techniques, however in many cases a machine learner really cannot interpret or have a rigorous reason behind the results. It seems these algorithms are efficient however dangerous in cases when we cannot understand the underlying processes e.g. Deep learning. 3) ${\bf Operations \ Research}$ seems to be mostly focused on either Markov modeling and optimization. Markov modeling suffer from the independent increments property which is limiting in real life. While, optimization may be understood in terms of algorithms similar to ones presented in machine learning. The above is based on my understanding, I would really appreciate feedback on the subtle differences and similarities between these three categories and why do they all stand out as separate entities
