How to compare whether models built using two different outcomes are significantly different

I would like to build the relationship between the dose given and two outcomes (one acute toxicity and one late toxicity). The model I used was binary logistic regression. For the acute toxicity outcome, the estimated dosage and its 95% confidence interval was 20 (15~35), while for the late toxicity outcome, the estimated dosage and its 95% confidence interval was 75 (50~80). We can see that 75>20 and these confidence intervals are not overlapping. It seems to indicate that the late toxicity is caused by a higher dose than the dose for acute toxicity. My question is: Is there any statistical method to test that the late toxicity is caused by a higher dose than acute toxicity? Or is simply claiming that their CIs do not overlap is strong enough? Thank you
