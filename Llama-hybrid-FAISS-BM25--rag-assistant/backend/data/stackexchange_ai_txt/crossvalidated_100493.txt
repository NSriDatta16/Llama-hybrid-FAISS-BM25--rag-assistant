On the background computation: Since what you are doing is to measure the background by calculating the average of some values with backgroung only, you can use the error on the average ($\sigma_{Bckg}/\sqrt{n_{avg}}$) and this should estimate correctly the background variation, taking into account the variation of the background among the $n_{avg}$ pixels you considered. You can also calculate the $Z_i$ error, if I understood correctly, and it is given by $\sqrt{N}$, so this is settled to. In order to calculate the covariance between the errors maybe you can use the covariance formula (and take a look here for an example on the covariance between two variables). I am not the most knowledgeable person about it, so I hope this rambling attract more educated people to the discussion. =)
