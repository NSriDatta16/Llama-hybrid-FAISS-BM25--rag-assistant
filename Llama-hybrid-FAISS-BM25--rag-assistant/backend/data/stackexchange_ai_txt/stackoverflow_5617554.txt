Do you read exception messages? A public action method 'Register' was not found on controller 'AudioRage.Controllers.HomeController' Now look at the code of HomeController you've posted. Do you see a Register action on it? I don't. So add one: public ActionResult Register() { ... } In your HomeController you have an action called Register but action is only accessible through POST verbs as it is decorated with the [HttpPost] attribute: [HttpPost] [ActionName("Register")] public ActionResult Index(RegisterModel model) so you cannot invoke it with a GET verb on /Home/Register .
