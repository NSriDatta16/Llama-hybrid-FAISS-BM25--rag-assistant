What operation shall be fast: insertion, retrieval, all ? There is always a trade-off. Does your solution need to be scalable ? Linked list are not. Should you want/need to stick to a linked list, you could store it into an array of structs having a field indicating the index of the next entry in the linked list. Insertion will be very fast, without any allocation, the downside being you have to know the number of elements in advance - or to reallocate the table when it's getting full. Refer to the " Linked lists using arrays of nodes " subsection of the Wikipedia page on linked list .
