Find the projection of a vector on the icosahedron or on its unfolded surface

Consider a sphere with center in coordinates' origin, and an inscribed icosahedron, oriented such that the two most distant vertices lay on Z coordinate axis, and one of the edges emerging from any of that vertices lays in XZ plane. Consider a given vector x originating in the center of the sphere. Direction, given by this vector, pierce the surface of the icosahedron in a certain point. Is there an elegant way to find the pierced facet (considering all the facets are enumerated), and then find the piercing point on this facet? This task is needed to project the pierce point to the flat unfolded (unwrapped) icosahedron surface.
