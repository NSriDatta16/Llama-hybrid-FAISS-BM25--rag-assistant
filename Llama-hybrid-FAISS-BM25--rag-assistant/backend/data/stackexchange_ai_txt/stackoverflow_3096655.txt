The histogram of oriented gradients is a technique used to detect humans: Wikipedia HoG Simply put, the algorithm recognizes humans by the distribution of gradient directions in the image: A circle would have a uniform gradient direction distribution, because all directions are equally frequent along the boundary. A square has a distribution with four peaks at 0째, 90째, 180째 and 270째, because that's the only directions of it's boundary. A human has a distinctive direction histogram, too, and that histogram can be recognized by classical machine learning algorithms like a support vector machine or an artificial neural network. I think OpenCV contains an implementation of the HoG algorithm.
