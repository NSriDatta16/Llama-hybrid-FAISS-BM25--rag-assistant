How do I go for NLP based on phrases instead of sentences?

I have a list of words in this format: chem, chemistry chemi, chemistry chm, chemistry chmstry, chemistry Here, the first column represents the actual word which is in the second column. I need to apply NLP (in python3) so that when the model is trained using this dataset and I give 'chmty' as input, it will give 'chemistry' as output. I don't want string similarity techniques, I want to build an NLP model.
