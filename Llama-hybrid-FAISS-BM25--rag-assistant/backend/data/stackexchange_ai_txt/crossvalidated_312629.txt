From my experience it's not necessary, but transforming variables can be very beneficial. It's also always judgement call depending on the variable. It's also dependent on the type of model you're using; for logistic regression it's a good idea and one recommendation would be to use Weight of Evidence (WOE) binning. For other tree based algorithms, such as Random Forest, you don't need to as the algorithm will make the cuts itself. The answer is No. For the sake of argument, let's say you have create a Logistic Regression, with one transformed variable. That transformed variable is actually a NEW variable, so once you get a new dataset, you should apply the same transformations and then make your predictions. If I haven't been clear in any of my points just let me know and I will be happy to elaborate. :)
