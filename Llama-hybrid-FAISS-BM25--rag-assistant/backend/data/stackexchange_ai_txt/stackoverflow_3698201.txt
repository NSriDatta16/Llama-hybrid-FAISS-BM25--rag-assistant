What's the logic behind it? Ive been told by multiple apps to do this. What apps? I haven't seen this yet myself, but I would guess that, if true, it might have something to do with the multitasking in iOS 4.0 and apps maybe not being quit if already running before an update. But it's strange. I've also noticed that if I reinstall/build the app too many times from xcode, it will become unstable and more likely to crash. A restart does fix the problems. Really, this sounds like a bit of folk science. Occasionally, a device can go a bit whacko, but that used to happen to me in (say) the days of 2.2.1. So if you can honestly reproduce this issue, I strongly encourage you to file a bug with Apple and get it fixed. Note they will probably ask you for a reproducible sample project in order to prove out this theory.
