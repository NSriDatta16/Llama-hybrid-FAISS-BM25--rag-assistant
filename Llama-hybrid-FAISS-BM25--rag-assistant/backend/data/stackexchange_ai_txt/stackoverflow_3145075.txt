Setting up linux build agent for teamcity

I am trying to install a build agent on linux for teamcity. I downloaded the buildAgent.zip file and extracted it. I renamed the buildAgent.dist.properties file to buildAgent.properties as instructed by the teamcity documentation. I edited the file with the server url and the port number i will be using(ex: 150). On the teamcity server machine i opened port 150. I opened a command shell and executed the ./agent.sh start command and it says it started but it is not showing up in the list on the teamcity server. Does anyone know why this is?
