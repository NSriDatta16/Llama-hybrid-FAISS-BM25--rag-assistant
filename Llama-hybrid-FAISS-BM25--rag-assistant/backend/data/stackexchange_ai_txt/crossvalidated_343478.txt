The relationship is there; volatility clustering produces heavier tails. Engle's original ARCH paper (p. 992) says The first-order ARCH process generates data with fatter tails than the normal density. Bollerslev's original GARCH paper (p. 313) says Hence the GARCH(1,1) process is leptokurtic (heavily tailed), a property the process shares with the ARCH(q) process; cf. Milhoj (1984). And Tsay's "Analysis of Financial Time Series" (2010, 3rd edition, p. 133) says Consequently, similar to ARCH models, the tail distribution of a GARCH(1,1) process is heavier than that of a normal distribution. after giving a proof of one special case.
