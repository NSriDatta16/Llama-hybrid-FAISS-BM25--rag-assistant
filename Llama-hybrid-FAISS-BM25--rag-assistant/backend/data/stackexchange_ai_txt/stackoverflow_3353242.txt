Android special directories

I see that as of API Level 8, you can request a handle to special directories with Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory() . This takes a type such as DIRECTORY_MUSIC , DIRECTORY_PICTURES , etc. I'm looking for an equivalent directory for other media types such as documents (Word docs, PDFs, etc.). My HTC Desire has a /sdcard/My Documents/ folder which looks like exactly what I want, but it has no DIRECTORY_ specifier for use with the above method. Is this a standard Android directory which I can rely on? If I can't use getExternalStoragePublicDirectory() , I have to use getExternalStorageDirectory() instead which just points me to the root of the SD card. I can explicitly check for the presence of My Documents under the root and use it if it's there. This is what I have: // default document save location File defaultSaveDir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File myDocs = new File(defaultSaveDir, "My Documents"); if (myDocs.exists() && myDocs.isDirectory()) defaultSaveDir = myDocs; Is there a better way?
