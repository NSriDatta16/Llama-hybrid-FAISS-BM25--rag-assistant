If all data are from the same person, one would normally think of all data as being dependent of all others. No standard test can handle such a situation, as your effective sample size is 1 (only one person involved), so there is no way to assess random variation. Technically one could make independence assumptions anyway, for example one could assume that all weeks are independent of each other and run a t-test for dependent observations with sample size 8 to compare the two variables. However it seems hard to argue on what basis the weeks should be seen as independent. Another possible approach would be to set up a time series model for the 8 weeks that somehow allows you to test whether the two variables' distributions only differ by random variation (optimally having more than 8 weeks of data; 8 time points don't allow much model diagnostic; such diagnostic could even hint at the weeks behaving as if they were independent by the way). None of this however can be justified without proper knowledge of the meaning and background of the observations.
