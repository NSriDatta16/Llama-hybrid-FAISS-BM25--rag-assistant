I'm not sure what you want help with, since the call to ranksum looks correct. You should be aware that floating point numbers, due to how they're represented, are not exact, so your zeros may not be "true" zeros, but actually just very small numbers (on the order of eps(0)). Using a significance test seems a little odd for feature selection. It might be a decent first step, but presumably you'd want to eliminate highly correlated factors too. * Edit: More on floating point* The short answer is that you can't really. You can coax matlab into displaying a few more decimal places by typing format longg (with 2 g's), but beyond that.... Matlab, like nearly everything else, uses IEEE-754 Floating Point, which has a finite amount of precision. The eps function tells the next largest magnitude number--you can think of it as the "step size", if that helps, or that for any number $\epsilon "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic" ). There are libraries that can represent decimal values to an arbitrary precision, but they're fairly specialized and I can't think of any that also include statistical tests. The more important question is whether you need to care. If you need to report the aparently-zero $p$-values, you could write $p eps(0) ), and you could use that "upper bound" if you were doing something with the $p$-values, like multiple comparisons correction. Most importantly, I'd encourage you not to over-interpret the absolute values. While this is the definition of a $p$-value, I'm not sure I would believe that you'll only see a difference this extreme much fewer than one in a googol times if there's no difference between your groups.
