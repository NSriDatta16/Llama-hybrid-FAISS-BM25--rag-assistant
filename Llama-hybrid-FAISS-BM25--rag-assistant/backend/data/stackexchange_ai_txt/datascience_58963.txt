Deep Learning is more an art than a science, meaning that there is no unaninously 'right' or 'wrong' solution. It is perfectly possible that cosine similarity works better that MSE in some cases. No loss function have been proven to be sistematically superior to any other, when it comes to train Machine Learning models. The only thing that you can do is to try all available options and choose the one that better fits your data and model.
