How to add all symbols in library folder to stage at runtime

I just submitted this question but i can't see if it posted anywhere, so I apologize if this is a duplicate. For a Flash CS4 project, I am constantly importing new images, converting them to movieclips and storing them in the library under an "Ornaments" folder. All of these ornaments need to be on the stage in a certain place when the program is initialized. Instead of having to drag the new symbols onto the stage every time I add a new, is it possible to add all of the symbols in the "Ornament" library folder to the stage at runtime? Thanks
