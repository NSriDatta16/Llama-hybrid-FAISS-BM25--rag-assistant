You might want to take a look at Monte : Monte (python) is a Python framework for building gradient based learning machines, like neural networks, conditional random fields, logistic regression, etc. Monte contains modules (that hold parameters, a cost-function and a gradient-function) and trainers (that can adapt a module's parameters by minimizing its cost-function on training data). Modules are usually composed of other modules, which can in turn contain other modules, etc. Gradients of decomposable systems like these can be computed with back-propagation.
