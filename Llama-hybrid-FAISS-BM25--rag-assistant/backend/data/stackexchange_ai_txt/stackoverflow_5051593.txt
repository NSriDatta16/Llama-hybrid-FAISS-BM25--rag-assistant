WebViews can display HTML not images. You either need to use an ImageView or generate some HTML with an image tag that displays your picture. If it needs to be dynamic you can generate it as a String and use the loadData() method to display it. Edit: You're going to want something like this in your html String. String base = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath().toString(); String imagePath = base + "/test.jpg"; String html = (" "); mWebView.loadData(html, "text/html","utf-8");
