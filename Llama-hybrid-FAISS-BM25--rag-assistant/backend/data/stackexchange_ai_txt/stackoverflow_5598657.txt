How should I store usernames/password for automated authentication?

An organization I work for has a few different websites they use on a daily basis. I've been asked to develop a web application (using ASP.NET) that can access/synthesize information from these and display it in one location. Unfortunately, one of the websites does not support OAuth or anything similar, so I need to store their login credentials in a database. My first thought was to use their credentials for my site as a key to encrypt their credentials for the remote site. For example: Bob logs in to my website with the password hunter2. Using that password, I decrypt Bob's credentials for www.example.com and log in as Bob there. Since I don't need to access example.com unless Bob is on my site, I can discard the decrypted credentials once he's done. My assumption that simply using hunter2 (or whatever Bob's password is) isn't enough and that there is a "standard" way that I haven't been able to find on Google or Stack Overflow.
