You are analyzing raw means, so in a random-effects model, the intercept represents the estimated average (over studies) mean (so, assuming there is heterogeneity, the true means differ across studies and the intercept term is then the estimated average mean). Therefore, if the intercept is significantly different from zero, then this suggests that the average mean is unlikely to be 0.
