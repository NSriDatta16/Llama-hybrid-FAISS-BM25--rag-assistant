How to interpret R-squared versus nRMSE for a random forest model?

I have trained six random forest regression models (to predict topsoil, subsoil and total soil organic carbon stocks for two study ares) using out-of-bag validation, and I have gathered the R² and normalised RMSE (normalised using the mean of the measured values) of the validation, as suggested by my thesis supervisors. The results can be seen in the table at the bottom of the post. I am a bit lost on how these two accuracy metrics relate to each other and how they should be interpreted. From what I've read online, the R² quantifies how much of the variation is explained by the model while the RMSE quantifies how much of the variation is left unexplained, so if I understand correctly, R² and RMSE should tell two sides of the same story. Then how is it possible that the R² and nRMSE of my models are so inconsistent? (i.e. the "main" models have consistently higher R² values than the "valley" models, but the nRMSE values of both are similar and even a bit lower for the "valley" models.) Am I not interpreting them right? Does it have something to do with the normalisation of the RMSE?
