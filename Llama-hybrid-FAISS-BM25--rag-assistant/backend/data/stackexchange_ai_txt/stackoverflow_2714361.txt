I have got four classes A , B , C and D . Class A has a member b of class B . Class B has a member c of class C . A has a member D* dpointer; This hierarchy has to be preserved (in fact this is a GUI with app, window, panel as A , B and C ). Now B and C must use a method from *dpointer . Is there something more elegant than giving dpointer as a member of B and C ? Is it bad ?
