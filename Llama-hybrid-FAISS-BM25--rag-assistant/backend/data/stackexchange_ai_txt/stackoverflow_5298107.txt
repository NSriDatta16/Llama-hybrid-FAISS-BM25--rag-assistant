Multiple Build Agents - TeamCity - VisualSVN Server - ASP.Net

I am thinking about setting up TeamCity with 2 build agents. One being our staging server with will be an exact copy of our development version and updated on every SVN/GIT commit. And the other would be our live server which would only update manually and wouldn't copy over certain files (web.config for example). Is this setup possible? I have done this before using a combination of CCNet and MSBuild, but it was very fiddly. On the standard version of TeamCity you can have 20 integrations, is that 20 active integrations (old ones can be switched off or would I need to delete the old ones and re-add them if needed). And finally I have always been an SVN man, but I hear about and see people using GIT more and more, is it any better or am I fine just carrying on with SVN. Cheers in advance.
