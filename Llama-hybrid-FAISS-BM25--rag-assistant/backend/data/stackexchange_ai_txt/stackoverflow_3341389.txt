The main difference is that on Unix, you'll have Makefiles, which you won't find on Windows. Visual Studio organizes your code in projects and solutions, and those project files contain all the information VS needs to compile&link your projects. If you have a *.sln file, just double click it to open it in VS. Then build the source (usually by pressing F6) and run in debug mode (usually F5). More details: A project is a collection of source files that result in 'something', usually a LIB, a DLL or an EXE. A solution is a collection of projects. Useful when e.g. one project creates a LIB that is used by another project. When you set dependencies between projects, VS will build the projects in the right order. Extensions used: *.vcproj : Project file for C/C++ sources *.vcproj..user : contains which windows are open in the GUI. Can safely be deleted. *.sln : Solution file *.ncb : Intellisense database for a solution. Can safely be deleted. *.suo : contains which windows are open in the GUI. Can safely be deleted. *.dsw : Visual Studio 6.0 related file - not used in VS2005. (Replaced by *.sln IIRC) ./Debug/* : folder with all intermediate files for a Debug build (can be changed) ./Release/* : folder with all intermediate files for a Release build (can be changed) That's all I can think of at the moment.
