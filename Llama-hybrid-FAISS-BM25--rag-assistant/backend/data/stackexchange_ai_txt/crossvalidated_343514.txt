When is it acceptable to probe an interaction effect between categorical variables? (Regression vs. anova)

This question seems to be an overly simple one but I would still appreciate an informed response. I am testing the interaction effect between a categorical variable (5 levels) and a binary variable. Outcome variable is continuous. I have completed by regression and anova to test for a possible interaction effect. Results of regression indicates a significant interaction effect between two groups (EX: class 1 and 2). In short, the regression output suggests a significant interaction effect (Class=3 * BIN=1) and the anova output suggests that the SSQ of the interaction term is non-significant (CLASS:BIN). (1) Does the significant interaction term (Class=3 * BIN=1) in the regression output justify "probing" of the significant interaction effect? (2) What is the significance of the (non-significant) interaction term (CLASS:BIN) in anova? (3) Say the moderator and DV are flipped (categorical by continuous predicting binary) so you are now running a binary logistic regression. P-value for the contrast of interaction effect for 2 dummy classes is still significant. Does it now make sense to probe the interaction solely within a regression framework? Would you not if the anova output is still saying the whole interaction term is NOT significant?
