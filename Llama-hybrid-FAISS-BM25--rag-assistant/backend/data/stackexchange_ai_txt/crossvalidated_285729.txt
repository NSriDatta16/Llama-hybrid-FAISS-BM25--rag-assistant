Sec. 1: Data Augmentation Since deep networks need to be trained on a huge number of training images to achieve satisfactory performance, if the original image data set contains limited training images, it is better to do data augmentation to boost the performance. Also, data augmentation becomes the thing must to do when training a deep network. There are many ways to do data augmentation, such as the popular horizontally flipping, random crops and color jittering. Moreover, you could try combinations of multiple different processing, e.g., doing the rotation and random scaling at the same time. In addition, you can try to raise saturation and value (S and V components of the HSV color space) of all pixels to a power between 0.25 and 4 (same for all pixels within a patch), multiply these values by a factor between 0.7 and 1.4, and add to them a value between -0.1 and 0.1. Also, you could add a value between [-0.1, 0.1] to the hue (H component of HSV) of all pixels in the image/patch. Krizhevsky et al. 1 proposed fancy PCA when training the famous Alex-Net in 2012. Fancy PCA alters the intensities of the RGB channels in training images. In practice, you can firstly perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout your training images. And then, for each training image, just add the following quantity to each RGB image pixel (i.e., I_{xy}=[I_{xy}^R,I_{xy}^G,I_{xy}^B]^T): [bf{p}_1,bf{p}_2,bf{p}_3][alpha_1 lambda_1,alpha_2 lambda_2,alpha_3 lambda_3]^T where, bf{p}_i and lambda_i are the i-th eigenvector and eigenvalue of the 3times 3 covariance matrix of RGB pixel values, respectively, and alpha_i is a random variable drawn from a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. Please note that, each alpha_i is drawn only once for all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again. That is to say, when the model meets the same training image again, it will randomly produce another alpha_i for data augmentation. In 1 , they claimed that “fancy PCA could approximately capture an important property of natural images, namely, that object identity is invariant to changes in the intensity and color of the illumination”. To the classification performance, this scheme reduced the top-1 error rate by over 1% in the competition of ImageNet 2012. (Source: Must Know Tips/Tricks in Deep Neural Networks (by Xiu-Shen Wei))
