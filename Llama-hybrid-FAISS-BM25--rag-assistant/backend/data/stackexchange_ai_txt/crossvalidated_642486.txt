Reproducing a cool chart - Better understanding reference classes in mutlinomial logistic regression

I am trying to reproduce this excellent data visualisation from the Economist https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/build-a-voter They have used multinomial logistic regression, and have created a "feature contribution" water-fall style chart to build-up voting intentions of defined demographic groups. I have a similar set of data (unrelated to politics!), and am trying to perform a similar analysis. The example below is a made-up, reproducible example in similar vein to the economist version. (Big thanks to chatgpt for writing the example quickly!) Can you help me interpret the co-efficients from the model output so that I can calculate the "waterfall values" of each level of the predictor variables? (NB. My understanding is that this is done in comparison with a reference class, which is what the model has done here. What I like about the economist version is that it presents as agnostic to a reference class, at least in the viz. I expect there is some dummy variable shenanigans going on, but I can't figure it out, and would love someone smarter to help!) ###### Load packages ###### require(tidyverse) require(nnet) ###### Create example data set ###### set.seed(123) # Set seed for reproducibility # Function to generate voting intention with different probabilities for each party generate_voting_intention
