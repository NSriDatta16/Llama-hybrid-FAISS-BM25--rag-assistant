Effect sizes for test of two categorical variables on a binary response variable?

I'm currently analyzing data from a driving simulator study about different warning concepts that vary in two parameters. The explanatory variables are warning parameter 1 (2 treatment groups) and parameter 2 (2 treatment groups). The response variable is collisions after warnings (collision vs. no collision). I would like to know whether parameter 1 and parameter 2 and their interaction have a significant effect on collision avoidance. If I understood right, it can be analyzed with logistic regression. I adopted the R code from the post Test for effects of two categorical variables on a binary response variable? for that: mymodel Now, I wonder which effect sizes should be reported and how to calculate them. Can anyone recommend an appropriate effect size?
