Additive Or Multiplicative Time Series Model?

So i Just have a question,for the time series graph https://gyazo.com/c8246b91ff891fa4177b3d4f22fb4aec (UPDATED) The time series graph shows the amount of box office sales in $US millions over a 17 year period. Here is a decomposition graph using additive model: https://gyazo.com/4894ac6b6007145844735fec373ae7a85 Multiplicative model: https://gyazo.com/5104d911493213b73b864ebaacbe527fc Would a additive or multiplicative model best fit this graph? In my personal opinion I think a multiplicative model would best fit this graph, as it appears that there is alot of seasonal spikes appear to vary in different size and magnitude. However I am not certain.
