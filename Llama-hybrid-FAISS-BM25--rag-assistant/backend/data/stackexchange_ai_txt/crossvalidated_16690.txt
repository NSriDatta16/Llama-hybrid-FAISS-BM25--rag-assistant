It makes it easier to interpret the results. Suppose you had some height data: Woman A: 165 Woman B: 170 Woman C: 175 Man D: 170 Man E: 180 Man F: 190 and you took a regression of the form Height = a + b * Gender + Residual . With the 0,1 dummy variable you would get an estimate of a of 170 being the average height of the women and of b of 10 being the difference between the average heights of the men and the women. With the 1,2 dummy variable you would get an estimate of a of 160 which is harder to interpret.
