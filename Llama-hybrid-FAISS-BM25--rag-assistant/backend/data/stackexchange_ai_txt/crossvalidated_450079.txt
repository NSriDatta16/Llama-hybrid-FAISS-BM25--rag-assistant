Should all (but one) seasonal dummies be included?

I have a question concerning the significance of seasonal dummies in a simple lm regression for time series. I want to determine whether I should include dummy variables for months of the year or not. When I run a decomposition function like tbats or stl it states that there is a seasonal component in my time series. When I then run a linear regression with dummies for seasonality and I look a the p-values, I get the result that some month dummies are significant and others are not. Should I only include the significant month dummies into the model or am I missing something here? I have hundreds of time series so I'm looking for some kind of rule of thumb that I can apply to all of them at once.
