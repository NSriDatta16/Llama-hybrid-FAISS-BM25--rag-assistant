What will a neural network respond to a never-seen feature?

If I want to "shut off" one of the input neurons of an ANN at training time and then turn it back on at inference time, what will happen? Let's say you want to do ablation study by setting every single feature X value to 0 in the dataset at training time. If at inference time I give (back) this feature, what would be the response from the neural network? Will it perform as well as if I also set all feature X to 0 at inference time, or performing worse due to confusion on this added feature? Does the answer change if different training method (specifically optimizer, like Adam optimizer or SGD) is used?
