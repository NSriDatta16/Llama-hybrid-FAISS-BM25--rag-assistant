How do I calculate the Credible interval of the effect size? (Bayesian framework)

I use R. I have a linear mixed model and I use its output to estimate my posterior distribution (with uninformative priors) using the function sim . I calculate the effect size between different subgroup as differences between the fitted values. Shall I use the same criteria also for the credible intervals (CrI)? Example: Subgroup1 has (-0.11, 0.01, 0.13) as lower, fit and upper estimates (95% CrI) Subgroup2 has (0.09, 0.26, 0.42) as lower, fit and upper estimates (95% CrI) The effect size is for me 0.25, what about its CrI? Again just the difference?
