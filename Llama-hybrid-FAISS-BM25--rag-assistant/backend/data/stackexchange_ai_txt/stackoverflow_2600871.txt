When to address managed heap fragmentation

I was reading a blog entry by Josh Smith where he used a cache mechanism in order to "reduce managed heap fragmentation". His caching reduces the number of short-lived objects being created at the cost of slightly slower execution speed. How much of a problem is managed heap fragmentation in a managed language like C#? How can you diagnose if it's an issue? In what situations would you typically need to address it?
