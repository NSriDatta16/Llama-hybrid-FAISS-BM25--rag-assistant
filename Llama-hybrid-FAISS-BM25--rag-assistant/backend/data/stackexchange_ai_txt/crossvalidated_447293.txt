Although the information in your question does not quite make sense (0.75% missingness with 156 observations) the answer to your question is that you need to apply Rubin's rules for pooling the analysis on the 20 imputed datasets. Essentially, this involves simply averaging the point estimates but the standard errors are not averaged because there is variation between imputations as well as within inmputations. You can apply Rubin's rules using any statistical software, but you will have to run the analysis model on each of the imputed datasets and then calculate the pooled values manually (or programatically). Alternatively you could just use the mice package in R and use the the supplied pool function. For example using the nhanes dataset: > library(mice) > imp fit round(summary(pool(fit), conf.int = TRUE), 3) estimate std.error statistic df p.value 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) -7.222 68.901 -0.105 9.462 0.919 -161.933 147.490 age 36.655 10.351 3.541 11.529 0.004 13.998 59.311 bmi 5.199 2.156 2.412 9.332 0.038 0.349 10.050 and this produces the pooled estimates using Rubin's rules, including standard errors, confidence intervals and p values.
