Personally I've never heard of anyone trying to do this in Ruby. It's definitely not a standard practice. That said you may be able to leverage this trick: if __FILE__ == $0 # Do something.. run tests, call a method, etc. We're direct. end The code in the if block will only execute if the file is executed directly, not if it's required by another library or application.
