this link helped me.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBi-P5j0Kec i am hoping it will help you as well say the distribution as as below A B C D A 100 80 10 10 B 0 9 0 1 C 0 1 8 1 D 0 1 0 9 the precision for A would be P(A) = 100/ 100 + 0 + 0 +0 = 100 P(B) = 9/ 9 + 80 + 1 + 1 = 9/91 psst... essentially take the true positive of the class and divide up by the column data across rows recall for a would be R(A) = 100/ 100+ 80+10+10 = 0.5 R(B) = 9 / 9+ 0+0+1 = 0.9 psst... essentially take the true positive of the class and divide up by the row data across columns once you get all the values, take the macro average avg(P) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) / 4 avg(R) = R(A) + R(B) + R(C) + R(D) / 4 F1 = 2 *avg(P) * avg(R) / avg(P) + avg(R)
