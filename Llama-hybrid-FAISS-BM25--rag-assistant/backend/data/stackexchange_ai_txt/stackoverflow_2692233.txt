WWW::Mechanize is built on top of LWP::UserAgent , so you can use the LWP::UserAgent methods. The default timeout is 180 seconds, which is already extremely long, but you can change it to be any value that you like by using the timeout method: $mech->timeout( $really_long_value ); This timeout is not the total request time, but the idle time on the socket that the user-agent will tolerate. If it receives no interaction within that time, the request should fail. However, it sounds like the server probably has a problem since it takes so long even when you do it manually. You might mention this to whoever runs that site. That error message is very suspicious. Without more details about the server, etc, it's very difficult to tell you what's going on. As for the cookie issue, just watch the HTTP conversation when you try it manually. Do whatever your interactive browser does. If it sends cookies, do that. If it uses a different form of authentication, do that, and so on. They might have changed more than the scheme when they turned off port 80.
