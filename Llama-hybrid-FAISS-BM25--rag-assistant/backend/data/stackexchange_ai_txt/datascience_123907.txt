Prediction intervals for future timestamps - out-of-sample

I've created a model for out-of-sample forecasting that uses multistep recursive strategy to reduce my problem to regression, the predictions are sufficient but I was wondering if there is any possibility to add something like prediction intervals - I know how to do this using residual based solutions (e.g. RMSFE) only for in-sample models when historical data is available. I've read somewhere about an idea of using Bayesian Structural Time Series modelling on past forecast errors to somehow estimate the uncertainty and then Monte Carlo Simulation to generate a range of possible future errors but I've concerns about this solution.
