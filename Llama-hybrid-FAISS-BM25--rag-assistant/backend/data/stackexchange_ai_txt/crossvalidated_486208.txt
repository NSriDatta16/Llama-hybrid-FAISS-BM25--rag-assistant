R - Logistic regression: how to prepare data

I've been doing a lot of googling on logistic regression but I've been getting confused more and more so please help me out. The data set I have The outcomes of interest (dependent variables) are Are admissions 'potentially preventable hospitalisations' (PPH) - Yes/no Are the patients admitted or discharged within a day - Admitted/ Discharged My Independent varibles are Migration status (Australian, Migrants, Refugees) Socio-economic Status (Low, High) Age ( 35) Here are the problems I have with my data set. I have about 6000 data for Australians, 1000 for migrants and 200 for refugees. Is this too big of an imblance to conduct logistic regression? For PPH outcome I have about 300 NAs, mostly from the Australian data - Im assuming this is because they have more sample so they are more likely to have NAs, but I wasnt sure if I should removed them or not. I have heard for data analysis removing data is only done if really necessary. Also a I have a similar concern as 1. where the rate of PPH is approximately 500, 10, 100 for Australians, refugees and migrants. I would like some advice on how to approach this data. Other problems are more fundamentally Logistic regression related, Setting the data type as a factor. I've converted Admitted ~ 1, and discharged ~ 0 and set the data type as an integer. C_ALL_analysis % mutate(Admitted_log = case_when( admitted_group == "Admitted" ~ 1, admitted_group == "Discharged" ~ 0)) Since the outcome of interest for me is admitted, and I want my results in terms of admitted is this the right things to do? Or am I suppose to convert admitted ~ 0 and Discharged ~ 1 to get my results in terms of admitted? Or can I keep my data as characters (admitted/ discharged), convert the variable into factors? But if I do convert them into factors, how do I know if the results is in reference 'admitted' or discharged? This is the code I put and the results I got C_ALL_analysis $age_group age_group) C_ALL_analysis $country_group country_group) C_ALL_analysis $IRSD_group IRSD_group) C_ALL_analysis $admitted_group admitted_group) C_ALL_analysis $Admitted_log Admitted_log) str(C_ALL_analysis) > $ age_group : Factor w/ 3 levels " 35","21-34": 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 ... $ IRSD_group : Factor w/ 2 levels "High","Low": 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ... $ country_group : Factor w/ 3 levels "AUS","HSC","NHSC": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ admitted_group: Factor w/ 2 levels "Admitted","Discharged": 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 ... $ Admitted_log : int 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 ... ** i will use admitted_group which i set as a factor mymodel Call: glm(formula = admitted_group ~ country_group, family = "binomial", data = C_ALL_analysis) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.346 -1.221 1.078 1.134 1.134 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The odds ratio of Australians being admitted to hospital is 1.108559, with p-value of 6.17e-05. The confidece interval of the odds ratio is (1.0540699-1.165917). Is this interpretation of the data correct? After this I am planning to run a second logistic regression to work out the adjusted odds ratio mymodel Since the aim for me is not to build a model, but to analyse my data, is it necessary for me to split my data into train and test data? Sorry I am very new to statistics in general so this questions may sound pretty basic, but please help me out!
