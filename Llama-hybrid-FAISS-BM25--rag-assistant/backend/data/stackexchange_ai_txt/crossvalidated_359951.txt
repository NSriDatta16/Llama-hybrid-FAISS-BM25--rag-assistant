Here is the definition of the HDR, taken from Rob Hyndman's 1996 article "Computing and Graphing Highest Density Regions" in The American Statistician : Let $f(x)$ be the density function of a random variable $X$. Then the $100(1-\alpha)\%$ HDR is the subset $R(f_\alpha)$ of the sample space of $X$ such that $$R(f_\alpha) = \{x\colon f(x)\geq f_\alpha\},$$ where $f_\alpha$ is the largest constant such that $$P\big(X\in R(f_\alpha)\big)\geq 1-\alpha.$$ Figure 1 from that article illustrates the difference between the 75% HDR (so $\alpha=0.25$) and various other 75% Probability Regions for a mixture of two normals ($c_q$ is the $q$-th quantile, $\mu$ the mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the density): The idea in one dimension is to take a horizontal line and shift it up (to $y=f_\alpha$) until the area above it and under the density is $1-\alpha$. Then the HDR $R_\alpha$ is the projection to the $x$ axis of this area. Of course, all this works with any density, whether Bayesian posterior or other. Here is a link to Rob Hyndman's page on HDRs. The article can be found on JSTOR Rob Hyndman's hdrcde package for R implements the algorithm from the papers and from subsequent work; Rob's page on the hdrcde package contains pointers to further literature.
