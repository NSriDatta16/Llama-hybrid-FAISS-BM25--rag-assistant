I would do it like this...Create a JPanel to contain the JTable on top and a JLabel on the bottom. Something like this... JPanel container = new JPanel( new BorderLayout() ); container.add( table, BorderLayout.CENTER ); JLabel label = new JLabel( "Drag XXX here to add a row" ); container.add( table, BorderLayout.SOUTH ); Then make both the label and table drop targets. You might need to play with the label to make it look and behave right. Set opaque to true possibly? Set its background to white to match the table? Also maybe play with the borders of all three to make them look integrated with each other. You could remove the label after the first row is added if that is the behavior you want.
