First of all perl's "__DATA__" pragma is a way of supplying input to $_ without specifying a file. There is no equivalent in bash since it has nothing similar to $_. However you can supply data directly in a bash script by other means such as explicit setting variables, using HERE docs etc. However I'm not convinced this is what you wish to do. It seems your after some sort of block commenting method. Is that the case?
