You should google Genetic Programming Algorithms They (sort of like the Neural Networks mentioned by Chaos) will enable you to generate solutions programmatically, then have the program modify itself based on a criteria, and create new solutions which are hopefully closer to accurate. Neural Networks would have to be trained by you, but with genetic programming, the program will do all the work. Although it is a hell of a lot of work to get them running in the first place!
