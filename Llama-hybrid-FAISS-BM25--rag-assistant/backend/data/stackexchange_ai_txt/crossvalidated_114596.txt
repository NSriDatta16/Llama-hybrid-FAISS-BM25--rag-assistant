What questions would you ask about the data? How long did the hamster spend on the wheel last night? Was it longer or shorter than the night before that? Is there any day per week that the hamster runs longer on the wheel? Eg does a hamster have a week day or weekend day %^)? How long does the hamster stay on the wheel in a continuous stretch, on average? Does different type of food affect the time the hamster spends on the wheel? Do my activities change the hamster's wheel behaviour? All of these would suggest different types of plots. Aggregate time on wheel by day, plot over days. See http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/hofmann-unwin-cook.pdf for how to plot data in different ways to explore different things, answer different questions. One plot is almost never enough.
