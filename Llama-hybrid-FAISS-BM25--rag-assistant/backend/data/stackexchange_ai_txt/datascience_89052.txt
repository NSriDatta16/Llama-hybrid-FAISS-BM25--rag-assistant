How to show two pictures in one cell in Jupyter Notebook? (matplotlib) (python)

As a beginner, can someone please help me with this? Is there any way to show both pictures in a single cell's output? My output could only display one picture. Thank you for your time and attention! Here is my code: from skimage import data image_coffee = data.coffee() image_horse = data.horse() fig = plt.figure(dpi=100) plt.imshow(image_coffee) plt.imshow(image_horse)
