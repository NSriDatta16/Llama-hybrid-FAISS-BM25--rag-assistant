I have the following environment: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit MS office (with Access) 2010 64-bit I am developing an application in VS 2010 and the application is being developed for x86 CPU. I am using DataSet to connect to the database and I am using the NewConnection wizard to connect to the database. I want to use an access database for data storage. (.accdb file) I downloaded and installed the Access Database engine (64 bit). When i use: Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0 - I get an error that the database format is not readable!! Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 - I get an error that the Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 driver is not registered on the local machine! Please help me find a solution to the problem.
