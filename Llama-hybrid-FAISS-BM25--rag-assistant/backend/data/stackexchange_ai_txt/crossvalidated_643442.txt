The concept and notation about MLE(Likelihood) and MAP

In generally, we say that X1, X2, ..., Xi are from a certain distribution, which can be represented by f(x;θ), where θ is an unknown parameter. When I read content related to MLE or the Likelihood function, I often see the use of f(x|θ) to represent the distribution of data X1, X2, ..., Xi. In Frequentist, θ is an unknown parameter, not a random variable . Is f(x;θ) the same as f(x|θ)? Is f(x|θ) a conditional probability even if θ is not a random variable ? and why? In Bayesian, the theta is a random variable, not an unknown parameter , the formula is: with P is distribution like f. Why P(x|θ) is likelihood? (θ is random variable! ) If we fix θ to an unknown parameter, i.e. P(θ=θ*), is MAP equal to MLE?
