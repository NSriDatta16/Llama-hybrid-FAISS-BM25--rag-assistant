How to build classifier if only 1 image per class available

If I have only 1 image for each of 10 classes, what is the best way to build an image classifier? The images themselves are large (1200x1600) and of good quality. For example: Or similar images from https://www.pexels.com/search/flowers/ From what I have read, neural networks need large amount of data for training. Which other machine learning methods can be used in such a situation? Basically, image similarity needs to be assessed. Can support vector machines be used here?
