Like awalshe said, it's better to merge between branches. To cherry-pick a merge, the method described in Pragmatic Version Control using CVS is very good: In the branch - tag ( PRE_FOO ) before the change, make the changes and commit, tag after the change ( POST_FOO ). Then, in trunk, merge using the tags: cvs up -j PRE_FOO -j POST_FOO Merging between branches is much easier and safer in SVN, and it's trivial to convert your entire CVS history to SVN - see cvs2svn . You should use either SVN 1.5, or - with earlier SVN versions - svnmerge .
