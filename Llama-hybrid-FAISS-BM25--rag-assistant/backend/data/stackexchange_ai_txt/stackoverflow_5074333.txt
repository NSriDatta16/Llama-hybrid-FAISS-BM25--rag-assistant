Definitions of XCode project templates, and approaches to Cocoa development

My background is c#, .net, and Visual Studio. I've been trying to get to grips with Cocoa development, but am finding it hard to find information about certain things, maybe because I'm coming in from a Visual Studio perspective. A few questions: What's the difference between a "Framework" project, and a "Library" project in XCode? What are the consequences of choosing "dynamic" or "static" for your project when starting a new XCode project. Can this be changed later on? does it affect the contents of the project? Does XCode have the concept of a "solution" with various projects like Visual Studio? If so, how do you reference projects with each other which are in the same solution in XCode? Is it even right to approach a Cocoa project in the same way as a .net one. For example, if I was going to build a simple image manipulation app, I'd start with the core library, which could be referenced in a winforms, silverlight, or an MVC frontend app. How does that organisation work in XCode?
