The best illustration for why something problematic might be going on when averaging rankings is probably an example of the following ranking of areas (as an example I will use average income and assume that income per head is a relevant number): Large area 1, small geographical sub-area A: population 100, average income 100,000 USD Large area 2, small geographical sub-area C: population 10000, average income 10,001 USD Large area 2, small geographical sub-area D: population 10000, average income 10,000 USD Large area 1, small geographical sub-area B: population 9900, average income 1,000 USD The average rank for both large areas is 2.5, but the average income per head is much higher in large area 2. You can probably also construct all sorts of examples with small differences such as {10,001,10,002,10,003 USD} vs. {9,997, 9,998, 9,999 USD} causing major changes in raking and obscuring massive differences in some sub-areas (e.g. if you add another sub-area with average income 100,000 USD to the second group, it still has the lower average rank). A classic example of ranking can be abused is gerrymandering . Better approaches might include: calculating the metric of interest on a larger area level (if possible based on the available data), using hierarchical models etc.
