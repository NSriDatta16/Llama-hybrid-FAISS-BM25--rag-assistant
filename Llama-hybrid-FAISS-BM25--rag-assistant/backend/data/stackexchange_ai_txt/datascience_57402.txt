A predictive model utilizing logistic regression cannot predict that at least one customer [...] You cannot test if something cannot be done . All you can do is to prove the opposite, which is exactly what the alternative hypothesis is used for. Therefore, this null hypothesis is not testable. The alternative hypothesis would be: A predictive model utilizing logistic regression can predict that at least one customer [...] with more than 70% confidence. This can be tested. You build a model and if you succeed, you proved the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis.
