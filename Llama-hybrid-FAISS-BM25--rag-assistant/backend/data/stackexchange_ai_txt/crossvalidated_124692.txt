constant means there is an intercept included in each equation in the model. trend means there is a linear time trend included. both means both of them are included. none means neither of them is included. Type ?VAR in R to get an explanation. There you will find the algebraic form of the model provided. Pay attention to the CD_t term. You may also see the vignette for the vars package, perhaps it could help.
