I think there is something (like a tabBar) at the bottom of your screen and it is overlapping the UITableView .. am I right, am I right?! Just make the frame of the UITableView 48 pixels shorter. That's the average size of a tabBar.. Or perhaps you have not taken in account that the bar at the top (the status bar) also counts, which is about 15 pixels high. In that case, take 15 pixels of the height of your UITableView's frame.
