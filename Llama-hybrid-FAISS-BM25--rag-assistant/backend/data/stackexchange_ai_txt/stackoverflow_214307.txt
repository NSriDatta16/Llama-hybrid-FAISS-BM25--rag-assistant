Can they both be set up to do it at the same time? I think if you try, you might get NHibernate complaining, as most of it's operations check the row count to ensure that the expect number of rows were inserted/updated/deleted. As Ben says, get NHibernate to do it. Ultimately, NHibernate (and ORMs in general) let you think of the database as a storage and retrieval mechanism. You still want to create constraints, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes, but the ORM should obey these rules anyway. As with any data-access scenerio, if you find yourself creating complex constraints in the database, then remember that these rules will have to be duplicated in your application.
