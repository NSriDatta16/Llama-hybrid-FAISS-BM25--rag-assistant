.Net [Windows] TreeView TreeNode does not retain color change after drag and drop

I have a form with 2 tree views, the user can drag and drop a node from one to another. After a node has been dragged and dropped, I change the color[highlight] of the source node in the Drag-Drop event handles.The color of the node changes fine. But when the users hovers the mouse over the source tree view after that, it flickers and the highlighting I had done disappears, reverting to the original color. I'm not handling any other event, I don't reload the treeview and I'm not changing the color. From my understanding of the MSDN documentation, I don't see any Refresh or Repaint type events.
