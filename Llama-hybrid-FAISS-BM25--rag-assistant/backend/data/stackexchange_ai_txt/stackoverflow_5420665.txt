Java RIA app with local database + synchronisation support

I need to develop an ordering system for a client that works with tablet computers. Because they are not always connected, the app needs a replication of the database and the ability to synchronize with the main database on command. Deployment to the clients should be easy and i want to use java technologies because i am familiar with Toplink EJB persistence and Glassfish as a front-end middleware for data retrieval. I was thinking about using JDeveloper ADF for building the UI because of its ease, Derby for local storage and Glassfish or WebLogic as middleware. Is this a good approach of using these technologies together ? Should i use a framework to synchronize with the database ? How can deployment be automated ? Thanx for ur help!
