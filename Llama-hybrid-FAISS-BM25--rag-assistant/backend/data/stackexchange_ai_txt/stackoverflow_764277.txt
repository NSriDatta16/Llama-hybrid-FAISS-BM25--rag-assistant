Branch off a specific directory from one SVN repository into own repo

So here's an example of what I currently have RepoA - trunk -- directory_a -- directory_b -- directory_c I need to get directory_b out of the RepoA and into its own repository (RepoB). RepoA - trunk -- directory_a -- directory_c RepoB - trunk -- directory_b Is the best way to do this by cloning the master RepoA SVN directory to RepoB, then removing directory_b from RepoA and removing directories directory_a and directory_c from RepoB? Or is there some other, more elegant, way to extract directory_b from RepoA and get it into its own repository?
