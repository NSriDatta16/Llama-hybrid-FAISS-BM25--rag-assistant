How start an IBAction by dragging on a UIButton?

I need help with my iPhone application. I currently have 5 UIButtons in a view linked with different IBActions . The buttons are placed one close to each other. I would like to know how to make the user able to press all the buttons just by dragging his finger on the buttons instead of pulling the finger away from the screen of his device and tap on a different button. If you can't understand how the buttons are placed here's a picture ^.^ Thanks!
