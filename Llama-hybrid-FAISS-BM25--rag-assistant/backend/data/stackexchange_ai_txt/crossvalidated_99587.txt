How do we define log-normal prior and a multivariate posterior log-likelihood in PyMC?

I am a newbie with pyMC and I am not still able to construct the structure of my MCMC with pyMC. I would like to establish a chain and I am confused how to define my parameters and log-likelihood function together. My chi-squared function is given by: where and are observational data and correspondence error respectively and is the model with four free parameter and the parameters are non-linear. The priors for X and Y are uniform but for M and C are given as following: ; where the probability of c follows log-normal distribution while the expectation value of c is computed with the above formula and is the function of M and $\sigma$ is 0.09 if $M for each C the parameter z is constant. I am wondering how I could define my likelihood for , and should it be referred as @Deterministic variable? Did I define M and C as priori information in a correct way or not? I will be grateful if somebody gives me some tips that how I can combine these parameters with given priors. import pymc as pm import numpy as np import math import random from scipy.stats import expon @pm.stochastic(dtype=np.float, observed=False, trace=True) def Xpos(value=1900,x_l=1800,x_h=1950): """The probable region of the position of halo centre""" def logp(value,x_l,x_h): if ((value>x_h) or (value y_h) or (value 0): x = np.linspace(math.pow(10,13),math.pow(10,16),200 ) prob=expon.pdf(x,loc=0,scale=math.pow(10,15)) conc = [5.26/(1.+zh)*math.pow(x[i]/math.pow(10,14),-0.1) for i in range(len(x))] mu_c=0 for i in range(len(x)): mu_c+=prob[i]*conc[i]/sum(prob) if (M
