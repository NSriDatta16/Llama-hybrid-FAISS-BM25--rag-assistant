abstract test case using python unittest

Is it possible to create an abstract TestCase , that will have some test_* methods, but this TestCase won't be called and those methods will only be used in subclasses? I think I am going to have one abstract TestCase in my test suite and it will be subclassed for a few different implementation of a single interface. This is why all test methods are the some, only one, internal method changes. How can I do it in elegant way?
