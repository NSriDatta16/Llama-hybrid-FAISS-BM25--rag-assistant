Ok the answer is described in detail here: http://www.technovelty.org/code/c/amd64-pic.html . The basic gist of the explanation is that the i386 architecture implicitly dereferences the frame pointer for each function (explained on the last paragraph of the linked page). This process incurs some extra overhead so in the new 64-bit architectures, this dereferencing overhead was eliminated as an optimization. The consequence of this optimization from a linking perspective was that unless 64-bit code is explicitly compiled as position independent code, it will produce code that is hard-coded with offsets for its execution context. This is an imperfect explanation of the content in the linked page but it suffices for my purposes.
