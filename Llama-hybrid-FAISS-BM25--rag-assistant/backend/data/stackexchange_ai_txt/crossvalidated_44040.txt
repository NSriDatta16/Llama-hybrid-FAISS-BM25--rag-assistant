It depends on how strictly you want to define it, most I believe would accept that for all parameter values, if the interval has at least 1 - alpha coverage - it can be taken as a confidence interval (no matter how you came up with it). There is an interesting post on this right now at Normal Deviate One could define it more strictly as always equal to 1 - alpha (similar I think I recall the technical term being) which is sometime achieved by post study randomization (or something equivalent) or not admitting relevant subsets or etc. Not a bad idea to do a simulation and plot the coverge over the parameter space. For instance, the odds ratio from a two group experiment with binary outcomes has a very interesting plot. As per comment below choose your CI to make the coverage 1−α for some parameters and greater for others? this is usual case. Normaldeviate's plot was an example with just one parameter and that is very misleading for when there are more than one parameter. But there are always caveats - for instance the whole real line, plane, etc has 100% covergae for all parameter values. One of the more famous unresolved problems is very simple problem to state and dicussed on wiki. Behrens-Fisher . Doing some simulations and plotting coverage over the full parameter space is highly recomended ;-)
