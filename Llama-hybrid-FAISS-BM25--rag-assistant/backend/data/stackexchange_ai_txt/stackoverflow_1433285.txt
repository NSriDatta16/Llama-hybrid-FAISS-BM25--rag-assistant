Try JSCoverage . JSCoverage is a tool that measures code coverage for JavaScript programs. JSCoverage works by instrumenting the JavaScript code used in web pages. Code coverage statistics are collected while the instrumented JavaScript code is executed in a web browser. The instrumentation can be done on-the-fly if you set the JSCoverage Server to run as an HTTP proxy and configure your browser to go through it. One way to use it is: Launch JSCoverage Server in proxy mode: jscoverage-server --proxy --verbose Configure your browser to you use localhost:8080 as the HTTP proxy. Add the following bookmarklet, making sure the relative path to jscoverage is correct: javascript:void(window.open('jscoverage/jscoverage.html')) Run your tests. Run the bookmarklet. It will popup a new window that shows you the coverage results.
