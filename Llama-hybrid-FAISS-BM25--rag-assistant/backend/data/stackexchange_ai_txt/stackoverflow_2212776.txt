Overload handling of std::endl?

I want to define a class MyStream so that: MyStream myStream; myStream gives output [blah]123 [blah]56 [blah]78 Basically, I want a "[blah]" inserted at the front, then inserted after every non terminating std::endl ? The difficulty here is NOT the logic management, but detecting and overloading the handling of std::endl . Is there an elegant way to do this? Thanks! EDIT: I don't need advice on logic management. I need to know how to detect/overload printing of std::endl .
