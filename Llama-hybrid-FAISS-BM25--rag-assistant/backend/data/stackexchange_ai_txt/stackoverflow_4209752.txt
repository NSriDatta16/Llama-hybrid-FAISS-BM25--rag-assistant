Access auto-assigning Null to non-Variant--where?

In Access 2007, I have two tables related such that the (surrogate) PK of one is an FK in the other: table Organization ( org_id int PK, other_fields whatever, contact_id int FK ) table contact ( contact_id int PK, contact_nm text(255), other_fields whatever ) Obviously not complete table definitions.... So I build forms that reflect this--there's a frmOrganization, with a subform sbfContact. They're related by contact_id, just as the tables are. There are controls on sbfContact for all fields in table contact except contact_id (though it is, of course, present in the Record Source (SELECT * FROM contact;)). Neither form has any code that references the other in any way, and no macros at all. My problem occurs when I try to use the subform to enter a new contact. As soon as I type a character into the control bound to contact_nm, Access tells me that "You tried to assign the Null value to a variable that is not a Variant data type." I what? Where? I'm not assigning anything to any variable--am I? If I answer "OK" to the message, the character I just typed appears in the control & everything proceeds as I expect. What's going on here, and--more importantly--what do I need to do to make it stop? Edit with more info Okay, I was hoping to simplify, but I don't s'pose it helped.... What I really have is four different entities that each requires its own Contact data: Customer Site Manufacturer Engineer (The line spacing is significant--a Customer will have at least one Site, maybe more, but Sites can exist without Customers (unless I carry "us" as a Customer). The other two are totally independent). I observed the original problem working with one of the "master" entites, and figured that it would be parallel in the others. I think that CodeSlave has pointed me to the correct source of the problem--I'm afraid that my only recourse is to not allow additions through this subform, instead building a freestanding "Create Contact" form. Other suggestions are welcome, though....
