PrestaShop vs. Shopify

I have seen several Questions comparing different ECommerce CMS's: Prestashop compared to Zen-Cart and osCommerce Magento or Prestashop, which is better? Best php/ruby/python e-commerce solution I was hoping to get some people to weigh in with which they prefer for a relatively small E-shop. I am now primarily looking at PrestaShop and Shopify . I really like that Shopify does the hosting, has quality service, and is simple to understand and theme. However PrestaShop is free and seems to be able to do just as much if not more than Shopify. I have decided that Magento is too clunky for the project, and have read that many other solutions (osCommerce, ZenCart, OpenCart) are outdated, buggy, or just inferior.
