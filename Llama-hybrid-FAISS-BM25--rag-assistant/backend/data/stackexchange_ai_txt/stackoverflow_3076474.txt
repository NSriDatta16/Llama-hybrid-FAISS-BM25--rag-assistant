Personally, the cleanest method that comes to mind would be to use CoreData, download the plists as needed (read: lazily) then instead of writing them out to disk, use CoreData to handle the storage. You'll read the data back from managed objects, and there'll be no mucking about with the filesystem on your part, let it take care of that mess for you.
