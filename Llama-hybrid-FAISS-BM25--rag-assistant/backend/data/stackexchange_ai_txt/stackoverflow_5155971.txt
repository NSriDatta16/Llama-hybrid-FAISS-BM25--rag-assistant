Because the Cat class is abstract, you do not have to implement all the interface methods. You will only have to implement all the interface methods on concrete classes which implement ISpeaks , like Tiger . This is logical, because there is no way to instantiate an object of type Cat , so there is no way to create an object which does not fully implement the interface. A similar example is given in the last paragraph of http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html
