How can I cancel Drag and Drop operation in Java/Swing programmatically?

I am just wondering if it's possible to I cancel "Drag and Drop" operation in Java/Swing programmatically? So the effect would be similar to if the user pressed the "ESC" key? I was expecting DragSourceDragEvent or DragSourceContext to have a cancelDrag() method, similar to DropTargetDragEvent which has acceptDrag() and rejectDrag() methods (both of which does not do what I want). I am missing something?
