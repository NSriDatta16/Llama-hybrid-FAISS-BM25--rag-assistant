The primary reason for this approach lies in the need to prevent overfitting and accurately assess the generalization performance of the model. Let's delve into the details: Preventing Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise and patterns specific to the training dataset, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Generalization Performance: The ultimate goal of machine learning models is to perform well on unseen data. By evaluating the model's performance on a validation dataset, we gain insights into how well it generalizes to new, unseen samples. Avoiding Data Leakage: Tuning hyperparameters on the training dataset itself can lead to data leakage, where information from the validation or test set inadvertently influences the model selection process. In conclusion, hyperparameter tuning on a validation dataset, rather than at the very beginning of model training, helps prevent overfitting, assess the model's generalization performance accurately, avoid data leakage, and enables iterative improvement of the model's hyperparameters. This approach ultimately leads to better-performing and more robust machine learning models.
