Statistical inference problems involving estimation of any aspects of a distribution arise only when the distribution is unknown . If the distribution is known then the centre can be located exactly, as can any other aspect of the distribution. Thus, even if you are interested in a HDI on the distribution rather than the mean, this is still something that would need to be estimated for an unknown distribution . Now, the HDI is essentially just a generalisation of the mode (it shrinks down to the mode as its coverage probability approaches zero). It is certainly a useful object of inference in some cases, but it is not usually considered to be a measure of central location; indeed, in some cases the HDI can be quite far from the "centre" of the distribution (particularly when dealing with bimodal distributions). Whether estimation of the HDI is more important than estimation of the mean, median, etc., will depend on the context of the problem and what you want to know.
