What does it mean when the shape of input images is (600,64,64,3)?

While attempting an assignment, I found that shape of the input image was (600,64,64,3). I thought 3 stood for the number of channels but it's listed as the 4th dimension. What does this mean? This is in reference to convolutional neural networks.
