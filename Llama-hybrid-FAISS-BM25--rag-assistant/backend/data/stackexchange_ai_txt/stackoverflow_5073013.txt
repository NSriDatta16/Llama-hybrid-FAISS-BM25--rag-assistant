How to save/load data Online(Store data with AJAX and JSON) and Offline (locally)

I need help figuring out the best, cross-browser compatible way to "SAVE" user input and STORE them locally(offline mod) AND on a server(online). Program will be used by Android and iOS. I want to know the best way to track user progress while the device is online OR offline. Hello I have been researching AJAX, JSON, XMLHttpRequest, REST, Java, and HTML5 (specifically, localStorage). The scenario: (Read a book online/offline, save page progress) A user logs in to a Web Service and the Web Service allows the user to download an "html webpage book" (view with HTML5 browser). After every page turn, a REST API uses a GET request to post the Progress data to a Web Server. Simultaneously, a JSON string is created and saved in a file on the server. (let's say "ProgressData.txt") In the background, a separate "copy" of ProgressData.txt is saved LOCALLY on the mobile device. The user then leaves the internet connection and continues to read the HTML Book. When the user regains connectivity, the ProgressData.txt is uploaded to the server using a REST API where it will update the old server file with the NEW .txt file with all of the user ProgressData. Possible solutions: HTML5 localStorage solution looks good. jQuery even simplifies it: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/html5Storage Straight Javascript looks good for Server-Side storage, however it doesn't have access to a mobile device's physical hard-drive, thus preventing any kind of offline saving. Java applets look possible. Plus not sure how Java runs with Android/iOS. I don't want to have to run a localhost(PHP/Apache/Python) from a mobiledevice every time the user goes offline, however that may be where the solution lies. I did stumble on this powerful tool: http://couchdb.apache.org/ Question: I need to know the best way to track user progress while the device is online OR offline. What is the best way to do this?
