The bottleneck of applying deep learning in practice

After reading a lot of deep learning papers, a kind of rough feeling is that there exist a lot of tricks in training the network to get the better-than-normal performance. From an industry application perspective, it is very hard to develop this kind of tricks except those elite research groups in big tech companies, e.g., google or facebook. Then what is the best way to apply deep learning algorithms in practice. Any thought and suggestions will be highly appreciated.
