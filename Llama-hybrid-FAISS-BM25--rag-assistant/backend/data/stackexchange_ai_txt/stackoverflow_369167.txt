You may not have permission to set the objectClass attribute. See whether you can attach the auxiliary class after creation, through ADSI Edit . If you can't, fix the permissions first (check the Properties tab in the Advanced view of Security settings) I could attach this specific class right now, onto a organizationalUnit object, as a domain admin; so in principle, this is possible.
