Another drag and drop question on iPhone

I tried to find an easy solution for the following. I have a main view which holds a tile. I want to drag and drop it over a UITableView. I could program the pick and drag already with UIGestureRecognizer. Now my problem is how can I detect within the table view that there is an item going to be dragged above it. For instance I want to highlight the given row when the tile is moved above it. I tried to add the touchesMoved/Began/Ended events to the viewCell. They does not get fires when I am dragging the tile over it (in other words the tile is hiding a portion of the viewCell under my finger). They get fired when there is no tile dragged above. Is there an effective hittest method for that? Thanks.
