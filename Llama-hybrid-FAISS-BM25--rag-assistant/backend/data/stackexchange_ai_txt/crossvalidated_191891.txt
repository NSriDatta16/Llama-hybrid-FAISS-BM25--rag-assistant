Understanding / plotting 2 variables where both are allowed to vary in logistic regression

I'm hoping someone can help clarify a few things for me. I ran some relatively simple logistic regressions in r and am having trouble with interpretation. I'm interested in the effects of elevation and a species diversity index on the presence/absence of a disease in individual animals. I ran a simple model of: Result~Elevation+Diversity which gave this result Call: glm(formula = Test_Result ~ Elevation + Simpsons_Diversity, family = binomial, data = XXXXXX) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.8141 -0.6984 -0.5317 -0.4143 2.3337 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.118e+00 1.594e-01 -13.289 I have a strong suspicion that diversity decreases with increasing elevation which I have confirmed although the relationship isn't quite as strong as I thought. When I run a model with an interaction term elevation*diversity I get: Call: glm(formula = Test_Result ~ Elevation_1000 + Simpsons_Diversity_100 + Elevation_1000 * Simpsons_Diversity_100, family = binomial, data = XXXXXXX) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.7908 -0.6959 -0.5437 -0.3963 2.4215 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.014422 0.179507 -11.222 Showing that adding the interaction term doesn't really help the fit of the model (AIC = 2930) and the interaction term itself is not significant (p-value=0.24). Am I on the right track so far? If I am, I understand how to convert coefficients to odds ratios and interpret those. My main question is can I plot the predicted probabilities for a combination of elevation and diversity where each variable is allowed to vary? Or is this essentially plotting the interaction? I was able to create a dataframe where I varied elevation and diversity and I used my simple non-interaction model to obtain predicted probabilities using the PREDICT fuction) for those combinations, but I want to make sure that I am doing things correctly. I've attached the plot of predicted probs for different levels of diversity.
