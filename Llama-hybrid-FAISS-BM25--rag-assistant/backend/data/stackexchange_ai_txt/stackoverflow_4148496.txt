Macro for build date in C#

This related question deals with the retrieval of an app's build date in C#, but there's gotta be a more efficient way to do it. So here's a little idea I had... Does Visual C# have a compiler macro that will insert the build date on a given position when the project is being compiled? It would be nice if the compiler could auto-generate the build date that will be displayed in my app's About screen. After all, having to change the date manually every time is a pain in the neck.
