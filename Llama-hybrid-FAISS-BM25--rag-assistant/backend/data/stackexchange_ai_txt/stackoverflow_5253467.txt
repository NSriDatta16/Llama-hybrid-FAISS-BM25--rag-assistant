You have the right idea of using 2 views on 1 scene. But embedding QGraphicsViews in a scene can be problematic. My suggestion is, if you don't care about user interaction directly with the items, to use 2 custom QGraphicsItems to hold the same QGraphicsScene that contains the items to be mirrored. In the paint() of the 2 items, use QGraphicsScene::render() to create the image and draw it.
