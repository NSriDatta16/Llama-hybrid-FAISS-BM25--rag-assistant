configure php app with multiple database connections

I have a php page with several databases. I keep reading that multiple databases is bad and you should combine them all into one, but I want to keep things separate for better organization. So let's say I stay with multiple databases. Is that bad? Now I'm seeing problem with mysql_max_connections. So I'm looking into singleton methods for getting connections. But the singleton classes seem to be only for one database connection. Is that the case? Do I need to create a separate singleton class for each database? Clarification: I anticipate the databases getting fairly large. I already have several hundred tables on one database and more are added with new content. I have heard that you don't want more then several thousand tables in any particular database. Maybe the best answer is to get everything combined somehow, but it would take a major overhaul so I would like to stick with multiple databases. I just want to know what is the most efficient way to organize connections for multiple databases.
