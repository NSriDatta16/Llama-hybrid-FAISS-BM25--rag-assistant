File downloads in IE6

I've come across a rather interesing (and frustrating) problem with IE6. We are serving up some server generated pdfs and then simply setting headers in PHP to force a browser download of the file. Works fine and all, except in IE6 but only if the windows user account is set to standard user (ie. not administrator). Since this is for a corporate environment, of course all their accounts are setup this way. Weird thing is, that in the download dialog, the Content-Type is not recognized: header( 'Pragma: public' ); header( 'Expires: 0' ); header( 'Cache-Control: must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0' ); header( 'Cache-Control: public' ); header( 'Content-Description: File Transfer' ); header( 'Content-Type: application/pdf' ); header( 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="xxx.pdf"' ); header( 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary' ); echo $content; exit; I also tried writing the file content to a temporary file first so I could also set the Content-Length in the header but that didn't help.
