I don't think there are any particularly game-specific software design patterns. Games use the same languages, libraries, platforms as everybody else and face pretty much exactly the same problems at the software level. There are certain methods or approaches that seem to be popular, but which aren't formalised at code level in the way that classic design patterns are. One example is component-based actors, often not even aggregated in the same object but via sharing an ID, communicating via a signals/slots type mechanism. Another would be the embedding of a second language for scripting purposes, such as Lua, Python, or Javascript.
