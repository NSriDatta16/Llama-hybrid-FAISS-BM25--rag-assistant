Data Science is not an algorithm to run on your data. It is the process that helps you answer a specific question. The key to be a data scientist is to ask the right questions. So, first, since you want to be familiar with machine learning, examine your data and try to understand what they can answer for you. Examples: Can I cluster the reddit questions in categories? Can you predict the score of a question based on the number of comments? Can you predict the sub-reddit that a user will ask a question?
