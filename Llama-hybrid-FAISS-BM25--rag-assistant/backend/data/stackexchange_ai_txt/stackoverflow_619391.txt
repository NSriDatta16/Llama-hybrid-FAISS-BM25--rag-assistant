Isn't the point of a LRU cache to allow you to trim the cache and throw out the least-recently-used stuff? :-) I don't see any code to trim the cache. Since you most likely want high performance for the retrieve use-case, and the trim use-case is less important why not offload the list maintenance to the trim process? IOW, just throw the entries into the cache, but timestamp them on retrieval. Don't reorder the entries, just mark them whenever they're used. Could be a true DateTime timestamp, or could be a simple counter in the class, highest number was most recently used. Then in the trim process just walk the whole tree and remove the entries with the oldest stamps.
