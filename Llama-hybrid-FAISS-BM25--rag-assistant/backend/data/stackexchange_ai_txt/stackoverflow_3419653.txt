Want to enable BHO in a WebBrowser Control embedded in a standard C# App

I have a standard winforms C# app with a webbrowser control dragged onto it. We also have a C++ BHO that we generally interact with through COM when it runs inside IE7 or IE8. I don't see any way to tell the webbrowser control to load the BHO. The BHO doesn't show any GUI or anything, it just listens to the http traffic when used from IE. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
