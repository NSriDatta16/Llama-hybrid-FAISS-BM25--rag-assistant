Including Interaction Terms in Random Forest

Suppose we have a response Y and predictors X1,....,Xn. If we were to try to fit Y via a linear model of X1,....,Xn, and it just so happened that the true relationship between Y and X1,...,Xn wasn't linear, we might be able to fix the model by transforming the X's somehow and then fitting the model. Moreover, if it just so happened that the X1,...,XN didn't affect y independent of the other features, we also might be able to improve the model by including interaction terms, x1*x3 or x1*x4*x7 or something of the like. So in the linear case, interaction terms might bring value by fixing non-linearity or independence violations between the response and the features. However, Random Forests don't really make these assumptions. Is including interaction terms important when fitting a Random Forest? Or will just including the individual terms and choosing appropriate parameters allow Random Forests to capture these relationships?
