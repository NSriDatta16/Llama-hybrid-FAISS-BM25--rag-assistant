Both solutions, filter and comprehension requires building a new list. I don't know enough of the Python internals to be sure, but I think that a more traditional (but less elegant) approach could be more efficient: names = ['Jones', 'Vai', 'Smith', 'Perez'] item = 0 while item <> len(names): name = names [item] if name=='Smith': names.remove(name) else: item += 1 print names Anyway, for short lists, I stick with either of the two solutions proposed earlier.
