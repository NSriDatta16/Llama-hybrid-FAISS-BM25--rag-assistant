Are there any machine learning algorithms that focus on comparing items, rather than classification or regression?

This is more of a hypothetical than something I'm actively trying to solve. It just struck me that a machine learning algorithm that specifically looked at two pieces of data and had to label one as greater than the other or something of that nature might be inherently different than classifying each separately and comparing the strength of the classifications.
