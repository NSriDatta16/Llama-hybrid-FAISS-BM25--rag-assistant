There is no problem in using both annotations on the same class. I even tend to encourage this, because thus you don't have to copy-paste when changes occur. In some cases, some properties differ in behaviour - for example an auto-generated ID might not be required to be marshalled. @XmlTransient and @Transient are then combined. It does become a bit hard to read, but not too hard, because it is obvious what all the annotations mean.
