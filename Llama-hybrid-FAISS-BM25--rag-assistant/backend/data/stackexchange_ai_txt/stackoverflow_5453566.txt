As an empirical test, I constructed binary and trinary Huffman trees for the distribution of Scrabble tiles. The entropy of the distribution shows you can't get better than 4.37 bits per letter. The binary Huffman tree uses on average 4.41 bits per letter. The trinary Huffman tree uses on average 2.81 trits per letter, which has the same information density as 4.45 bits per letter.
