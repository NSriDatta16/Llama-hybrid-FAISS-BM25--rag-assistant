I found this excellent article How to Train a Final Machine Learning Model very helpful in clearing up all the confusions I have regarding the use of CV in machine learning. Basically we use CV (e.g. 80/20 split, k-fold, etc) to estimate how well your whole procedure (including the data engineering, choice of model (i.e. algorithm) and hyper-parameters, etc.) will perform on future unseen data. And once you've chosen the winning "procedure", the fitted models from CV have served their purpose and can now be discarded. You then use the same winning "procedure" and train your final model using the whole data set.
