Cross Domain User Tracking

We have several websites on different domains and I'd like to be able to track users' movements on these sites. Obviously cookies are not feasable, because they don't cross domain borders. I could look at a combination of IP address and User Agent, but there are some cases where that does not work. I don't want to use flash or other plugins. Any ideas? Or am I doomed to rely on the IP/User_Agent combination?
