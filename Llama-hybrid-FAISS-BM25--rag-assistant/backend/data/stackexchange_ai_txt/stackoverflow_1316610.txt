How do I select from multiple mySQL tables and output to PHP?

I have at least 4 tables in MySQL for my PHP application (shortened it for this example) Agents - Agent_ID - Agent_Name Country - Country_ID - Country_Name Job - Job_ID - Job_Type Line_Items - Line_ID - Agent_ID - Country_ID - Job_ID Now, I need to select from Line_Items where Agent_ID = 1, and instead of echo-ing the Agent_ID, Country_ID and Job_ID in their integers, I would like to output their names instead (Agent_Name, Country_Name, Job_Type). How do I write the query? How do I output this in PHP, using the well-used $result = mysql_query("select ...."); while($row = mysql_fetch_query($result)){echo .....};
