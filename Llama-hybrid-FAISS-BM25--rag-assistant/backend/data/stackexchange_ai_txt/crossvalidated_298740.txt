The average "distance" is sqrt(n) in the topological sense, independent of direction. You drive a distance of 10 miles no matter what direction you drive (North, South, East or West). You correctly point out that given 100 steps the average distance from the origin will be 10 (above OR below the point of orgin) Rest assured that the average displacement (which may be either positive OR negative) is zero.
