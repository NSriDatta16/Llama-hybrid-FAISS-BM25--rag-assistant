The PHP Manual has a (sadly mostly empty) chapter on PHP internals . The main development mailing list is internals@lists.php.net. You can sign up via php.net and/or use Markmail to search the archives . The git repository for PHP is located on git.php.net , but there is also a mirror on GitHub . For browsing the source code you should use the lxr.php.net cross reference tool . The PHP wiki has a list of various resources on PHP development (blog posts, books, slides, etc). In particular there is an (older) book by Sara Golemon : Extending and Embedding PHP . A more current and ongoing effort is http://www.phpinternalsbook.com If you have questions, you should try the #php.pecl room on efnet. Also see this presentation by Sebastian Bergmann about Compiler Internals: http://www.scribd.com/doc/18171982/PHP-Compiler-Internals And make sure to check Nikic's blog. He's got a number of posts on how to read the source: http://nikic.github.com/ In addition to that, you can check the PHP Credits for individual contributers: http://www.php.net/credits.php A number of them run their own blogs which might contain more information.
