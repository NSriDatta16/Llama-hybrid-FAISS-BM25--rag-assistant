predicted value is more conentrated than actual with DNN

I have created an Deep Neural Network model with keras. def nopitid_model(optimizer,loss='mean_squared_error',epochs=50): model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=24, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(15, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1,)) # # Compile model model.compile(loss=loss, optimizer=optimizer) prediction = model.fit(x=X_norm,y=Y,batch_size=int(X_norm.shape[0]/5), verbose=0, epochs=epochs, validation_split=0.3) return model,prediction The MAE is about 5%, which is acceptable. However, after plot the predicted value vs actual value, I have noticed that the predicted value scattered between 1260 - 1290, whereas actual data range from 800-1600. More interesting, some predicted values also can be observed at 1230. I can't figure out what has caused this. Looking for all suggestions.
