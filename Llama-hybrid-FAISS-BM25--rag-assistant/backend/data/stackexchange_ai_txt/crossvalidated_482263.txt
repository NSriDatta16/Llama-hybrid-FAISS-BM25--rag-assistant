How do I account for extra information I have about the distribution of the response variable in a logistic regression analysis?

I've fitted a logistic regression, response is gender of teachers in a school leadership role (female=1), and the predictor is 'type' of school. School type is categorical with three values: co-educational (mixed gender); all girls; all boys. Here's the model output: Call: glm(formula = cbind(data $q8a, data$ q8b) ~ temp.coed, family = "binomial") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.55935 -0.60008 -0.08811 0.61469 1.75349 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.6150 0.1076 5.714 1.1e-08 *** temp.coedBoys -1.0745 0.3841 -2.797 0.00515 ** temp.coedGirls 0.8956 0.2888 3.101 0.00193 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 53.301 on 48 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 31.759 on 46 degrees of freedom (7 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 163.08 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 I can see that, at a girls school, a school leader is ( exp(0.8956) ) 2.4 times more likely to be a female at a girls school than at a co-ed school (the baseline), and about a third ( exp(-1.074) ) as likely to a female at a boys school than at a co-ed school. I have some additional information about teachers in these schools: I know the gender distribution of all teachers (so, not just teachers in leadership roles as in the regression). From summary statistics, I can see that the change in leadership gender distribution is similar to the change in teacher gender distribution, across school type. I think it could be that the results I'm seeing in this analysis are due to the overall change in teacher gender across school type, and are not because of some effect of school type on who is a school leader. How do I account for this extra information I have? I wondered if I should include the overall teacher gender proportions as a predictor in the model?
