The best I know of at the moment is by an article by Rufilanchas in 2017 [1]: in it, he says that Pearson, the first person to use the word (not the first who used such a diagram), used it in relation to how he believed that the vertical alignment of columns to represent frequency distributions is preferable to it aligned horizontally: "...Pearson, who seemed to be mostly interested in the psychological effect of the difference in orientation of the bars, found some “optical advantage of vertical over horizontal columns” (Pearson, 1938: 144), hence the choice for a word specifically meaning a vertical structure like a mast as the element for the root of the new word “histogram”..." We see how this preference for the vertical arrangement of the columns relates to the prefix 'histo' in a little more detail in the Oxford English Dictionary which states its etymology: "... Etymology: References and notes: [1] Rufilanchas, D.R. On the origin of Karl Pearson’s term 'histogram'. Revista Estadistica Española. 2017:192. pg 29-35 (you can get articles and issues at https://www.ine.es/ss/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1254735226759&pagename=ProductosYServicios%2FPYSLayout&L=0 ). [2] "histo-, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2021. Web. 1 October 2021. [3] Though not part of this question, here it leads to how the prefix 'histo' relates to the medical term histology: tissues appear like the woven cloth made using the vertical loom, both of which use the word 'histo'; see Mossakowska-Gaubert, M.
