error while truncating tables from oracle db

I am doing something like this in a procedure to clear all data from all tables in my database. LOOP dbms_utility.exec_ddl_statement('alter table ' || c.owner || '.' || c.table_name || ' disable constraint ' || c.constraint_name); END LOOP; . . . LOOP EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'TRUNCATE TABLE ' || t.table_name ; END LOOP; Now , this throws the following error : ORA-03291: Invalid truncate option - missing STORAGE keyword ORA-06512: at "MYSCHEMA.CLEAR_DATA", line 15 ORA-06512: at line 2 Process exited. Disconnecting from the database MYDB. Why is a storage keyword mandatory? I thought DROP STORAGE was the default. Even specifying storage close, as in, EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'TRUNCATE TABLE ' || t.table_name || 'DROP STORAGE'; doesn't help. The error is the same. I thought it might have something to do with foreign constraints on some tables. Hence, the 'disable constraint' earlier in the script
