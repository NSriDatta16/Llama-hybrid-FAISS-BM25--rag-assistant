Silverlight 4: why items are not moveable?

There is a "field" on which some items are draggable: Here is a XAML code: And code-behind: private bool bIsCaptured = false; double mouseVerticalPosition; double mouseHorizontalPosition; private void Item1_OnMouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { ((FrameworkElement)sender).CaptureMouse(); bIsCaptured = true; mouseVerticalPosition = e.GetPosition(null).Y; mouseHorizontalPosition = e.GetPosition(null).X; } private void Item1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (bIsCaptured) { UserControl item = sender as UserControl; if (item != null) { // Calculate the current position of the object. double deltaV = e.GetPosition(null).Y - mouseVerticalPosition; double deltaH = e.GetPosition(null).X - mouseHorizontalPosition; double newTop = deltaV + (double)item.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty); double newLeft = deltaH + (double)item.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty); // Set new position of object. item.SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty, newTop); item.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, newLeft); // Update position global variables. mouseVerticalPosition = e.GetPosition(null).Y; mouseHorizontalPosition = e.GetPosition(null).X; } } } private void Item1_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { UserControl item = sender as UserControl; bIsCaptured = false; if (item != null) { item.ReleaseMouseCapture(); } } My task is to display a collection of items that are bound to a list of object. How to do that is described in the topic: Silverlight 4: how to display list of custom controls (not in list order) . The only lack of the suggested approach is: items are not draggable anymore... Here if update XAML code of controls "holder" (provided for consistency purposes): All mouse-event handlers are called, but items are not really movable... why?
