I was able to get the proper alignment by specifying the problematic TextView with: android:id="@+id/must_be_bottom_left" android:layout_alignParentRight="true" android:layout_alignParentBottom="true" android:layout_below="@id/xxx" where xxx was the id of a TextView that has android:layout_below="@id/yyy" and yyy is a TextView that is always above both xxx and must_be_bottom_left . The contents of my list items can vary so that sometimes the "xxx" TextView is View.GONE , but even then the layout works as expected. I don't know how fragile or merely seredipidous this work-around is. I am using Android 1.6 and I haven't tested it for forward compatability.
