It's one of the great tragedies of Arabic notation that we put the most significant digit first. Almost all computations are easier when we start with the least significant digit: void fprint_binary(FILE *fp, unsigned long n) { char digits[8*sizeof(n)+1]; char *p = digits+sizeof(digits)-1; *p = '\0'; unsigned long mask; for (mask = 1; mask; mask The comments about representation go double if you ever write code for a Turing machine (exercise for students, not practical).
