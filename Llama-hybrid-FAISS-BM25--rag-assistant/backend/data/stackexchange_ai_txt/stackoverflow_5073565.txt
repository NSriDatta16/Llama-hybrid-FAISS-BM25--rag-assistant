If your text is a single block consisting of multiple paragraphs, you will have to enable an option to treat newlines as normal characters. This is dependent on your regex library and language of choice. If you want to extract multiple phrases from a single block like this, you will also have to enclose your basic pattern within a repeating group, with appropriate wildcards ("[^A-Z ]*") to ignore succeeding non-phrase text. Again, how to do this depends on your choice of library and language. If you are processing each line separately and collecting the phrases, this isn't necessary.
