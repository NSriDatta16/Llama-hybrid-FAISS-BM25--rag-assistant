Type of printfn in F#, static vs dynamic string

I just began toying around with F# in Mono and the following problem arose that I cannot quite understand. Looking up information on printfn and TextWriterFormat didn't bring enlightenment either, so I thought I'm going to ask here. In FSI I run the following: > "hello";; val it : string = "hello" > printfn "hello";; hello val it : unit = () Just a normal string and printing it. Fine. Now I wanted to declare a variable to contain that same string and print it as well: > let v = "hello" in printfn v ;; let v = "hello" in printfn v ;; ---------------------------^ \...\stdin(22,28): error FS0001: The type 'string' is not compatible with the type 'Printf.TextWriterFormat ' I understood from my reading that printfn requires a constant string. I also understand that I can get around this problem with something like printfn "%s" v . However, I'd like to understand what's going on with the typing here. Clearly, "hello" is of type string as well as v is. Why is there a type problem then? Is printfn something special? As I understand it the compiler already performs type-checking on the arguments of the first string, such that printfn "%s" 1 fails.. this could of course not work with dynamic strings, but I assumed that to be a mere convenience from the compiler-side for the static case.
