Good parser generator (think lex/yacc or antlr) for .NET? Build time only?

Is there a good parser generator (think lex/yacc or antlr) for .NET? Any that have a license that would not scare lawyers? Lotâ€™s of LGPL but I am working on embedded components and some organizations are not comfortable with me taking an LGPL dependency. I've heard that Oslo may provide this functionality but I'm not sure if it's a build time dependency or also a runtime dependency. Can anyone clarify what Oslo will provide? UPDATE What I would really like is a parser generator that is a build time only dependency. It looks like ANTLR has a runtime component.
