What kind of analysis would be appropriate for my data?

I'm working on a project looking at the geographic distribution of a type of physician in the United States. My data is as such: I would like to identify zip code level characteristics that predict the presence of a doctor in that zip code. I was planning on doing a binary logistic regression on SPSS. However, my data is interesting in that there are only 376 zip codes in the United States that have at least one of these kinds of doctors (and 40,0661 zip codes that do not). What kind of analysis would you recommend for this kind of data?
