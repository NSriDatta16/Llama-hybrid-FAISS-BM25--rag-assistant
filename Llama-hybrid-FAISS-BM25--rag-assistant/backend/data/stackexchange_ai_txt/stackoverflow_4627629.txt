You have installed a Infragistics product and it without a Developer Licence. Here a solution for a case liek your I looked for a solution to this all day yesterday, and finally figured out how to fix this for myself. Re-installed VS 2005 and Infragistics at least 3 times and that did nothing for me. My setup is Vista 64, VS 2005 and Infragistics 7.2. My fix was to download SubInACL from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E8BA3E56-D8FE-4A91- 93CF-ED6985E3927B&displaylang=en And create a .cmd file with the following contents (You may need to change the first line if you are not running a 64-bit OS): cd /d "%programfiles% (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools" subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Infragistics /grant=administrators=f /grant=users=f /grant= system=f subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Infragistics.License /grant=administrators=f /grant=users=f /grant=system=f Then double click the file to run it. For some reason permissions weren't correctly set for the Infragistics registry keys to access them during design time. Original Post
