HT index RSI value at end of each month in an xts time series object

First I read-in a csv and create an xts object. require(quantmod) sugar Then I create a new series of RSI values using TTR (loads with quantmod) sugarRSI Now I'd like to get a new series that only includes the value of the last day of each month. There is a last() function in xts, but not clear on how to deploy it efficiently.
