Boosting algorithms only built with decision trees? why?

My understanding of boosting is just training models sequentially and learning from its previous mistakes. Can boosting algorithms be built with bunch of logistic regression? or logistic regression + decision trees? If yes, I would like to know some papers or books that covers this topic in-depth.
