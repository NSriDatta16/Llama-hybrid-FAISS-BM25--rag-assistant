Interpreting the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)!

I read all about pros and cons of RMSE vs. other absolute errors namely mean absolute error (MAE). See the the following references: MAE and RMSE â€” Which Metric is Better? What's the bottom line? How to compare models Or this nice blogpost , or this question in stats.stackexchange containing interesting responses, and this one in datascience.stackexchange Still I can not get my head around something about RMSE: Scenario: Let's say we have a regressor for predicting house prices with a MAE of 20.5\$ and a RMSE of 24.5\$. Based on MAE, I can certainly interpret that the average difference between the predicted and the actual price is 20.5\$. How can I interpret RMSE? Can we still safely say the predicted and the actual price are off by 24.5\$ at the same time base on RMSE (upper-bound of prediction error)? In the first medium post, it says: RMSE does not describe average error alone and has other implications that are more difficult to tease out and understand. It confuses me a little. And I could not find any reliable reference to also clearly state that one can safely interpret RSME as one does MAE. Is RMSE is simply a only mathematically more convenient for optimization etc., and we are better off with MAE for the interpretation? Any detailed explanation is highly appreciated.
