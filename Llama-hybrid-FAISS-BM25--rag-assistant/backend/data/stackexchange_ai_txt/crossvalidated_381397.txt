Suppose I have for a first group of numbers $\{2,4\}$ and for a second group $\{-2,2\}$ then the mean of the first group is $\frac{2+4}{2}=3$ , and of the second group is $\frac{-2+2}{2}=0$ . Then the ratio of the mean values is $\frac{3}{0}=?$ . By convention some people call this $+\infty$ . Now there is another way to look at this. Suppose we wanted to see the mean of all possible fractions. Then we would construct the fractions that can be formed from the two groups: $\left\{\frac{2}{-2}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{4}{-2}, \frac{4}{2}\right\}=\left\{\ -1, 1, -2, 2\right\}$ , the mean of which is $\frac{-1+ 1 -2+ 2}{4}=\frac{0}{4}=0$ . Now am I pulling a fast one? OK, suppose I interchanged the groups then in the first case I would have gotten $\frac{0}{3}=0$ , which is now a number (at least) and in the second case I would have gotten $\left\{\frac{-2}{2}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{-2}{4}, \frac{2}{4}\right\}=\left\{\ -1, 1, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right\}$ , the mean of which is $0$ , and no different from the prior mean of all possible fractions. Now which of these answers is suspect $\{+\infty,0,0,0\}$ ? Well, obviously the first answer is suspect, but it may be correct, that depends. Making fractions and finding mean values are not commutative operations, that is, the fraction of two mean values is not the same as the mean value of many fractions, and it is generally, but not always, more consistent to do the latter. It is unclear what pairing of numbers to make fractions is implied by the question. For example, if I were handing out right shoes of different sizes to individuals regardless of their right foot lengths, then there would be one shoe size for each foot length, i.e., only $n$ fractions for $n$ shoes and $n$ people. In the numerical example I gave, I had two groups of sizes $n$ and $m$ , where in my case both $n$ and $m$ were equal to two, but in general that would make for $n\times m$ fractions. There are still other possibilities, but whatever the case is we cannot work backwards from the ratio of two mean values to even venture a guess. Taking an average erases any knowledge of what $n$ (or $m$ ) might have been, or whether $n$ or $m$ were taken with replacement or without replacement . For example, if I want to calculate my odds of winning by counting cards in a poker game with some cards showing on the table, I am doing so without replacement , that is, if a card is showing, it isn't available elsewhere. Nevertheless, after a night of poker, it is perfectly fair to say that if I am up by $\$2$ , that would have been the terminal running average of my winnings, and if Jack only had $\$1$ for his winnings then I can say without fear of contradiction that I won twice what Jack did. So taking a ratio of average values is not necessarily incorrect. It is the meaning that is different for different calculations having different answers.
