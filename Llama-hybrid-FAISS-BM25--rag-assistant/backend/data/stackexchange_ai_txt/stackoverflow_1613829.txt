As other posters have said, I am not seeing this problem on Eclipse 3.5.0 running on JDK 1.6.0.14 (when fixing the reduced visibility of the getData() method). I suggest doing a clean build (Project/Clean in Eclipse). Also, the Eclipse and Java version you are running might help. -- Flaviu Cipcigan
