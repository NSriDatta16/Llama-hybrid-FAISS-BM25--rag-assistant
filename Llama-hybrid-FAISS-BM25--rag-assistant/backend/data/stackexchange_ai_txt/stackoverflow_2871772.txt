How to replicate data with memcache

I am trying to find good resources on best practices to data replication across memcache servers. What I want to accomplish is that if one of my servers in my pool goes down, the next server in line already has the info set. I have found "repcached" but since I run a WIN32 test environment, I have been unable to install it. So what's our alternatives on how to replicate data between servers? Thanks,
