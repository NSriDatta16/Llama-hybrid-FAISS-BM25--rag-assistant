Trouble set location to recorded audio

I have to following code to launch and the audio recorder on Android: final Intent recordSoundIntent = new Intent ("android.provider.MediaStore.RECORD_SOUND"); String fileName = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + File.separator + UUID.randomUUID() + ".3gpp"; recordSoundIntent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(new File(fileName))); startActivityForResult(Intent.createChooser(recordSoundIntent, getString(R.string.record_sound_chooser)), INTENT_SOUND_RECORDING); My problem is the following: My filename (fileName) has no effect, the Uri returned from data.getData() returns in my last test run: content://media/external/audio/media/41. However, this file is created on my sdcard: recording34485.3gpp. If it is not possible to set custom location upon creating sound it is the location to this file I would like.
