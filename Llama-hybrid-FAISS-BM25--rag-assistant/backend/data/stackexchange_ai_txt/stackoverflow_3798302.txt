What do I do once I've got the normal map? Do I need to register it with OpenGL? Yes, you need to load it as a texture. Does it need to be associated with the texture, if yes, how is it done? If you mean associated with the color texture, then no. You need to create a texture that holds the normal map in order to use it later with OpenGl. How is it mapped to a 2D textured quad? Your normal map is just another texture, you bind it and map as any other texture. Normal map stores the normals in tangent space coordinates, so to calculate the lighting per pixel you need to know the relative position of the light source in tangent space coordinate system. This is done by setting additional parameters per vertex (normal, tangent, binormal), calculating the light-source position in tangent space coordinates and interpolating this position along the triangles. In the fragment shader you lookup the normal in the normal map and perform the desired lighting calculation based on the interpolated parameters. (Is this something that I can do without shaders / GLSL?) Yes, you can use some legacy extensions to program the multi-texture environment combination functions. Never done it myself but it looks like hell.
