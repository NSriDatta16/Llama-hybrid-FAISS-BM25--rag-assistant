likelihood vs confidence in layman terms

I already referred this post post and post . Don't mark it as duplicate. I am working on a binary classification problem using logistic regression. Loan default or not. I have a requirement where I am told to predict the outcome classes for our unseen records and also report the confidence of predictions generated. I am novice data scientist. So, am not really sure what is the difference between likelihood and confidence? If I run logistic regression, I get likelihood measure like 70% probability of belonging to class 1 and 30% of probability of belonging to class 0. My questions are as follows a) Does likelihood and confidence mean the same? Is there any simple explanation that ordinary layman like me can understand. b) Is there any tutorial that you can suggest which has on how to report confidence of predictions? When I use scikit-learn for logistic regression, I don't know how can I report confidence for the predictions? c) Any idea on how can we generate the interval? In scikit-learn logistic regression tutorials that I find online, I only see probability/likelihood of an instance becoming label 1 or label 0. Can you guide me on how can we generate interval?
