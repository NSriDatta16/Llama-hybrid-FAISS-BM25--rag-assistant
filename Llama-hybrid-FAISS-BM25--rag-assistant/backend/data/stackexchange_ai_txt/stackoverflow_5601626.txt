Asking for advice on playing movies on iPhone

Hia, I'm looking for a way to play a movie as background in portray mode in my app. The movie should not respond to any taps and my app would have its own buttons and labels over the movie that control the app. If you happens to know the Dragons Lair/Space Ace app from iTunes store, something this way. It seems there are several approaches for playing a m4v file. Any suggestion which would give me a video playback like described above? Thanks for reading!
