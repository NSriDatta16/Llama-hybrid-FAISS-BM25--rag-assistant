Conditional probability of two conditional independent events in Bayesian Networks

I have a common Bayesian Networks example I need to estimate probablity of JohnCalls given MaryCalls. Other words I need to find $P(JohnCalls = True|MaryCalls=True)$ From product rule, I know that $P(JohnCalls = True|MaryCalls=True) = \dfrac{P(JohnCalls, True|MaryCalls=True)}{P(MaryCalls=True)} $ But how can I calculate $P(JohnCalls, True|MaryCalls=True)$ I understand, that it should depend on $Alarm$ variable, but I don't know how.
