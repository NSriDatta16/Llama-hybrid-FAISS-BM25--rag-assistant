Fisher's test of periodicity

I have evenly sampled time series on which I applied Fourier transform. I am trying do determine if the signal contains statistically significant periodic components. I have succeeded with determining period. Now I am trying to calculate p-value for this component using these formulas derived by Fisher: \begin{align} I(\lambda) &= \frac{1}{2\pi n}\bigg|\sum_{t=1}^n X_te^{-it\lambda}\bigg|^2 \\[5pt] Y_r &= \frac{I(\lambda_r)}{\sum_{j=1}^mI(\lambda_j)}, \qquad r = 1, \ldots, m, \\[5pt] P(Y>y) &= 1- \sum_{j=0}^m (-1)^j{m\choose j}(1-jy)_+^{m-1} \end{align} The first formula is just squared discrete Fourier transfom. $n$ - length of time data series $m = (n - 1) / 2$ is number of AC harmonic components without Nyquist frequency The problem I am solving is that for some values of $g$-statistics (denoted as $Y_r$ in this example) the sum of series is diverging. Let's take an example: \begin{align} n &= 287 \\ m &= 143 \\ y &= 0.0044598585072423936 \end{align} Partial sum for $j = 1$ is: $$ (-1)^1 + 143C1 \times (1 - 0.0044598585072423936)^142 = -75.802 $$ The meaning of P value is probability which should be number between 0 (the event never occurs) and 1 (the event occurs always). Adding next terms to the sum just make the resulting value larger in absolute value. Is there something I am doing incorrectly?
