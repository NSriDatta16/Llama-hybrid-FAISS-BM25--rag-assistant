Whats wrong with this php code, keep getting Error no 2?

And I keep getting error no2 when I run: if(session_check()){ echo "something";} Is it because I am using dynamic IP? Is my code good enough to protect session hijacking? If I exclude the ($_SESSION['ip'] != $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) , it works perfectly. Important Question: What are your anti session hijacking methods? Can share with us? Using IP-checking, user-agent checking or probably other methods??
