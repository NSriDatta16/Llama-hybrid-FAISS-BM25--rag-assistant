I'm working on a product called "Transactor Code Agent", which is designed to do just what you are asking for. It provides local backup and version control for your source files. It lets you use your existing source control setup for what it was meant for (managing "mostly completed" work by multiple developers over multiple releases), while providing you with an automated backup and local file version control for your in-progress work. The beta should be coming out sometime in January. You can see our "website" (it's a little rough) at www.transactor.com There's a form there you can use to signup for the private beta. Update: Here's a little bit more information, based on some feedback I got in the comments: 1) Do I have a thing againt source control? No! I think source control is a wonderful thing. When used properly it provides a tremendous tool for managing the software life cycle. But, when it is used properly, source control leaves a big gap, in that it doesn't protect a developers work until it's finished. What's needed is something that focuses on the in-progress work of individual programmers. Code Agent does that. To put it differently, source control is a tool designed to make your boss's life easier (because it helps to manager features and changes and teams and versions over time) Code Agent is a tool designed to make your life easier (because it makes sure that your work is always saved).
