You really only have two options: Strip "log4net:" from the XML, as you suggested; Modify the XML to declare the namespace, probably most easily accomplished by wrapping the fragment (via StringBuilder) in a root element that has the declaration. Strictly speaking, your example is malformed XML -- it's no surprise XDocument / XElement won't parse it.
