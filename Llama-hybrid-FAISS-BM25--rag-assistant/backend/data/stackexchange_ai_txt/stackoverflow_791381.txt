ASP .net MVC will be closer to your rails experience. ASP .net Web Forms (what is usually called ASP.net) is clearly different, but if you are learning for the sake of finding jobs, it's what will pay for a long time(there are lots and lots of sites, both internal and public-facing) built on ASP .net web forms. There are some emerging sites using ASP.net MVC, but it's a long way. So, it depends on your goals. If you just need to know "a little .net", go with MVC because the concepts will be known to you. If you need to know "the .net web stack", then most people will thnik of web forms, not MVC... And yes, samples in the microsoft world tend to be on the "lighter side". It's near impossible to find demos that do not have the "draggy-droppy" feeling, and it is a REAL problem.
