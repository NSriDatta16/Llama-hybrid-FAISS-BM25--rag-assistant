Deploying to SQL Azure is no different than it would be when you are deploying to a separate SQL Server machine running SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition. This is different from deploying to a web server that is also running SQL Server Express, that allows you to package an MDF file as part of the ASP.NET app, but that is by design. There are tools available, but you could also script the changes to the database (either by hand or automatically). Another possible way of automating the deployment is by leveraging the SQL Azure migration wizard , but that will still require a bit of setting up (it is more geared towards 1-time-only migrations).
