What exactly is the difference between a parametric and non-parametric model?

I am confused with the definition of non-parametric model after reading this link Parametric vs Nonparametric Models and Answer comments of my another question . Originally I thought "parametric vs non-parametric" means if we have distribution assumptions on the model (similar to parametric or non-parametric hypothesis testing). But both of the resources claim "parametric vs non-parametric" can be determined by if number of parameters in the model is depending on number of rows in the data matrix. For kernel density estimation (non-parametric) such a definition can be applied. But under this definition how can a neural network be a non-parametric model, as the number of parameters in the model is depending on the neural network structure and not on the number of rows in the data matrix? What exactly is the difference between parametric and a non-parametric model?
