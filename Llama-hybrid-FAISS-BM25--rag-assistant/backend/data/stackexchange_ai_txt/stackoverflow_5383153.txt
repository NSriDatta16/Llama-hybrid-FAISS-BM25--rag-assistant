How to notify some users when an attribute change in Magento?

I need to notify on group of user when a product is edited and saved and one given attribute has been changed. Let's say I've an attribute is_new sets to false, if an admin update the product, I need to hook that this attribute has been changed and notify via emails the group "subscribers". Any ideas?
