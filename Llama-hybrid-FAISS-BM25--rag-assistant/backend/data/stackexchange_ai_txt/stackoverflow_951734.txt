You need to define the end-result requirements for the application. Part of the answer depends on what mobile hardware you will be running. And, whether or not you need to use unique abilities of your hardware (touch-screen, barcode scanner, gps, special buttons, VOIP, etc.) or if a simple input/output screen framework is sufficient. That might drive your decision towards a local application or something more remote like a web application or terminal services. (There are, of course, local applications that use remote services also. Do you need to consider multiple front-ends?) In addition, where are your development strengths? What are your language proficiencies? As you mentioned, mobile application development can have a steep startup curve for learning and for setting up your initial development/debugging/deployment environment. Is that worth it, or can you leverage desktop or web development experience and deploy remotely? Once you make these decisions and determine your development environment and target, then you can take the next step to look at frameworks and methodologies specific to your needs.
