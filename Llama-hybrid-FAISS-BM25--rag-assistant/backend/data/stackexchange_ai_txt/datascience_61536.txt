Deep reinforcement learning on changing data sizes

I have a game that I want to build a model that will learn to play the game. Yet, the environment output is two lists that represent the location and number of soldiers of the user and Opponent. The lists lengths are changing with each step, so to know the input size to the network is a problem. How can this be dealt with?
