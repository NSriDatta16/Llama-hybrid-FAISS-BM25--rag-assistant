Your interpretation of the spec is correct. Some kind of rationale is also given in the second paragraph of section 6.2 in the namespaces spec you referenced: the interpretation of unprefixed attributes is determined by the element on which they appear. But I would also be interested in some more details on why this specific behavior was chosen.
