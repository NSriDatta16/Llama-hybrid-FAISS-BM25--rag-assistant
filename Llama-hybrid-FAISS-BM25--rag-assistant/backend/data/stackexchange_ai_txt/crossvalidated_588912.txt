Anova with stratified Cox model

I'd like to use anova to investigate which variables are important to my Cox model outcome. I tried using anova from {stats} and car but it seems neither can handle strata() terms, which I have in my model. I can't use anova from rms because I have pspline() terms in my model. An ideal solution might be anova.coxph from survival if I can change from sequential testing to non-sequential (e.g., like a two-model ANOVA or something like drop1() ). However I don't know if this is possible. I thought about calculating the relevant statistics manually (something like [this] answer suggests 1 ). This is in theory fine but will take a little while to run through all my 50 variables and doesn't seem very elegant. Are there any better suggestions for how this can be done?
