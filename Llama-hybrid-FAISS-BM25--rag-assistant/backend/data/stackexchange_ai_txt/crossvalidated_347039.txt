Factor scores for binary data where "Yes"s are limited to <=3 of 18 items

I have survey (n=600) where individuals were asked binary yes (1) /no (0) questions regarding 18 specific service needs (e.g. transportation, groceries, peer counseling, etc.) Participants were limited to choosing yes to only 3 of the 18 services. Because of internal logistics - these 18 services can be factored into 3 groups. We want to know which of these 3 groups people said "yes" to. I wasn't going to run PCA since these 18 services are already factored, but I need factor (based) scores for each group. Is it statistically appropriate to just use sum factor-based scoring for each group? Do I need to take into consideration that individuals were only allotted 3 yes responses, thus the highest per-case value for any group would be 3. Thanks so much for you help!
