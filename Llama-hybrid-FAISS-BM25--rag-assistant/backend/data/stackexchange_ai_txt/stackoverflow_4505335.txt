Performing LINQ queries on a DataTable object

Say i have a DataTable object with data from the database, and I need to reorganize it. I think (according to my research) LINQ would be an elegant (but is it fast?) way to do so. The question is how. The data comes from the database in the following format ORDER SAMPLE METHOD 1234 1 ASH-10 1234 1 ASH-11 1234 1 ASH-12 1234 2 ASH-10 1234 2 ASh-12 1234 5 ASH-10 1235 1 BSH-10 1235 1 BSH-11 1235 1 BSH-12 I need it to be reshuffled as ORDER SAMPLE ASH-10 ASH-11 ASH-12 BSH-10 BSH-11 BSH-12 1234 1 Y Y Y N N N 1234 2 Y N Y N N N 1234 5 Y N N N N N 1235 1 N N N N Y Y As you can see the method columns will be dynamic. I could, of course, loop through the data using the old fashioned loop, but it seems like LINQ would be a better and faster way to go about it. Correct me if I am wrong.
