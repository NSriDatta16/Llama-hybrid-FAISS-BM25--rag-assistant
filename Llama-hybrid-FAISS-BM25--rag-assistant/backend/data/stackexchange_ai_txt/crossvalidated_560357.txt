You are correct that such an embedding of your data fails to be a vector space. But that's generally not a problem. For continuous variables, the sum doesn't necessarily make any sense either (the sum of two people's height may be way beyond any actually observed height, but so what?). The model probably doesn't know anything about the fact you've one-hot encoded, no. But again, that probably doesn't matter. For a linear model e.g., all that matters is that you can multiply the indicator by a coefficient and add that as a "contribution" of having that value. That the model never sees something between 0 and 1, or beyond those values, is useful to know about how the model will produce the coefficient. It also tells you how the model would deal with an errant input of 2, but in general practice that won't happen anyway. Absolutely! You can take the product of probability spaces without caring too much about what distribution each one takes.
