This tag is used for questions about the Lua programming language . From Lua's About page : What is Lua? Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. The official implementation of Lua is written in clean ANSI C , but a list of several other implementations can be found on the Lua Users Wiki page on Lua Implementations . The latest official version of Lua is 5.4.1 . The previous minor version (5.3.6) is available in the version history on the official site. Lua version numbers are defined as follows: major.minor.bugfix. Minor version increases will often no longer be backwards compatible with prior minor versions. Lua is certified Open Source software distributed under the terms of the MIT license . As such, Lua is free to use, even for commercial products. Please note that the official name of this programming language is Lua ( a Portuguese word for Earth's moon ). It is not an acronym -- it is not spelled LUA.
