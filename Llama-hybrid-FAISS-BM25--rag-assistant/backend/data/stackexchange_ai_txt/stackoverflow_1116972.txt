What you are proposing is a waterfall schedule. There's enough threads around that will teach you why most organizations have shifted away from it in the past few years. Here's another thought. Your attempts to implement a methodology in which you take on all the roles (PM, BA, Developer, QA, Support, Release) is bound for failure. You really can't do all of those jobs. There just isn't enough time in the day. Hey I know, as a team lead I get people pulling me in all those directions everyday :) Furthermore, even if you could do all of those, you won't be able to them all very well. They are separate roles for a reason and they each provide a check and balance on one another. For example, you'll end up taking shortcuts as a developer that you'll conveniently not verify as the analyst. As QA, you'll only check the path through the application that you developed. And frankly, if you are a developer, you are going to be rushing through everything but the development because it is BORING. I really would question the company's commitment if they are only hiring one person in Technology.
