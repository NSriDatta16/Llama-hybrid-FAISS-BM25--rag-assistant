You could try (I'm not completely confident in the syntax, but I think it's close): interface Transforming { Y transform(Transformer transformer); } interface Container extends Transforming > { } Then your Container will have the Transforming functionality. The type Y will be determined at the actual call to transform, based on what Y is for the Transformer object passes to transform. This will not guarentee the Y is necessarily a Container type, but maybe something in Transformer can give that restriction.
