I immediately fix the comments if I see a problem, and probably note down what it would take to improve the code. If I then get hit by a bus, the code is all the better for my quick, pointed attention. Then, if I have time, I'll sort the code itself out (fixing it usually requires time consuming regression testing). If not, I'll leave it for another day, but at least I'll know what the problem is right away when I do have time to come back to it.
