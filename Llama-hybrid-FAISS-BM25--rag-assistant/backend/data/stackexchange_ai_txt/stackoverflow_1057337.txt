Placing the right content into the right place

I'm in the proccess of creating my own web profilo and personal website. I have a layout and a design already done. Now I have no idea where to place my content and how. I have a layout like this: Menu Header Box 1 | Box 2 | Submenu In the header I currently have "about me" information but I'm not sure it's the right place. Shouldn't the "about me" content be placed in the about me page? Box 1 should be recent blog posts of that I am sure. Box 2 might be the next pharagrap of the about me or maybe site news. I am also not quite sure I need a sub menu in the index page but that section is empty if I don't have anything in it. I have found this webblog a bit useful but I still want some advice on where to proceed ahead.
