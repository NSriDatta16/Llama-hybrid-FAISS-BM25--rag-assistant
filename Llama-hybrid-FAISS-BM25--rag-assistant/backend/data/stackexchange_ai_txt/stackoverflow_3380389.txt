Divs with floating image not lining up corrently

I put together a simple system so that my dad can manage a website for his club volleyball team. He's not very familiar with html markups so I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible for him. Here is what I have him right now: section heading with the following css rules: .text_block { padding : 1em 0; min-height : 300px; } .text_block img { float : left; padding : 0 25px 15px 0; } .text_block p { text-align : justify; padding : 0 1.5em; } without the min-height declaration on the wrapper div I get messes like this: Messy paragraphs http://img.skitch.com/20100801-dcb4x7uw41gkn48x1fdahys994.jpg . since some of the images don't have much text in their div wrap. When I DO include the min-height element we get big gaps where there are small paragraphs and no images. Worst case scenario I could have him tag the "text_block" divs as "text_block has_image" for those with images, but I would like to keep this as simple as possible. Can anyone help me out with this? It would be greatly appreciated.
