Multiple UIScrollviews at different speeds

I have 4 UIScrollViews that overlay each other, and they all scroll when you drag a finger across. I however want to make one of them scroll at a different speed than the others. I have tried using - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating: (UIScrollView *)scrollView - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDecelerating: (UIScrollView *)scrollView - (void)scrollViewDidScroll: (UIScrollView *)scrollView - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging: (UIScrollView *)scrollView - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: (UIScrollView *)scrollView to capture when a scroll occurs but none of them are called during or after the scroll. I have also tried setting the decelerationRate to be different for one of the views but they still all scroll at the same time? Any ideas?
