What about skipping those tests that you know won't pass because the functionality is currently missing? Make it obvious that you are skipping the tests too! Really make it scream "like a stuck pig", as they say in Oz! (-: As you add functionality, enable the associated tests and keep "your bar green!" Here's another great article over at The Pragmatic Programmers that covers making broken windows obvious to others. HTH cheers, Rob
