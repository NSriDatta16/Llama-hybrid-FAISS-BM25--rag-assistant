How to store more than one option in a variable - Java

In Java, how would I create a property/field/variable that can at any one time store a couple of options/values, similar to lower level environments where you can set bits in variables, each meaning different things. I know that one can do this in Java by using static finals or something and then just ORing them all together, but isn't there a more elegant solution? E.g in C# where you can have the [Flags] attribute to an Enum and then OR the states/values together into an instance of that Enum. Any ideas? Renault
