Hyper parameters tuning: Random search vs Bayesian optimization

So, we know that random search works better than grid search, but a more recent approach is Bayesian optimization (using gaussian processes). I've looked up a comparison between the two, and found nothing. I know that at Stanford's cs231n they mention only random search, but it is possible that they wanted to keep things simple. My question is: which approach is generally better, and if the answer is "sometimes random search, sometimes Bayesian" when should I prefer one method over another?
