scaffold generation

Here's an excerpt from the Ruby On rails The pragmatic Programmers: The following command doesn't work on the new Rails, in the script folder I only have the file Rail. ruby script/generate scaffold Product Admin (Product: Model and Admin: Controller) The closest I can get to this instruction is using the following: rail generate scaffold Product Admin:controller but what I get is Product being the controller and Admin isn't anything. How can I generate scaffold Product Admin, Product being the model and Admin being the controller with the new Rails?
