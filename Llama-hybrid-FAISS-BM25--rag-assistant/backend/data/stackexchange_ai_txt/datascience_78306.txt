"Change the features of a CNN into a grid to fed into RNN Encoder?" What is meant by that?

So in the paper for OCR pr LaTex formula extraction from image What You Get Is What You See: A Visual Markup Decompiler , they pass the features of the CNN into RNN Encoder. But there is problem that rather than passing the features directly, they have proposed a solution to change it into the grid. Extract the features from the CNN and then arrange those extracted features in a grid to pass into an RNN encoder. This is the exact language they have used. What is meant by that? Theoratically speaking, if I have an CNN without any Dense/Fully Connected layer and produces an output of [batch,m*n*C] , then how can I change it in the form of a grid ?? Please see the picture below. So after getting the output from the CNN , they have chnged it somehow before passing it to RNN . What is the method that one can use to get this transformation? So if I have to pass something to keras.layers.RNN()(that_desired_grid_format) , what should be this grid format and how can I change it?
