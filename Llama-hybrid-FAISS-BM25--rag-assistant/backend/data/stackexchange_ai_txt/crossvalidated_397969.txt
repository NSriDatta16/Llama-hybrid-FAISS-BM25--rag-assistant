How can I make use of zip codes when I am building a model for fraud detection

I have gone through few articles but I am not convinced on what should I do with these. I know from business standpoint it might be good to consider fraudulent transactions happening from unknown locations. But I don't know how to use this in my data as dummy encoding might not be good solution. how to represent geography or zip code in machine learning model or recommender system?
