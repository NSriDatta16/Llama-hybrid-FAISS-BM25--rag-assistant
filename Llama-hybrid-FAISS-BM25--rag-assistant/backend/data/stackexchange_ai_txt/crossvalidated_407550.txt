yes, it's possible. as long as you have logits (the inputs to the final softmax layer), you can represent your stacked ensemble model with a much smaller model (which could be a neural net, svm, etc.) initially, the smaller model ("student") was designed to predict raw unnormalized logits. nowadays, it's more common to train the student to predict softmax outputs.
