It looks like you want the fitted values $\hat y_t$ which can be obtained using the function fitted from the forecast package as follows: fit fit is the fitted model object on which you applie the fitted function. (I chose a certain model applied on the AirPassengers time series as an example; you will have to insert your own fitted model object there.) A similar question with an answer can be found on Stack Overflow here .
