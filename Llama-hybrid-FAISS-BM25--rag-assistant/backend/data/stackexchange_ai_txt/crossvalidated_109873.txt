It looks like you have 3 pieces of information: Time: ss1 vs. ss2 Type of lesion: Mild vs. Severe Visibility of lesion: less visible to more visible. Which of the later 2 variables does your ordinal scale measure? and do you have a measure of the other? If the ordinal variable is measuring the visibility then you could use proportional odds logistic regression with visibility as the response variable and time and type of lesion, and their interaction as predictor variables. The interaction term is the main one of interest if you want to show that the visibility changes differently over time for mild vs. severe legions.
