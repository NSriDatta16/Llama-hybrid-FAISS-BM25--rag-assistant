How to play a sound clip in JNLP?

I have the following line to play a sound clip : Applet.newAudioClip(new URL("file:/C:/Dir_Sound/music.au")).play() it works in standalone app, but in jnlp I got an error message : java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission C:/Dir_Sound/music.au read) I'm not running it in "all-permissions mode", is there another way to play the sound file ? PS : The sound file is selected by the user on his computer when the program runs, I can't embed it in my jar.
