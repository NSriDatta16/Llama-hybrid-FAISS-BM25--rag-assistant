dropping into a draggable with jquery

Is it possible to drop a draggable div into an already draggable and droppable div with jquery? I just cannot achieve this. I would be grateful if somebody could give a working example. Thanks. EDIT What I cannot achieve is a div into which different divs can be dropped and they can be sorted. Furthermore, these dropped and sortable divs should also at the same time be able to accommodate again sortable and dropable divs. EDIT What I'm trying to make work is at : http://jsfiddle.net/QcbK8/
