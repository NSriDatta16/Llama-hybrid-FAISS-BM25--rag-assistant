if you really just need dictionary-like storage, some of the new key/value or column stores like Cassandra or MongoDB might provide a lot more speed than you'd get with a relational database. Of course if you decide to go with RDBMS, SQLAlchemy is the way to go (disclaimer: I am its creator), but your desired featurelist seems to lean in the direction of "I just want a dictionary that feels like Python" - if you aren't interested in relational queries or strong ACIDity, those facets of RDBMS will probably feel cumbersome.
