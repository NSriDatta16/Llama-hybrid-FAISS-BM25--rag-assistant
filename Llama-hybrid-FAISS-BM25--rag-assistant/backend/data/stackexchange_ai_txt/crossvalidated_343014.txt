Is there an extension of PCA for data embedded in hyperbolic spaces?

I'm working on a project where we are embedding data into an n-dimensional Poincare ball similar to this paper . However, we'd like to take the additional step of reducing this data to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic manifold. Is there a way analogous to PCA that preserves the topological properties of the transformation in a somewhat similar way?
