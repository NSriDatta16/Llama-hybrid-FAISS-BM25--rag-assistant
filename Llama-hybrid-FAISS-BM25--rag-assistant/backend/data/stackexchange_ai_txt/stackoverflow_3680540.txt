Dragging and resizing UIImages or UIButtons

How does one take a UIButton or UIImageView and make it editable at runtime? I would like the user to be able to move small UIImageViews or UIButtons around the screen, resizing them, dragging them etc. I would like to make the corners of the squares or rectangles able to handle user interaction so that they can resize using the corners. Any help appreciated. :)
