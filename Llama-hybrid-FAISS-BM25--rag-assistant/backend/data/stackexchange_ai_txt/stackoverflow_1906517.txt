For (1) I'd suggest a tree map with O(Log N) access to an Hashmap (O(1) access). The basic "O" seems to clearly favorite hashmap, but then: tree is bound by log N, whereas the worst case for Hashmap is O(N) - when everything lands in one bucket tree organically grows to fit any number of elements. Hashmap gets inefficient with a bad ratio of nItems / nBuckets, in which case you have to rehash There are a few other things xyou could figure out... :)
