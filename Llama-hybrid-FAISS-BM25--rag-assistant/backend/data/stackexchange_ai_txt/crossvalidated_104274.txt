factor analysis for given data with help of matlab

suppose that we have following data i have done covariance matrix and eigenvalue decomposition >> means=mean(X); >> centered=X-repmat(means,10,1); >> covariance=(centered'*centered)/(9); >> [V,D]=eig(covariance); >> [e,i]=sort(diag(D),'descend'); >> sorted=V(:,i); e e = 1.0e+03 * 3.8861 0.4605 0.1162 0.0465 >> sorted sorted = 0.5080 0.5042 0.3747 -0.5893 0.0090 -0.6091 0.7930 -0.0092 0.8560 -0.3490 -0.2747 0.2647 0.0955 0.5030 0.3941 0.7633 i have calculated also percentage distribution (e./sum(e))*100 ans = 86.1796 10.2125 2.5776 1.0303 for instance i want to choose first two,because in sum they have more then 96% of total variance,now please how can i continue for factor analysis?matlab commands also visual help will be very good,according to this answer Steps done in factor analysis compared to steps done in PCA i was confused,so please for given concrete numerical example,how can i continue,not just definitions,i need concrete numerical steps.thansk in advance EDITED : because i have choose first two eigenvector,i have done PCA also factors=sorted(:,1:2) factors = 0.5080 0.5042 0.0090 -0.6091 0.8560 -0.3490 0.0955 0.5030 >> PCA=X*factors PCA = 299.5739 24.8602 150.1380 65.5846 183.9319 36.7606 156.7749 11.6325 58.1864 17.0585 236.6723 35.3584 176.0291 68.7008 208.4237 45.3761 190.6039 33.7278 206.2131 3.4430 how can i calculate loadings?how can i do orthogonal rotations?
