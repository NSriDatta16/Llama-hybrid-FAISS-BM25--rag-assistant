Recoding your data with numerical values seems ok, provided the assumption of an ordinal scale holds. This is often the case for Likert-type item, but see these related questions: Is it appropriate to treat n-point Likert scale data as n trials from a binomial process? Under what conditions should Likert scales be used as ordinal or interval data? When validating a questionnaire, we often provide usual numerical summaries (mean $\pm$ sd, range, quartiles) to highlight ceiling/floor effect, that is higher response rate in the extreme range of the scale. Dotplots are also great tool to summarize such data. This is just for visualization/summary purpose. If you want to get into more statistical stuff, you can use proportional odds model or ordinal logistic regression, for ordinal items, and multinomial regression, for discrete ones.
