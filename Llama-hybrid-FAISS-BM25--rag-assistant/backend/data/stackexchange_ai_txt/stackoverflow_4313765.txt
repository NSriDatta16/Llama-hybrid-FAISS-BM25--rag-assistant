Is it possible read XML files that are linked to within another XML file "all in one go"?

I have an XML file stored on a server which contains elements, of which some are refererences to other xml files e.g. value http://www.example.org/item1.xml http://www.example.org/item2.xml Where item1 and item2 are like this for example: 1 Item One I want to be able to read the main XML file (which of course I can do) this is done with an Asyncronous web request to download the XML - would it be possible to read the XML files referenced within the XML file in the same "request" rather than spin up, in this case two more seperate webclient requests to download these, as because these would be asyncronous too and therefore this data would not be available until those requests have completed - for binding to a UI in XAML for instance. This would result in the main xml file being downloaded and completed and then the two xml files being seperately downloaded too. Is it possible to read the main xml and the "sub xml" files all in one go? I can only use Async webrequests as this is a platform limitation of Silverlight and I cannot change the data as it is distibuted between many XML files to save server storage and is in a provided format, can the main and sub XML files be downloaded and parsed in one request, using LINQ / XElement / Silverlight supported features - I cannot use XPath as this would not be supported.
