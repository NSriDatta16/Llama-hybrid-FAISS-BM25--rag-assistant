You are not predicting 24 binary outcomes from single timestamp, but you have hourly, binary time-series and want to make predictions in 24h time horizon. So the binary outcomes are not only the labels to be predicted, but they are also the data. Just use some time-series forecasting method for binary data. In your comments you gave us more details, that you have distant historical data, so you want to learn the time specific patterns and use them as predictions. The simplest solution would be just to take the conditional means of target variable aggregated by time, so basically something like AVG followed by GROUP BY in SQL. Since you may not have all the relevant data (all the combinations of days, hours, weeks etc.) and want to extrapolate, some machine learning approach may work better. I would start with simple models like logistic regressing or random forest with dummies for hour, weekday, month etc. as data.
