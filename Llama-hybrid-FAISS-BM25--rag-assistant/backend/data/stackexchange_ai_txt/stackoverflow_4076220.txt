C# Slow Paint Event: painting large number of objects

I have a PictureBox it serves as a canvas. A List the array size of aprox 8000. The "RectangleObj" is a simple rectangle class, once you invoke its Draw(Graphic g) method it will draw the border using g.DrawRectangle(...) and, fill the rectangle with an alpha transparency using g.FillRectangle(...) In the application Form.cs, i use the pictureBox1_Paint(...) to loop the array of RectangleObj and invoke the Draw method of that class. Like this. private void pictureBox1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { for (int i = 0; i count = 8000 RectList[i].Draw(e.Graphics); } Every time the mouse clicks upon a RectangleObj and drags changing its location (mouse move event) the paint event is called. since the array is large in number, the paint event does not have enough time to finish its loop and gets flooded with mouse movements. so, this makes the Paint event slow. Can somebody advice me how to optimize this procedure.
