Split plots are often used out of necessity, but there can be statistical advantages in term of precision of your contrasts (or also disadvantages). Here is my rudimentary understanding of intuition for using split plot: First, let me establish that two common terms in split plot design are "whole plot factor" and the "sub-plot factor." In an agricultural study the whole plot factor are at a larger spatial scale, say entire fields, which represent different levels of some treatment such as drainage efficiency. The sub-plot factors are spatially nested within the whole plot factor. Subplot factors are often something that can be applied at a smaller spatial scale, such as crop type. Aside from reasons of practicality (which may be the case in the example I wrote above), split power may be efficient (or inefficient!). Federer and King 2007 suggest that one reason to use Split plot is that in comparison to a 2-way ANOVA you generally have increased precision to detect contrasts between the sub-plot factors. Also, interaction effects may be easier to detect. In contrast, precision to detect contrasts between the whole plot factor generally decreases. These differences are explained by the fact that two separate residual error terms are used for hypothesis testing. The whole plot error term is calculated by first averaging the subplots within each whole plot. Spit plot is also sometimes used as a split plot in time, which as I understand is similar to a repeated measures, often used on subjects. I'm not sure what the advantage one way or another is on this. The terminology maps as follows: split-plot design = repeated-measures design whole plot = subject whole plot factor = between-subject factor split-plot factor = within-subject factor = repeated-measures factor A very comprehensive reference on split plot theory and implementation is: Federer WT & King F (2007) Variations on split plot and split block experiment designs (John Wiley & Sons).
