ASP.NET MVC - jQuery Sortable

I have a list of menu items which can be sorted. I have the sort working which is based on this link . However, I'm not sure how to save the order of the menu items to the database? I'm using nhibernate. View Code Sort Main Menus You can drag the items into a different order $(function() { $("#items").sortable({ axis: "y" }); }); MainMenuEditor Code " value=" " />
