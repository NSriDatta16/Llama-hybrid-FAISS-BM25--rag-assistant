It sounds contradictory that you want to start derby in network server mode and get the embedded driver. Even if this might be possible, it is definitely discouraged. You should decide on whether you want to use Apache Derby in the network mode using the DRDA or as an embedded driver and stick to that decision. Here you'll find a tutorial on how to use the network driver: http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/ns_intro.html
