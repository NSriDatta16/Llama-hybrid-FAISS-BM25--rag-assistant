Distributed hash maps have such a property. Well, actually, not quite, basically a hash function tells you what storage bucket to look in, in there you'll probably need to rely on traditional hash maps. It doesn't completely cover your requirements, as the list containing the storage areas / nodes (in a distributed scenario), again, is usually a hash map (essentially making it a hash table of hash tables), although you could use some other algorithm, e.g. if the number of storage areas is known. EDIT: Forgot a little tid-bit, you'd probably want to use different hash functions for the different levels, otherwise you'll end up with a lot of similar hash-values within each storage area.
