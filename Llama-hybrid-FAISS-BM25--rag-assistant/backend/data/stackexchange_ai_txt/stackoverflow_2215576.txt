Django: Problems embedding tinyMCE into my non-flatpage model

I got tinyMCE working for flat pages by copying the change_form.html file and embedding a script element. I followed the directions here but still have issues. I added this snippet to my Entry model: class Entry( models.Model ): class Admin: # various admin options are here js = ( '/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js', '/appmedia/admin/js/textareas.js', ) When I view source in my add entry admin page ( after restarting Apache2 ) I don't see the above referenced js files anywhere.
