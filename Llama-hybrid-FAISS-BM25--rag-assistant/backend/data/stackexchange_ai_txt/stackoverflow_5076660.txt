How to fill a ListBox with a background worker in .Net2.0?

In my application a ListBox is filled after a user puts more than two characters into a textBox. If there is a lot to fill into the ListBox, the user has to wait until the ListBox is completely filled before is able to continue his input. Now I need a solution to fill the ListBox without blocking the UI, so I would like to use a background worker to solve this. ---- Original Version ----- In my application I fill a ListBox when the user puts in more then two characters into a textBox. The ListBox fills with results and after this, the user is able to put in more characters. My problem is the following behaviour: The user is only able to put in the next char after the whole ListBox is filled with all entries. If there are a lot of results the user has to wait until he is able to continue. I would like to have the following behaviour: If the user puts in a char, the filling of the ListBox should stop and build the list for the new input. I thought about sth. like: [PSEUDO-CODE] loop over results { if (UserInput) { // I thought about sth. like GetKeyState() but I think there should be a more elegant way (perhaps a control or another technology I don't know about ATM). P.S.: Currently I'm looking for a solution with .Net2.0, but if there is a technology inside a later version of .Net I would also be glad for a short hint (just for my information).
