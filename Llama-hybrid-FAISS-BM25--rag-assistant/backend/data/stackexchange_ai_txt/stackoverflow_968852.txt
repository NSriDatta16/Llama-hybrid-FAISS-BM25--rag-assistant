Passing and Handling Large Objects in Workflows

I am having to pass a fairly large object/file to a workflow when it starts (in the order of hundreds of MBs). I am using secondary storage to dump the object and have as little of it as possible in the RAM at one time on Workflow side. Is there another way to pass and handle the object which is more efficient. Does WF provide any built in function to handle such situations?
