The average should be the number of players... using the max means if you have 3 player teams: [4 4 4] [7 4 1] The second one would be considered weaker. Is that what you want? I think you would rather do something like: (Total Scores / Total Players) + (Max Score / Total Players), so in the above example it would make the second team slightly better. I guess it depends on how you feel the teams should be balanced.
