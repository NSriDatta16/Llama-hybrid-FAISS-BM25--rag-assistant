You can't install the runtime on your computer if you already have that version of access installed (at least you can't with the supplied installer). It is important to realize that all of the SAME problems that exist when installing the full version of access on a target computer are the SAME issues when installing the runtime. So, just like multiple versions of access can be a problem on the same computer, the same applies to the runtime. I explain what the runtime is and answer a good number of your questions here: http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/RunTime/Index.html
