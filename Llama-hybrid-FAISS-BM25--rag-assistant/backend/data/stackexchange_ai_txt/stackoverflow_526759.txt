If you are going to be providing 'export to Excel and import (paste) from Excel ' then does that mean that you're delivering to an environment where your users have a guaranteed installation of Excel on their machines? If so, you could look at using Excel itself as the grid you want, either via a VSTO project or by perhaps embedding an Excel sheet as a control a WinForm? The latter might require jumping through a few interop hoops but I think it's still possible. Obviously, if it's not guaranteed that all your users will have Excel on their machines then you can disregard my answer ;-)
