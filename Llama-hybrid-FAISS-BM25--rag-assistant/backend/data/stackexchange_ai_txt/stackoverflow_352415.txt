C# single project organization

I am reorganizing my source files into a single solution with a single project, due to various reasons: a paranoic configured antivirus software; Advices on partitioning code through .NET assemblies Control component dependencies to gain clean architecture Benefit from the C# and VB.NET compilers perf This leaves me with many namespaces, which are splitted across multiple files. So far, I am using this convention: given the namespace Company.Project.A , the files are named A.f1.cs , A.f2.cs and so on, and the Company.Project.B namespace is splitted across B.f1.cs , B.f2.cs , etc. Given the single project restriction, are there any better ways to organize multiple files in multiple namespaces?
