My eMoose tool does something similar with specific tags that are embedded in the JavaDoc of a method or in comments of the method, as a way of drawing attention to these details. I was going to add similar support with annotations but was told that this feature was coming at some point in the next Eclipse. If you can't make the transition to the next Eclipse version milestones, I'd be happy to share my source code so you can easily build a plugin with that feature.
