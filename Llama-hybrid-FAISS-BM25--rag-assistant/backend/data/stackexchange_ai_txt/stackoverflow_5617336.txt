Is there a simple ORM for .Net like Vici CoolStorage?

I really like Vici CoolStorage because it is very simple to use and work with MySQL. I've tried NHibernate but I just don't get it. Does anyone know or can you suggest a .Net ORM that is simple and light because it look like Vici CoolStorage is dead.
