Unless you have a strong basis to remove the constant you should not generally do so (an example of a potentially reasonable reason to remove the constant is the prior consideration that at $x=0$ the response must be 0 - such as when modelling braking distance as a function of speed for cars under standardized conditions). But even then, there may be good reasons why - within the range of the data - a model with an intercept would still be a reasonable choice. Outside a physical model like that, it's very like removing the intercept for a linear fit and it's a somewhat similar consideration to removing a non-significant main effect when an interaction term is present. In both cases the usual advice is something like "don't do it without a really good reason. If you have a really good reason then think about it very carefully, and then you still probably don't do it" Some people advise never removing it, but I think that it's reasonable in some situations. (I wouldn't include mere non-significance among them.) [There are many threads on site relating to both the intercept in a straight line fit and leaving out main effects when there's an interaction; it may be worth exploring via search.] A non-significant intercept doesn't mean that the quadratic model is "not valid", it simply means that where the parabola crosses the $y$-axis (i.e. at $x=0$) the estimate of the average $y$-value is not distinguishable from 0. from comments: it's [...] a species diversity vs environmental parameter analysis I assume then that you don't have a theoretical basis for thinking that the relationship must be quadratic (even though it might be a good description); in that case I'd say that there's really no reason to consider doing anything with the intercept term. It's unlikely to be worth worrying about at all (that it's not significant, I mean). I'd advise you to keep it in the model; and of itself it presents no reason to doubt the model. Response to comment under answer: If you have a response that cannot go negative you should generally consider models that have the same property; in those situations you should typically expect to find some particular characteristics (smaller variance when the mean gets small, for example) that would make an ordinary linear model unsuitable, and good model choice can respect the constraint on the mean as well as match such characteristics
