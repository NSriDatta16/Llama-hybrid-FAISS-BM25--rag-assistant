The question mentions regression, which typically addresses conditional expectation: $$ E[y|x] = \int y\,p(y|x)\,dy, $$ where $y$ is the average donation and $x$ is the number of words. Linear regression may be too restrictive and so one could apply a local regression approach such as Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression. The results could be sensitive to the choice of bandwidth: A wide bandwidth could mask interesting local variation. More generally, the question of independence between $x$ and $y$ is interesting. If $x$ and $y$ are independent then $p(y|x) = p(y)$ and of course the conditional expectation is independent as well. But $y$ might depend on $x$ in intersting ways even if the conditional expectation is independent of $x$. With so much data I would look at histograms of $y$ that all have the nearly the same value of $x$ and see how the histogram changes as the chosen value of $x$ changes. Only after such an investigation would I think about how to proceed more formally.
