Deactivate agent app after launch in Cocoa

What method should be called to deactivate an app right after it's launch in applicationDidFinishLaunching: delegate method has been called? Or maybe there is a better place to do that? The documentation for deactivate method for NSApplication says that I shouldn't call this method directly since AppKit knows better how to deactivate stuff.
