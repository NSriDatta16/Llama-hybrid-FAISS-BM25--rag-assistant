operators as strings

I need to evaluate a mathmatical expression that is presented to me as a string in C#. Example noddy but gets the point across that the string as the expression. I need the evaluate to then populate an int. There is no Eval() in C# like in others langugaes... String myString = "3*4"; Edit: I am on VS2008 Tried the Microsoft.JScript. = Its deprecated method (but still complies - warning) However the Microsoft.JScript dll that I have doens work on public object InvokeMember(string name, BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, object target, object[] args); Complains that there is a missing ";" go figure... EDIT 2 Solution - was the codeDom one - it worked for as there are no security issue - only me ever going to be running the code. Many thanks for the replies ... And the link to the new Dragon Book awesome EDIT 3 Matt dataTable.Compute() also works - even better for the security conscious. (parameter checking noted)
