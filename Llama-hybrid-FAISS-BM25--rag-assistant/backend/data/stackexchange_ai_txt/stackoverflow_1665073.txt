Open Source Secure Sockets Framework

I am looking for an open source framework to build a proprietary protocol onto (Agent/Client talks to a Receiver/Server that stuffs things into a SQL database). I need session handling (ie login/logout) and some kind of encryption. I found the Spread Framework which looks great, but does not appear to support authentication or encryption of any kind out of the box. My preferred language is C, C++, Python, or Perl. Anyone know of anything off hand? Hoping for something to be out there to save me time rather than doing it the hard way all in *nix sockets ;) Thanks in advance!
