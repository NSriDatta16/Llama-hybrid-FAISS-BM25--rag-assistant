Two solutions: Remove the plugin through the list of installed plugins (the illustrations are from the blog post " Install Eclipse UI Form Editor " written by Albert ATTARD ): The "about eclipse" menu will give you access to the list of installed Software: You can click on the right application (m2eclipse for you, Jiglo in this example), and click uninstall, and restart eclipse. A safer solution would be first to install a new fresh copy of Eclipse, and add your existing plugins (except m2eclipse): if that fails, you still have your previous Eclipse installation untouched.
