Since you are asking about TFS: We are using a CommonAssemblyInfo to increment the version of the dlls. Nightly Builds are typically from a trunk. We have a Main-Folder from which a "Dev" Folder is branched for the current release. We make nightly builds from the current Dev-branch and manual, so called reference builds once we merge Dev-stuff back into Main. Builds are defined via the Build Agent stuff. Custom Tasks like incrementing version number enter the game via MSBuild.
