chrome browser showing this: Browser Incompatible Please Use Mozilla Firefox 3.2 above OR IE 8.0 above for website http://test.theartness.com/ ... I didn't understand what causing this error. i checked char encoding etc etc. everything.. I have seen in http://web-sniffer.net/ , it seems server sending that response for netscape/mozilla browsers. It is working for Internet explorer7 .. it seems server blocked it for those user agents? please help me to figure out what is wrong with it? Best Regards, Satish Kalepu.
