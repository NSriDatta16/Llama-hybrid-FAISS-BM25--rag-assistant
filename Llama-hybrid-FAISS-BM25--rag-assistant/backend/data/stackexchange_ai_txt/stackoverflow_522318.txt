If I read your question correctly, you're tracking both click and mousedrag events. Can you track the coordinates upon mousedown, followed by a short computation in mousedrag to see if the mouse has moved your desired minimum numbers of pixels? Of course, you then also want to cancel/reset on mouseup or when the mouse is dragged outside the bounds of your JComponent. Caveat: I haven't done this myself, but I think it's where I'd start if it were me.
