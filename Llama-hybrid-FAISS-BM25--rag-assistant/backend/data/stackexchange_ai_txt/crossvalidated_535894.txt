Why do Shapley values increase over time?

I calculated the Shapley values (using xgboot package, gbm regression model) of several big actors in the cocoa market and received results which I cannot explain: it seems that Shapley increases (the trend, in general) for all of them. The same thing happened when I calculate it for other sectors. Does it make sense? If it does, what stands behind these results? If not, what could be my mistake? Thanks a lot for any help! Here is the code, in general, although the question is more about the meaning of the results: library(SHAPforxgboost) library(tidyverse) library(xgboost) #shapley for boosting method X
