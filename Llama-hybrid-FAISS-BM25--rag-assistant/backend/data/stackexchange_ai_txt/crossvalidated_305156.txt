Generating Synthetic Food Orders

I have some transactional data for users who have ordered food. However, I am not allowed to share this data but am allowed to augment or generate a synthetic sample and share it. I was thinking about using generative adversarial networks for this purpose. Data might look like: t_0 = ['burger', 'fries', 'coke'] t_1 = ['chicken sandwich', 'sweet potato tots'] t_2 = ['buffalo chicken sandwich', 'caesar salad', 'iced tea', 'nachos', 'cheese burger', 'fries'] . . . These orders could all have different dimension as some transactions have ordered more food than others. I know that I can create k-hot vectors of these items and pad the vectors such that they all have the same dimension and feed this as the input into the GAN. There is potentially 1,000 distinct items, so I am wondering that this k-hot feature vector will be too large.I was wondering if there was a more sound way of either using GANs for this purpose or an alternate generative model with feature ideas which might accomplish the goal of generating these synthetic orders.
