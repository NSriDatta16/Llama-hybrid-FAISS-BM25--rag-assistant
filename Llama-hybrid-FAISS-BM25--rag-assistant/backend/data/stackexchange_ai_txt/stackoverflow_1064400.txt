Is it bad to "think" in LINQ when the skill isn't transferrable outside C#?

I use LINQ in my code all the time. I've gotten to the point where it just seems so natural to Group, Order, an organize a bunch of objects using the LINQ syntax that I struggle to think how I would do the same things without it. I had never delved into the SQL-esque world before this, but I imagine many people who learned even the normal SQL syntax suddenly felt constricted by most normal programming languages abilities to wrangle complex object hierarchies? Am I painting myself into a corner becoming reliant on LINQ to do my more complex tasks? It just feels so much more expressive than if I wrote plain C# code. Is becoming dependent on the LINQ syntax in my day-to-day programming going to hurt me in the long run if I end up switching languages or frameworks where something like it isn't available?
