tsne for prediction

I have a traditional prediction setting, with a training data set train and a test data set test . I do not know the outcome y of the test set. I found that tsne separates my binary classification setting quite well. However, tsne cannot really be used for prediction, as in predict(tsne, newdata=test) which can be done for PCA. What is the best approach here? Should I combine my train and test set (i.e., rbind ) and run tsne on the whole data set?
