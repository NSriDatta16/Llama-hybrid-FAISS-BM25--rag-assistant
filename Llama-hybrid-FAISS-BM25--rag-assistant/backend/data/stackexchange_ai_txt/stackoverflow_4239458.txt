jQuery UI Sliders - Select overlapping sliders based on dragging direction

I have this simple jQuery UI Slider setup with a range and a two default values that overlap. The entire thing (with a few bells and whistles) can be found in this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/yijiang/XeyGS/ $('#slider').slider({ min: 1, max: 11, range: true, values: [4, 4] }); The problem with this is that when you attempt the drag the single visible handle to the right, it fails, because jQuery UI always places the minimum handle on top. This is obviously bad, for a number of reasons. Is there a way to allow jQuery UI to choose which handle to drag depending on which direction the user starts dragging?
