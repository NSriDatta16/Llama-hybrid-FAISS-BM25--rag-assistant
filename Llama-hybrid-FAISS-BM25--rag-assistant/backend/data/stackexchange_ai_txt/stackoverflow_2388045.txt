Visual studio has gone crazy trying to create files

I downloaded Process Monitor and began monitoring my project directory that I am writing code in. I see endless entries every couple seconds of: Operation: Create File C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\csharp C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\code C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\web and so on for the rest of the templates Then it says the result is PATH NOT FOUND . What is happening? Has Visual Studio GONE CRAZY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
