As you remarked yourself and as explained by @ttnphns in the comments, computing covariance matrix implicitly performs centering: variance, by definition, is the average squared deviation from the mean . Centered and non-centered data will have identical covariance matrices. So if by PCA we understand the following procedure: $$\mathrm{Data}\to\text{Covariance matrix}\to\text{Eigen-decomposition},$$ then centering does not make any difference. [Wikipedia:] To find the axes of the ellipse, we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin. Then, we compute the covariance matrix of the data... And so you are right to observe that this is not a very accurate formulation. When people talk about "PCA on non-centered data", they mean that instead of covariance matrix the eigen-decomposition is performed on the $\mathbf X^\top \mathbf X/(n-1)$ matrix. If $\mathbf X$ is centered then this will be exactly the covariance matrix. If not then not. So if by PCA we understand the following procedure: $$\text{Data } \mathbf X\to\text{Matrix } \mathbf X^\top \mathbf X/(n-1)\to\text{Eigen-decomposition},$$ then centering matters a lot and has the effect described and illustrated by @ttnphns in How does centering the data get rid of the intercept in regression and PCA? It might seem weird to even mention this "strange" procedure, however consider that PCA can be very conveniently performed via singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix $\mathbf X$ itself. I describe this in detail here: Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA? In this case the procedure is as follows: $$\text{Data } \mathbf X \to \text{Singular value decomposition}.$$ If $\mathbf X$ is centered then this is equivalent to standard PCA done via covariance matrix. But if not, then it's equivalent to the "non-centered" PCA as described above. Since SVD is a very common and very convenient way to perform PCA, in practice it can be quite important to remember to center the data before calling svd function. I certainly had my share of bugs because of forgetting to do it.
