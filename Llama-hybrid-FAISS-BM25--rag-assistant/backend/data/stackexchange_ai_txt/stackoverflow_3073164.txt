The "less complex middle tier" is what worries me... the point of the ORM is to ensure that most of the complexity relates to your actual domain (whether that is order-processing, feed-reading, or whatever). That complexity has to go somewhere . And the last place you want that complexity is in the DB - your least scalable commodity (you generally scale the db server up (which is expensive), where-as you scale the app-servers out (much cheaper)). There may be a case for using document databases instead of relational databases, but RDBMS are not going anywhere. Generally I would suggest: limit your xml usage at the db to sensible amounts. It can be a very effective tool - but be careful you aren't creating an inner-platform. The relational database (by whichever vendor) is exceptional at its job, with sophisticated indexing, ACID, referential integrity etc... leverage that power.
