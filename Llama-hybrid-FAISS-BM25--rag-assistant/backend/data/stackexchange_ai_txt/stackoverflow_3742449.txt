How do I use linq to do a WHERE against a collection object (using Netflix data source)

I am using LinqPad to learn Linq by querying the NetFlix OData source. (BTW I know their is a similar question already on SO...didn't help me). Here is the query I got working which is awesome. from x in Titles //where x.Rating=="PG" where x.Instant.Available==true where x.AverageRating>=4.0 //where x.Rating.StartsWith("TV") //where x.Genres.First (g => g.Name.Contains("Family") ) //(from y in Genres where y.Name.Contains("Family") select y) //where x.Genres.First (g => g.Name=="") //orderby x.Name orderby x.AverageRating descending //select x //) select new {x.Name, x.Rating, x.AverageRating, x.ShortSynopsis} (Pardon all the comments...it is a testament to the fact I am experimenting and that I will change the query for various needs). There are two thing I cannot figure out. First. Let's say I only want to return the first 10 results. Second (and most importantly). I want to filter by a partial string of the genre. Each title contains a Genres collection. I want to show only Genres where the Name contains a certain string (like "Family"). Even better filter using Titles where genre.name.contains "firstFilter" AND "secondFilter". Basically, I want to filter by genre(s) and I cannot figure out how to do it since Title contains its own Genres collection and I cannot figure out how to return only title that are in one or more genres of the collection. Thanks for your help! ps...it seems that Netflix OData source does not support Any operator. Seth
