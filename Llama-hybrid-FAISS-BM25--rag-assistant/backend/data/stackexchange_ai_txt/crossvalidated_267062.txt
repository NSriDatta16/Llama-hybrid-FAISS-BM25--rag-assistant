In real analysis and probability theory there is an elegant result called Jensen's inequality . What this says is that for any random variable $X$ and a convex function $h$ we have $$h\left(\mathbb{E} [X]\right) \leq \mathbb{E} \left[ h(X) \right]$$ and the inequality is reversed if $h$ is concave, i.e. $$h\left(\mathbb{E} [X]\right) \geq \mathbb{E} \left[ h(X) \right]$$ Your question, when do we have $h\left(\mathbb{E} [X]\right) = \mathbb{E} \left[ h(X) \right]$, can then be answered by considering functions that are both concave and convex at the same time . As pointed out, affine functions clearly meet this requirement, since they are the only concave and convex functions everywhere at the same time.
