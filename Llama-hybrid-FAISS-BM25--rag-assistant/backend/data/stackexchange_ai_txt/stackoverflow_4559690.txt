I don't know jnlp-files, but in a html-file, you would write: with ./ only, if it is in the current directory. Else maybe an absolute path is preferable. If viewn in the browser or appletviewer, then ./ is ok, if the jar is at the same place, the html-file is. main-class looks wrong, since you don't want to use the main-class.
