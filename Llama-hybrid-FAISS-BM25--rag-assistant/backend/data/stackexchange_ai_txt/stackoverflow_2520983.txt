There is a system catalog table called sqlite_master that you can use to check index (or other) names: SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' ORDER BY name; You can use a pragma to get the indexed columns: PRAGMA index_info(index-name); And this one to get the column names for a table: PRAGMA table_info(table-name);
