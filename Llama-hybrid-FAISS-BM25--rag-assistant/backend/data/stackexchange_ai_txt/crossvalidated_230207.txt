Comparing PC and PLS regression performance on the test data depending on the number of components

I am performing PLS regression but have noticed that the R2 between predicted and measured values for the test set decreases with increasing the number of components. If I do principal components regression, as one would expect, R2 increases with increasing the number of components. Does this signal I'm doing something wrong somewhere? What are principal components in PLS at all? Could it be that the higher PCs in my PLS analysis introduce more noise than signal? Here is a snippet of R code to better illustrate what I'm doing (data file is too big to upload): PCA regression: library("pls") library("caret") for (x in 1:70) { y_test This behaves as one would expect - R2 increases with the number of components. If I do PLS by using the plsr function rather than pcr, however, R2 is highest with only a few components and progressively decreases from then on. How could that be? PLS regression: library("pls") library("caret") for (x in 1:70) { y_test
