As explained in the comments, the problem is ridge regression, where the squared error is minimized subject to a bound on the $\ell_2$ norm of $\beta$. As far as I can discern, constraining the $\ell_2$ norm of $\beta$ is not connected to linear model assumptions that the error is spherical. After all, using Bayesian language, the likelihood $\pi(y|\beta)$ being spherical does not suggest that the prior $\pi(\beta)$ should be too.
