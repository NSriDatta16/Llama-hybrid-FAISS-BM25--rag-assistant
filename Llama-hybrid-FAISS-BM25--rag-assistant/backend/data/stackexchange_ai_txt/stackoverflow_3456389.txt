Struts 1 was a framework that added additional structure above a JSP/servlet application. I would develop with Struts in preference to raw JSP, and in fact many developers using JSP before Struts emerged evolved their own equivalent frameworks. JSF is in effect a standardised equivalent of Struts 1, whose development was heavily influenced by the originators of Struts. So JSF is more or less a direct replacement of Struts, that in principle should be widely supported by Java EE App Server vendors. The adoption of JSF is not uniform, there are enthusiastic users, and otehr folks who stick with Struts 1. I have no statistics to tell you which technolgies are more widely used. Both Struts and JSF and Model/View/Controller frameworks, and neither address how to implement the Model - in particular they don't say much about persistence, hence you need something in addition to Struts/JSF which is where Hibernate and JPA come in. To my perception the emerging trend is to build UIs using Dojo or JQuery, with REST services, It appears that Struts 2 is attempting to address this problem domain, with rich widgets in the browser. This is interesting and worth study. Personally I've not used Struts 2, nor have I encountered it professionally, probably because I'm working with products that major on Dojo and iWidgets. I'm planning to give Struts 2 some attention.
