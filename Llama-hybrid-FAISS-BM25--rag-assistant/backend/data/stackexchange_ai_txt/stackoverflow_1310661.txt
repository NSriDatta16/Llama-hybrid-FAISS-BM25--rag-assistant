What are the typical use cases for vi?

I recently started picking up vi , going through some tutorials and trying to get used to it. But I still have some questions about it. It seems to be nice for small one file changes, but as soon as I start to try doing bigger things it seems to be lacking. For example, I'm used to have code formatting, import organizing, simple overview over all packages and other things that an IDE gives me. I saw some tutorials on how to use vi as an IDE, but it felt awkward at best. Now I'm just wondering, what are the typical use cases for vi? Is it typically used to edit small files, or can it be used for larger projects? And if you use it in larger projects, how do you make it work? Or would it be a lot easier to use an IDE with vi keybindings?
