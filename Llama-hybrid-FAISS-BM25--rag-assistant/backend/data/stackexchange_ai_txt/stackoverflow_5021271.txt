NSArray adds a pointer to the object . In order to track changes to variable, the array would have to add a pointer to the variable itself (remember, you're just setting the variable to nil, not the object). There can be many variables all pointing to the same object, and reassigning them won't change any others. Remember: Pointers aren't magic. They're just ordinary variables whose value is a memory address â€” in this case, the memory address of an object. Two pointers to the same object aren't "linked" any more than two int s with the value 5 . Changing the pointer doesn't affect the object; in order to affect the object, you have to either send it a message that causes it to change (e.g. [object setValue:6] ) or dereference the pointer to access the object's members directly (e.g. object->value = 6 ). PS: Don't access an object's members directly. It's bad and fragile and very prone to bugs. I just mentioned it here to explain how pointers work.
