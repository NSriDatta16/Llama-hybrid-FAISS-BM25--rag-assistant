I had the same problem, so I created a command in the preamble which defined a new style for my note page, and I also changed the template of the notes a bit. This is what I have (just before the \begin{document}: \usepackage{setspace} \usetemplatenote{\setlength{\leftmargin}{1cm} \beamertemplatefootempty \insertnote} \newcommand{\notepage}[1]{\note{\setlength{\parskip}{0.7em} \setlength{\parindent}{0.4em} \scriptsize #1 }} So instead of using \note in the document, I call \notepage, and the note will be formatted the way I defined before. Try this formatting and if you don't like you can change the values of the margins, indentation and skip between paragraphs to suit your needs. By the way, I don't understand why you are using \documentclass[beamer]{beamer} \setbeameroption{show notes} The way I do it is to have the three options and comment/uncomment according to what I need: %\documentclass[notes]{beamer} %\documentclass[notes=hide]{beamer} \documentclass[notes=only]{beamer}
