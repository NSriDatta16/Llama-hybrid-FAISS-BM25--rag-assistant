How to Drag item from C# form and drop on other application?

I want to know that how can we drag item from treeview in C# and drop in other(autocad) application. That item is basically the autocad file .dwg. I have written some code: private void treeView1_ItemDrag(object sender, ItemDragEventArgs e) { TreeNode n = (TreeNode)e.Item; this.treeView1.DoDragDrop(AcadObj, DragDropEffects.Copy); } AcadObj is an autocad object. This event is working fine but the event DragDrop is not firing, even when i drag on autocad the mouse pointer gives me plus sign (that the file is accepted here). My DragDrop event is : private void treeview1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e){ MessageBox.Show("It works"); } The above event is not working and not showing me MessageBox. I have implemented only these two events. Please helpe me and guide me how can i do this
