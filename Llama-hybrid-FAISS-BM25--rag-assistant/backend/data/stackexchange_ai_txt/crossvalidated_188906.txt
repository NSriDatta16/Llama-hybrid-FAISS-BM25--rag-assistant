Time Series analysis with multiple number of features

I'm taking my first steps in data mining while working on a student project. I'd appreciate any leads on the following: I have a data set with the following properties: a set of Features columns (let's say, 10); a set of Time Series columns (let's say, 7). Please note, that time representation is sequential (e.g. day 1, day 2, ..., day 7); a number of rows is high (let's say, 1k). some feature values, as well as some time series values may be missing (blanks and NaNs) the correlation between rows is very high (for example, row #16 and 17 have coef. of cor. ~1) the correlation between individual features and time series is very low (~0) My objective is to use both sets to predict time series column #8. The approach I have been thinking about goes something like this: Since the same features represent different values for the time series (in one row there are 10 values for features which are the same for the 7 values of time series data) i'm looking for a method to extract a matrix? of 7 values and 1k rows that will play a role of "unique identifier" for each value of time series in a row (So that we will be able to calculate the value, for instance, of the time series column 5 using features and that missing matrix). Later on, I plan to fill in the gaps of missing feature values and time series and later apply standard prediction analysis methods. Based on my experience I want to look into more details on Granger Causality analysis and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) which is a nonlinear autoregressive model. Any hints would be kindly appreciated, including if you are able to tell me what this sort of problem is called so that I can research further. Thanks!
