If you want a measure of linear association between the values in the vector-valued input and the scalar-valued output, then you are looking for linear regression. A single index for this association could be R-squared or the correlation between model predictions and true values. It also nicely fits the bivariate (scalar input, scalar output) scenario. In that case, the R-squared is simply the squared correlation between both variables. You lose the sense of directionality, however: you won't have a negative index, like you would with correlation. As mentioned in comments, a principled choice for an approach to the problem would be logistic regression, where the dependent variables are taken to be realizations of a Bernoulli trial. There, however, R-squared isn't a good metric. You can look into deviance, a statistic that generalizes the R-squared to distributions other than Gaussian.
