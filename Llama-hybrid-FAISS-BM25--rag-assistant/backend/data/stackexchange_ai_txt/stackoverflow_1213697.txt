How can I manage merging updates from several developers?

I work with a mid-sized team of developers all working on one product. Developers write the code to address a feature or bug fix ticket, then check it into our main development branch (in Subversion). Once the ticket has been tested and validated there by the QA folks, I merge it into the trunk. I normally do this manually, since a lot of the tickets span several revisions, which are not always sequential and may include fixes for several tickets at once. One thing that I'm sure would help is encouraging developers to only checkin one ticket per revision. We use Jira to track our tasks, so every Subversion revision should have a Jira issue ID in the log - when I'm merging code, I go looking for revisions that include the issue I'm merging in. Are there other ways I could manage this better? Do other teams branch off of the trunk for every ticket and issue? As I said, we have one main development branch, at least partly because we are building a lot of new functionality pretty quickly, and I imagine we would wind up with dozens of branches pretty quickly if we made one for each ticket.
