How to train neural network that has different kind of layers

If we have MLP then we can easily compute the gradient for each parameters, by computing the gradient recursively begin with the last layer of the network, but suppose I have neural network that consist of different type of layer for instance Input->convolution layer->ReLu->max pooling->fully connected layer->siftmax layer, how do I compute the gradient for each parameters ?
