Please see 3 recent pre-prints (6-8/2018) about transformation-identical CNN (TI-CNN) and geared rotation-identical CNN (GRI-CNN). They were expanded and derived from the circular path CNN (SPIE MI 1998 and IEEE TMI 2002) initiated by the same medical AI research team at Georgetown University medical center who also independently developed the CNN and the wavelet CNN in early 1990s for cancer research. “Transformationally Identical and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks through Symmetric Element Operators” https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03636 “Transformationally Identical and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks by Combining Symmetric Operations or Input Vectors” https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11156 "Geared Rotationally Identical and Invariant Convolutional Neural Network Systems" https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01280 also
