Whether or not truncated BPTT is appropriate depends on your application. For language modeling, you could back-propagate every eight words and probably not have to worry about the undesirable regularity that you mentioned. The truncated BPTT will save time during training from having to back-propagate all the way to the beginning of a really long sentence. Most of the useful information for language modeling occurs in the words that are in the recent history. If you're working with a different type of data you will have to make a judgment about if the truncation is appropriate or not. For applications that require memorizing information over a long time span then truncated BPTT is definitely not appropriate.
