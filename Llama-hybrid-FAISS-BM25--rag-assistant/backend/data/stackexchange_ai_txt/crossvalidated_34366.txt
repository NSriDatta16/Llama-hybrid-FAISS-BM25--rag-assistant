You could construct a time series of the line length over increments of time. Then there are many classes of time series models that one could try to fit to this data. In particular there may be a periodic pattern that could be detected. My thought is that specific times are allotted at workplaces for lunch or coffee break that would cause the lines to be longer at those times. If a constant model fits best to this data that would tend to confirm your randomness hypothesis and mean that the time of day could not be used to predict the line length. Otherwise you may be able to and you might want to visit Starbucks at times that have short line length predictions.
