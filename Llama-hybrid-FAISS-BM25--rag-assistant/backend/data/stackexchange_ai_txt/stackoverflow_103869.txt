Start with Subversion. The documentation is online , and the Pragmatic Programmers Svn book is great. If you're on Windows you can also get TortoiseSvn (free) for explorer integration or VisualSvn (commercial) for Visual Studio integration. For the Mac, Versions looks like a nice stand alone client, and XCode 3 has svn integration built in. Still I'd spend a bit of time in the command line using the svn client to really figure out what you're doing. After getting comfortable with the way svn works, then you can get into distributed version control systems like Git, Bazaar, or Mercurial, but I've seen enough professional developers have problems wrapping their heads around the basics of version control (branching merging etc) that I'd get comfortable with that first before moving to distributed systems. Stay the hell away from Visual SourceSafe (VSS). It is poop. Your code is not safe. See these many links as to why not to use VSS.
