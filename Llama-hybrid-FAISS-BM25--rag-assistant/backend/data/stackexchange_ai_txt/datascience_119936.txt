Build a dataframe with multiple CSV

I am collecting metrics on 6 REST services from a microservices architecture. For each instant collected, I extract two CSV from each service. One CSV contains three latency metrics (99th quantile, 50th quantile, average). And another CSV has the number of responses per second that the service returned with the HTTP codes 200 and 400. Examples of each of the CSVs: Latency: "Time", "99th quantile", "50th quantile", "Mean", "IsError" 2023-02-23 15:20:30,2.45,0.577,0.602,True 2023-02-23 15:21:00,0.939,0.424,0.457,True 2023-02-23 15:21:30,0.740,0.417,0.456,True 2023-02-23 15:22:00,0.965,0.396,0.443,True 2023-02-23 15:22:30,2.34,0.438,0.547,True QPS: "Time","2xx","4xx/5xx","IsError" 2023-02-22 21:18:30,216,0,False 2023-02-22 21:19:00,280,0,False 2023-02-22 21:19:30,242,0,False 2023-02-22 21:20:00,311,0,False In addition to the metrics, it has a column with the Time and a column with the label whether it is a boolean value. The CSV file names always start with the service name and have the word "latency" in the case of latency metrics and "QPS" in the case of wanted per second. Example: Cart latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_53_38.csv Cart QPS-data-2023-02-23 15_53_26.csv Catalogue latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_53_20.csv Catalogue QPS-data-2023-02-23 15_53_13.csv Frontend latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_54.csv Frontend QPS-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_48.csv Orders latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_53_54.csv Orders QPS-data-2023-02-23 15_53_47.csv Payment latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_10.csv Payment QPS-data-2023-02-23 15_54_00.csv Shipping latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_24.csv Shipping QPS-data-2023-02-23 15_54_17.csv User latency-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_40.csv User QPS-data-as-seriestocolumns-2023-02-23 15_54_32.csv I wanted to make a dataset where it reads all the CSV from a paste and creates the whole dataset for training and validation. In the end, I would have a dataset with the following format: "Time","99th quantile","50th quantile","Mean","2xx","4xx/5xx","IsError","Service" 2023-02-06 16:13:00,0.0970,0.00402,0.00771,254,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:13:30,0.0700,0.00377,0.00614,267,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:14:00,0.0208,0.00328,0.00388,251,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:14:30,0.0971,0.00349,0.00655,273,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:15:00,0.0232,0.00323,0.00443,276,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:15:30,0.00995,0.00309,0.00380,69,0,True,Orders 2023-02-06 16:16:00,0.00957,0.00283,0.00316,171,0,True,Orders Is it possible to put all this information together in a single DataFrame? Knowing that a collected moment is represented by two CSVs and that in the same folder, I will have several collection time periods.
