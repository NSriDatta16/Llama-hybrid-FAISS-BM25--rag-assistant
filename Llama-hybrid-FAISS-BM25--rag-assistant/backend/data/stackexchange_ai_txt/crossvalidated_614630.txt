Expected value of a function of two random variables

In Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine learning" in chapter 1.2.2, the author introduces the concept of expectations of functions of two random variables. In pg 20, introduces the following term, $$ E_x[f(x,y)] $$ And goes on to remark on it, saying that it- denotes the average of the function f(x, y) with respect to the distribution of x. Note that Ex[f(x, y)] will be a function of y. Why is the expectation a function of y?
