If the model fits well, nothing can be done?

I am playing a data without any background information. First, I try multiple linear regression. The model fits well, since the $r^2$ is larger than 90%. I deleted several variables by AIC. The fits improves a little bit. I am interesting what are possible directions that I should look into, if the model fits well at the very beginning. The target of the analysis is find the model that make the most accurate prediction. What I can come up with: Try other models like regression tree, random forest, SVM or whatever data mining models. The prediction may or may not become better. Perform cross validation. Check overfitting. Diagnostic residual.
