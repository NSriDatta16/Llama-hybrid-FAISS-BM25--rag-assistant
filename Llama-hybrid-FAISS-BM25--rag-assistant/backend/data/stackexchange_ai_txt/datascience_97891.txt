Is it reasonable to do train/test splitting based upon information/entropy?

I want to divide my time series dataset into training and test sets. The data is seasonal and very noisy. When I randomly split, the test and train samples do not resemble in their distributions . Sometimes, train data get most of the noisy/peak points and sometimes these points go to test data. Can I split the data into train/test by calculating how much information the two sets hold. The information can be quantified by e.g. Shannon entropy or standard deviation etc. When I tried to search literature around this, I could not find any reference?
