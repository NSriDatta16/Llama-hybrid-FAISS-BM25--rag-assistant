You are experiencing the classic XA 2-PC race condition. It does happen in production environments. There are 3 things coming to my mind. Last agent optimization where JDBC is the non-XA resource.(Lose recovery semantics) Have JMS Time-To-Deliver. (Deliberately Lose real time) Build retries into JDBC code. (Least effect on functionality) Weblogic has this LLR optimization avoids this problem and gives you all XA guarantees.
