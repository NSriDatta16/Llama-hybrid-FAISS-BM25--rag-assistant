I do agree Magento makes this kind of thing a bit too hard. I wanted to display the description of the coupon code next to the entered coupon code. I suspect my code will be able to help you on your way. I put this code at the top in the template checkout/cart/coupon.phtml: addBindParam('coupon_code', $this->getCouponCode()); $c->getSelect()->where("coupon_code is null or coupon_code='' or coupon_code=:coupon_code"); foreach ($c->getItems() as $item) { $coupon_description = $item->getDescription(); } ?> So you can see $coupon_description now holds the description of the Shopping Cart Price Rule as long as the user specified a coupon code. You can add more properties from the coupon this way.
