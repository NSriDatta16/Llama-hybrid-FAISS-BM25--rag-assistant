Predictive modelling and cost function

I have to help a company to detect customer in a list of prospects. The company has this benefit/cost function: Value of a new customer = $20 Acquisition cost = $5 So if the model: Miss to detect a customer: it costs $15 (loss of income) . Predict a non customer as a customer: it costs $5 (useless acquisition cost) . For now I: Use models like Decision tree, Random Forest & Boosted trees and recover the probability of the 2 classes. If: $\Pr(prospect=customer) * 20 -5 > 0$ , I recommend to contact the prospect. Question Is there a way to directly use the cost function in the model building instead of using simple split criteria like Information Gain, Gini Index, etc.?
