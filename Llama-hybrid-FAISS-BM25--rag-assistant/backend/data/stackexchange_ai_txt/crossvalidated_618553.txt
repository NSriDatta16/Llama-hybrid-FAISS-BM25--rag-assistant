Another option here is to define a distance on the vectors. If they are ordinal categories this would be: $$\sqrt{\sum{(x^i_d - x^j_d)^2}}$$ and if they are not it would be $$\sqrt{\sum{I_{x^i_d = x^j_d}}}$$ Given this metric, you can use a clustering algorithm, make a nearest neighbour model, and visualize with e.g. t-SNE. If you convert the metric to a kernel you can also build SVMs.
