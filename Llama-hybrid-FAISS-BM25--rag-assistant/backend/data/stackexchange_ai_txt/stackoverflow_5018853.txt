How to put email to my own mailbox with Java mail API

I am trying to send simple text mail to myself from a servlet using Java Mail API. I wonder how to best approach this in order to avoid daily sent limits meant to restrict sending mail to other people. How does a mail server receive email? From what information I could find, it is through the SMTP protocol? When the receiver happens to be local, instead of a relay the SMTP server assumes the role of local mail delivery agent. Is that correct? Any problems I could bump into when I connect directly to my SMTP server? To avoid any confusion , I want my servlet to act as an SMTP server, NOT a mail client that connects to one. I want to make a mail server to RECEIVE a message going to my mail box, not relay one to other people.
