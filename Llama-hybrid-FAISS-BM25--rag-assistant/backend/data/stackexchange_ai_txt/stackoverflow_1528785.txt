Unless the other people are iphone developers with their own development profile, you will need to make an ad-hoc profile and build. It is pretty easy... just follow the instructions in the developer portal. All you have to do is clone your release configuration, change a few lines and add a plist entitlements file (all provided in the instructions). Then just send the tester the build and the provisioning profile you create with their device-id included and they should be able to drag it into itunes to install. If they are developers and people you trust, just give them the code and have them change the Bundle Identifier to whatever is in their development domain.
