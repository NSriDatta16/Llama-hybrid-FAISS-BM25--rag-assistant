Pipeline objects have a step field which contains operators applied in each step. You can have a look at that object to understand the meanings of the resulted features. That said, if you are doing feature engineering manually by looking at the data, then you will have to do it in mostly the same way as before: Do it step by step, look at the intermediate results and think about good ways to convert the data. Pipeline would help you to compile the entire process into a single, compact object after the engineering process is done. Alternatively, you may want to find helpful features in more automatic ways, such as grid search over hyperparameter spaces. For that purpose, the pipeline will be a great help because you can optimize the entire pipeline as a whole, as opposed to optimizing each single step in the pipeline separately.
