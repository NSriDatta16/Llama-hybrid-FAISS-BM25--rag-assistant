By differentiating one error against the other, the author want to exhibit how a change in ϑ_u(t) affects ϑ(t-q). This notion comes from the basic derivative intuition: how does x varies based on y changing values. He is basically trying to show why the weights tend to vanish(sic.) if you apply BPTT over a RNN.
