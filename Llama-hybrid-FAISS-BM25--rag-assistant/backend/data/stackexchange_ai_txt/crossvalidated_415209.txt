Low sample size analysis with all effects in same direction

I have multiple tests done on a similar subject (brain activity in different regions of the brain) I have a treatment group and control group. When comparing the two groups, on the 12 different brain regions, the treatment group had less brain activity in every region. However, because my sample size was 8 for treatment and 14 for control only two of them was significant. Is there something I can do to say that overall although 10 of the 12 regions didnt have significant it was likely because of low sample size for those and that there is a difference between the treatment and control overall? I know I could average all of the brain regions for each participant and do a t test on that but the sample size would still be low and this wouldnt be significant.
