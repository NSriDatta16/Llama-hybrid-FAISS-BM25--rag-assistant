Batch Update in NHibernate

Does batch update command exist in NHibernate? As far as I am aware it doesn't. So what's the best way to handle this situation? I would like to do the following: Fetch a list of objects ( let's call them a list of users, List ) from the database Change the properties of those objects, ( Users.Foreach(User=>User.Country="Antartica" ) Update each item back individually ( Users.Foreach(User=>NHibernate.Session.Update(User) ). Call Session.Flush to update the database. Is this a good approach? Will this resulted in a lot of round trip between my code and the database? What do you think? Or is there a more elegant solution?
