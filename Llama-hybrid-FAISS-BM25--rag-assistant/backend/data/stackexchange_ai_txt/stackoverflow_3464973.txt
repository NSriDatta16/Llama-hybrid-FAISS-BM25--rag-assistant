some more details would be needed for more in-depth analysis. In most cases a difference in compilation errors between cmdline and netbeans editor can be caused by missing source roots (read generated source roots - see the project properties Sources panel on how to setup source roots). netbeans is embedding an old svn HEAD snapshot maven binaries so in some very rare cases there could be differences in resolving the dependency tree, but I have yet to see such case. also the netbeans compiler doesn't pick up most of the switches defined on the compiler plugin apart from target/source, encoding. The netbeans editor compiler is not 100% compatible with jdk compiler and there have been cases of incompatibilities so we are back to the need to see the actual errors first..
