SVM formula variations

I was reading about SVM in Wikipedia and saw that the formula was written like this (with minus): $$ \vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} - b = 0 $$ While other sources have it like this (with plus): $$ \boldsymbol {w}^\text{T} \boldsymbol x + b = 0 $$ What are the differences in their meaning and which one should be used? In essence I want to refer to the SVM formula and I don't know which one is the correct one.
