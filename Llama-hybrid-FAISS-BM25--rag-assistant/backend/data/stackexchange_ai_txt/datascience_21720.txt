python print values seasonal_decomposition

I am totally beginner in Python and after using seasonal_decompose for time series decomposition result=seasonal_decompose(series, model='additive', freq=365) I got plotted results with commands result.plot() and pyplot.show() , but I cannot understand how to print this results values on screen or how to see decomposed time series values? I have plot, but I need to have values in console or some data file. Complete code: from pandas import read_csv series=read_csv('B.csv', header=0, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0, squeeze=True) from random import randrange from matplotlib import pyplot from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose result=seasonal_decompose(series, model='additive', freq=365) result.plot() pyplot.show()
