I don't know the specific answer but... As JVMTI agents are "usually" headless are you using qmake because your project has a head that you are developing in kdevelop/qtcreator? Is the head using the attach API? If not and it is purely headless then would not a different editor/cmake be better? qmake is now a preproc for cmake, for the MOC stuff, no? I must admit I'm a bit fuzzy on q/cmake although I'm hoping to move to cmake for my work.
