I'm not sure if a "normal" classification model can help you with this problem. You aren't really trying to predict a label. I suppose you could try to build a classifier than predicts similar or not-similar . But you only have labelled data for the positive class, so you're stuck with one-class classifiers. caveats of using a standard classifier like Xgboost to train over this dataset by using a random set from the pool as 'non-customers' So you would take a sample from the non-customer pool and label these people as not-similar ? You could try it, but the labels are going to be noisy. Some of the people in the non-customer pool may, in fact, be similar to your seed customers. An alternative approach is to treat this more like a clustering problem. You have a "seed" cluster with a number of profiles. What you need is a similarity measure between the "seed" customers and the larger pool of people (customers and non-customers). You could threshold the similarity metric to find similar people.
