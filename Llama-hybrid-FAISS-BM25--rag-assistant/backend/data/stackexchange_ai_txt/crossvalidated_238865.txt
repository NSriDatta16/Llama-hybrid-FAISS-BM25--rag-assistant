Most tests return a continuous measure of the strength of the relationship, and so it's easier to characterize how closely linked the variables are then it is to give a yes/no answer. (This is generally more useful, though; knowing that location is 80% predictive of score vs. 20% predictive of score is better than just knowing that it's predictive.) Testing for correlation is easy--you can just run a multiple correlation test. It's easy because correlation is specifically a linear relationship. You might be looking at the height of a symmetric smooth volcano, for example, where there is not a correlation between lat or lon and the height but the height could be predicted exactly given the lat and lon. More helpful are measures of dependence, like mutual information , or nonlinear fitting methodologies, which often get called 'machine learning.'
