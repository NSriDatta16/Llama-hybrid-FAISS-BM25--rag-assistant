Comparing two groups: a risk of pseudoreplication

I am growing coral on two different structures. I want to compare whether one structure (a table) grows coral more quickly than the other one (a tree). Both structures hold 60 pieces of coral, so a total of 120 pieces have been measured for their growth rate. Now I am wondering what to compare: all 120 pieces and see if there is a significant difference between the two structures (without risking serious pseudo-replication?), or just the average of the table and tree (no statistics, because in fact n = 1?). I hope for (1), but I am scared that it is not scientifically valid.
