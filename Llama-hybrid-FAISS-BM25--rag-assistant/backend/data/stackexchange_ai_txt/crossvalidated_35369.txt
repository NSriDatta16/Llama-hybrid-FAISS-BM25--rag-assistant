My first thought would be that you can't average out your frequency like that. I think it will introduce frequencies that aren't really there. Could you aggregate things to create a monthly (average) reading and do something on a monthly basis? Or is that not good enough? EDIT: Now that I've thought about it, I'd basically create a time series with a frequency of 24, aggregating (averaging bins) data into half-months: Jan1, Jan2, Feb1, Feb2, ..., Dec1, Dec2. If there are no readings in a bin, enter NA. If you end up with NA's, use StructTS , which allows NA's. Otherwise, I'd try stl in preference to decompose . I'm also wondering if you could use loess or approx or package akima 's interp to interpolate your data to a regular (half-months) series and go with that. But I suspect it would introduce artifacts.
