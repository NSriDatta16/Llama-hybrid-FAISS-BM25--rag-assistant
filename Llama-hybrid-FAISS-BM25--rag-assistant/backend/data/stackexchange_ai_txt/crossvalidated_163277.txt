These models are not common in general. Still much work is done on ordinary functional regression; let alone logistic functional regression. Having said that, you will be able to find better references if you look for " functional generalized linear model ". A seminal paper on the matter is the Annnals of Statistics paper of Mueller & Stadtmueller's 2005 paper on " Generalized functional linear regression model ". There they lay the foundations for Poisson and binomial functional regression models. The earliest (2002) applied paper I have come across is Ratcliffe et al.'s Functional data analysis with application to periodically stimulated foetal heart rate data. II: Functional logistic regression . Applications papers of similar nature has appeared more recently too (eg. Zhu & Cox (2009) , Reiss & Ogden (2010) , etc.) General word of caution : Notice that you are in completely different ball game if you deal with sparse instead of dense functional data.
