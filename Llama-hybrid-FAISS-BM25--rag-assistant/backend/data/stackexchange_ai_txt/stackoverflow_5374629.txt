NicEdit Error in Chrome

I'm using the NicEdit WYSIWYG plugin on my site. It's come to my attention that when NicEdit is instantiated in Chrome, the following Javascript error is generated: Uncaught TypeError: Object has no method 'createRange' This doesn't stop the plugin from working, but I would like to prevent this if possible. Here is the offending method: getRng : function() { var s = this.getSel(); if(!s) { return null; } return (s.rangeCount > 0) ? s.getRangeAt(0) : s.createRange(); } NicEdit seems to be pretty much dead as a project, which is why I am asking this question here instead of over at the NicEdit forums. I am hoping that someone knows of a 'quickfix' to this problem. In all other respects NicEdit works well for me, so I am reluctant to change over to a different WYISWYG plugin just yet... Thanks (in advance) for your help.
