How can I get past "http://gems.rubyforge.org/ does not appear to be a repository" error message

Question 828421 asked similar question, but received only one real answer (update rubygems) and that attempt results in the same error. Ruby version 1.9.1.p243 on Windows. Included Gem, version 1.3.5. Never installed any gems before; never did any special config for this Ruby. Ruby itself works, as does irb, and "gem" operates but can't do install (and maybe other ops). Tried this (from a book): gem install rspec Got this: ERROR: http://gems.rubyforge.org/ does not appear to be a repository ERROR: While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError) SocketError: getaddrinfo: The storage control blocks were destroyed. ( http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml ) When I go to that URL (without "yaml") using MSIE7, I get a page titled "Gemcutter | awesome gem hosting" and have no problem wandering around that site. So I don't -think- it's a proxy problem (though this is all from inside corporate firewall/proxies/etc). When I go to that URL -with- "yaml", it goes to " http://production.s3.rubygems.org/yaml " and shows what I assume is an update specification page, starting with this: --- !ruby/object:Gem::SourceIndex I didn't destroy any "storage control blocks". So what is preventing gem from installing a gem? Web search shows MANY people having this same problem over a long span of time, but I have yet to see anyone say "It's because of THIS, so do THIS to fix it." Well, someone suggested updating "gem", but trying that gets same error. Help please?
