CFHTTP Encoding Problem

I am trying to pull a page for parsing information out of it using cfhttp. The page headers that I am calling are: Content-Encoding: gzip Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 19066 Server: IBM_HTTP_Server Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent Content-Language: en-US Cache-Control: no-cache="set-cookie, set-cookie2" Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1 I set the charset to ISO-8859-1 however I am getting the following in the FileContent (only a small sample is shown below but I think it gets to point across). EðÑq·Oã?·Ì\ZóL¯þ´Vú5ðbä£ÿæ¾_HÉÒñQãO\Çþãë85ÁÜ à±°ùÖ}&bßý?,u?2SùQyk5g?UÛ3Ñ¸fã×ARÃi_iûRã _ òCA¿-ß.

Any suggestions or help would be greatly valued. Below is my Code #listings# I have also tried the headers: And tried removing the 'Accept-Encoding' header and just leaving the TE. UPDATE: I still havn't figured it out, but I found something that might help someone help me out. When I used a test php server of mine to run file_get_contents on the same page and it worked fine, then if I ran the same cfhttp code to call the php page that was calling the page I need it worked just fine. Thanks for the suggestions so far.
