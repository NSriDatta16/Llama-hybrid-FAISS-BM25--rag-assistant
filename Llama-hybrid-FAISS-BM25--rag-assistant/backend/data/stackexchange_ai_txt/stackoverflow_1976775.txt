If your database (or in mysql, the underlying storage engine of all tables used in your select statement) is transactional, then there simply no way to execute it "outside of a transaction". Perhaps you meant "run it in autocommit mode", but that is not the same as "not transactional". In the latter case, it still runs in a transaction, it's just that the transaction ends immediately after your statement is finshed. So, in both cases, during the run, a single select statement will be isolated at the READ COMMITTED level from the other transactions. Now what this means for your READ COMMITTED transaction isolation level: perhaps surprisingly, not that much. READ COMMITTED means that you may encounter non-repeatable reads: when running multiple select statements in the same transaction, it is possible that rows that you selected at a certain point in time are modified and comitted by another transaction. You will be able to see those changes when you re-execute the select statement later on in the same pending transaction. In autocommit mode, those 2 select statements would be executed in their own transaction. If another transaction would have modified and committed the rows you selected the first time, you would be able to see those changes just as well when you executed the statement the second time.
