Well what you should be doing is applying the PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern. After logging out, redirect to another page (like the homepage). So if the user presses the back button, they will be taken back to the Logout page (and redirected again). That's my opinion. But if you want to try and display the Expired Page, you could try adding this to the code on your Logout.aspx page (prior to Redirect). // Warning: Untested Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1)) Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache) Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false)
