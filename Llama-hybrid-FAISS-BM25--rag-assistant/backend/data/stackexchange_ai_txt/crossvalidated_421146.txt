Why is a frequentist confidence interval equivalent to a credible interval with flat priors?

It's a commonly quoted result that frequentist confidence intervals are equivalent to a bayesian credible interval assuming a flat prior. Ignoring for now questions about invariance under reparameterization or reasonability of a flat prior over the real line in practice, why is this true mathematically? Let $X$ be random vector representing our data. $f_\theta$ the distribution of $X$ conditional on some value of $\theta$ . Suppose $a(X), b(X)$ are functions such that $$ \int_{X \mid a(X) Then, for some realization of the data $X = x$ , the interval $[a(x), b(x)]$ is a confidence interval of level $\alpha$ . I need to go from that to $$\Pr(a(x) and have no idea how. Bayes theorem gives proportionality, but seemingly no more. I suspect Iâ€™m not understanding something about the rigorous treatment of flat priors.
