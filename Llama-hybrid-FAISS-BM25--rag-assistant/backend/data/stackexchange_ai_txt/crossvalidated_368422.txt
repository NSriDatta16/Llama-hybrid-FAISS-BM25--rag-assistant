I see this problem in following way with following solutions: If attributes are the same, but classes are different, then probably you are missing some attributes that actually tell the difference between classes. So you might need more domain expertise , feature engineering and/or data collection . Model will assign the most probable class to such instance in test dataset. If this instance indeed appears more frequently as one of classes, then it is more probable to be this class. If you leave it as it is , it might work well, but you need to experiment with it. Or, sure, one of solutions is just removing those cases from dataset. Also remember that there could be a human error because of accident or lack on knowledge while creating dataset. So, again, more domain expertise might help. Note: try different solutions separately or together. If it works, it works. Even if it is weird.
