You could intercept the SMS in a BroadcastReceiver , abort the broadcast to prevent any SMS apps from seeing it, then manually insert the SMS into the SMS ContentProvider . But then that's terrible, fragile, uses non-public APIs and will possibly break third-party SMS applications. So basically, no you can't do this properly.
