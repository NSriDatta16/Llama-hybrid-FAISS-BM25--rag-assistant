Have you seen this page: UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Page ? There you can find both: the datasets to practice on and published results - to compare performance of your own implementation (there is a link on known performance of well known machine learning techniques too). In addition, this page is citing a critical mass of papers from which you could go further on with research for the best approach which suits your problem, data, or needs. Also, there is another way to do that (potentially) by application of sequitur http:// sequitur.info. If you will be able to normalize/approximate your data well, it will give your grammar of those "distinct periods of time with similar activity levels" see this paper and search for another one, cause I am unable to add more links...
