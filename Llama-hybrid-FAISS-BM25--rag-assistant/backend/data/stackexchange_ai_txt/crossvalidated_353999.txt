Time series model estimation - Unsignificant coefficients

Im trying to estimate the best model for my dataset using R. I tried both auto.arima function as well as AIC to identify the best model (I created several models and picked the best one according to Akaike). Both "best" models were, of course, the same, which happened to be an ARIMA(1,1,1). The issue is that one of the coefficients (the MA) is not significant (absolute value of the estimated value divided by its sd is less than 2.093). What should I do in this case? Thanks in advance EDIT: If I use BIC instead of AIC, the 'best' model is an ARIMA (1,1,0), which is consistent with the fact that the MA term in the 1,1,1, is insignificant.
