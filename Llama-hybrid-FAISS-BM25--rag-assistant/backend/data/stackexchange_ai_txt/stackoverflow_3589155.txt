@bobince: The issue I believe is around reflow. The logic in my JavaScript tries to figure out if children are overlapping each other (since they get dynamic content that I can't predict) in an absolute layout container and then adjusts the parent's css dimensions and sibbling's css that need to shift down. Changing the css dimensions trigger reflow and this happens in the middle of my iteration, this scenario seems to be much slower in IE8 standards than in IE8 Quirks for very large tables. I know that I should hide or use documentFragment when doing this type of operations, however because I need things to move and then look at the new offset dimensions I was getting inaccurate values.
