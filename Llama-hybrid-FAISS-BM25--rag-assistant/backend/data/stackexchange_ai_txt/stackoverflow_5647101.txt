What is the best way to remove double quotes from strings set using MySQL _FETCH?

I have a php script to retrieve data from a MysQL databse following an ajax call. The data needs to be returned to the calling web page as a string representing a series of x,y values to be displayed on a scatter graph. The required format which the php script needs to output to the calling page (which will pick it up from xmlhttp.responseText) is as follows: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5],[6,6],[7,7]] What I am getting is: [[0,"69.08"],[1,"53.53"],[2,"61.61"],[3,"72.04"],[4,"82.72"],[5,"103.76"]] The PHP code I am using to build the return string is: while ($row=mysql_fetch_array($res_Data,MYSQL_NUM)) { $index[$i] = $i; $PointArray[0] = $i; $PointArray[1] = $row[1]; $ReturnData[$i] = $PointArray; $i = $i + 1; } echo json_encode($ReturnData); Interestingly, when I echo the data to a html table displayed on the calling page rather than setting it as a php array, no double quotes appear. My questions is twofold: (1) Is there a more elegant way of building the data string than what I have come up with which appears a bit clumsy? (2) What's the best way to remove the double quotes - should this be done server side or in the javascript function on the web page initiating the call? Many thanks
