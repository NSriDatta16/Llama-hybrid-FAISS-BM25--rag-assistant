I don't think of breakpoints as being a natural way to analyze this, but rather would fit a flexible nonlinear function and get Bayesian credible interval bands to represent uncertainty in the function estimate. For example, you could use a regression spline with lots of knots. If you think of a structural change as a change in the first derivative of this function, you could easily differentiate the fit and show a credible interval for the first derivative. Likewise for the second derivative (acceleration) and third derivative (jolt).
