Average Coverage Error (ACE)

This paper mentions ACE. It is defined as following ACE = PICP - PINC where PICP and PINC stand for Prediction Interval Coverage Probability and Prediction Interval Nominal Confidence, respectively. The paper states that ACE should be as close to zero as possible. Let's assume PICP has a coverage probability close to one for a confidence interval 0.95. PINC would equal to .05. So, I don't see, or rather agree, why ACE should be close to zero. Could someone explain why?
