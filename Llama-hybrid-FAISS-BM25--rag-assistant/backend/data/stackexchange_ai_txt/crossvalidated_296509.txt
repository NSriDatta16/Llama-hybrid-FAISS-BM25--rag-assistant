Although there is nesting and relations here, they are time-dependent . The best model is one that processes sequences . Each user is a sequence of jobs. Each job is a vector. Role name and employment type could just be one-hot encoded. The dates could be treated the same, or even better incorporated somehow into the structure of the sequences. You could get arbitrarily creative with how you would like to represent these raw data, but if done right you will lose almost no information. Especially, as a sequence, you retain information on order, which was not present before. Otherwise, you treat an "engineer turned manager" the same as a "manager turned engineer", which is not the case. Now, you can take advantage of all of the work done in this area (e.g., RNN , LSTM , GRU , RA ) as well as many powerful libraries in tow ( Keras , TF , Theano ).
