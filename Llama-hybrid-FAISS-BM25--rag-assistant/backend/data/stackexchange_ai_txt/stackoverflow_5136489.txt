Sounds like it is quite a heavy site (2500+ lines of js!). It is strange that you only experience it on Chrome but this may just be down to the way it handles requests. As your static content is so heavy, I would recommend using a content delivery network (CDN). Spreading your content across a CDN (and geographical locations) allows a user to be served by the closest,and therefore fastest, server. There are many CDN providers who will charge to host your content. I use Amazon S3 storage facility, and while not a true CDN, helps me spread my static content which does speed up my sites. Also with Amazon S3, you can specify your geographical location of your storage area, whether it be US or Europe etc. This geographical location may be closer than your existing web server which is a bonus. S3 gives you free membership as well to test it out. Hope this helps. Chris.
