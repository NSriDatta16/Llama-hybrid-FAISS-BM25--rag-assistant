Fluent Nhibernate external configuration

All examples of fluent nhibernate make such(or similar) call: c.AddMappingsFromAssembly(typeof(Product).Assembly); I don't want tu use "typeof(Product).Assembly" as i don't want to have reference to my domain project here ("Procuct" class). In ordinary NHibernate I would just create hbm.xml files and make following entry in web.config: but this entry does not work with FluentNHibernate. Is there an elegant way of providing assemblies in my session-building method? Preferably from configuration file. Resources : Context of unwanted code/dependency: static NHSessionManager() { Configuration c = new Configuration(); //change following to sth that does not need refernce to domain c.AddMappingsFromAssembly(typeof(Product).Assembly); c.Configure(); sessionFactory = c.BuildSessionFactory(); } My first idea was to read assemblies names from appSettings and load them: var assembliesToMap = new List (); foreach (var assemblyName in assembliesToMap) { var assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(assemblyName); c.AddMappingsFromAssembly(assembly); } but that is my last option. I'm looking for sth build in fluent nhibernate.
