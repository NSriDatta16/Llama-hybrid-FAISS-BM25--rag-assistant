Software for ML/NLP/DM laboratory

suppose you might buy some software to be used in a ML/NLP/DM laboratory. What software package would you ask for? Let's say: MATLAB (with some toolboxes), SPSS, and what else? I know that there is a lot of free software one can use like R, Weka, Rapidminer, python packages, and so on. However, the above question targets commercial software. Thanks.
