Speed of prediction: neural network vs. random forest?

I'm currently trying to improve on a classifier. The current method used is a neural network, and the method I've found to be better is a random forest (or even just a single tree). With 40 trees, the classification is much better than the neural network. However, it takes 40 minutes(using 4 parallel workers due to running out of memory) to classify a large block of data; whereas, the neural network takes ~5 minutes(using 8 parallel workers). Is there a way to improve the speed of prediction? And does anyone know the reason for this huge slow down? I'm guessing it is due to the number of trees, and also the number of workers I can use. MATLAB was used to create and run both the network and the forest. 40 features, 13 outputs, training set size: ~800,000, individual block size: ~500x500, whole file to be classfied: 1+GB along with other files containing more information The data is not sparse.
