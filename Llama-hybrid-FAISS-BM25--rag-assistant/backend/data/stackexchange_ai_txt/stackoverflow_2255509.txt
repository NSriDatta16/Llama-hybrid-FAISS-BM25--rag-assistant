Different results from converting a file from iso-8859-1 to utf-8 iconv in shell vs calling it from python with subprocess

Well, this could be a simple question, to be frank I'm a little confused with encodings an all those things. Let's suppose I have the file 01234.txt which is iso-8859-1. When I do: iconv --from-code=iso-8859-1 --to-code=utf-8 01234.txt > 01234_utf8.txt It gives me the desired result, but when I do the same thing with python and using subprocess: import subprocess p0 = subprocess.Popen([ ], shell=True) p0.wait() I get almost the same result, but the new file is missing e.g. part of the line before the last one and the last one. Here the last three lines of both files: iconv result: 795719000|MARIA TERESA MARROU VILLALOBOS|107 259871385|CHRISTIAM ALBERTO SUAREZ VILLALOBOS|107 311015100|JORGE MEZA CERVANTES|09499386 python result: 795719000|MARIA TERESA MARROU VILLALOBOS|107 259871385|CHRISTIAM EDIT: In the python file I've tried using coding: utf-8 and coding: iso-8859-1 ( not both at the same time ). EDIT: I've used codecs in bpython it works great. When using it from a file I get the not desired result. EDIT: I'm using linux (Ubuntu 9.10) and python 2.6.2. Any suggestions?
