Random forest that aggregates by taking the maximum over the trees instead of taking the average

I want to make a Random forest that aggregates by taking the maximum over the decision trees instead of taking the average. By default Sklearn is taking the average, and I couldn't find how to change this to taking the maximum. Does anyone know how to do this?
