GitHub vs Google Code for a hobby project

Note: I have seen this and tried to take as much from it as possible; but I believe my context is different. I am working on a small-ish project. Call it Foobar. I'm wanting to get this done more organised..I've tried a few projects, mostly as an unorganised programming-as-a-light-hobby student. I'm trying to get more organised; 90% of those projects went after I either failed to document at all, or because I lost them. As such, I've been thinking about getting version control/hosting going. Not only will it organise me more, but (a big if here) if it gets anywhere into a usable state, it will be easier for people to get. The two places I'm considering are Google Code and GitHub. From the question I linked: Google Code: As with any Google page, the complexity is almost non-existent Everyone (or almost everyone) has a Google account, which is nice if people want to report problems using the issues system GitHub: May (or may not) be a little more complex (not a problem for me though) than Google's pages but... ...has a much prettier interface than Google's service It needs people to be registered on GitHub to post about issues I like the fact that with Git, you have your own revisions locally From this I'm leaning towards GitHub, as Google Code doesn't look appealing to me. For a small hobby project - basically making community features irrelevant - are there features that should take me over to one side or the other?
