Estimating population average models in lmer or geepack

I would like to know how to estimate a population average model of a hierarchical logistic regression using R package geepack . The Stata code is: xtlogit dep ind1 ind2 ind3, i(ind4) pa I would like to reproduce this in R using geepack or any other method.
