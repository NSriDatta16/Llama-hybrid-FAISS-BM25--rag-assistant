JExcel Warning: Could not add cell at A257 because it exceeds the maximum column limit'

I was asked to add an average amount of data from my web-app (basically a List from a SQL) into a downloadable Excel file, so I did a servlet to generate the Excel. Problem is that jxl API doesn’t seem to like more than 256 rows, and my data is more than a thousand. Is there any way to go around this limitation? I would like to keep using this API if I could (no need to install different APIs in the server and it’s easy to use). But I will change if I must. Thanks for all! PS: here is the main code of the servlet: List sql = (List )session.getAttribute("sql"); response.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-excel"); response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=Export.xls"); w = Workbook.createWorkbook(response.getOutputStream()); s = w.createSheet("Consult Project", 0); for(int i=0;i
