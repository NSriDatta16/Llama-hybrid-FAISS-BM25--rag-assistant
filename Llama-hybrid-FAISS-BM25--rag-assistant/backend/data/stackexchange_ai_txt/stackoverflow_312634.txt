You need three components. A scheduler should launch backup , compression and perhaps other steps like copying the end result to a file server. You can choose your tool for each task but I can recommend our Cobian Backup based setup that has served well for a couple of years. Scheduler: Cobian Backup Backup: ExpressMaint (for MSSQL Express) Compression: Cobian Backup Basically, you set up backup scheduling with Cobian, run ExpressMaint or other MSSQL backup tool as a Cobian "before event". Cobian then zips the result and saves it to a destination. Compressing SQL Server backup files is necessary if you intend to move them in a network and/or centralize their storage.
