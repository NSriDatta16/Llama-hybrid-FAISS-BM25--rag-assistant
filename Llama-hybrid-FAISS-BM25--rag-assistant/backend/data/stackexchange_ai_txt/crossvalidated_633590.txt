Yes, you can use random assignment as an instrument to estimate the average treatment effect on the compliers. In fact, when there are only compliers and never takers, this is the same as the average treatment effect on the treated. You get your point estimate by dividing the ITT by the first stage (=the effect of random assignment on the probability of watching the video) and 2SLS would be the most straightforward approach to hypothesis testing. The original references would be: Imbens , G. W. and Angrist , J. 1994 . “Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects,” . Econometrica , 62 : 467 – 476. https://doi.org/10.2307/2951620 Angrist, J. D., Imbens, G. W., & Rubin, D. B. (1996). Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables. Journal of the American statistical Association, 91(434), 444-455. https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902 But I think this might be more suitable, since it is practical application that deals specifically with one-sided non-compliance and it includes multiple treatment groups, which is also similar to your case: Angrist, J.D. Instrumental variables methods in experimental criminological research: what, why and how. J Exp Criminol 2, 23–44 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-005-5126-x However, consider whether the ITT might not be what is actually intersting? Is it the effect of an employer watching a video or the effect of making an applicant provide a video that is relevant for policy?
