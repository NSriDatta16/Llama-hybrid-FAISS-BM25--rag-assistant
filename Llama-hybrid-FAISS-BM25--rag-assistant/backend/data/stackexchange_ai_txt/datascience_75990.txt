There are different ways to measure the similarity between two functions. One option is to define the overlap between both functions as their dot-product: # ensure both functions are normalized (self-overlap = 1) x0 /= np.dot(x0, x0) x1 /= np.dot(x1,x1) overlap = np.dot(x0,x1) Instead of multiplying the individual function values as above, you may calculate their difference and take, for example, the mean. This is similar to a loss function in machine learning: d = np.absolute(x0 - x1) mae = np.mean(d) # mean absolute error mse = np.mean(d**2) # mean square error If the data is represented on different grid this approach won't work. But you can interpolate your functions and represent them on a new, common grid. A basic example is available in the SciPy documentation . The interpolated data can then be used in the above code snippets.
