tag making browsers close paragraphs

I'm having an issue with the HTML below: Some paragraph text some span text additional paragraph text that continues ... So this is just a paragraph that contains some preformatted text in the middle. The problem that I am having is that both Opera and Chrome don't display this the way I expect. Specifically they close the paragraph tag before the span and force a new line. WTH?! Using chromes HTML inspection options it shows that the tag is being closed and an empty inserted instead of enclosing the . If the span is removed chrome still closes the tag, forcing a newline. I need to have the following tag structure display without any newlines being forced . Is this at all possible or is there another option or workaround? EDIT: I'm locked into having the tag as it is part of a syntax highlighting plugin for wordpress. NOTE: I think the best piece of advice here is to validate your HTML. A lot of the problems I was having was because of invalid HTML that was being handled gracefully by some browsers and not gracefully by others. Validating means you have a clean slate to work from.
