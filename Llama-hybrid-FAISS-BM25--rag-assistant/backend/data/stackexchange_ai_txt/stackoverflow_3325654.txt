And I do not know if this would work, but what I would try do as a first attempt is to write an application that burned the CPU, and in that burn loop monitored its CPU utilzation yielded its timeslice to reduce CPU utilization to compensate when the average utilization exceeded the target percentage. In psuedocode , something like this: while (true) { double cpuUtilization = GetCpuUtilization(); if (cpuUtilization > 0.5) { Thread.Sleep(0); } } There might be some caveats that I have not considered here, but that is off the top of my head. One thing, you will probably need to run a loop in a seperate thread for each CPU core in the system, so a four core system should probably have four threads each running the above loop.
