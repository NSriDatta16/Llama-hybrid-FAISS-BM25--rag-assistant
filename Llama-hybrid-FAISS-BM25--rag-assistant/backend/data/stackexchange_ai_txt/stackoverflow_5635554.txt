The Eclipse you are using to execute the PDE build (i.e. the org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner application) must be executable in your build server environment. You said that you are executing the build on a Unix machine, but the ws and os parameters are set to win32. So it seems that you use a Windows version of Eclipse on your Unix build server. This can't work since the Unix-specific fragments usually are not available there (needed for example for SWT, that's why the class SWTError is not found). You should download an Eclipse from eclipse.org which is specific to your environment on your build server (OS, windowing system and processor architecture) and use it to run the PDE build.
