Dynamically change url or WordPress theme if UserAgent is iPhone

Is there any way to do this? My website is http://kennethreitz.com . Its driven by some moderate PHP on top Wordpress. My options are to detect if the user is using an iphone, and if they are either a) tell wordpress to load a different "theme" that i have written. b) if this isn't possible, have a different wordpress installation on a subdomain (i.kennethreitz.com) that operates out of the same database, that uses a different theme. I'd rather be able to do A for SEO reasons. Any ideas?
