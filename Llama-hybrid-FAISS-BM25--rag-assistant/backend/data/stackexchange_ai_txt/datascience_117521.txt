Here $n=120$ will be the right answer as you are calculating the distribution over the total number of trials performed accross all folds. The confidence interval here is over a series of binary trials, which here is the per-data point classifications. So the average trial here would be over the total number of trials in the k-fold validations, which is $$30*4 = 120$$ from Wikipedia Using the normal approximation, the success probability p is estimated as $$ {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}\pm z{\sqrt {\frac {{\hat > {p}}\left(1-{\hat {p}}\right)}{n}}},} $$ or the equivalent $$ > {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{S}}{n}}\pm {\frac {z}{n{\sqrt {n}}}}{\sqrt > {n_{S}n_{F}}},}{\displaystyle {\frac {n_{S}}{n}}\pm {\frac {z}{n{\sqrt > {n}}}}{\sqrt {n_{S}n_{F}}},} $$ ... measured with ${\displaystyle n}$ trials In this case, each trial is a classification, since each prediction on validation data point is a Bernoulli trial (binary classifications) with some $n_s$ successes (correct classifications) and $n_f$ failures (incorrect classifications).
