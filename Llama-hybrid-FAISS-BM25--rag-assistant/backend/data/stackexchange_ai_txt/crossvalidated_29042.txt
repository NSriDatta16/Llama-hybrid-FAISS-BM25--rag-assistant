You should choose "hidden option c", where c is beta regression. This is a type of regression model that is appropriate when the response variable is distributed as Beta . You can think of it as analogous to a generalized linear model . It's exactly what you are looking for. There is a package in R called betareg which deals with this. I don't know if you use R , but even if you don't you could read the 'vignettes' anyway, they will give you general information about the topic in addition to how to implement it in R (which you wouldn't need in that case). Edit (much later): Let me make a quick clarification. I interpret the question as being about the ratio of two, positive, real values. If so, (and they are distributed as Gammas) that is a Beta distribution. However, if $a$ is a count of 'successes' out of a known total, $b$, of 'trials', then this would be a count proportion $a/b$, not a continuous proportion, and you should use binomial GLM (e.g., logistic regression). For how to do it in R, see e.g. How to do logistic regression in R when outcome is fractional (a ratio of two counts)? Another possibility is to use linear regression if the ratios can be transformed so as to meet the assumptions of a standard linear model, although I would not be optimistic about that actually working.
