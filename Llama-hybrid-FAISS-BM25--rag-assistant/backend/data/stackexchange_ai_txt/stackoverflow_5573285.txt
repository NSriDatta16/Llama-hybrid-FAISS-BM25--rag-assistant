To get multi-touch events, you should use the methods getX(int pointer) and getY(int pointer) which returns the position of each touch point. You can know how many fingers are on screen with the method getPointerCount(). (Methods from the MotionEvent) Also, the ACTION_DOWN are fired only when the finger touch for the first time, if it's drag, the next events are going to be ACTION_MOVE. You are overriding onTouch(View arg0, MotionEvent arg1), but to listen the touch events from the View you are creating, you should override onTouchEvent(MotionEvent evt).
