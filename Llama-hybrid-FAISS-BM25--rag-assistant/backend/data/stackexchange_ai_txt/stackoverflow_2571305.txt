Drupal: allowing users to sign up to content using a form

My apologies if this is a little broad, but I'm struggling to know where to start here! OK, so I have a Drupal site and I need users to be able to sign up for certain content, here is the workflow in detail: I need a form within a block consisting of the following elements: First Name (required) Last Name (required) Organisation (optional) Email Address (required) Then there will be a choice of content to sign up to (using checkboxes): Policy Bulletin Action News eBulletin (which only members can sign up to) Then the usual submit button of course! Upon submission, users will: 1) Be taken to a confirmation page, or 2) Be informed about incorrectly filled in fields, and/or the need to become a user to be able to sign up for the eBulletin (possibly even directed to the membership sign-up page). Users will then receive an email when new content of the type(s) they signed up to is created, along with a link to the node. There should be details about how to unsubscribe within this email. I have used the Subscriptions module in the past, but I am not sure if it is possible to use a sign-up form with it. Plus, there is the added complexity that one of the content types, eBulletin, is only available for site members. Like I say, I'm struggling to know where to start, and any ideas would be gratefully received!
