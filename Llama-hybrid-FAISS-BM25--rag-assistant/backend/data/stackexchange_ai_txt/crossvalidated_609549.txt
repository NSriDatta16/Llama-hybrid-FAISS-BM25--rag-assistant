The logistic regression model is a kind of generalized linear model , so it consists of the linear predictor $$ \eta = \boldsymbol{\beta}X $$ we pass it through the inverse of the link function $g$ (the logistic function), to obtain $p$ , i.e. the conditional mean of the Bernoulli distribution $$ E[Y|X] = p = g^{-1}(\eta) $$ since $Y$ is binary, we have $$ Y|X \sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(p) $$ so $\boldsymbol{\beta} \ne p$ , but $g^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}X) = p$ . Logistic regression predicts the mean of the Bernoulli distribution. Regarding your comment, in maximum likelihood, we are estimating the parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ of our model by maximizing $$ \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \underset{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; \mathsf{Bernoulli}\big(y \,|\, g^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}X) \big) $$ (forgive me for the slight abuse of notation). Here $p$ is a function of $X$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ , rather than standalone parameter. Noting in the definition of maximum likelihood prohibits us from doing this.
