$\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$ are all well identified. When $\beta_1 = 0$ , we have $y_t = (1 - \beta_2 L^2)^- (\beta_0 + u_t + \phi_1 u_{t-2})$ . So $y_t$ is a weighted average of $u_t, u_{t-2}, u_{t-4}$ , ... plus a constant (assuming $|\beta_2| and $\beta_2 \ne -\phi_1$ ). (When $\beta_2 = -\phi_1$ , then $y_t$ is merely $u_t$ + a constant, but the conclusion below still stands.) So in your original OLS, the regressor $y_{t-2}$ is correlated with the residual term (assuming $\phi_1 \ne 0$ ) and this makes $\hat{\beta_2}$ inconsistent.
