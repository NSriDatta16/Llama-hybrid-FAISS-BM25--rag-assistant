No. If you are sampled it, you would have the same data, just duplicated. If you used simulated data, your model would basically learn how to imitate the simulation, rather how to predict what was observed. You cannot generale something out of nothing. You need to either collect more data, or use a a very simple model (e.g. logistic regression with the single feature). If you have strong prior knowledge, you could use it within Bayesian model to augment the data with the prior information.
