Can CNNs complete lines and contours?

Are there deep convolutional networks capable of recognizing two overlapping triangles in this image - or is this beyond the capabilities of CNNs? And are there CNNs that can recogize two boxes connected by a line in this image? If there are no CNNs that can do it: Are there other architectures that can?
