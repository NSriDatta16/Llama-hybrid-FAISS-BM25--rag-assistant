What does the zero-inflation model actually represent? this is a model for the occurance of non zeros vs zeros. It can be interpreted in the same was as a logistic regression model where success means a non-zero count and you are modelling the probability of obtaining a non-zero count. Are these p-values sufficient in interpreting the model or do further statistical tests of significance need to be completed in order to infer relationships between variables? Try to interpret the coefficient estimates, not the p values, but yes, the p values can be interpreted, as the probability of obvserving these data, or data more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true . That is, each p value relates to a specific test of a specific null hypothesis and that is the only context in which you can interpret p values. With this type of model how would you go about determining the significance of the random effects? With non-zero inflated models I am able to do this by using the anova() function to compare a model with and without a particular random effect however when I tried to do this only one p-value is generated. As such I am not sure if this pertains to either the conditional or the zero-inflation model. Again, don't worry too much about p values from these tests. You have repeated measures and therefore you are accounting for this using random intercepts. It is sufficient to report the variance of these random intercepts. In your case you can note that the variance of one of these variance components in both parts of the model is small in comparison to the other. Having said that, it is good to seek a parsimoneous model, so if you have reason to believe that there should not be any correlation within either of your grouping variables for either part of the model, then you can remove the corresponding random term from the model and perform a likelihood ratio test in the same way as you do with a model without zero inflation - note that you have 2 parts to the model that include random effects: the main part and the ziformula part.
