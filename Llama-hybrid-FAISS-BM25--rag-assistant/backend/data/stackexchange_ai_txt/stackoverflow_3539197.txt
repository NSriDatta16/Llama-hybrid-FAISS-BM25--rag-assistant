You have to open() the file in binary mode (consider docs ). Just like this: file = open(location, 'rb') I don't know whether it is applicable to you (since you are not allowed to change your Apache's settings), but I'd suggest to use Lighttpd + mod_secdownload for performance reasons. This elegant solution leverages Lighttpd's optimizations for serving static content while delegating authorization decisions to 3rd party (in your case Django).
