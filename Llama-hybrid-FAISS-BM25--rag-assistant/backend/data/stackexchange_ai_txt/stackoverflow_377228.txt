How to exclude 'out of stock' items from the front page?

I'm currently using Magento 1.1.6. My store only sells unique items (shirts with exclusive designs) which means at any one time, only 1 unit is available for each items. How do I omit those items which are already sold from being displayed in the front page? BTW, I'm using these code to show products on the front page: {{block type="catalog/product_list" category_id="3" template="catalog/product/list_home_batik.phtml"}}
