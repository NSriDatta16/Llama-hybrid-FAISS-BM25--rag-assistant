Is there a general definition of the white noise?

In my course, a white noise over G is defined as a bounded linear operator $\xi$ from the Hilbert space $G$, to $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})$ such that $\xi(g)$ is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance $||g||^2$, and $Cov(\xi(g_1), \xi(g_2))= $
