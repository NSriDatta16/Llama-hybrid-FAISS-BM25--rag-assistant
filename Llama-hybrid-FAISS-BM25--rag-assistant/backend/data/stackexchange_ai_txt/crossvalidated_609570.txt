What is the roadmap to self-taught probability and statistics for artificial intelligence?

I am trying to self-teach probability and statistics for Machine Learning career. However I want to learn very well as doing research in AI is my goal. Which books should I use to learn probability, frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics and which one should I go first ? I also know some basic probability, the better route may be to read some frequentist statistical book and then to Bayesian ? Feel free to suggest any route and book?
