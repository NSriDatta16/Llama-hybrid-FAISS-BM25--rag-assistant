Recommendations for java captcha libraries

I'm looking for a replacement for JCaptcha, which doesn't seem to be maintained any more, and isn't very good to begin with. The replacement has to integrate nicely with JavaEE webapps. As I can see it, there are three options: JCaptcha - No longer maintained, crude API SimpleCaptcha - much nicer API, nicer captchas, but seems to be Java6 only ReCaptcha - easy to use, uses remote web-service to generate captchas, but not much control over look and feel Has anyone used any others, that they'd recommend?
