what are the top js lib/framework/tool i should know?

i know the basics of js the language for several years, but never had a need to go deeper than say change a style of a paragraph or do a image rollover or validate a field. am thinking going deeper with js. can anyone recommend the top 3 library or framework that you cant live without? Xah
