Yes, whenever you test multiple hypotheses at once you should adjust for multiple comparisons. Yes, there is another way. Try applying FDR control. To elaborate, when there are a very large number of hypotheses, as seen in genomics, when we are controlling the probability of a single discovery we find that power is lost and nothing is significant. Consider applying the method of False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, which is a much more liberal way of adjusting for multiple comparisons. I encourage you to search for resources. You need not have a strong statistics background to implement the BH algorithm. Background information can be found for instance here . The lectures from this course can also serve as reference if your stats background is a bit stronger.
