I think it's better if you do train/val/test for each cross-validation fold. The validation set is used only for early stopping and the test set is used for just performance evaluation for the chosen hyper parameter configuration. So, you do your usual time series cross-validation, and while doing so, separate the train set into two i.e. (train/val again, e.g. 80/20) and use the val only for early-stopping.
