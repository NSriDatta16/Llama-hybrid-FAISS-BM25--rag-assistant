There is no reason a source file can't be in multiple projects. Just add it as an 'existing item' in VS. If you are using precompiled headers then both projects will need equivalent set ups for this to work. You can also use a #pragma in a lib to force a symbol to be included when the linker would otherwise discard it. #pragma comment(linker, "/include:__mySymbol") See the MSDN document for #pragma comment and the include option
