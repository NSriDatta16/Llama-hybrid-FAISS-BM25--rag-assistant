find out how a person is feeling?

How might I create a C# program to decide how, say, sad a person is? Do you think it might work just to pick out "depressed" words, or would that not go far enough? I could use a neural network if needed. UPDATE: Assuming that we know the prompt that the user is referring to, and that we know how that prompt should be responded to. We also have other sentences that they have marked as "happy", "sad" etc. Yes, they are in front of a webcam with a mic. Sorry if the question is too vague.
