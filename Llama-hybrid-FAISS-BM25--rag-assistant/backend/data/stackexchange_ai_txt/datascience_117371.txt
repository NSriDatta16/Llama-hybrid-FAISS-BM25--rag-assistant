There are quite a few reasons to choose a specific ml algorithm for a given dataset, e.g based on the problem you are trying to solve for example if it is a classification or a regression problem. Learning about different algorithms and common problems that they are used for and if they are suitable to work under certain conditions e.g XGBoost performing well when the datasets are highly-dimensional, Random forests being easier to tune compared to boosted algorithms like XGBoost, etc there's no harm in trying out different algorithms and seeing which gives you the best performance but you can, with practice, have some in mind that you can try instead of trying all the algorithms out there.
