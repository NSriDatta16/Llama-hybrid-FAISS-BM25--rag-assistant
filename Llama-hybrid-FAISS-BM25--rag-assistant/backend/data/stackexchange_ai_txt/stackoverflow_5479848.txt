So here I give my subjective answer. From my experience everything related to statistics is best solved with R. I have seen this often that in fields related to statistics, R has the most libraries and very often the most state-of-the-art algorithms/methods implemented. Most programmers like me like to stay with the languages that they know, and learning something new is a trade off, mainly because it's time consuming. So if learning a new language is a viable option, R is a good choice, in my opinion the best. Take a brief look at the R libraries related to Bayesian Networks and Bayesian Interference. Baysian: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html Graphical Models: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/gR.html Machine Learning: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html The main advantages of R: - easy to install a library: install.packages("RWeka") - the help format and style is the same for all libraries - if you know R, it's easy to switch from one library to the next. So it's easy to test all available libraries and then use the one that fits best
