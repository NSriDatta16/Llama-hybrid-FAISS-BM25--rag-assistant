Since you tagged the question sql-server then I recommend you to read To Blob or Not To Blob , a research paper by the regretted Jim Gray. The paper goes into plenty of detail on the topic of storing BLOBs in the file system (NTFS) vs. database (SQL Server), and you'll be amazed how many angles are considered. It's a MUST read. But the conclusion is this: The study indicates that if objects are larger than one megabyte on average, NTFS has a clear advantage over SQL Server. If the objects are under 256 kilobytes, the database has a clear advantage. Inside this range, it depends on how write intensive the workload is, and the storage age of a typical replica in the system. Your case falls clearly in the 'To BLOB' case.
