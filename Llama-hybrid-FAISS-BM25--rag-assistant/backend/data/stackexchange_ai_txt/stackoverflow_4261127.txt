Blueprint IE hack breaks VS designer

My client and I have both just independently experienced this. Given an HTML page like below, when the IE hack is included, conditionally or not, everything above the "First text" is not visible in the VS designer, in 2008 and 2010, and 2008 crashes very frequently, while 2010 only crashes during certain edit ops on the page. Smart Computer Solutions Smart Computer Solutions Some catchy and informative company slogan. First text Second text Third text I'm also asking this on the Blueprint forum, but SO is my primary oracle.
