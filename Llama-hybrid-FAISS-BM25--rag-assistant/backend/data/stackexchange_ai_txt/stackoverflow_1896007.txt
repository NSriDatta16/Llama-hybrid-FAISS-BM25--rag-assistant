Is it possible for rails to save multiple data type in same db column?

I tried to simulate variable_set and variable_get in drupal which use as site-wide variables storage. I tried something like this. # == Schema Information # Schema version: 20091212170012 # # Table name: variables # # id :integer not null, primary key # name :string(255) # value :text # created_at :datetime # updated_at :datetime # class Variable but it doesn't work.
