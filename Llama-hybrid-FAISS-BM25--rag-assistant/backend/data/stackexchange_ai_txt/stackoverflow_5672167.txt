What technologies should I use to load content into a dynamic div?

I have an interesting project in mind, and I have a question. You can see the look from my jank design below: I have a variety of technologies I'm planning on leveraging. To give you an idea: node.js (for various servers) WebSockets (for chat client and some content I'd rather not disclose) canvas (for part of the #content ) Now, with this in mind, I have no problem leveraging technologies that are not supported by most browsers. That's not any concern. For my question, on the page I have laid out above, the only thing I want to change (besides the updating chat feature) is the content. I would like to load the "Home", "About", "Contact" and "Login" sections of my website into the #content portion of the page. Now, I have an instinct to say the best way to achieve this goal is through AJAX, but I'm not sure. Since I could possibly just set up some files with the HTML I'd like to display, and then onclick, load them into the #content section. Is this the best method to use? I'm looking for practicality and performance. Sorry for the bizarre question. Thanks!
