PCA: understanding how to use loading vectors of X to recapture the geometry of X

If we suppose that X is an n x d matrix, and then perform PCA to obtain loading vectors z_1, z_2, ... z_d , why do we need to use all d loading vectors to exactly recapture the geometry of X ? My intuition is that without all the loading vectors, we would be "missing some information" from X ... but I'm having trouble translating what "missing some information" means as a mathematically rigorous explanation.
