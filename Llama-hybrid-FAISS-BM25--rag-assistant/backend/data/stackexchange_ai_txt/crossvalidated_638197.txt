Getting a very big relative risk ratio value

We have fitted a multilevel multinomial logistic regression model to our data. We have obtained relative risk ratios(RRR). For most of the independent variables RRR have usual values, like 0.49, 0.78, 2.45, 1.78, etc. But, only for a ordinal variable which has three categories, one of the categories have RRR value 115590.5. Why is it that much large and unusual values than the rest of the RRR values obtained by fitting the multinomial logistic regression model? Have you ever found such a big number as RRR? What could be the possible reason behind it?
