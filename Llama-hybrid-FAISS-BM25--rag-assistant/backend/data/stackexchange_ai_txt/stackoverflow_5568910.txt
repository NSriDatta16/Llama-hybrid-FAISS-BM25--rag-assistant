I actually found a pseudo-solution. Before beginning a chunk of code opening a new script, type the following lines of code: \begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=1] \end{lstlisting} This won't produce any visible output in the document and will reset the line numbering of the following chunk to 1 (or any other desired number). Needless to say, any more elegant solutions are still welcome!
