The correct way is to use a helper function. Sure, the unsigned char ucReadCh2_ADC(unsigned char *); may look like it stores the result as a value [0,255]. But who says the actual range is [0,255] ? And even if it did, what would those values represent ? On the other hand, if you'd typedef unsigned long milliKelvin , the typedef unsigned char (*EvalTemperature)(milliKelvin *out); is a lot clearer. And for every function, it becomes clear how it should be wrapped - quite often a trivial function. Note that I removed the "uc" prefix from the typedef since the function didn't return an unsigned char anyway. It returns a boolean, OK-ness. (Colbert fans may want to use a float to indicate truthiness ;-) )
