In the past you would add hacks in your JavaScript to determine which browser the client was using and run code based on that. It seems like there wasn't a decided on best way to do it so every book had it's own implementation. You will find in a lot of old books code to determine the browser and then throughout the code you would see things like: if (NS4) { } elseif (IE) { } But largely that's obsolete now. Another big thing we have now are frameworks like JQuery which look to abstract some of the few existing incompatibilities that are still there. It seems to me in the past, people would just roll their own style JQuery-esq frameworks so there wasn't a unified one accepted by the larger community. One of my favorite quotes about user agent strings came with Chrome was released: "And thus Chrome used WebKit, and pretended to be Safari, and WebKit pretended to be KHTML, and KHTML pretended to be Gecko, and all browsers pretended to be Mozilla, and Chrome called itself Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13, and the user agent string was a complete mess, and near useless, and everyone pretended to be everyone else, and confusion abounded." It's a good comedy read - http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/
