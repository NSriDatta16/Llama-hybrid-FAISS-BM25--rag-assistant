How are app reviews handled in the iPhone/Android/Blackberry app stores

I am considering writing a mobile application for one of the following mobile platforms: iPhone Android Blackberry One area which I am struggling to get more information about is how app reviews are handled in the app stores on these platforms. In particular, I am trying to answer the following questions: Are app reviews moderated for spam/offensive language? Are app reviews ever "aged"? This could mean discarding old reviews or weighting them lower when calculating an average rating. Does publishing a new version of the app cause old reviews to be discarded?
