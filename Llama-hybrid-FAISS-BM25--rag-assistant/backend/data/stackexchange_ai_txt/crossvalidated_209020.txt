This should be relevant: Hautsch et al. "Capturing the zero: a new class of zero-augmented distributions and multiplicative error processes" (2014). Here is their abstract, where I highlighted some key points: We propose a novel approach to model serially dependent positive-valued variables which realize a non-trivial proportion of zero outcomes . This is a typical phenomenon in financial time series observed at high frequencies, such as cumulated trading volumes . We introduce a flexible point-mass mixture distribution and develop a semiparametric specification test explicitly tailored for such distributions. Moreover, we propose a new type of multiplicative error model based on a zero-augmented distribution , which incorporates an autoregressive binary choice component and thus captures the (potentially different) dynamics of both zero occurrences and of strictly positive realizations. Applying the proposed model to high-frequency cumulated trading volumes of both liquid and illiquid NYSE stocks , we show that the model captures the dynamic and distributional properties of the data well and is able to correctly predict future distributions . While the focus in the paper is on a univariate setting, the authors claim in the last paragraph of their Conclusions that it should be straightforward to extend the model to a multivariate setting, in the spirit of, e.g., Manganelli (2005), Cipollini, Engle, and Gallo (2006), or Hautsch (2008) and subsequently give some ideas of possible applications.
