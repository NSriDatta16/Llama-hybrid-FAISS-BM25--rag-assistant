Having the switch inside the loop is performing a comparison 50000 times which only needs to be performed once, something I'd advise against. The second is a little more subtle, but it's quite probable the eq function is being dynamically looked up every iteration and possibly interpreted each time as well (not sure how MATLAB does optimisation). Your best bet for performance is probably to put the for loop inside of the switch switch average case 'arithmetic' for ... end case 'geometric' for ... end case 'harmonic' for ... end end
