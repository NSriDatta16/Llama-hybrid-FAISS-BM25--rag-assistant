Note that you do not 'calculate' $p(\mu,\tau \mid y)$. Instead, you samples from it (in the sense that MCMC methods sample from their target distributions). If you sample from the joint distribution of $(\mu,\tau)$ and ignore the value of $\tau$, you have a sample from the marginal distribution of $\mu$ - this is essentially what the concepts of joint and marginal distributions mean. Therefore, your mu_samples can be interpreted as a sample from $p(\mu \mid y)$ and there is no need to do any special 'marginalization' to your samples. However, analytically marginalizing over some variables, if possible, may improve the performance of an MCMC algorithm.
