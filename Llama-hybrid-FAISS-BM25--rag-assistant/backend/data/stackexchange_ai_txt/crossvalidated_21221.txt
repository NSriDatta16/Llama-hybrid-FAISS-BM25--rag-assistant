Average value from ranges in a survey

I have a questionnaire where some of the questions concern ranges, the answer alternatives are: 0 1 - 15 16 - 30 31 - 45 46 - 60 60+ (the numbers are minutes per week, not that it matters) If I would like to present the result as an average number, how would I do this? My thinking right now is just to take the average in the range (1 - 15 => 7), times how often it was selected. Then sum it for all alternatives and divide by the total number of answers. Not sure how to handle the 60+ value yet though. But it seems to simplistic and since it looks like a problem that must occur quite often, there might be some better method. Edit: A little background: The survey is regarding sources of inefficiencies in the workplace, like issues with slow servers, slow computers, using the wrong programs, etc. There are questions for several areas, and for each area the user will answer an estimate of how much time is lost, in minutes per week, in that particular area. I was looking for an average since I thought it would be an effective way to present the results; "On average, a developer loses X minutes per week due to an inefficient workplace. This means we could save Y money if we....". There is no need for it to be precise, it will just be used as an indicator and give some incentive for change.
