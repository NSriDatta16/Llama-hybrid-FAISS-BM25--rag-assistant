Why the HTML paragraph behaves so oddly on my chrome?

Get an empty HTML, type in this and see its source code on Google Chrome: &nbsp; WHY? If you did it like I did, you'll see this in the source: &nbsp; &nbsp; WHY? Just in case, here's a demo using jsbin . In that link, you see this: [repeating P] WHY? [repeating P] I've added this jQuery on it: $("p").html("[repeating P]"); Remove the whole from it, and everything goes back to normal. This small weird unexpected behavior is consistent when adding more things in the , and it could be a or I guess whatever in there. And it doesn't matter if the HTML is well formated or not. Anyone knows why ?
