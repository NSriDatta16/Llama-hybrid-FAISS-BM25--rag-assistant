Android application dev using the SDK or HTML, CSS and JS

Last night I learnt that it is possible to develop apps for Android using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, much like you would do a client side website. Is this a widely used approach? Because I have started to learn developing with the SDK but I naturally know more about HTML, CSS and Javascript, so I'd like to leverage that knowledge if possible. So basically my question boils down to this: Are Android web apps as good as native apps? Can the same functionality be achieved through web apps? Regards Renault
