Loading views from within views can lead to confusion. Extending the Controller class hides much of the complexity that comes from that approach, but still utilises the idea of generating common views (footer, header, navigation bars, etc) by rendering them once on every page load. Specifically, consult the CI User Guide and wiki for references to MY_Controller - you extend this by creating a MY_Controller.php file in the ./libraries directory. In there you can call view fragments, also utilising the third-parameter= true feature of the load->view() call. You load these into $this->data - for example loading the footer into $this->data['footer'] . In your various controllers, continue adding view data to $this->data . In your views - I typically use a template that does little other than skeleton HTML and some basic CSS, and then echos the entire header, footer, nav and main content lumps as variables taken from $this->data Added bonus - if you're new to CI, you'll likely soon be looking for how to do other things that a MY_Controller will make easy for you :) I've got a wiki page on simplifying the generation and display of view partials, as you're trying to do here, using MY_Controller at: https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/wiki/Header-and-Footer-and-Menu-on-every-page---jedd
