You said that you might use 4 instead of 16 bytes per user. This will save you 12 bytes per user what saves you 1.2 Giga bytes per 100 million users. I am sure that you can afford such storage for that many users. But if you use this user ID in way that it is not exposed to user (for instance in URL) increasing numbers could be just ok. Other way if this numbers is exposed to user and can manipulate it have in mind protection against birthday attack http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack
