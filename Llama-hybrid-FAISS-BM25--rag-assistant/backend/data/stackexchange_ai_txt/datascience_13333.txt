Considerations for multiple hidden layers in neural networks?

What is a general approach or planning when it comes to selecting the number of hidden layers in a neural network? Are there datasets/industries/classification v. linear that would help in choosing the number of hidden layers? I mostly deal with small, financial datasets (less than 10,000 records) and want to put more planning into the number of layers that I use. What should I be taking into account?
