You can safely assume 5 to begin with ( make sure you have NO MISSING DAYS i.e. fill in a local average for any day that there are no observed values. Good software can detect other cycles if they are present for example a monday effect or the first week-of-the-month effect et al . Make sure you detect anomalies and suitably adjust the data for their effect otherwise memory effects will/can be occluded. In response to your question .. 1) adjust for anomalies ... 2 ) use 4 daily dummy indicators ....3) examine the residuals for persistent effects suggesting a cycle greater than 5 via the acf and/or intervention detection schemes in a trial and error manner.
