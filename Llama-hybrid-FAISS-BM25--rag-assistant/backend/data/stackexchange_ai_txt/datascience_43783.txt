I'd recommend you read Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James. Be sure to check Introduction to Machine Learning by Andre Ng on Coursera. Really gives good sense to what data science is all about. Pick R or Python, check out Kaggle.com and you will have a better sense what should you do next
