Is there a way to combine features there is correlated but is important(time series) in a classification problem?

Suppose I have variables indicating access by months , consults by months (and other variables) and I want to predict the digital propension . Digital_acess_mont01 Digital_acess_mont02 Digital_acess_mont03 transfer_mont01 transfer_mont03 transfer_mont03 digital propension 22 23 24 3 8 4 1 23 25 23 5 6 10 1 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Is there a way to combine this information, aggregating acess by month , and do this to tranfers too ? keep in mind the last months are more important than others. here the biggest problem is multicollinearity in the dataset. thanks.
