Can you think of an elegant way to solve this problem? Honestly, you just dance around the problem, but don't mention the problem itself ;). If I correctly guess your problem, then the combination of MultiBinding and IMultiValueConverter should do the trick. HTH. P.S. BTW, you have immutable class instances, not value objects. With value objects (which are described by struct keyword) you would dance much more no matter if there were setters or not :).
