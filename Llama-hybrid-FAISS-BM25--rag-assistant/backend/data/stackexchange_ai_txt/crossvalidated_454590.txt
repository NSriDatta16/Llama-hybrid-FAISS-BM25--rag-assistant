why prophet doesn't capture some holiday effect well

I used prophet for time series forecasting. the holiday effect for Christmas and thanksgiving were captured well. The data show strong positive effect for the Easter Sunday('lower_window': -2, 'upper_window': 1), but the the prediction doesn't capture effect well. See the plot below for your reference. What might cause this issue? how to improve it? many thanks
