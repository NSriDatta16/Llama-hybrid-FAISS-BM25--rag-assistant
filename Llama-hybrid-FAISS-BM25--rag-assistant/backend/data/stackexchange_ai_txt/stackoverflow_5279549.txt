varbinary(max) is replacement of Image type. The storage size of varbinary(max) is 2^31 - 1 Bytes => 2GB. it should be enough. Image type is deprecated and will be probably removed in future version of SQL server. Use Binary type for your data and set its length to Max . Btw. working with such amount of data in EF can be quite bad idea.
