SampleData created in Blend not working

I am currently creating a proto using Expressions Blend. I created a SampleDataSource and added Collection. This collection has 5 simple properties. After setting that up, I dragged and dropped the SampleDataSource to the Silverlight page that i created in Blend (same project) and created the Datagrid. The SampleData and the grid works well. Now when I open the same page in Visual Studio 2010 I get several errors: The most significant I find is: Error 4 Undefined CLR namespace. The 'clr-namespace' URI refers to a namespace 'Expression.Blend.SampleData.SampleDataSource' that is not included in the assembly. C:\Projects\Moneydashboard\Management client\ManagementClient\ManagementClient\SampleDataSource.xaml 6 47 ManagementClient Basically I want to run the proto I created in Blend to run and compile in VS 2010. Thanks and regards, Mayur Kotlikar
