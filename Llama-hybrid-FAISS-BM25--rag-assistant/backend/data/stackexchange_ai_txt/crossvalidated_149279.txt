Have a look at: Estivill-Castro, Vladimir (20 June 2002). " Why so many clustering algorithms â€” A Position Paper". ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter 4 (1): 65-75. who noted that clustering is in the eye of the beholder . There is no such thing as an objectively best clustering, and there is no measure of quality . You can measure how well an output agrees with some other result, or you can check if it optimizes some statistical metric like SSQ. But often, there exist some (maybe slow) algorithm that optimizes this metric - so you end up just checking how similar the algorithms are to your metrics... If all you want to measure is the impact of dimensionality reduction: run the same algorithm with and without, and compare the results. (You just can't be sure which one is really better...)
