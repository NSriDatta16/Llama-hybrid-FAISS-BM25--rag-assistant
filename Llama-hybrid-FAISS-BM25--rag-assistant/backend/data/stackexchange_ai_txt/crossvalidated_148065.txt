What does lsmeans report for a generalized linear model, such as Poisson mixed model (fit with glmer)?

I am analyzing the eye-tracking data from a designed experiment. A simplified version of my data looks like this (You can get the dput() data here ), head(lookDATA) participant fixationImage fixationCount 1 9 Automobile 81 2 9 Bird 63 3 9 Chair 82 4 9 Dog 64 5 9 Face 90 6 9 Plant 75 where participant is a unique identifier for each subject, fixationImage is what picture category they fixated on, and fixationCount is the number of times they fixated on that picture category. I fit a poisson model to the data using glmer() from the lme4 package . model I used lsmeans() from the lsmeans package to examine the differences among the factor levels, cld(lsmeans(model,"fixationImage")) which provides the following output: fixationImage lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group Chair 3.786022 0.05764923 NA 3.673018 3.899026 1 Bird 3.866201 0.05750641 NA 3.753476 3.978925 2 Dog 3.868768 0.05751010 NA 3.756037 3.981500 2 Body 3.883644 0.06040952 NA 3.765230 4.002059 23 Plant 3.893327 0.05746744 NA 3.780679 4.005975 23 Automobile 3.901939 0.05745528 NA 3.789315 4.014563 23 Face 3.946848 0.05832549 NA 3.832519 4.061178 3 According to my (perhaps limited) understanding of the using lsmeans vignette the lsmean column should represent the average number of looks to a given category predicted by the model. However, these values seem uncomfortably far from simple descriptive statistics for these numbers, summaryBy(fixationCount ~ fixationImage, data = lookDATA) fixationImage fixationCount.mean 1 Automobile 55.18750 2 Bird 53.25000 3 Body 57.12821 4 Chair 50.39450 5 Dog 53.82883 6 Face 56.76389 7 Plant 54.71429 suggesting perhaps that I do not correctly understand what the lsmeans represent here, or perhaps that I've misspecified the model. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
