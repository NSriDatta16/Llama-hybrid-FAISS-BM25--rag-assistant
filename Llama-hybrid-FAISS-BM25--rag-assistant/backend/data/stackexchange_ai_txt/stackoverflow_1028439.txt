The graphical clients make this pretty easy. Dragging a file(s) or folder(s) onto a change list will check it out for you. Instead of checking them out with the context menu or Ctrl+E, which will put them in the default change list, just drag them onto the appropriate change list and they are automatically checked out where you want them to be. To do it from the command line, you pass the target change list number to the edit command, via the -c switch. The following command will open the file foo.txt for edit in change list number 1234: p4 edit -c 1234 foo.txt
