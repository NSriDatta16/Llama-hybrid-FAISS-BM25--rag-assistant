I second Adam's appreciation for LINQ to SQL and EF, but I'm thinking this wouldn't be an option for you (yet) because of the lack of support for third-party DBMS. On the other hand, a third-party ORM (e.g. NHibernate) may be an option. Perhaps I don't pay enough attention, but I'm not aware of any good reason to avoid TableAdapters vs DataAdapters. Do you have a link or two?
