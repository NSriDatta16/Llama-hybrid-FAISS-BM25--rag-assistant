Mean of target variable differs by one percent for independent variable, yet it has a coefficient of 0.43 and is highly significant in logistic reg

I have a dataset that contains information on what an individual likes! The question is posed do you get energy from ..... (my X). These X variables are categories. One of these categories is whether someone gets energy from and enjoys playing sport . It is true if someone answered yes and false if they answered no. The target variable is whether someone passed an undergraduate course. This is a binary variable 1 indicating a pass and 0 indicating a fail. 504 students indicated they enjoyed and gained energy from playing sports. 66.4% of these students passed the course. 244 students indicated they did enjoy playing sports or gained energy from it. 65.9% of these students passed the course. This seems like a very small difference and given that the dataset is not that large I would not expect this to be significant. Yet, when I perform a logistic regression on this dataset (including the other categories such as social activities, events, entertainment) it shows that sport is highly significant ( z-value of 3) and has a coefficeint of 0.43 . If I correct interpret this coefficient value it would mean that someone that enjoys sports has a 53% higher chance of passing the course. This value does not pass my sanity check when comparing it with the mean and the sample size of both groups. What is going on here? What am I missing? I am using the statsmodels api with the Logit model. Below is the model output generated by the summary method. https://gyazo.com/0616c6eeb576d149274efdf14ad54a2a I added gender as a control variable.
