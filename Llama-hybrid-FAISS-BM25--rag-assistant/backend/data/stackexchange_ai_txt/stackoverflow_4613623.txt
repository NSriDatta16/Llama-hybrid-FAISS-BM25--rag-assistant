We have built a simple monitoring app that sits on the desktop and flashes up red when there is either an exception written to the event log from one of the apps on the server or it writes an error to the error log table on the database. It also monitors the database health, checking fragmentation and the like. The only problem we have with this is that it can be a little intrusive on the desktop as it keeps popping up with a red message box if there is a a problem. However it does encourage you to fix it asap. We currently have this running on several of the developers machines. The improvement we are thinking of making is to have one monitoring app running on a server that then publishes an rss feed so that the app is only checking once in one place but we can consume the information from anywhere using whichever method we choose at the time (such as through our phones when we aren't in the office).
