How to make a hybrid ARIMA and SVMs model in R

I want to combine 2 awesome models for data prediction / forecast - an ARIMA and an SVMs model, and thus I want to reduce standard error for the hybrid model. Currently, here's a graph showing them in action: I don't exactly know how to combine both models together. My way is to fit the result of the ARIMA prediction to an SVM classifier. However, my method produces a higher error in all 4 categories (MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE): row 1 - ARIMA fit row 2 - SVMs fit row 3 - ARIMA + SVMs combination (my method) This is my source code: # Time series data data_ts Any help will be greatly appreciated.
