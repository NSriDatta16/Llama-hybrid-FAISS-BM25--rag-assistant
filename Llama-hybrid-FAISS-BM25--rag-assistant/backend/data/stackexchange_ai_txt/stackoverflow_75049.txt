I created a project here and used an embedded resource (build action was set to Embedded Resource, rather than just resource). This solution doesn't work with Resource, but you may be able to manipulate it. I put this on the OnIntialized() but it doesn't have to go there. //IconTest = namespace; exclamic.ico = resource System.IO.Stream stream = this.GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("IconTest.Resources.exclamic.ico"); if (stream != null) { //Decode the icon from the stream and set the first frame to the BitmapSource BitmapDecoder decoder = IconBitmapDecoder.Create(stream, BitmapCreateOptions.None, BitmapCacheOption.None); BitmapSource source = decoder.Frames[0]; //set the source of your image image.Source = source; }
