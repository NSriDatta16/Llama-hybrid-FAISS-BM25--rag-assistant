Curing noncoverage with hot-deck imputation?

Is it advisable to use hot-deck imputation to allow for poststratification in the presence of empty post-strata? In a survey reweighting exercise, I have population totals for a complete cross-classification of four attributes: country, age, sex, and work status. However, the survey suffers from noncoverage: For a few category combinations, there is no corresponding sample in the survey. This means that simple post-stratification cannot be applied directly. For the missing category combinations, I could use survey records that are "similar" to the missing ones (hot-deck imputation), and then apply simple post-stratification. I could even repeat this $k$ times and average over the $k$ sets of weights. Question : Is this considered "better" or "worse" than collapsing post-strata or using GREG estimation? Why? (Pointers to literature are welcome, too.) The following questions are related: https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/29132/6432 , Effects of ignoring the sampling strategy
