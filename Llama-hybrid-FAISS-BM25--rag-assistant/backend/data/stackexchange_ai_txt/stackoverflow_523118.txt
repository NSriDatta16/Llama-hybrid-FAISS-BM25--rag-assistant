Well i don't see a mistake, but you could just do echo $day[date('N')-1]; you need to remember that array indexes start at 0 not 1. So $day[7] will give you index error because theres is no 7. EDIT: as paoloa bergantino pointed out. You need to make the $day variable global, or you could put it inside the scope of the function.
