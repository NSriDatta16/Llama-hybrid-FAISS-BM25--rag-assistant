There are much worse pitfalls in the SharePoint OM than just plain old thread safety. Pay particular attention to working with objects retrieved from properties. You should always keep a pointer to an object while you work on it; example: var list = web.List["MyList"] list.Items[0]["Field1"] = "foo" list.Items[0]["Field2"] = "bar" list.Items[0].Update() // nothing is updated! You might expect Field1 and Field2 to be updated by the final Update() call, but nope. Each time you use the indexer, a NEW reference to the SPListItem is returned. Correct way: SPListItem item = list.Items[0] item["Field1"] = "foo" item["Field2"] = "bar" item.Update() // updated! Just a start. Also google for pitfalls around the IDisposabe/Dispose pattern. -Oisin
