I don't believe it is. Firefox 2 trims long link titles anyway and they should really only be used to convey a small amount of help text. If you need more explanation text I would suggest that it belongs in a paragraph associated with the link. You could then add the tooltip JavaScript code to hide those paragraphs and show them as tooltips on hover. That's your best bet for getting it to work cross-browser IMO.
