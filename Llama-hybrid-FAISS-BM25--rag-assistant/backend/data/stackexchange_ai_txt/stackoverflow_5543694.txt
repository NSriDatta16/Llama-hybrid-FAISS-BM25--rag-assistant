How to play s video stored on the web by HTML5

How is it possible to play a video stored on the web through HTML5? For example, this video http://www.cybertechmedia.com/samplevideos.html And I need to play it. How can I refer to it? I thought: var video = getDocumentById('videoPreview'); video.myFile = ???; What shall I refer to myFile with? Or shall I use something else?
