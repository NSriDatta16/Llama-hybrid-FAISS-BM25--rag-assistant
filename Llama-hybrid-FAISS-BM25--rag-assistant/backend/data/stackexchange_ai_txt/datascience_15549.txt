This is because you have very little amount of data. If not enough data is provided to CNNs, they are very likely to overfit. You can do the following things in order to overcome this problem: Data Augmentation : It is a technique to create new examples from the training examples by doing some preprocessing on them e.g. Rotation, Scaling, etc. Rigorous Dropout : Dropout is a very powerful technique to control overfittting. You can try using more rigorous dropout in your architecture
