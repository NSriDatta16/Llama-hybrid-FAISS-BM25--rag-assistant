You are not specifying what language the asynchronous call is in, but I'm assuming PHP on both ends. I think the most elegant way would be this: HTML page loads, defines a random key for the operation (e.g. using rand() or an already available session ID [be careful though that the same user could be starting two operations]) HTML page makes Ajax call to PHP script to start_process.php start_process.php executes exec /path/to/scriptname.php to start the process; see the User Contributed Notes on exec() on suggestions how to start a process in the background. Which one is the right for you, depends mainly on your OS. long_process.php frequently writes its status into a status file, named after the random key that your Ajax page generated HTML page makes frequent calls to show_status.php that reads out the status file, and returns the progress.
