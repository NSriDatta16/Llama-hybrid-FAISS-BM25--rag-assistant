Profile analysis in time series with multiple paired groups

I have two different sources of data on popularity of volunteering in 100 countries for each of 5 years. So I have 2*100*5 data points. I want to know if the different sources say the same thing at all or if they are completely unrelated. The 5-year trends are almost certainly not linear. I could do 100 separate profile analyses but a) tiny sample sizes and b) I would miss what is shared between all of them - 1) a possible level 1 effect (volunteering is changing over the 5 years across all countries and both sources) and 2) also possible level 2 effects (the two sources differ from one another systematically across all countries; the 100 country trends differ from one another systematically across both sources). What I am really interested in is, having removed those effects, are the profiles still similar between sources (even if they are quite different between countries)? I guess I can consider country to be a random effect and source to be a fixed effect ... but not sure how to do a mixed-effects model in this case. Is there a single test I can do which will combine them all into one test?
