How to interpret parameters in GLM with family=Gamma

I have a question regarding parameter interpretation for a GLM with a gamma distributed dependent variable. This is what R returns for my GLM with a log-link: Call: glm(formula = income ~ height + age + educat + married + sex + language + highschool, family = Gamma(link = log), data = fakesoep) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.47399 -0.31490 -0.05961 0.18374 1.94176 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 6.2202325 0.2182771 28.497 How do I interpret the parameters? If I calculate exp(coef()) of my model, I get ~ 500 for the intercept. Now I believe that doesn't mean the expected income if all other variables are held constant, does it? Since the average or mean(age) lies at ~ 2000. I furthermore have no clue how to interpret the direction and value of the covariates' coefficients.
