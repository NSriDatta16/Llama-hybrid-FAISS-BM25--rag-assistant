System\Processor Queue Length counter will tell you how many threads are waiting for CPU resources. LogicalDisk\Current Disk Queue Length will tell you how many requests are pending disk I/O. EDIT: You can graph these values using "Reliability and Performance Monitor" in Vista or "perfmon.exe" on XP. Unix gives you time-averaged values over various intervals; perfmon has a averaged counters (configurable sample interval for all counters together) or you can just get a snapshot of the current queue. I don't think there is a way to the a EMA (exponential moving average) like Unix gives you.
