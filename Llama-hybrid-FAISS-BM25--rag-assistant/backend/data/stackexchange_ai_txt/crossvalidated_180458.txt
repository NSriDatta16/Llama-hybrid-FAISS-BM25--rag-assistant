Finding a suitable algorithm for prediction location

I'm wanting to learn about prediction modelling and machine learning but am having difficulty understanding how I can apply it to the problem I've come up with. So here's my basic example, I want to record some observations of where I see birds in my garden and use that data to predict where they are most likely to be based on analysis of that data. Is there a better way to record data that will make it easier to apply prediction modelling algorithms? My thinking so far is that I can use a kMeans algorithm to cluster results and then I have a dataset that represents similar conditions to those I am trying to predict and then I simply take averages of the location (relative in the garden), corner (was the bird in the corner) and tree (was the bird in a tree) to predict where I might see the next bird. I'm just after some pointers or any feedback you can give that I can take forward and try to apply some more advanced techniques, I guess specifically what algorithms do you think would be well suited to this problem? Thanks!
