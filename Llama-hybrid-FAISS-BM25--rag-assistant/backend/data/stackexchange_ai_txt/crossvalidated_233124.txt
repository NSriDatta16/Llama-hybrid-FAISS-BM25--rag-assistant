How to analyze count data with a categorical predictor and no control treatment

I have a dataset looking at the occurrence of locations inside and outside of individual diurnal home ranges. Daytime home ranges were built for multiple individuals (5-10 individuals) for each of 5 species. Then I mapped the occurrence of relocation data at night for each individual over the course of days to months. That means I have huge variation in the number of nighttime locations per individuals ranging from just 3 up to 34. In the end I have a dataset of the number of nighttime locations that fall within the daytime home range and a number that fall outside of this daytime home range. I would like to see if there are differences between species in the amount of nighttime locations inside and outside of the daytime home range. My data looks something like this called 'night' Species, Indiv, Total Nights, Nights In, Nights out, BRWE 1 3 3 0 BRWE 2 3 2 1 BRWE 3 4 4 0 BRWE 4 5 5 0 BRWE 5 7 6 1 BRWE 6 10 4 6 MAFD 1 3 2 1 MAFD 2 6 5 1 MAFD 3 8 5 3 MAFD 4 10 10 0 MAFD 5 10 10 0 MAFD 6 11 8 3 MAFD 7 34 33 1 MIST 1 3 3 0 MIST 2 3 3 0 MIST 3 4 4 0 MIST 4 5 5 0 MIST 5 5 5 0 MIST 6 7 7 0 MIST 7 7 4 3 MIST 8 15 6 9 MIST 9 23 10 13 WTGD 1 4 2 2 WTGD 2 5 5 0 WTGD 3 7 4 3 WTGD 4 8 6 2 WTGD 5 11 5 6 WTGD 6 33 13 20 I began with a basic glm in R: mod
