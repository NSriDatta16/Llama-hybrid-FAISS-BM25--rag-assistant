How do you detect seasonality(multiplicative or additive) in a time series data?

Trying to apply seasonal_decompose on timeseries data. It looks something like this: modal_price Period 2014-11-01 1469 2015-01-01 1258 2015-03-01 1112 2015-04-01 1373 2015-06-01 1370 2015-07-01 1406 2015-08-01 1520 2015-09-01 1860 2015-10-01 1436 2015-11-01 1455 Using freq=11 and seasonalcomponents are all Nan. What should i do in order to detect the seasonality type(multiplicative/additive) of this data?
