In Probabilistic Graphical Models, what does it mean that r.v. X influences r.v Y?

I wanted to pin down what the intuitive phrase: r.v. X influences r.v. Y as precisely and as rigorously as I could, and wanted to check if my interpretation was correct and complete with the community. The way I interpret that phrase is as the following: X influences Y if any observation (or realization) of the r.v X affects the probability distribution for the values of Y. So for example, if we are wondering what the probability for a certain value of Y might be, we might go reference its distribution $p_Y(y)$ for an answer. However, if we believe that X could influence Y, then we believe that the distribution for Y is affect by a realization of X, yielding a different but valid distribution $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$. Is this a correct way of interpreting what "r.v. X influences r.v. Y" means? Are there alternative interpretations of that sentences in probability, statistics, machine learning or inference?
