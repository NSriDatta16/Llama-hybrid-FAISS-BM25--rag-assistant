Accessing session cookies with NSHTTPCookieStorage

I'm accessing a server's secure information and it sends a bunch of cookies to the App on request. The problem is some of the cookies are session only and when I use: [NSHTTPCookie requestHeaderFieldsWithCookies:[[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookiesForURL:[NSURL URLWithString:theCookie]] it doesn't return the session ones with the name JSESSIONID and causes issues. If I NSLog the full NSHTTPCookieStorage it displays the session ones so they are there, I just can't find a way to retrieve them out of the storage. Also, I've had a look through the cookie plist and the session cookies aren't stored there but I assume this is just due to them being session based. Any help is appreciated. Edit: This is a snippet of what I get when I ask for all cookies: Now when I ask for the cookies based on the URL in the above cookies, first one gets returned, second one doesn't. *note sorry about having to remove certain items, they are as expected and are not relevant for the question
