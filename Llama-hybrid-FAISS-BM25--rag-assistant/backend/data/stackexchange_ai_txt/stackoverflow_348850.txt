Code Coverage tools for PHP

Is there any code coverage tool available for PHP? I wish to check the code coverage of my code and API's written in PHP, but have not been able to lay my hands on any code coverage tool for PHP, as it is more of a server side language and dynamic in nature. Does anyone know of a method by which code coverage for PHP can be executed?
