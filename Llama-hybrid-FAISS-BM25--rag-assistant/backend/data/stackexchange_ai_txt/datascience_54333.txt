Source to learn/understand one-shot learning

I'm currently looking into one-shot learning and I wonder if there are any good sources/tutorials out there, which demonstrate one-shot learning in a (more or less) "hands-on" way? Also some hints to indroductory literature to one-shot learning would be highly welcome! Are there any books which cover the topic? I'm not interested in standard ML homepages which pop up on the first page of a Google search. I'm looking for recommendations of people who are somewhat familiar with the topic. So what are the best (serious) sources to start with one-shot learning? [Maybe like "Barto/Sutton: Reinforcement Learning" or "Hastie et al.: Elements of Stat. Learning"] I would be happy for helpful recommendations!
