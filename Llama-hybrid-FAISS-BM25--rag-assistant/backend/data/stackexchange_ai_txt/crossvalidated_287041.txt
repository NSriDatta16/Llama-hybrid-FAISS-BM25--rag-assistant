If the linear kernel function is the same as RBF with sigma = inf, then what is happening when the kernel scale is changed with a linear SVM?

From another answer here, I was linked to a paper: Linear kernel and non-linear kernel for support vector machine? http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.141.880&rep=rep1&type=pdf So to clarify, I think that the linear cannot be better than rbf if you have the right parameters and that linear is just a worse version of rbf. Linear comes from rbf. Is this correct? Also, in Matlab I see sigma for kernel scale but not gamma. Are gamma and sigma the same?
