Hypothesis testing with no sample or standard deviation, is this is a trick question?

The question I was asked is as follows: A website received 6802 page views last week. Does this provide evidence at a 1% significance level against the claim that the website receives on average 1000 page views per day? I have calculated the mean as: 6802 / 7 = 971.71 (2 d.p) H0 = 1000 H1 = 971.71 I figure that it is impossible to calculate a standard deviation without sample data, and therefore the inability to calculate a z score and a resulting p value. Is this is a trick question that is unanswerable or am I missing something? I figured I could try generating a random sample of n = 7 with a normal distribution based on that mean, and go from there? Building upon that, should I also perform bootstrapping on that sample? Or should I create another random sample with a mean of 1000 and compare the two using a randomisation distribution? Help would be much appreciated, I'm racking my brains trying to figure this out.
