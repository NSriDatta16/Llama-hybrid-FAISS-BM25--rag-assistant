how to get such results using excel formula

i have two excel sheets An example of the two sheets are below sheet1 a 1 b 2 d 1 e 3 g 1 sheet2 a b c d e f i want to put a formula in b1 of sheet 2 and drag it down so that the resulting sheet 2 is sheet2 a 1 b 2 c 0 d 1 e 3 f 0 explanation : - a = 1 because same value in book1 b = 2 because same value in book1 c = 0 because c does not exist in book1 d = 1 because same value in book1 e = 3 because same value in book1 f = 0 because f does not exist in book1 what formula can i use in b column of sheet 2 ?
