Run the application twice (say instance A and B). Console will display message from B. Then create two consoles as rsilva pointed (say 1 and 2). Both consoles will show message from B. After that change console 1 to display message from A by selecting the arrow near icon with monitor and select the instance A. The message from instance A will be displayed on console 1. You can of course drag (or detached) one console to other place for better visibility.
