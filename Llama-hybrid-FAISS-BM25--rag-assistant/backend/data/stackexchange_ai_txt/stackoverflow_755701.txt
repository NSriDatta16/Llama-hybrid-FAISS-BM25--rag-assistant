linking two tables

I have two table: job with jobid, jobdescription, etc and user with userid, jobid, name, etc. What is the best practice to link two jobid to the same userid in table user ? I can do this with a intermediate table that store the entries of the jobs of the same user but I am thinking that is a more elegant solution. Thank you.
