#byIdName div{ /* #1 */ margin: 30px; background:#FF00FF; } This block of code targets only divs that are INSIDE of the element with the "byIdName" attribute. div#ByIdNameTwo{ /* #2 */ margin: 30px; background:#00FF00; } This block of code targets only a div element that has the id "ByIdNameTwo". If it is not a div with that ID, it will be ignored. Also, the ID selector will override the class selector because it is more specific. Adding "!important" will fix that, but it's not recommended. Using "!important" is not a practice that should be encouraged when there are better alternates. The better solution would be something like this: #ByIdNameTwo.idone2 { margin: 20px; background: #FFFF00; } As an additional note, try to avoid using unnecessary elements in your css selectors (such as "div" in these cases). It actually takes the CSS selector engine longer to find match these types of rules than just using the ID or class name.
