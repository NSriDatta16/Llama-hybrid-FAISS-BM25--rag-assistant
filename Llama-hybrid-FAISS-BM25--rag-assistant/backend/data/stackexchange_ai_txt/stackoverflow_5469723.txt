How to generate code as Eclipse Visual Editor Does

I want to create an editor which should be drag and drop and it should generate source code accordingly.I found Visual Editor is doing almost the same what I wanted to achieve. I already went through GEF but I was expecting is there any source code available for Visual Editor so that I could understand the code generation logic behind it.
