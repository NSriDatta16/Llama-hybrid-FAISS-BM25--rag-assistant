Microsoft Expression Blend (silverlight): repeating header?

I'm using the new microsoft expression. I'm trying to create a repeating header much like this one at http://csstreacle.artygirl.co.uk/ . Is there a way I can do this in Expression blend. How do I organize the containers? And how do I set it to repeat in code or manually? I have a rectangle with a gradient on it. How do I get it to expand to fill the screen width for any browser/ computer screen size? I would usually do this with a 1px image in css but understand that xaml is a bit different. Rather than a background this needs to be a two tiered background for the header. The rest of the website will be white! Thanks Judi Check out this I've managed the background but the width is on auto 1000. Any ideas how to set it to auto or 100%?
