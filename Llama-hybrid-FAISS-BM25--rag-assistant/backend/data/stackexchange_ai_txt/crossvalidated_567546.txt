Categorical variable with too many categories. Should I group them according to frequency or according to the target?

I am working with a dataset of flight records and I model the flight delay. I have variables for the origin and destination airport , but each of them has about 300 categories. I think about grouping the less significant airports. But I am not sure how to do that. Should I: -Group the airport with less number of registries. -Group airports with similar average flight delay. Or, actually, maybe I shouldn't group at all? For record, I have about 5 million total entries.
