I use Git for my personal use, even tough it is a "Distributed" source control system, for me it has allowed for very nice workflows on my local machine and syncing with my other machines (home x 2, etc) very nicely through github or directly to my home server. For example, for personal projects I end up working on different features and/or bug-fixes at the same time and git's painless branching/merging allows me to switch between features, merge back and keep all organized very seamlessly. Also very easy to setup. At work we use SubVersion, and I still use git on my local machine to manage my coding workflow and then commit to svn repo
