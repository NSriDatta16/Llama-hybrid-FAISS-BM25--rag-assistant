There are two obvious independent (unbiased) estimates of $A:$ $\hat A$ and $0.3\hat B + 0.7\hat C.$ Their variances are easily expressed in terms of the variances of the three noise terms. The minimum-variance unbiased estimate of $A$ obtained from those two estimates is their weighted average with weights inversely proportional to the variances: see Determining true mean from noisy observations .
