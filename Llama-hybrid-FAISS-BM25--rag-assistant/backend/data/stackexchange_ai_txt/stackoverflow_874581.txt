Sectioned List in Java/Swing?

I have a list of items in a JList for the user to select. Since it's a lot of items (say, cities in states), I want to divide the list into sections. The section headings should not be selectable, though. So for my cities/states example, this might look like this: State 1 City 1 City 2 City 3 State 2 City 4 City 5 City 6 It wouldn't be so difficult to write this myself by embedding JList s in a custom ListCellRenderer , but I'm wondering if there already is a class like that out there.
