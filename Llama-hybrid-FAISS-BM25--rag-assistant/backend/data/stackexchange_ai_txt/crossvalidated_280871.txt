Do trees work with fat data sets?

I have a data set of $200$ observations of $10,000$ features. I want to use this data to make numeric predictions of a target variable $y$. Will trees, in particular XGBoost, be useful here? I feel like the extremely fat nature of this data might cause problems but I'm not very familiar with trees and not sure what those problems could be.
