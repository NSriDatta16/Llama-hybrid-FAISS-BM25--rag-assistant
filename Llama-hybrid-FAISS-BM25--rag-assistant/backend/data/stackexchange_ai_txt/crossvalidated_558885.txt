People really do find the delta method more useful in some cases. It is really impossible to tell which is more appropriate without being given a specific context since the context would largely determine which method is "best" for the given situation. I think that you've considered this to at least some extent, because you've listed some downsides to the delta method that you came up with. I pick up on some skepticism, or sentiment that the delta method may be favored by academics without being pragmatic in real-world applications where we have modern computational statistics. The skepticism is good, but consider your downsides to the delta method. The first only holds when asymptotic normality hasn't "kicked in" as you put it, but it can "kick in" faster than you'd expect in some applications. Mistakes in the derivation are possible, but not a serious concern since you'd typically not be doing anything wildly different from one application to another. And it usually isn't too time-consuming to derive. If you're willing to use a computer for bootstrapping, then you can use a computer for the delta-method... and I guarantee that it will take far less computation than bootstrapping. Here's a real-world example of the delta-method that is often used in reality: Greenwood's formula. Greenwood's formula uses the delta-method to come up with standard errors for Kaplan-Meier curves, which are used in survival analysis (medical studies, mostly). This is just one very big example off the top of my head that uses the delta method in a major real-world application, and I'm sure there are more. I think you can answer your own question if you give yourself a context. Just make pros and cons for bootstrapping and the delta-method like you already did with the delta-method, and ask yourself "for my given situation, which method's pros outweigh the cons?"
