Data Science is so broad, there's many different paths to get into it. It is usually split into 4 or 5 different types for example: You could see from the other posts in this topic people coming from an Applied Statistics background (applying the right algorithm), Programming background (participating in Kaggle), and others applying it to a business background Savvy companies could refer to a programming skewed person as a "Data Engineer". Big companies also use each type for their data science team, so demonstrating good T-shaped skills would be a good thing.
