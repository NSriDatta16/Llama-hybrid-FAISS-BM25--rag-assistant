Using PHP/MySQL to dynamically load lists in jQTouch

I'm attempting to create a webpage using jQTouch that has the "home" ul list of choices be static, but it will dynamically load the lists as you go farther down the tree. I'm using this for a car inventory site, where there will be a large chain of pages to load. I don't want to load all the pages at startup (since it's for mobile devices) so I'm trying to dynamically load my pages and their contents as I go along. I've got a current page of code working, and tested it on Android 2.1 (works 100% of the time), iPad 4.2.1 (works 90% of the time), and iPod touch 4.2.1 (never works at all). The important pieces of code are listed below: index.php: var jQT = $.jQTouch({ icon: 'cht.png', statusBar: 'black', slideSelector: 'div#home a' }); function reloadUCD() { $('#ucd').load('usedcars.php', function() { return false; }); } Welcome! Search Used Cars Used Cars Back usedcars.php is a PHP script that returns MySQL data in the proper form, as below: Used Cars Back Chevrolet Chrysler Dodge Ford GMC Honda Hyundai Infiniti Jeep Lincoln Nissan Toyota Volkswagen From what I've read on both the jQuery site as well as other threads on stackoverflow, the way I handled the .load function should force it to wait until the .load is completed before letting the onClick continue to the new page. Given that the Android device is loading it correctly every time makes me think I'm on the right track, but that I'm missing some key issue. What am I doing wrong with my code to keep it from working 100% of the time on the iPhone/iPt devices? Is there a different method for the logic I could be using to make it load properly? Also, is there some bug/problem with jQTouch that would be preventing this from acting right? Thanks in advance, Josh Hogan
