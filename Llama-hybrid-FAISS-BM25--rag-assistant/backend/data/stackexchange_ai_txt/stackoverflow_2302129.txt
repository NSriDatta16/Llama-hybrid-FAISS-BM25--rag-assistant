construct a DOM tree from a string without loading resources (specifically images)

So I am grabbing RSS feeds via AJAX. After processing them, I have a html string that I want to manipulate using various jQuery functionality. In order to do this, I need a tree of DOM nodes. I can parse a HTML string into the jQuery() function. I can add it as innerHTML to some hidden node and use that. I have even tried using mozilla's nonstandard range.createContextualFragment(). The problem with all of these solutions is that when my HTML snippet has an tag, firefox dutifully fetches whatever image is referenced. Since this processing is background stuff that isn't being displayed to the user, I'd like to just get a DOM tree without the browser loading all the images contained in it. Is this possible with javascript? I don't mind if it's mozilla-only, as I'm already using javascript 1.7 features (which seem to be mozilla-only for now)
