Here's a trick: use the SQL Server dynamic management view to grab data about which indexes have been used. This query will give you the most recently used index in each database. If the indexes aren't being used, then the data probably isn't being used either. SELECT db.[name] AS DatabaseName , (SELECT TOP 1 last_user_seek FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats ix1 WHERE ix1.database_id = db.database_id ORDER BY last_user_seek DESC) AS last_user_seek , (SELECT TOP 1 last_user_scan FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats ix1 WHERE ix1.database_id = db.database_id ORDER BY last_user_scan DESC) AS last_user_scan , (SELECT TOP 1 last_user_lookup FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats ix1 WHERE ix1.database_id = db.database_id ORDER BY last_user_lookup DESC) AS last_user_lookup , (SELECT TOP 1 last_user_update FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats ix1 WHERE ix1.database_id = db.database_id ORDER BY last_user_update DESC) AS last_user_update FROM sys.databases db ORDER BY db.[name] One warning: if you have maintenance plans set up to automatically reindex your databases regularly, or a third party defrag program, then these dates may be artificially recent.
