Looking for a rotation widget for java

I have a function in my java app that rotates an image by x degrees. Right now I pop up a simple JOptionPane that collects the rotation angle as a double from the user. Is there a java widget that would allow the user to click / drag to a point on a circle to set the rotation angle visually? Already checked out: AWT, SWT, Swing
