Short answer is no. But why would you not want to cache? What do you mean by 'generate a new page in realtime'? Authenticated users (anyone logged in) can see new content right away. Anonymous users may have to wait a little bit (if you are using Boost, for example), BUT, you can always control it, or flush it when new content is added. You should cache as much as you can. You can install Boost (static HTML files), Memcache, and enable Drupal cache. It's encouraged, especially the last one. You can also run nginx on the server. You can also try using Pressflow, a drop-in replacement for Drupal that will give you better performance. http://pressflow.org/ Its been discussed many times.. you can make Drupal extremely fast if you want to.
