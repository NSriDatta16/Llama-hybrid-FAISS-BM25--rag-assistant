PCA on Neural Networks dimensions reduction?

The dataset which was extracted from the database consists of more than 50 columns, I call these columns dimension s, can I call them dimension s? Obviously, I have to do dimension reduction on them. But since PCA like algorithms often do axis rotating to generate some new axises. I don't think I will PCA algorithm in dimensions reduction . So I calculated the correlations between these columns(parameters), and filtered these who has a high value and some other rules. So can I still call it dimensions reduction ? Since I only did some parameters filtering The reason I don't use PCA like algorithms is because I want to implement Neural Network classification, and I need the real parameters. Please comment on these, anything even criticizing is welcomed.
