Since you tagged this with GLM, I am guessing you are looking for which model you should use. That depends upon you dependent variable. If you are trying to predict a continuous value, linear regression is likely the best model. If you are trying to create a binary classifier, then you would probably use logistic regression. Logistic regression deals with modeling the log odds of an event. If you are trying to predict a discrete (non-binary) number (such as a count expected for a unit time), then Poisson regression may work, unless the assumption of Poisson distribution is too far off. In that case, you may want to look at negative binomial regression. What are you trying to predict?
