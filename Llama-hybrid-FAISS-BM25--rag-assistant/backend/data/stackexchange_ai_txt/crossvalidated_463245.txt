Confidence intervals for averages of averages

Suppose we have an experiment involving $N$ independent samples of single variable functions, $y_1(t),...,y_N(t)$ where $$y_k(t) = \dfrac{1}{M}\sum_{j = 1}^{M} x_j(t); \ \ k = 1,...,N.$$ I am interested in the average over independent samples, $$\bar{y}(t) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{k = 1}^N y_k(t)$$ How should I combine the uncertainty in the measurements $x_j(t)$ , $y_k(t)$ and the final average $\bar{y}(t)$ ? For instance, if I produce a plot of each $y_i(t)$ , I could draw error bars at each time point equal to the standard deviation $$\tilde{y}_i(t) = y_i(t) \pm \sqrt{\text{Var}[y(t)]}$$ to give some indication of uncertainty. The same could be done for $\bar{y}$ , $$\hat{y}_i(t) = \bar{y}(t) \pm \sqrt{\text{Var}[\bar{y}(t)]}.$$ Clearly if for all $t$ , $$ \sqrt{\text{Var}[y(t)]} \le \sqrt{\text{Var}[\bar{y}(t)]},$$ we could just consider the error in the final average; under what conditions would that be true? If the $x_j(t)$ 's are i.i.d with finite variance and the CLT applies, then $$\sqrt{\text{Var}[y(t)]} \sim \mathcal{O}(M^{-1/2})(?)$$ Then $N \ll M$ would justify us to indicate only the width (SD) of $\bar{y}(t)$ as a simple error estimate. I imagine this situation is very common, any standard texts or references discussing it? This post is similar, but I am hoping for a conceptual explanation.
