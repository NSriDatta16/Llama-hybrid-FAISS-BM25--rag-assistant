Ok, I found the answer, apparently I overlooked a certain line in the Magento API docs, because the solution was right there. So: you don't need to set the currentStore each time, you just need to append the store id or code to the update array: $soapClient->call( $soapSession, 'catalog_product.update', array($sku, $localized_product_data, 'fr') ); This works perfectly.
