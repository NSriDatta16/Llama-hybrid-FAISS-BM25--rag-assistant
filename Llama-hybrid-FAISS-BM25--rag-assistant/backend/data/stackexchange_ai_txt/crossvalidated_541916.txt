Meaning of interaction with %ia% in rms? Three-way interaction?

In this very illustrative post on evaluating added value of predictors by Frank Harrell, he codes a logistic regression model as such: lrm(sigdz ~ rcs(age,4) * sex + rcs(choleste,4) + rcs(age,4) %ia% rcs(choleste,4), data=acath) The "%ia%" expression is new to me. He justifies its use: The nonlinear interaction between age and cholesterol is a restricted one such that terms that are nonlinear in both predictors are excluded. This is to save degrees of freedom. Although I do not quite understand what's behind the explanation, it does make sense to me that we can make a less-demanding interaction, since coding continuous-continuous interactions of spline variables does seem to make model heavier. Q1: What does %ia% mean, in coding terms? Couldn't find much refs on the expression. Q2: If I wanted to code a three-way interaction between two continuous predictors modelled with rcs() and a categorical one, how could I code in this df-sparing %ia% manner? (in the case of the post example, involving cholesterol, age and sex, for example) Know coding Q's are better suited to SO, but this has a more stats background. Thanks
