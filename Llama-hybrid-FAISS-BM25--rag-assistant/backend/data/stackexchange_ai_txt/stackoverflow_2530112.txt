Using the value of a variable as another variables name in Ruby

I'm just starting out in learning Ruby and I've written a program that generates some numbers and assigns them to variables @one, @two, @three etc. The user can then specify a variable to change by inputting it's name (e.g one). I then need to do something like '@[valueofinout] = asd'. How would I do this, and is there a better way as the way I'm thinking of seems to be discouraged? I've found x = "myvar" myvar = "hi" eval(x) -> "hi" but I don't completely understand why the second line is needed. In my case would I use something like @one = "21" input = "one" input = "@" + input changeto = "22" eval(input) -> changeto
