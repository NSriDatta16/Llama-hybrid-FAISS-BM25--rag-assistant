Add New Product Image Type (Attribute) in Magento

I am trying to add a new image type in the product admin panel. I created a new attribute (hero_banner) set it's type to media image (similar to how the thumbnail image and small_image have been set up). I then added it to the Default attribute set under images. It appears fine in the admin panel and allows you to assign images as the hero but then when I try and echo the image path into the phtml the templates stop rendering. The code I am using to echo the image is below: helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'hero_banner'); ?> This is being done within a product foreach iteration so I have the $_product variable and I am able to echo other images fine (such as thumbnail, small_image etc). What am I doing wrong?
