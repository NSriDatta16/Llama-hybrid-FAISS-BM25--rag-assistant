Confidence bands for difference of time series

Assume that I have two time series $Y_{1t}$ and $Y_{2t}$ that are sampled at the same frequency. Is there a way to quantify the uncertainty in their difference $Y_{1t} - Y_{2t}$? That is, can we get confidence bands on $Y_{1t} - Y_{2t}$? My thought is that some sort of a dependent bootstrap should apply. This question also seems related to this question .
