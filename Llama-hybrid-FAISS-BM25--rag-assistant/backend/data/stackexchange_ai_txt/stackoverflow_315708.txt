C# Technique - Getting Constant Values By String

Is there any good way to convert strings like "xlSum", "xlAverage", and "xlCount" into the value they have under Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlConsolidationFunction? I guess reflection would be slow (if its possible). There are about 10 of these constant values. I was trying to avoid a large switch statement if possible.
