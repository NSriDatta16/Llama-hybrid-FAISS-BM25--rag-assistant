Dragging inside div - Firefox issue

Greetings, I've run into a problem with a simple jQuery mousemove function: When I click and drag inside a div, sometimes the browser will attempt to "drag" the div like it is an image. This only exhibits in Firefox (tested version 4.0), and is causing havoc with my project. I boiled it down to this test case: .box { width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 10px; } .red {background-color: red; } .yellow {background-color: yellow; } .green {background-color: green; } .hidden { display: none; } Can't Drag Me Can't Drag Me To reproduce: click once on a div to select it then click and drag. Red box can be dragged Yellow box cannot be dragged Green box can be dragged So the problem only seems to exhibit when a div is empty or its contents are hidden. Can anyone explain to my why this is happening? What would be the best approach to prevent this "dragging" behavior? Now I know I could add an empty div to the container but I wondered if there was a more elegant approach. Thanks
