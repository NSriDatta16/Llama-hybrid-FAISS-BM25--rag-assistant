what is the appropriate one-class classifier for sequenced categorical data?

Can someone suggest an algorithm for an outlier detection system? My requirements are: it supposed to be a one class classifier, where on training phase, it only fed 'normal' data however the normal class can have multiple sub-class. (we can see it as multi-class classification with an 'other' class, where this 'other' class is never learned) all features are categorical features have sequence relation, so I need it analysed in sequence. I need a lighter algorithm for real time application optionally - I need an on-line learning capability I have tried HMM. However it still very heavy to my liking. Furthermore it required me to create different model for each sub-normal-class. Next I tried one-class-svm (with one hot encoder). It was light enough. However results was incorrect. I'm guessing it was because this approach is not appropriate for sequence analysis? Now I am in the middle of Neural Network trial. I read that Autoencoder is an approach for one-class-classification. My results so far is not satisfying in term of learning time and detection results. Can someone suggest a better (machine learning algorithm) approach?
