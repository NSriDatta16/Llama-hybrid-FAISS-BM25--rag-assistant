How to conduct a meta-analysis on ICCs (i.e., test-retest reliability)?

I have calculated two-way single consistency ICCs in R using the irr package. There are multiple ICCs representing test-retest reliability across these time points. Is there a way to compute a meta-analysis on ICCs in R? Or to convert ICCs into a different coefficient (e.g. Pearson R) in order to conduct a meta-analysis? Converting ICCs into a different coefficient seems challenging potentially because not all ICCs are the same (e.g., "average" ICCs will be higher than "single" ICCs). Does anyone have any insight on conducting meta-analyses on ICCs?
