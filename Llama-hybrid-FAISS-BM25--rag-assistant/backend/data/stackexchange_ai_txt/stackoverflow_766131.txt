wchar_t is a wide-character string, so each character takes 2 bytes of storage. 'H' as a wchar_t is 0x0048. Since x86 is little-endian, you see the bytes in memory in order 48 00. db in windbg will dump the bytes and provide how its viewed as an ASCII string, hence the H.E.L. ... output you see. You can use 'du' to dump the memory as a unicode string.
