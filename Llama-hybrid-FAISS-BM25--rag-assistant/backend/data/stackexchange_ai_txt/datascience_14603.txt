Hastie et al is at the mathematical level you require - being written by statistics academics with strong mathematical pedigree (Hastie is currently a mathematics professor, for example) - and the complete text is available for free online via the authors' website. It is probably about the best general survey of machine learning for people with mathematical and statistical background at the graduate student level. That said, it is still a survey, and individual topics will require follow up elsewhere, though useful recommended reading is provided. Bishop also assumes a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity, although the table of contents may make the content appear more simple than it is, for example by listing a review of probability distributions including the Gaussian as Chapter 2. Russel & Norvig isn't about machine learning or data science, but rather the wider field of artificial intelligence, in which it includes machine learning as smallish subset, and data science effectively not at all. For example, it discusses a number of different kinds of systems of pre-programmed AI approaches - the exact opposite of machine learning. It is interesting if you want to understand the wider world of automation but will do little to help you understand ML.
