Is the application buy or build ? If Buy, does it support all three and talk to the app vendor about the differences ? If Build, then is it an in-house build or contract out. If contracting out, put out your requirements and let the suppliers put their arguments. If in house build, then first look at why you are not contracting out. Normally it is because you already have an in house capability, so look at that expertise. You want some sizing information first. Are you talking data volumes in megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes ? What are your uptime requirements, backup (recovery time / recovery point) ? How much concurrent activity ? Is that peak ? Generally any database system is fine for data storage and retrieval. High-end analysis, load balancing, replication, management, backup/recovery, auditability, security are all areas you may need to consider.
