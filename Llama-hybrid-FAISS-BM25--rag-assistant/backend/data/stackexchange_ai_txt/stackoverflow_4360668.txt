Active count=2 means that you have one of your designed thread ( birdofprey ), and the main thread. This is because you use lock, so the second birdofprey thread waits for the first and so on. I didn't get deeper into the algorithm, but it seems that you don't need to lock birdofprey threads, since they don't share any data (I could get wrong). If they share, you should make exclusive access to the shared data, and not to lock the whole body of run . Update upon comment remove locks (if there is no shared data. storage_i is not a shared data.); in the for loop` create threads, start them, append to a list; make the second loop over the list of threads, call join collect the information you need.
