There have been no public announcements about inclusion of client database support in a future version of the Windows Phone 7 operating system or framework and tools. However, there are a number of options available already, which include Sterling , Windows Phone 7 Database , Perst 3 , SQLite , and another one who's name I can't remember. If you want to know what's coming up in the next major release of the operating system and developer tools, you should pay attention to the upcoming MIX '11 conference in Las Vegas (April 12-14). You won't find anyone prepared to talk about what to expect until after then. UPDATE: The other product I was thinking of was NinjaDB Lite/Pro from Kellerman Software.
