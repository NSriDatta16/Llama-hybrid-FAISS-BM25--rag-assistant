This 'triangular' data structure (where a new 'diagonal' can be observed each time period) occurs in many contexts. Some examples Age-period-cohort data is of this form. A few links: A report by Bendix Carstensen is probably a decent place to read about these models: http://publichealth.ku.dk/sections/biostatistics/reports/2006/ResearchReport06-1.pdf/ He has a 2007 paper as well. I'll try to find the reference. This article in the Stata Journal is worth a look too: http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0211 Kupper, Janis, Karmous, & Greenberg (1985), Statistical age-period-cohort analysis: a review and critique. J Chronic Dis. 1985;38(10):811-30. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4044767 Davison and Hinkley (1997) analyze the AIDS reporting data set from De Angelis and Gilks (1994), which is count data of this general form. De Angelis, D. and Gilks, W.R. (1994) Estimating acquired immune deficiency syndrome accounting for reporting delay. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, A , 157, 31â€“40. Davison, A.C. and Hinkley, D.V. (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application . Cambridge University Press. Claims- (Loss-) reserving data is of this form; there are many articles on the various kinds of analysis used for this data (though I regard many of the more popular approaches as badly misguided for several reasons) The tendency to cumulate the data is common in this application; unfortunately the consequences of the particular kinds of dependence this induces are often ignored, and the impact this has on the ability to identify calendar-period changes is also often ignored. Bond yield curve data is of similar form (there are numerous other kinds of data that come in this form or an equivalent form.) I suggest you be cautious when analyzing the cumulated data - it induces dependence along the vintages and obscures potential calendar-period effects that may be very important; on the other hand, if analyzed as a proportion of the origination amount, the variance structure may require you to deal with it as cumulative. One possibility is taking it back to the per-period data as dollar amounts with origination amount as exposure. they do not come from a sampling process. This is a common issue, especially, with time series data - but you can regard it as a sample path from a process about which you wish to make inference. The data can be seen as resulting from a probabilistic process which (if the history were re-run) would have turned out differently.
