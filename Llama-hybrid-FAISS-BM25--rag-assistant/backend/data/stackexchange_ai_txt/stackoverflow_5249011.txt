Another approach (I've used it like that), is to use mail merge in Word. Works great. Easy solution: Save a .csv file, and trigger a mail merge with a certain word template via word's COM interface. Instead of a .csv file you can also set up a data connection via odbc, but that's harder to install, and more likely to fail. Advantages of mail merging: Your client doesn't need a developer ( you =] ) to create or maintain templates. You can teach an average MsWord user how to create templates in a matter of minutes; Your client gets "normal" word documents as an output; Easy to implement; Disadvantages: Certain things are difficult in word templates, like nested groups, so possibilities are not endless (like they would if you hand-roll some sort of report generator); Word needs to be installed on the machine where the reports are generated;
