Developing a self-study plan

I see that some previous questions have danced around this topic, but I can not find any answers that truly hit on my scenario. High Level Goal: Develop a sequential self-study plan aimed at developing skills necessary for weekend-warrior statistical analysis (a la 538-blog). Details: Looking to generate a sequence of topics, with references to books and other online materials (EdX, MIT OCW, Khan etc.). Off the top of my head I would like the topics to range from intro prob/stat to more complex statistical methods. I am not afraid of mathematical rigor and would prefer it if we stayed away from layman references. About Me: Degree in neuroscience, took calc, lin alg, discrete math, and intro stats for neuroscience. No work in pure probability or other higher level mathematics, so I would love references to necessary skills here if they apply. I can program at an introductory level in Python and Java. Also, I have experience with SQL and some SAS (more mechanical use, not 'knowledge') In the past I have attempted self-study, but end up not getting creating a logical flow and having large amounts of overlap. basic subjects interested in 1) prob/stats 2)regression analysis 3)time series 4)econometrics 5)modeling I know this is a huge ask, and I am certainly not expecting any one person to hand it all to me, but I would really appreciate input from people with knowledge of what skills are necessary and the best resources to acquire them! I'll certainly keep track of suggestions and then make my completed plan available. Thanks in advance.
