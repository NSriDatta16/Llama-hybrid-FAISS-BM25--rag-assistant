How to get a mean from multiple categorical fields

I have some census data on income I would love to analyze. But income, in the data, is split into different income groups, each group is a column containing the number of people in an area that earns A to B. If my explanation doesn't make any sense please look at the table below. So basically I want to get the average income for an area. Can this even be done with data like this?
