This problem is the same in logistic regression as in ordinary linear regression. There is a danger of overfittting when the sample is not huge and the number of predictors is large. It doesn't matter that they all contribute to the fit and that including them does not introduce a multicollinearity issue. They can still overfit and be less useful as a model fro prediction than it appears based on the fit. Hopefully you will cut down a little on the predictors. But let's say you have a large number of predictors and they do not overfit (maybe because you have a very large dataset). Then a table analogous to the ANOVA table in ordinary linear regression which presents the covariate, its estimate standard error, p-value for its significance etc would be a useful dsiplay.
