Possibly, and as a commenter was suggesting, there is some negative correlation between $X$ and $Y$ . Another possibility is that they are correlated differently with the A and B groups themselves -- e.g., $X$ is higher in group A, but $Y$ is higher in group B. When you add them together, you are then in a way "averaging out" these effects. I'm aware this answer is not super precise, but hopefully it gives some intuition as to what could be happening. One way to look into this would be to plot your data -- what does the distribution of $X$ (and $Y$ ) look like? Are they correlated? What do the distributions look like within each A/B group? What do the correlations look like within each group?
