I asked Jeff Sutherland this, and he told me that at PatientKeeper they have a fixed estimate of half a day to fix a bug. If the nature of your bugs is that they can be rather predictable such that you can find an approximate average I guess this is a fair strategy. However, in practice I don't find this always to work out. It is often difficult to understand what the bug is, and it might take longer time analyzing it than to solve it. This often makes bugs highly unpredictable and difficult to estimate. All tasks you include in your sprint must be analyzed, and bugs will often require more analyzis than other tasks. What we've done in such cases of "unpredictable" bugs is to allocate fixed time for figuring out what the problem is. E.g. we choose to spend one day (or x points) on digging into the bug trying to understand it, and then plan to address the actual fix for the next sprint. However, if that isn't sufficient time to figure it out we don't want to waste more time on it in the current sprint, and will have to reconsider it for the next. In some cases the bug might be highly critical, and you just gotta live with an uncertain estimate..
