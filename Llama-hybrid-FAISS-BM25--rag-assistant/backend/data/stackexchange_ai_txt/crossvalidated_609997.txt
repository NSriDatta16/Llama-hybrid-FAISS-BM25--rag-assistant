Suppose you have two populations: A and B. You draw samples from A: $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ You draw samples from B: $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ The actual values of $a$ 's and $b$ 's are just the numbers $0$ 's and $1$ 's, which represent success/failures. Now let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote the averages of these samples, i.e. $$ \alpha = \frac{a_1+a_2+...+a_n}{n} \text{ and }\beta = \frac{b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n}{n} $$ These quantities $\alpha,\beta$ represent the proportion of successes that you see in each population. For example, suppose your samples for A included a total of 30 times where $a=1$ and 70 times where $a=0$ . Then $\alpha = .3$ , and so you estimate that the success rate for population A is roughly 30 percent. You can apply the CLT to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ since they are means from a population. You are correct that that $a$ 's and $b$ 's are not normally distributed. But the moment you start taking their means they become normally distributed. As a follow up question you ask " why is their difference normally distributed "? Their difference is given by $\alpha - \beta$ . It is a well-known theorem in probability, that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are normally distributed, and they are independent, then $\alpha - \beta$ is also normally distributed. Do you require help how to determine the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ parameters for their difference?
