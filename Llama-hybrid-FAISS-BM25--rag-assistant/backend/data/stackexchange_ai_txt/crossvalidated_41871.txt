I'm working my way through the same questions. There are now a couple of helpful articles that weren't available when you posed this question. "Bayesian A/B testing with theory and code" by Antti Rasinen - the logical conclusion of an unfinished series of articles series "Exact Bayesian Inference for A/B testing" by Evan Haas (partially rescued here part1 and part2 ). The conjugate prior for the binomial distribution is the beta distribution. Therefore the distribution of the conversion rate for one variant is the beta distribution. You can solve $Pr(A > B)$ numerically or exactly. The author refers to an essay written by Bayes himself, "An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances" . "Proportionate A/B Testing" by Ian Clarke - Author explains that the beta distribution is the key to understanding how to apply a Bayesian solution to A/B testing. He also discusses the use of Thompson Sampling for determining prior values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . "Chapter 2: A little more on PyMC" from the book "Bayesian Methods for Hackers" by Cam Davidson Pilon - This is an iPython book explaining Bayesian methods in a number of applications. About half way through Chapter 2 (the section title is Example: Bayesian A/B testing ), the author gives a detailed explanation of how to calculate probability that A is better than B (or vice versa) using the pymc library. Full python code is given, including plotting the results. There are also now a number of Bayesian significance calculators online as well: by onlinedialogue by Lyst by Yanir Seroussi
