Does fitting Simple LogisticRegression with the predictors to find the relationship with the Response make sense?

Machine Learning newbie here. My question is quite straight forward, does it make sense to fit simple logistic regression between each of my predictors and response, and then picking up the predictors that show significant relationship with the response for building my further models? I do understand that some of the predictors will lose significance when used with other predictors.
