Are there libraries to perform xslt transformation in erlang?

I'm really new to erlang and I'm wondering how to manipulate xml. I've found erlsom but I need to do some simple transformation on a xml. I'm looking for an xslt (even 1.0) library, but I haven't found anything and reduced myself to do the transformations by hand working on the DOM, or whatever you can call a structure representing the xml-tree in erlang. No need to say that the result is an unelegant mess of code that I use to obtain a result i can achieve with an xslt of a bunch of lines. Do you know code library, or examples, or documentation that can point me into the right direction?
