Can a neural network with random connections still work correctly?

Let's say we have a neural network with n layers where connections do not simply go from layer i to layer i+1, but can go from any layer i to any layer k such that k > i. For example; connections from layer 1 directly to layer 3, or layer 2 directly to layer n, etc... Given an arbitrary training function and some chosen activation function for each layer, would such a neural network still work correctly?
