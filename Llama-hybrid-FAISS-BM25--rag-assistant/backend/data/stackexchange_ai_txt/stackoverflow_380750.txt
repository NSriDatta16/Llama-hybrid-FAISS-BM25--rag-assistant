TRAC doesn't have time management support, while redmine does. So I think that Redmine would be a better options for the project management. Redmine allow you to annotate tickets with the estimated effort, the percent of completion and you can tell that an issue depends from another to be solved. Then you can create Gantt chart with Redmine. For these reason in my company we are thinking to switch from TRAC to Redmine. Both are simply to be deployed.
