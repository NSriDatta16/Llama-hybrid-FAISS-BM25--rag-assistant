The answer depends on the scale of the information. If there is some ordinal relationship to IP addresses, then leveraging that ordinality makes sense. In the absence of ordinality, it makes no sense whatsoever. For instance, suppose the NFL had hundreds of football teams with no implicit ranking. Converting that nominally scaled variable into an ordinally scaled metric simply for the sake of convenience would be total garbage. One of the convenient facts about RFs is that nominally scaled factors with many levels are still feasible. This is due to the fact that the process of resampling and selection acts as an automatic brake on the possible number of levels, generally ensuring that the memory limitations of the hardware aren't exceeded. Of course, if the number of levels is so massive that this breaks down, then some additional constraints will need to be imposed.
