Confusion about the concept of Bayesian Networks

I read a lot about Bayesian networks, including focused literature. However, what I have not yet understood properly is this: What is the use case of Bayesian networks that contain of more than 2 levels? Suppose I have a graph A -> X; B -> X. I am interested in X. Then I can set up a model with conditional probabilities P(X|A,B). That's interesting. Now suppose there is also C -> A. If I want to find P(X|A,B), I never need to know C. So when would that relationship matter? In a more general sense: The Markov condition says that only the parents are relevant for the probability of a node. If I want to train a classifier to learn some node's conditional probability, wouldn't it be sufficient to just track its parents? What to do with the rest of the network? Thus, wouldn't I always end up with a 2-layered net, one layer for the inputs and one for the targeted value that is to be trained?
