SplObjectStorage is the closest thing. $storage = new SplObjectStorage; $obj1 = new StdClass; $storage->attach($obj1); $storage->attach($obj1); // not attached echo $storage->count(); // 1 $obj2 = new StdClass; // different instance $obj3 = clone($obj2); // different instance $storage->attach($obj2); $storage->attach($obj3); echo $storage->count(); // 3 As the name implies, this is only working with objects though. If you'd want to use this with scalar types, you'd have to use the new Spl Types as a replacement, as well as the Spl Data Structures and ArrayObject for Array replacements.
