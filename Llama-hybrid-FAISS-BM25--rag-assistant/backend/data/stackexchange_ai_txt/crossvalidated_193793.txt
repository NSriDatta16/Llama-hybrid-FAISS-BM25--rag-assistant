In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), how we can decide number of kernels between input and hidden layer?

I have $32\times32$ input image and $5\times5$ convolution. So in the first hidden layer, the feature map size will be $28\times28$. At this link we can see in C1, the number of feature maps is 4 but in C2, the number of feature maps is 12. So how can we calculate number of kernels? Is it arbitrary or is there logic behind this?
