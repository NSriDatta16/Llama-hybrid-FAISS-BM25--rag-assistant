How to improve training accuracy of DCGAN

I trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. The training accuracy of the generator did not turn out very well and the training loss was 10.1567 after 10 hours of training. What should I do to improve the accuracy ? Should I increase the batch size for each epoch ? Add more layers ? Add more nodes to each layer ? I have used all the practices recommended for a good GAN such as stride instead of pooling and batch normalisation in both models. Complete source code :- https://github.com/tanmay-edgelord/DCGAN-keras/tree/master The results from the generator are in the 'Generate_image.ipynb' notebook. Please ask for any other details that are needed.
