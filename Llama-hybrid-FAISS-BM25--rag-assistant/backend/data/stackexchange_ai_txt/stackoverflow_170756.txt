Delete code. This isn't snarky, but actually serious. Any time I would see the smallest amount of code duplication or even code that I couldn't get to execute, I deleted it. This increased coverage and increased maintainability. I should note that this is more applicable to increasing the coverage of old code bases vs. new code bases.
