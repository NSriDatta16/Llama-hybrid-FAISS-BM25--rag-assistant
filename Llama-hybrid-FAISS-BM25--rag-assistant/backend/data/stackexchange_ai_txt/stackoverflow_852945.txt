If you're wanting an ETA rather than a 'progress bar' then can you supply more than one figure? Calculate the average download speed over a set period of time (depending on how long the overall download is likely to last, if you're looking at 10+ minutes then every 5s or so would be ok) and keep a record of the averages. Then you can provide two figures, an upper and lower estimate. If you're confident that the averages are going to be a good indication of the total time to download, then you could display the 40th percentile and the 60th - if the average download times vary widely then the 10th and 90th might be better. I'd rather see a ballpark '21-30 minutes' and it be accurate than be told 29 min 35.2 seconds and it be miles out, and varying wildly from one update to the next.
