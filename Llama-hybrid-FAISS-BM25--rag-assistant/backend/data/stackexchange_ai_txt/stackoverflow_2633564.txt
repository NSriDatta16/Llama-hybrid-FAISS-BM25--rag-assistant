Windows Azure : Server Error , 404 - File or directory not found

I want to upload some files of size 35MB on to the blob container. I have coded for splitting the data into blocks and upload it on to the blob container and form a blob using PUT. I tested the code for some files of Size 2MB or something... It worked well. But When I tried it for a large MB file, its giving me this error Server Error 404 - File or directory not found. The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. when I tried it for files of size 6MB , it gives me this error.. Server Error in '/' Application. Runtime Error Description: An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine. Details: To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a tag within a "web.config" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This tag should then have its "mode" attribute set to "Off". Notes: The current error page you are seeing can be replaced by a custom error page by modifying the "defaultRedirect" attribute of the application's configuration tag to point to a custom error page URL. Can anyone tell me, How to solve this...
