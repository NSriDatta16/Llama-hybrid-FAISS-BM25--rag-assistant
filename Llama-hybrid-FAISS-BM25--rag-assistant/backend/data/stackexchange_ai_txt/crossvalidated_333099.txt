definition of "hidden unit" in a ConvNet

I'm 90% sure my definition is right, but it's such a core concept that I want to be sure. When we're talking about a normal neural net, the definition of a hidden unit to me is clear. But I learned about ConvNets from taking Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization, where in the context of ConvNets he normally talks about input/output volumes and filters. He never really defined a hidden unit in this context, so when he used the term I was confused. Here's what I think the definition is. Can you tell me if I'm right? A hidden unit corresponds to the output of a single filter at a single particular x/y offset in the input volume. So for example if your input volume is 9x9x3 and you have 5 3x3 filters (stride of 1 with no padding), your output will be 7x7x5, each filter is solely associated with 49 hidden units, each hidden unit is solely associated with one filter, and there are 49x5=245 hidden units at this layer. Or I guess I could have said things more simply by saying that a hidden unit is the value at a particular x,y,z coordinate in the output volume. Is all of that right? And just for the avoidance of doubt, a neuron still = a hidden unit here, right?
