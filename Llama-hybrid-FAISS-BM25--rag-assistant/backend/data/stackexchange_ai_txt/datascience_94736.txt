If you only care about word similarity, then apply Occam's Razor and use word2vec. There is no need to increase model complexity if not going to be used. Also, the quality of embeddings is primarily increased through the size and diversity of the corpus. The algorithm has a much smaller effect on the quality of the embedding.
