UIView Touch event at the bottom of the screen not fired

I am encountering a strange problem. I created a UIView that takes place at the bottom of the screen (0,431,320,49) and then I want to deal with touch events. When I touch the upper side of the UIView, it works. But when I touch the bottom side (I mean, more than 20px in relative position), the touchBegan event is not fired. It sounds like I have a problem with the network status bar that would change in some way the behavior of my code. Does someone have any idea? Regards, Mathieu
