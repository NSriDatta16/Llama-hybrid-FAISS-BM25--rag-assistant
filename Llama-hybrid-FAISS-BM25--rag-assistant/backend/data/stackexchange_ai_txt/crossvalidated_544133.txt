How does the glm function with binomial family (Logistic Regression) actually work in R?

I would like to know how the glm function in R actually work. Wouldn't it be possible to make a logistic regression not on the raw columns of a dataset but on the four values you get in the contingency table (if you have two binary variables as outcome and predictor). So for Example, taking a random dataset which gives this contingency table: Right-handed Left-handed Total Male 43 9 52 Female 44 4 48 Total 87 13 100 Is the glm function in R calculating them in the end or is it only working on the raw columns? Or is it important for the glm function to know which male is right-handed, which one left-handed and the same for the females?
