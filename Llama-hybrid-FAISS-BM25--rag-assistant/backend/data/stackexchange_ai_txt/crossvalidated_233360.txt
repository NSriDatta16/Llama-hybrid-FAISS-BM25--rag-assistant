According to H.A. David [1] Laplace recognized the need for tables of the normal distribution "as early as 1783" and the first normal table was produced by Kramp in 1799. Laplace suggested two series approximations, one for the integral from $0$ to $x$ of $e^{-t^2}$ (which is proportional to a normal distribution with variance $\frac{_1}{^2}$) and one for the upper tail. However, Kramp didn't use these series of Laplace, since there was a gap in the intervals for which they could be usefully applied. In effect he starts with the integral for the tail area from 0 and then applies a Taylor expansion about the last calculated integral -- that is, as he calculates new values in the table he shifts the $x$ of his Taylor expansion of $G(x+h)$ (where $G$ is the integral giving the upper tail area). To be specific, quoting the relevant couple of sentences: he simply uses a Taylor series expansion of $G(x + h)$ about $G(x)$, with $h = .01$, up to the term in $h^3$. This enables him to proceed step by step from $x = 0$ to $x = h, 2h, 3h,...$, upon multiplying $he^{-x^2}$ by $$1-hx+ \frac13(2x^2 - 1)h^2 - \frac16(2x^3 - 3x)h^3.$$ Thus, at $x = 0$ this product reduces to $$.01 (1 - \frac13 \times .0001 ) = .00999967,\qquad\qquad (4)$$ so that at $G(.01) = .88622692 - .00999967 = .87622725$. The next term on the left of (4) can be shown to be $10^{-9}$, so that its omission is justified. David indicates that the tables were widely used. So rather than thousands of Riemann sums it was hundreds of Taylor expansions. On a smaller note, in a pinch (stuck with only a calculator and a few remembered values from the normal table) I have quite successfully applied Simpson's rule (and related rules for numerical integration) to get a good approximation at other values; it's not all that tedious to produce an abbreviated table* to a few figures of accuracy. [To produce tables of the scale and accuracy of Kramp's would be a fairly large task, though, even using a cleverer method, as he did.] * By an abbreviated table, I mean one where you can basically get away with interpolation in between tabulated values without losing too much accuracy. If you only want say around 3 figure accuracy you really don't need to compute all that many values. I have effectively used polynomial interpolation (more precisely, applied finite difference techniques), which allows for a table with fewer values than linear interpolation -- if somewhat more effort at the interpolation step -- and also have done interpolation with a logit transformation, which makes linear interpolation considerably more effective, but is only much use if you have a good calculator).
