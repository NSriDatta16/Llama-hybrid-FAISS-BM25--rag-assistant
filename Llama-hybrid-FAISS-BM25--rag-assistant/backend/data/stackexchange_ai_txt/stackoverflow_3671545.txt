Nice photos. It looks like the type of translucent plastic you use can make a big difference. What I see is that the brightness of the plastic at each point is based on the angle between the ray from the light source to that point, and the surface normal at that point. (The viewer angle is irrelevant.) When the vector from internal light source to surface point is nearly parallel to the surface normal vector, the surface point is bright; when they're nearly perpendicular to each other, the surface point is dark. So try using the dot product of those two vectors. Don't forget to normalize. In other words, it's basically diffuse reflection, except that you're adding the effect of internal light sources (transmitted) to the effect of external light sources (reflected). See Lambertian_reflectance as a starting point. You may also want to add a little specular reflection on top of that. The third image is more complex: I think it's showing the shadows of the inner surfaces on the outer ones.
