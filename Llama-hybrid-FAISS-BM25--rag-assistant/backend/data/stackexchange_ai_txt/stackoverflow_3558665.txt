randomizing large dataset

I am trying to find a way to get a random selection from a large dataset. We expect the set to grow to ~500K records, so it is important to find a way that keeps performing well while the set grows. I tried a technique from: http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?24,163940,262235#msg-262235 But it's not exactly random and it doesn't play well with a LIMIT clause, you don't always get the number of records that you want. So I thought, since the PK is auto_increment, I just generate a list of random id's and use an IN clause to select the rows I want. The problem with that approach is that sometimes I need a random set of data with records having a spefic status, a status that is found in at most 5% of the total set. To make that work I would first need to find out what ID's I can use that have that specific status, so that's not going to work either. I am using mysql 5.1.46, MyISAM storage engine. It might be important to know that the query to select the random rows is going to be run very often and the table it is selecting from is appended to frequently. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
