It depends on the data you have available If you have micro data, i.e. records of individuals, you might want to look into multiple logistic regression, i.e. modelling the probability of dropping out based on various explanatory variables, e.g. gender. It will also allow you to assess if the effect has changed over time. If you have aggregated data, i.e. tabular data, you might want to look into chi-sqaure test, e.g. to see if there is any differences between drop outs based on gender.
