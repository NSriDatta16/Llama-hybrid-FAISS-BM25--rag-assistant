Is this the best way to show content?

I'm relatively new in Android's world and the UI/Thread model is still confusing. Here is what I am trying to do: Load data from the web Handle them Show them Show an AlertDialog if there is a problem I'm currently doing like this, but I'm not sure that using many thread like that is the best way to do it. Inside the onCreate() final ProgressDialog pd = ProgressDialog.show(this, "", loadingText, true); final AlertDialog.Builder b = new AlertDialog.Builder(this); new Thread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { try { loadResorts(); } catch (ResortsRetrievalException e) { runOnUiThread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { b.setMessage(R.string.resorts_retrieval_error) .show(); } }); } pd.dismiss(); } }).start(); And my loadResorts method finishes with final BaseAdapter a = new ResortAdapter(this, R.layout.resort_item, resorts); runOnUiThread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { resortsList.setAdapter(a); } }); I have one Thread and two calls of runOnUiThread for that. I feel that there could be a better solution without having to deal with these threads. Am I right? Thanks
