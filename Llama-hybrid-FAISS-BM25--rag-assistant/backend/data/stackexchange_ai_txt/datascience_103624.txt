Sampling a data based on average and variance of another data

I have a set of textual datasets that have the following average and variance tokens lengths: Dataset1 avg = 28.18, var = 393.03 Dataset2 avg = 32.70, var = 644.79 Dataset3 avg = 36.94, var = 805.50 Dataset4 avg = 28.56, var = 436.86 Dataset5 avg = 53.13, var = 612.18 How can I sample a smaller set of instances from Dataset5 that is similar (or equal if possible) in terms of avg and var to any of the above datasets? I am using Pandas dataframes, where each dataset have 2 columns [text, tokens_length].
