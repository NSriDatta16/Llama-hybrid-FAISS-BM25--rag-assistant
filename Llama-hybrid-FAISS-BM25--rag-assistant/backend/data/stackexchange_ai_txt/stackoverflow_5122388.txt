The sub is called when requested data arrives. You can close anonymous sub around variable from the outside to get it assigned. my $result; $redis->get(key => sub { my ($redis, $res) = @_; $result = $res->[0]; }); But pay attention to that variable is filled asynchronously, so it will not be immediately available. Probably best approach is to process result within the anonymous sub.
