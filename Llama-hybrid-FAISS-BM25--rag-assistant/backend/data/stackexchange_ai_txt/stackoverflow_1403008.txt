How to do Silverlight Validation in a web service

I am currently trying to implement the built-in Silverlight 3 validation against objects that are accessed via a web service. I have tried to follow the examples listed on SilverLight.net ( Jesse Liberty's tutorial ) and have had no luck. In fact, I could not get the tutorial to work after I downloaded it unless I started it without debugging. Currently my code looks like this [DataContract] public class Email { [DataMember] public string EMailID; [DataMember] public string EMailTypeID; [DataMember] public string EMailTypeName; [DataMember] public string UserID; [DataMember] public string EMailAddress; [DataMember] public string ActiveRecordFlag; [DataMember] public string Created; [DataMember] public string Modified; } I tried the INotifyChange changes, all to no avail. Has anyone done this before, or seen a tutorial on how to use objects that are accessed via web services with the built in validation? Thanks ~Steve
