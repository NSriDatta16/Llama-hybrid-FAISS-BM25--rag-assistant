For a soft reset, that's easy. A shortcut in in the Startup folder will get you running again. Hard reset is more difficult becasue by the very definition, it returns a device to factory state. The user would be required to do a reinstall. Now that can be facilitated using storage cards, a custom autorun.exe or device specific features (like what Symbol has), but it's going to be really, really hard to have a solution that works across all devices. In those cases, it's best to let the user know that after a hard reset, the application must be reinstalled in the same way it was installed in the first place.
