Django annotate with values: how to access values?

I have a model with "disposals" and a model with "salesman". I want to get the average discount of everye salesman. Here's what I'm trying: sm = Disposal.objects.annotate(average_discount=Avg('discount')).values('average_discount','sm__fname','sm__lname').order_by('-discount') for s in sm: data[0] = data[0]+s.sm__fname+','+s.sm__lname+','+str(s.average_discount) Now I get this error: Disposal object has no attribute sm__fname The query runs fine when I execute it in the django shell - but how can I access the values? Thank you very much!
