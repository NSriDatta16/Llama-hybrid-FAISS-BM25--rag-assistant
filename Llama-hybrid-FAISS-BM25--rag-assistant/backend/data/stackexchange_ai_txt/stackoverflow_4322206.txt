1 trillion+ a single record will contain text data and meta data about the text document. pl help me understand about the storage limitations I hope you have a BIG budget for hardware. This is big as in "millions". A trillion documents, at 1024 bytes total storage per document (VERY unlikely to be realistic when you say text) is a size of about 950 terabyte of data. Storage limitations means you talk high end SAN here. Using a non-redundant setup of 2tb discs that is 450 discs. Make the maths. Adding redundancy / raid to that and you talk major hardware invesment. An this assumes only 1kb per document. If you have on average 16kg data usage, this is... 7200 2tb discs. THat is a hardware problem to start with. SQL Server does not scale so high, and you can not do that in a single system anyway. The normal approach for a docuemnt store like this would be a clustered storage system (clustered or somehow distributed file system) plus a central database for the keywords / tagging. Depending on load / inserts possibly with replciations of hte database for distributed search. Whatever it is going to be, the storage / backup requiments are terrific. Lagre project here, large budget. IO load is gong to be another issue - hardware wise. You will need a large machine and get a TON of IO bandwidth into it. I have seen 8gb links overloaded on a SQL Server (fed by a HP eva with 190 discs) and I can imagine you will run something similar. You will want hardware with as much ram as technically possible, regardless of the price - unless you store the blobs outside. SQL row compression may come in VERY handy. Full text search will be a problem. the total size of data will cross 1000 TB. No. Seriously. It will be a bigger, I think. 1000tb would assume the documents are small - like the XML form of a travel ticket.
