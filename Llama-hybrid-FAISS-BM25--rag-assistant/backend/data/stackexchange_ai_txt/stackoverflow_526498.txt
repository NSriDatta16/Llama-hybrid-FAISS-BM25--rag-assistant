It's absolutely unacceptable to have your controls rely on an external web service to check the license. The only thing you're going to get out of that is pissed off customers and maintenance issues for yourself. I strongly encourage you to go with the honor system, or a very simple licensing key file (that never expires). You're selling a web site, not video games. Unless you know for a fact that you are losing significant money because of piracy of your product, do not waste your time. Remember the first rule of optimization!
