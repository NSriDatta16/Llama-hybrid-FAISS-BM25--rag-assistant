How to combine two vector embeddings into one?

I want to use OpenCLIP for generating embeddings for each slide in an array of pptx presentations. To improve the quality of the results, I want to vectorize both slide text content and preview images. So then I can run queries like "What slides show the project plan of Fintech project delivery in the form of a Gantt chart?", assuming text embeddings will cover the "Fintech" part and image embeddings the "Gantt chart" part. Is that even possible? If so, can I just concatenate two vectors?
