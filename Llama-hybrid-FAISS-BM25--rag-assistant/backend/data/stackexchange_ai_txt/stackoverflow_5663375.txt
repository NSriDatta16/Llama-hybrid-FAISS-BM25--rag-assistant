Magento multi website/store setup - please help!

I followed an article from Magento Support on how to set up a Magento installation with multiple websites, stores, and store views, but it screwed my installation and I couldn't access anything. Thanks to a couple of replies to my post, I was able to get back to some semblance of a working system. I would really appreciate if someone could spot what stupid thing I must have done in my setup. My requirements for this test setup are: - One single admin area. - Two websites. - First website with 1 store (with 3 store views). - Second website with 2 stores (each with one store view). - I'd prefer to access the frontend using URLs like: http://www.firstwebsite.com rather than http://www.firstwebsite.com/magento/index.php Machine is running Windows XP. In the stores configuration I have this setup: Websites: Name=Main Website code=base Name=Paul Website code=pws1 Stores: Name=Main Store Website=Main Website Name=Electronics Website=Paul Website Name=Media Website=Paul Website Store Views: Name=English Store=Electronics code=en1 Name=English Store=Media code=en2 Name=English Store=Main Store code=default Name=French Store=Main Store code=french Name=German Store=Main Store code=german System/Configuration/General/Web (accessed by URL http://test.pdapache.com/magento/index.php ): Scope=Default Config Add Store Code to Urls = No Auto-redirect to Base URL = No Secure and Unsecure URLs just set to {{base_url}} at this scope Scope=Main Website Unsecure Base URL=http://test.pdapache.com/magento/ Secure Base URL=https://test.pdapache.com/magento/ All other secure/unsecure not using default. Also Default Web URL=cms (use Default = No). CMS Home Page=Home Page (use default = no) Scope=Paul Website Unsecure Base URL=http://paulsplace.com/magento/ Secure Base URL=https://paulsplace.com/magento/ All other secure/unsecure not using default. Also Default Web URL=cms (use Default = No). CMS Home Page=Home Page (use default = no) hosts file: 127.0.0.1 test.pdapache.com 127.0.0.1 www.paulsplace.com 127.0.0.1 paulsplace.com httpd.conf: Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf httpd-vhosts.conf file: ServerAdmin me@myemail.com DocumentRoot "C:/Applications/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/htdocs" ServerName paulsplace.com ErrorLog "logs/paulsplace.com-error.log" CustomLog "logs/paulsplace.com-access.log" common SetEnv MAGE_RUN_TYPE website SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE pws1 ServerAdmin me@myemail.com DocumentRoot "C:/Applications/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/htdocs" ServerName pdapache.com ErrorLog "logs/pdapache.com-error.log" CustomLog "logs/pdapache.com-access.log" common SetEnv MAGE_RUN_TYPE website SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE base When I go to either of these addresses: http://test.pdapache.com/magento/index.php http://www.paulsplace.com/magento/index.php I get a Magento logo-ed page that just says "There was no Home CMS page configured or found" The URLs I'd rather be using, i.e. http://test.pdapache.com http://www.paulsplace.com just displays the Apache index.html "It works!" page. Help! I guess I've made some stupid mistake somewhere, maybe more than one, but I don't know where.
