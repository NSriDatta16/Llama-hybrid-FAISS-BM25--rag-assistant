Open all files when user right clicks and selects "Open With"

I have an application written in WPF/C# that can take multiple files as command line arguments. When I run it from the command line with multiple files it opens all of them. When I select multiple files in an explorer window and drag them to the applications icon it opens all of them. But if I select multiple files in explorer and right click, select Open With, and then select my application it only opens the last one. Is there a way to tell Windows that my application can handle more than one file? I've noticed that some programs seem to work that way while others do not.
