If plugin is html page that can be opened standalone in the browser, may be you should use page fragment load $('#content').load('plugin.html #plugin-body'); not load the whole page ( more ) May be I should have predefined function on plugin page called pluginInitialize(initParams); function is called from loader page when plugin is loaded. This function contains plugin initialization logic (may be sophisticated and rather complex).
