How to encode the redirect_uri for facebook login

I'm trying to build a login link for facebook and I'm I'm getting errors only in some cases. I'm trying to specify a a querystring parameter in redirect_uri token so that I can redirect them back to a specific area of my site after logging in. Here's what works and what doesn't work. &redirect_uri=http://mydomain.com/login?returnUrl=returnUrl - works &redirect_uri=http://mydomain.com/login?returnurl=/return/url -doesn't work &redirect_uri=http%3a%2f%2fmyagentcheckin.com%2flogin%3freturnUrl%3d%2freturn%2furl -doesn't work It seems that the / in the querystring are causing it to fail. Facebook returns an error when I try it. Anyone know of a way around this?
