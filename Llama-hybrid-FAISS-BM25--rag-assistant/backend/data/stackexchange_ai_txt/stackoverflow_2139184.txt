JMeter Graph Results for multiple http requests

I created a simple JMeter Http test. I specified 50 users, each users will do do 30 http requests (one after the other), and the user's ramp up time is 1 second. Then I added a Graph Result Listener, then recorded the performance of my application for 10minutes. Question : What is Graph Results Listener measuring - per http request of each user? or all 30 http requests of each user? I mean, if I have an Average of 5seconds, does that mean that the each http requests gets a response 5 seconds on average? ...or does that mean that all 30 http requests (totaling their response times) gets 5 seconds on average?
