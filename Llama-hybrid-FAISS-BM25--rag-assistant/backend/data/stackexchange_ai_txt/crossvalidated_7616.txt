By myself when you are approaching to a new data set you should start to watch to the whole problem. First of all get a distribution for categorical features and mean and standard deviations for each continuous feature. Then: Delete features with more than X% missing values; Delete categorical features when a particular value gets more then 90-95% of relative frequency; Delete continuous features with CV=std/mean Get a parameter ranking, eg ANOVA for continuous and Chi-square for categorical; Get a significant subset of features; Then I usually split the classification techniques in 2 sets: white box and black box technique. If you need to know 'how the classifier works' you should choose in the first set, eg Decision-Trees or Rules-based classifiers. If you need to classify new records without building a model should should take a look to eager learner, eg KNN. After that I think is better to have a threshold between accuracy and speed: Neural Network are a bit slower than SVM. This is my top five classification technique: Decision Tree; Rule-based classifiers; SMO (SVM); Naive Bayes; Neural Networks.
