Doubly linked list, obviously. What do you mean by "you want your memory to be contiguous"? No matter which data structure you use, it's only going to be contiguous till you delete one element, after which you'll have to pack the data up to preserve contiguity. And seriously, when you need to move half, on average, of your records after each deletion, it pretty much doesn't matter which data structure you use, you're screwed anyway. Just go with dynamic array.
