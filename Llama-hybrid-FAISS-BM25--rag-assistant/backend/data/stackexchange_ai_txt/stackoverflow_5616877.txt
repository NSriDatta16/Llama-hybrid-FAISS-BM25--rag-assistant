So, I tried chuck's suggestion and it gave me an error. I did this to "fix it". I'm sure it could be done more elegantly, but this worked for me. Open up the same file Chuck says to open up, line 50 (or so) should look like this: function js_beautify($js_source_text, $tab_size = 4) change $tab_size to 1 function js_beautify($js_source_text, $tab_size = 1) Now, around line 56 where it says: $tab_string = str_repeat(' ', $tab_size); change the space to a tab like so: $tab_string = str_repeat("\t", $tab_size); That worked for me.
