Is there a way to set HTML5 drag end effect? (i.e. no revert)

When finish dragging a HTML5 draggable element, the element will revert back to its original location. Is it possible to prevent the feedback image to revert? Instead of reverting back, I want the feedback image to disappear after the drag is completed.
