As @Aksakal says, there is nothing weird about this: it is easy to see that the significance level (for a continuous random variable) is equal to the probability of a type I error. So your one-sided and two sided test have the same type I error probability. What differs is the power of the two tests. If you know that the alternative is an increase, then for the same type I error probability, the type II error probability is lower with the one sided test (or the power is higher). In fact, it can be shown that, for a given type I error probability (and in the univariate case), the one sided test is the most powerfull you can find, whatever the alternative is. This is thus the UMPT, the Uniformly Most Powerful Test. It all depends on what you want to test. Assume you want to buy lamps from your supplier and the supplier says that the life time of a lamp is 1000 hours (on average). If you want to test these lamps then you will probably not care if these lamps live longer so you will test $H_0: \mu=1000$ versus $H_1: \mu see also What follows if we fail to reject the null hypothesis?
