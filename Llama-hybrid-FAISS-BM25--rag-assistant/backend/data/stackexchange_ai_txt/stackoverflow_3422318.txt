One idea to achieve this: If the image is 10x10, and your original is 40x40 Loop each pixel in the 10x10, then retrieve the 4 pixels representative of that looped pixel. So for each pixel in the smaller image, find the corresponding scaled amount of pixels in the larger image. You can then take the average colour of the 4 pixels, and compare with the pixel in the smaller image. You can specify error bounds, IE -10% or +10% bounds are considered a match, others are considered a failure. Build up a count of matches and failures and use the bounds to determine if it is considered a match or not. I think this might perform better than scaling the image to the same size and doing a 1pixel:1pixel comparison as I'm not sure how resizing algorithms necesserially work and you might lose some detail which will give less accurate results. Or if there might be different ways and methods of resizing images. But, again I don't know how the resize might work depends on how you go about doing it.
