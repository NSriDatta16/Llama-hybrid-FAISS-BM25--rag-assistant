With a correlation matrix, you are looking only at the pairwise relationships. Regression analysis tells you about the relationships when considering also the other variables. To give a completely made-up example: say that you're interested in predicting the probability of committing a crime. Having a tattoo, in your dataset, strongly correlates with a crime. However, if you consider in regression analysis both having a tattoo and criminal history, the regression parameter for a tattoo may go to zero as it was only a proxy for loosely identifying gang members. Using pairwise correlations alone should not be a reason for including or excluding features from analysis.
