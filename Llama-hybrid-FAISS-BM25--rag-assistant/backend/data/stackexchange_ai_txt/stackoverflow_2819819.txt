Look at http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html . Choose on the left tree "New in Version 3.6" and then "Drag and Drop Rows". If you means "drag a group of selected rows" inside one jqGrid table choose "Sortable Rows" on the same demo page. If you need this feature it can be interesting to look at jqGrid disable sortablerows where I describe how one can allow only selected rows be sortable (per drag a drop)
