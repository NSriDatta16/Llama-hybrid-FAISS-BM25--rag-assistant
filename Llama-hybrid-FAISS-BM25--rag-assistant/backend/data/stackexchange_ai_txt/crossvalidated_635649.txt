Exact Meaning of Controlled Variables in terms of the OLS estimators

Consider a two-regressors linear regression model: $$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2D+u$$ where $X$ is continuous and $D$ is binary. In this case, we say that we have controlled $D$ . Here, I want to know the exact meaning of "controlled". Before I present my idea, consider three estimators. First, let $\widehat{\beta}_1$ be the OLS estimator using the two-regressors model above. Second, let $\widehat{\beta}_{11}$ and $\widehat{\beta}_{10}$ be the OLS estimator using only the sample with $D=1$ and $D=0$ , respectively, based on $$Y=\alpha_0+\alpha_1X+e$$ If $\widehat{\beta}_1$ is a weighted average of $\widehat{\beta}_{11}$ and $\widehat{\beta}_{10}$ , the term "controlled" is quite valid because $\widehat{\beta}_{11}$ and $\widehat{\beta}_{10}$ are estimated while controlling $D$ . But, I am not sure, whether this idea is correct or not.
