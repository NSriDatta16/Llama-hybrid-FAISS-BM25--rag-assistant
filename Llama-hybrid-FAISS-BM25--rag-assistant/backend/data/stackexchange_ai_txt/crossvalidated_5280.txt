Personally, I like introducing linear regression and ANOVA by showing that it is all the same and that linear models amount to partition the total variance: We have some kind of variance in the outcome that can be explained by the factors of interest, plus the unexplained part (called the 'residual'). I generally use the following illustration (gray line for total variability, black lines for group or individual specific variability) : I also like the heplots R package, from Michael Friendly and John Fox, but see also Visual Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models: The heplots Package for R . Standard ways to explain what ANOVA actually does, especially in the Linear Model framework, are really well explained in Plane answers to complex questions , by Christensen, but there are very few illustrations. Saville and Wood's Statistical methods: The geometric approach has some examples, but mainly on regression. In Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments , which mostly focused on DoE, there are illustrations that I like, but see below (these are mine :-) But I think you have to look for textbooks on Linear Models if you want to see how sum of squares, errors, etc. translates into a vector space, as shown on Wikipedia . Estimation and Inference in Econometrics , by Davidson and MacKinnon, seems to have nice illustrations (the 1st chapter actually covers OLS geometry) but I only browse the French translation (available here ). The Geometry of Linear Regression has also some good illustrations. Edit : Ah, and I just remember this article by Robert Pruzek, A new graphic for one-way ANOVA . Edit 2 And now, the granova package (mentioned by @gd047 and associated to the above paper) has been ported to ggplot, see granovaGG with an illustration for one-way ANOVA below.
