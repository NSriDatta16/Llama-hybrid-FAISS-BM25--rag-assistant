Plate notation for a hierarchical regression model (bayesian)

I've been recently studying hierarchical bayesian regressio (with pymc3), and I was wondering, how does the following example: http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/ look like when shown in plate notation? For reference, the model is defined as: $\textrm{radon}_{i} = \alpha_{c}+\beta_{c}*floor_{i,c}+\epsilon_{c}$, where for the final model, $\alpha_{c} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha})$ and $\beta_{c} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\beta},\sigma_{\beta})$, i.e., the coefficients all come from a common group distribution. Thank you!
