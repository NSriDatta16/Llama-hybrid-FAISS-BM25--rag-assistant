Hausman test for GLMMs?

I have a panel data set I'm using to model a binary response. I have developed 3 alternative models: A simple logistic regression, pooling all the observations A conditional logistic regression, stratifying the data by individual (I understand this is the binary equivalent of a fixed effects model) A random effects logistic regression, with a random intercept for each individual The purpose of these models is to establish whether there is a significant trend over time. They do not agree. With a continuous response and true fixed and random effects models, I could use the Hausman test to choose between them. Is there an alternative I can use with these binary response models? In particular in R... There is a similar question on Cross Validated but the answer basically says "always use random effects". There's a question on SO too which adapts a function from plm but has a major disclaimer and I rather suspect it's not a valid approach.
