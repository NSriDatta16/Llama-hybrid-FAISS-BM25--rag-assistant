How to use the chi squared test (a biological investigation)

Imagine four habitats - A, B, C and D - set up in a choice chamber and two species of the same family, X and Y, 20 individuals of each. In a series of experiments, we put these species into the choice chamber - first one group of 20 (of the same species), then the other group of 20 (of the other species) in order to note down their 'choices'. Now imagine that I have the count data of the number of individuals of each species in each quadrant of the choice chamber (mean value calculated after 22 repeats) - how do I use the chi-squared test in this scenario ? Do I use a 4x2 table with my four habitats along the top and my observed and expected values of the two different species in the table? Or do I have to separately calculate the chi squared of both species and their associated with the four habitats? Or do I do something else? It is necessary for me to do some sort of significance test. Essentially, I am interested in commenting on whether species A and/or species B have (potentially different) preferences for any of the four habitats, and if they do, then explaining that preference using biological theory from the existing literature. For a bit more detail on how the data was collected, please see below: I first put 20 individuals of species A into the choice chamber, all at the same time, waited 5 minutes, and then counted how many individuals were in each quadrant. I then took the species out, put them into a rest chamber and put 20 individuals of species B into the chamber and repeated the process for both species 20 times. I was not able to keep track of each individual I put in. I am therefore currently assuming that the data is totally independent each time, and that there were no herding effects, scent trails, 'memory' etc between trials. Once I had my count data (observed values), I then took a mean average for each species. These were (1.000 12.455 3.727 2.818) for species for A and (9.818 2.182 2.273 5.727) for species B. I now wish to analyse these values (or maybe I have to analyse the raw data, not just the mean?). Another thing which has just clicked - will my expected values be 5 (20/4 - assuming even distribution) or would I use the (row total*column total)/(grand total) formula? NB. The same individuals were tested over and over again (with the rest periods in between as described above). Please also note : A lot of these new ideas/clarification have come from a conversation in the comments down below. In that conversation there are also suggestions from other experts who have some ideas on how I might analyse the data - if you wish, please do skim over that conversation below. However, the main points (from my end, at least) have been summarised in this question itself.
