Google Maps API: GClientGeocoder.getLatLng()

I'm using the jQuery plugin http://googlemaps.mayzes.org/ for Google Maps but have had trouble adding markers. Current setup: Show AJAX content in a thickbox, where a map is loaded. The map loads fine, and centers properly to a geocoded address. However, if you add a marker with a geocoded address the Google Maps API errors out with "a is undefined" (relevant code from the plugin) if ( markers[i].geocode ) { var geocoder = new GClientGeocoder(); geocoder.getLatLng(markers[i].geocode, function(center) { if (!center) alert(address + " not found"); else jQuery.googleMaps.marker[i] = new GMarker(center, {draggable: markers[i].draggable, icon: gIcon}); }); } The notable part is geocoder.getLatLng(markers[i].geocode, func... as this is directly calling the maps API, and upon inspection, markers[i].geocode is coming out as my test address ("Australia"). What I'm finding is that if I load the map the first time, it will center the map, but error due to the marker (and not show the UI either). If I close the thickbox and load it up again with a different address/country, the map will load fine, with the UI and centered on the new location with a marker in the old address/country . Closing and opening the thickbox multiple times after this will move the centering, but the marker will always stay in the first address/country. Any ideas?
