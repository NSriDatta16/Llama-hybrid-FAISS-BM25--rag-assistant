Mixed Effects Random Forests (MERFs) are a thing. As the answer above states, there's some great research about them by Dr. Larocque's group at HEC Montreal. The paper is here: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2012.741599 . Essentially it is a theoretically sound way to combine the non-linear modeling of random forests with linear random effects. We just released an open source package in Python implementing MERF using the above algorithm in the paper. We wrote a detailed blog post about the package and how to use it for clustered data sets.
