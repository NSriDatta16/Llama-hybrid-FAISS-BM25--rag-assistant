Calculating log odds of Y = 0 in Logistic Regression Model

For the following variables: DV: YES/NO (1 vs. 0) IV_1: Age IV_2: MALE/FEMALE (1 vs. 0) And co-efficients: (Intercept) -3.70 Age 0.02 Gender 0.17 I know that calculating the log odds of a YES (1) would require: -3.70 + 0.02*Age + 0.17*Gender But how would I calculate the log odds of a NO (0)?
