Given that you are working with Scikit-Learn, this should be fairly simple. Using the PCA decomposition class from sklearn, you will start by fitting your first dataset : from sklearn.decomposition import PCA pca = PCA(n_components=2) pca_X1 = pca.fit_transform(dataset_1_X) Using the pca instance that has just been fitted, you can then go on transforming your other datasets. pca_X2 = pca.transform(dataset_2_X) pca_X3 = pca.transform(dataset_3_X) ... Note the use of pca.transform as opposed to pca.fit_transform . The former will use the components from the first dataset, whereas the latter will refit your other datasets.
