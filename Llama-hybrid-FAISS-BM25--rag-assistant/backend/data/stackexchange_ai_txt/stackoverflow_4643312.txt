$_SERVER['REQUEST_URL'] Sometimes answers are easy :) I found the solution here: http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php by CTRL+F'ing for "query". EDIT As matchu said in the comments, not all servers support REQUEST_URL. In that case I would use the much less elegant strtok($url, '?'); .
