The assumption are mostly correct for Java. They are not necessarily correct for databases, as there are variations. Java handles time zones with Calendar objects. The java.util.Date object always contains the UTC value. Databases generally store and return dates and timestamps (with hour, minutes, etc.) as they are written, regardless of the internal format used by storage. If you store 2010-12-25, you will retrieve the same value regardless of the time zone of the clients or server. Some databases have the TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE data type which stores both the timestamp and the time zone separately. Dates and timestamps are converted between Java and Database, usually in a manner that the subclasses of java.util.Date that are used are interpreted in the JDBC client's time zone.
