After further research, we've learned about WebLogic's Generic File Loading Overrides feature. This feature allows us to use a Deployment Plan for our application and specify a "config-root" for the application. Within the config-root, we can create a directory called "AppFileOverrides" and override any file in the WEB-INF/classes or WEB-INF/lib directories. This feature works by injecting a classloader just in front of the Web Application classloader, thus any resource loaded from the classpath will be found in this classloader before anything bundled into the web application archive. Using this feature, we are able to add configuration files (and in theory, classes) that don't exist in the war file at all. Thus, we are able to mimic the functionality of keeping configuration files outside the war. Moving forward, I'm encouraging our developers to include the configurations inside the war file, but this will work nicely for legacy apps and for situations where we need to change the configuration for a given deployment target (dev vs production)
