I think I've figured out a solution, though why this doesn't just work is beyond me. If you set the zoomScale property, it seems to trigger whatever is needed to allow dragging and scrolling to take place, even if you set the property to 1, which does nothing. I just did this in the initWithFrame: method of the UIScrollView: ... self.zoomScale = 1; ... If anyone else knows of any better or more correct way to do this, or has an explanation for why this happens, I'd like to know.
