To learn how localStorage works and in detail Complete details about LocalStorage is a good source for you to begin with. Just to add I will give you an example which might help you. This is the options.html function save_options() { if(document.getElementById("x").checked == true){localStorage['x_en'] = 1;} if(document.getElementById("x").checked == false){localStorage['x_en'] = 0;} } function restore_options() { var x_opt = localStorage['x_en']; if (x_opt == 0) {document.getElementById('x').checked = false;}else{ var select = document.getElementById('x');select.checked = true; localStorage['x_en'] = 1;} } X To access this you need to have a background.html page which can be as shown below. alert(localStorage['x_en']); //Will alert the localStorage value. If you want to access the localStorage from the Content Script you can't directly access it by the above method. You need to use the concept called Message Passing ( http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/messaging.html ) which can pass the values from the background to content scripts. Just as Sergey said this might be an issue with the typo.
