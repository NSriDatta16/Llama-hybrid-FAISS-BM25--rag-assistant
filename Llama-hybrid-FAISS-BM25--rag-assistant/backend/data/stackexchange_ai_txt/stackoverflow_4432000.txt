As dportas implies in a comment, it is helpful to know what a null value in a particular field means - not what it means in theory, but what it means in your data . I think as long as you are clear what a null means in your table, and if you are sure it only means one thing , you can make an informed pragmatic decision about whether to allow it. Opinion: My rule of thumb is that nullable fields are fine but shouldn't multi-task
