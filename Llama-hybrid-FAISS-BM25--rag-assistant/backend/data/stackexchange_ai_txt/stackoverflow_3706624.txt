remove query string key=value at webserver level (apache/nginx)

I would like to remove fb_xd_fragment from the query string and pass the rest of the request off to the application level. This is for an improved cache hit rate so doing this modification at the application level is not useful nor possible (trust me). Example of how to modify the query string using apache or nginx would be nice. Example input values example.com/abcd?page=2&fb_xd_fragment example.com/abcd?fb_xd_fragment example.com/abcd?fb_xd_fragment&page=4 example.com/abcd?fb_xd_fragment=xyz&page=6 example.com/abcd?page=8&fb_xd_fragement=xyz
