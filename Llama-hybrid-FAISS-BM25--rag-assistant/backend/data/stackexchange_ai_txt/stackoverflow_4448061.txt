here is how I would do it : first, make your CrappyFlowDocument a resource by adding a key to it and putting it in a resource dictionary: in App.xaml: in your CrappyFlowDocument.xaml file: Woo, my first paragraph! then, call it directly as the FlowDocumentScrollViewer's "Document" property: I'm not aware of an easier way to do this, hopefully this will suit your needs
