What kind of machine learning can predict a probability rather than classification?

For example, I want to predict a probability of whether raining tomorrow, and I can't get the prob. of cloudy or sunny...etc day. I only get events(attributes of weather) like temperature, humidity, sunny interval, rainy interval...etc. Train data: temp. -> 80F humidity -> 30% sunny interval -> 5hr rainy interval -> 0hr Label: prob. of rainy tomorrow is 20% Test data example: temp. -> 90F humidity -> 10% sunny interval -> 10hr rainy interval -> 0hr I only can get the prob. of rainy day, so I can't use classification algo. Like above, I want to predict the prob. of rainy tomorrow. I'm not a professional in ML knowledge. I survey many sources and thought the most possible algorithm of ML maybe is regression!?(Cuz it can give me a value like linear regression). But I don't know is there any other algorithms can help me to predict a probability(also can say I want to predict a value)?
