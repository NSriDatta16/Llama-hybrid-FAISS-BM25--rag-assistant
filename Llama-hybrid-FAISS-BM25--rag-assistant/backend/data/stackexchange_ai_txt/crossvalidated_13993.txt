Because all the answers so far are negative (in terms of advocating using less than the full data set or in suggesting limited uses for the two-eye cases), let's see what can be done. For that, we need a probability model. Consider a single response variable, $Y$ (one of V1 through V5, apparently). As a point of departure, suppose the response depends on several factors, including An average or "typical" response $\mu$. A random patient-specific factor, $\varepsilon$, with zero mean. Perhaps an indicator that both eyes were involved, $X_2$. A surgery type factor, $X_s$, which ought to be an attribute of the eye , but which appears to be constant within each patient (thereby limiting our ability to identify this factor). A factor for any systematic difference between the right and the left, $X_e$. For each eye, a random variation from the expected response in that eye, $\delta$, with zero mean and independent of the patient factor $\varepsilon$. It is implicit here that the experiment was designed in certain standard ways: namely, that patients were randomly selected from a specified population; that the determination to treat the left eye, right eye, or both, was either randomized or can be assumed independent of other factors; etc. Changes to these assumptions would require concomitant changes in the model. According to this model, the response expected of eye $j$ ($j \in {\text{right}, \text{left}}$) within patient $i$ is $$Y(i,j) = \mu + \beta_2 X_2(i,j) + \beta_s X_s(i,j) + \beta_e X_e(j) + \varepsilon(i) + \delta(j).$$ This looks like a somewhat complex partially nested mixed model. Fitting the parameters $\mu$, $\beta_2$ and $\beta_s$ can be done with maximum likelihood (or possibly generalized least squares regression). I offer this purely as an illustration, to show how one might profitably think about this problem and arrive at a way to exploit the dataset to the fullest. Some of my assumptions may be incorrect and should be modified; additional interactions may be needed; some thought may be required about how best to handle potential differences between eyes. (It's unlikely there's a universal difference between left and right, but maybe there's a difference related to the patient's dominant eye, for instance.) The point is that there does not appear to be any reason either to limit the analysis to one eye per patient or to use ad hoc analytical methods . Standard methodology appears to be applicable and a good way to use it begins by modeling the experiment.
