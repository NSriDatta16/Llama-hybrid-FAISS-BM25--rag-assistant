Show that an irreducible Markov Chain is always reversible

Suppose we have a Markov chain $X$ , with transition probabilities $T_{ij} = P(X_{n+1}=i\mid X_{n}=j )$ . Let $(Y_{1}, Y_{2}, .., Y_{N})$ represent the reversed Markov chain of $X$ , such that $Y_{n} = X_{N-n}$ . Then, $$P(Y_{n+1}=j \mid Y_{n}=i) = T_{ij}\frac{P(Y_{n+1}=j)}{P(Y_{n}=i)}.$$ I understand that this result holds if X is homogeneous and is irrelevant whether X is irreducible. If $X$ is an irreducible Markov chain then $T_{ij}^{(n)} \geq 0$ for each possible pair $i, j$ such that $i \neq j$ , for some integer $n$ . Should one use the idea of detailed balance to show the result that an irreducible (but not necessarily homogeneous) chain must be reversible? I am unsure if the above homogeneous case helps any explanation in the context of the irreducible case. Thank you in advance for your help and thoughts.
