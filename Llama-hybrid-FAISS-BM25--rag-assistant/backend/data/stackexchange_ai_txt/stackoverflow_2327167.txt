There's a couple ways I could see handling this. 1) Do another AJAX call upon submission that does the validations and returns w/o a full post. It's not an elegant solution since it involves two round trips and depending on the validations would lead to performance issues. 2) When you return the json that is used for extending the form, have it instead turn 2 sets of json objects. The first set of objects would represent the data you're currently using. The second set in the array would represent the validation logic which you can then apply however you need upon the form's creation. Neither way is truly elegant; however, the latter provides a way minimize round trips to do the validation.
