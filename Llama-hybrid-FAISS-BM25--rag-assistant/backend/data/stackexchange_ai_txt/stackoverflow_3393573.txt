Hide content after 3 paragraphs

Working with an API that spits out the contents in p tags ... but it gets too long. Thinking of hiding them upon reaching a limit of 400 characters, but that's not a good idea since there is a possibility of it cutting through a HTML tag. So I'm trying to hide the rest of the content after 3 paragraphs instead and with a text "Read More" that will unhide the rest of the content. How would one accomplish this?
