How do I pass a Range to a Sub in Word VBA?

I know this sounds simple, but seemingly it is not. If I write this in Word VBA, it always says "incompatible types" - why? And how do I make it work? Sub GetRange() Dim r As Range Set r = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(5).Range ProcessRange (r) End Sub Sub ProcessRange(r As Range) Debug.Print "This generates an error (incompatible types)- why?" End Sub
