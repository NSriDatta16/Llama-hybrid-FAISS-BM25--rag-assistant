How to interpret this pmf and likelihood? From 'The Bayesian Choice by Christian Robert

I'm having some difficulties in understanding the definitions in the following example: How do we interpret the pmf and the likelihood? is it always 1/3? If so, then why the branching out for values of theta? Berger and Wolpert (1988) is compilation of lecture notes, and I have no access to it. Also what's the meaning of $\mathbb{N}^*$? I've never seen this notation. This example is from ' The Bayesian Choice ' by Christian Robert. Any help would be appreciated.
