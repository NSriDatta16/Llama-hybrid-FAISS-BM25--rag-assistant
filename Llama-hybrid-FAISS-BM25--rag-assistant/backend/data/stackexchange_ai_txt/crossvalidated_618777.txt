Proving consistent/inconsistency of a fusion of KF estimates

I have a distributed fusion scenario with a single target where two sensor nodes $i,j$ estimate the true state $\mathbf{x}$ using a local Kalman filter. The (linear, Gaussian) measurement errors of both the nodes can be assumed to be indpendent. The local estimates $(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{P}_i)$ , $(\mathbf{x}_j, \mathbf{P}_j)$ (which now have correlated estimation errors) are fused together using a Kalman filter, generating the fused estimate, \begin{align} \mathbf{P}_f = ( \mathbf{P}^{-1}_i + \mathbf{P}^{-1}_j )^{-1}\\ \mathbf{x}_f = \mathbf{P}_f (\mathbf{P}^{-1}_i\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{P}^{-1}_j\mathbf{x}_j) \end{align} The fused estimate using a standard KF in this case is proven to be inconsistent since it ignores the cross-correlation between the two estimates. I'm looking for a theoretical proof that the estimate is inconsistent . Practically, I can setup a Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the normalized estimation error squared (NEES) and show that the average NEES is not $\chi^2$ distributed with $n$ degrees of freedom (within the confidence regions). This will help in proving that estimators with the following structures are consistent, \begin{align} \mathbf{P}_f = ( \mathbf{P}^{-1}_i + \mathbf{P}^{-1}_j - \Gamma^{-1} )^{-1}\\ \mathbf{x}_f = \mathbf{P}_f (\mathbf{P}^{-1}_i\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{P}^{-1}_j\mathbf{x}_j - \Gamma^{-1}\gamma) \end{align} with some bounds on $(\Gamma, \gamma)$ .
