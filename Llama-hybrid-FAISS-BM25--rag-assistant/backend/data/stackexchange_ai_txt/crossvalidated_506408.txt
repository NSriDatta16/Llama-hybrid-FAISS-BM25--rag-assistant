Suppose that we want to study the height of men $X$ in Canada for the last 2 years. Assume also that $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ with $\sigma^2$ known. Then, talking about the probability \begin{equation*} P(X>1.80)=P(\omega \in \Omega:X(\omega)>1.80) \end{equation*} that a random man from Canada has a height more than $1.80$ makes sense, because $X$ is a random variable. On the other hand, talking about the probability \begin{equation*} \hspace{10mm} P(\mu>1.80)=P(\omega\in \Omega:\mu(\omega)>1.80) \hspace{4mm}(?) \end{equation*} that the average height of men in Canada is more than $1.80$ does not make sense, because the actual parameter is equal to a fixed number and it is not a random variable (if for example we knew that $\mu=1.75$ , then $P(\mu>1.80)=0$ , because $\mu=1.75$ ). The average height of men in Canada for the last 2 years is a unique number; it is not possible that the average height of any population takes more than one value. Similarly, if $\{X_1,...,X_n\}$ are i.i.d. random variables from $X$ , then $\overline{X}_n=\frac{X_1+...+X_n}{n}$ is also a random variable, so talking about the probability \begin{equation*} P\Big(\overline{X}_n \in \Big[\mu-z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\mu+z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big ] \Big)=0.95 \end{equation*} makes sence, while talking about the probability \begin{equation*} P\Big(\mu \in \Big[\overline{X}_n-z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\overline{X}_n+z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big ] \Big) \end{equation*} does not, because $\mu$ is not a random variable (we could only say that the last probability is either 1 or 0, because $\mu$ is either contained in the interval or not). However, the probability \begin{equation*} P\Big(\overline{X}_n \in \Big[\mu-z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\mu+z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big ] \Big)=0.95 \end{equation*} means that, if we take a random sample $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ of heights many times and estimate the empirical average height $\overline{x}=\frac{x_1+...+x_n}{n}$ each time, then $\overline{x}$ will be contained in the intervals \begin{equation*} \overline{x} \in \Big[\mu -z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\mu+z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big ] \end{equation*} approximately $95\%$ of these times. Equivalently, taking a random sample $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ from $X$ many times, $\mu$ will be contained in the intervals \begin{equation*} \mu \in \Big[\overline{x} -z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\overline{x}+z_{a/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big ] \end{equation*} $95\%$ of these times. Note that, each time we take a different sample $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ from $X$ , the confidence interval changes, since its center $\overline{x}=\frac{x_1+...+x_n}{n}$ does. However, the percentage of times that $\mu$ is contained in these different confidence intervals will still be approximately $95 \%$ .
