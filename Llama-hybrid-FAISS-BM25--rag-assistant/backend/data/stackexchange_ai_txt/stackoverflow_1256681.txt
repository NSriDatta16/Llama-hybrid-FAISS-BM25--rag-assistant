Are you set on only having a single set of UI code on all platforms? I would encourage you to consider two separate UIs with a common core, there's really no substitute for a native UI. In this case, you could go Winforms/WPF in C# for the Windows UI, Cocoa in ObjC for the OS X UI, GTK in C# for the Linux UI. All of these would use a common C# core capable of running on Mono and .NET. Mono makes it relatively painless to use with ObjC.
