Forecasting using PC-VAR

I am trying to forecast an index by using a PC-VAR. When performing the PCA, can I exclude the response variable from the dataset and find the PCs and later build a VAR with the response variable and selected PCâ€™s which explain a descent amount of the variation (say 2 PCs).
