After looking at it,the scenario seems to be same like me.What I faced for the first time when doing Tab+Navigation. I am sure that there is some problem with your Tab+Navigation based application. Although it shows the Tab as well as navigation are not able to navigate the basic flow.And it is very difficult to solve your problem with such less code. Instead of this, I had an alternate solution for the same: Once you have a tab bar in a XIB, the easiest way to approach this is to drag a UINavigationController object over from the Library window (looks like a left nav bar button on a gold background) into the Tree View for your tab bar (the text only view, not the GUI). Place it under the tab bar, then drag your existing view controller under the tab bar controller instead of under the tab bar. When you go to view that tab you should then see a navigation bar on the top of it... if you are loading the navigation controller from another xib, you'll modify the nav bar in the tab bar xib. else you can below you can follow the best url for the same: http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2yYlm_2ktFYC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=navigation+with+the+tab+based+application+iphoneSDK&source=bl&ots=nf2YYjX5Am&sig=COpHj9wOtsDChQBglpsljSTsElw&hl=en&ei=3ZoFTeGSOI_tsgbc_Iz6CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBnPfAtswgw Hope this will surely solve your problem.
