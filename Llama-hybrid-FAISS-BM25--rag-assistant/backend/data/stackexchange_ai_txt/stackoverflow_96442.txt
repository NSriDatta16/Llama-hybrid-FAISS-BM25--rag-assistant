We were just discussing some of the aspects of C++ and OO at lunch, someone (a great engineer actually) was saying that unless you have a really strong programming background before you learn C++, it will literally ruin you. I highly recommend learning another language first, then shifting to C++ when you need it. It's not like there is anything great about pointers, they are simply a vestigial piece left over from when it was difficult for a compiler convert operations to assembly efficiently without them. These days if a compiler can't optimize an array operation better then you can using pointers, your compiler is broken. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying C++ is horrible or anything and don't want to start an advocacy discussion, I've used it and use it occasionally now, I'm just recommending you start with something else. It's really NOT like learning to drive a manual car then easily being able to apply that to an automatic, it's more like learning to drive on one of those huge construction cranes then assuming that will apply when you start to drive a car--then you find yourself driving your car down the middle of the street at 5mph with your emergency lights on. [edit] reviewing that last paragraph--I think that may have been my most accurate analogy ever!
