Calculate the average rate of population increase per decade of a country

The population of a country increased by 20% in the first decade, 30% in the second decade and 45% in the third decade. What is the average rate of increase per decade in the population? The answer is 31.28. The best I got was near 30 when I took the geometric mean $(20\times30\times45)^{1/3}$ but obviously it's incorrect. Please explain briefly your answers thank you!
