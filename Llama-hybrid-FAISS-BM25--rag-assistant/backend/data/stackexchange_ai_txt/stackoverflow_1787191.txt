Generate all of them? In your first case you have a total of 35 characters per a position. Total storage is (base^positions) - 1 so your total number of combinations on the low end is 36^9 - 1 or 101,559,956,668,415 which is nearly a TB if the codes are one byte long...which they are not. And that's at the low end. The best system is to pre-generate batches of valid numbers and feed these into the insertions. If the method of generation is semi-random then You can do this easily by dividing the random spaces using segments of the bit array. But you don't mention how random is random. Of course if you have complete control over the randomness then you could just use UUIDs, which is what we do.
