If you only use random state for test/train split then I don't think it matters for future inference. You don't even need that to run the inference. If you use random state on multiple place in the training pipeline, then it depends on your actual usage. For Random Forest, all the trees are fixed after training so there is no random factor in inference. Therefore, random state is not important anymore.
