What is standing in the way of pulsed neural networks being used in applications?

Pulsed or Spiking neural networks incorporate more of the membrane dynamics of biological neurons, where pulses carry information to the next layer. The neurons do not necessarily have to "fire" all at the same time, as they would in a backprop, for example. Yet, there seem to be barriers against employing these models for machine learning problems. What specific issues stand in the way of machine learning practitioners using models that are more biologically realistic?
