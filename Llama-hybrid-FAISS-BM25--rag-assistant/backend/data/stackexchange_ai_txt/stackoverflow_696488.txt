Tunneling is a general term that refers to the encapsulation of one protocol within another. Usually TCP/IP is transported over a lower-level transport (such as Ethernet). One can, however use a higher-level protocol (such as SSH) as a base for transporting TCP/IP. This means that the protocols are nested: (native) TCP/IP transports SSH SSH transports (tunneled) TCP/IP This may look useless and complex at first, but allows one to leverage the advantages of a high-level protocol (for example encryption for SSH) using a lower-level protocol (such as TCP/IP). Note that VPNs are usually implemented using some kind of tunneling.
