why does posterior prediction involve integration over all parameter space?

The primary objective of Bayesian inference is to compute the posterior. For instance, if the posterior $p(\theta | x)$ is known then the expectation $\mathbb{E}$ of the test function $\tau(x)$ under the posterior $p(\theta | x)$ can be computed like $E[\tau | x] = \int d\theta \tau(\theta) p(\theta | x)$ . To make a prediction $x'$ from the data distribution $p(x | \theta)$ , assuming $x'$ and $x$ are independent to each other, the posterior predictive distribution of $x'$ is $p(x' | x) = \int d\theta p(x' | x, \theta) p(\theta | x) = \int d\theta p(x' | \theta) p(\theta | x)$ . How should I convince myself on an intuitive level the necessity for the integration over all $\theta$ in order to compute the predictive posterior?
