Create versions in eclipse using local history

Is it possible to leverage eclipses built-in local history to create and save versions. I find local history very useful, but if I could restore the whole project to a previous state that would be even better. I've considered using version management, but it seems unnecessary as I am the only person working on my project. And I could really benefit from the ability to name my (local history) versions instead of having to go by date. Thanks, Lemiant
