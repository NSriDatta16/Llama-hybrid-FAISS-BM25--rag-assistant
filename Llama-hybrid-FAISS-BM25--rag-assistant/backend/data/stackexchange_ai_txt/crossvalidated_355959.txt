Just in case anyone is interested: yes, it is possible to replace the RNN layers by Dilated Convolutions (DCs). The architectures described in speech recognition literature did not work out of the box for HTR, but with some modifications results got better. I will give a short summary. The NN contains CNN layers and a final CTC layer. In between, I integrated DCs. I grouped layers of DCs into blocks: each block has a layer with a sampling rate of 1, 2 and 4. Each kernel has size 3x3. The kernel weights (k1, k2, k4) across blocks are shared. The tested NN contains 2 blocks, and all intermediate outputs (o1, o2, ..., o6) are concatenated to form a large feature matrix. Finally, for each time-step the features are mapped to all possible characters, which are then fed into the CTC layer.
