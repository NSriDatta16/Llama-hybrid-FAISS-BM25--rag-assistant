The number 500,000 on its own isn't determinative because the size (in terms of computation power) of each transaction is not known, but assuming it defines a very heavy load, although a properly configured Windows cluster could handle that, I think you will find many organizations are more comfortable on *nix systems in production for that kind of load (at least in my geographic area), where things that you don't think much about in development (such as simultaneous network connections) come into play, so that may need to play into your considerations. This system will be maintained by someone. Are they agnostic about Windows vs. Linux or Unix? I think that will be the first driving factor here. If you truly have freedom with regards to the OS this will be deployed on, then either technology will get the job done, or fail to if not done right.
