Regression curve changed a lot (in the same situation) after a new variable is added into the logistic regression model training

I have a trained logistic regression model with 5 input variables. Then I added another new input variable and used all of them (6 input variables) to train a new logistic regression model. With the obtained coefficients, I got two values based on the logistic function when the inputs are given. Next, I set the new variable as 0 while the other 5 input variables are all the same. Theoretically, the two values will be close since they are in the exactly same condition. According to the equation of logistic regression: probability=1/(1+EXP(-l)), where l=a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x4+a5x5+a6x6. I can get the coefficients of a0 to a6 by regression. When x1 to x6 are given specific values, the probability P1 can be calculated through the above equation. Then, I added a new variable x7 into the model. So for the new model, I have new coefficients of a0 to a7. Now I give the same value of x1 to x6 in the new equation and x7=0. This is the second probability value P2. In general, P1 should be close to P2, but in my result, they are not. I try to use this method to check my model with the new variable. But the result shows they have an obvious difference. All the calculation part is correct. So I wonder if it is because of the logistic regression method.
