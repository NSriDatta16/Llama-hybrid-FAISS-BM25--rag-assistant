No such file to load -- tasks/facebooker

WORKING UPDATE to solve this problem, I simply dragged the tasks/facebooker folder into lib from the venders/facebooker/lib/ directory. The migrations now function. I have a fully tested and working Rails app that won't deploy. Its running facebooker and working with restful authentication. In Capistrano I am getting the following message: latest => /home/fogonthedowns/blog.justinzollars.com/releases/20100710053254 * executing "cd /home/fogonthedowns/blog.justinzollars.com/releases/20100710053254; rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate" servers: ["blog.justinzollars.com"] [blog.justinzollars.com] executing command ** [out :: blog.justinzollars.com] (in /home/fogonthedowns/blog.justinzollars.com/releases/20100710053254) ** [out :: blog.justinzollars.com] rake aborted! ** [out :: blog.justinzollars.com] no such file to load -- tasks/facebooker ** [out :: blog.justinzollars.com] /home/fogonthedowns/blog.justinzollars.com/releases/20100710053254/Rakefile:9 ** [out :: blog.justinzollars.com] (See full trace by running task with --trace) command finished The file tasks/facebooker exists, (see comment below), why won't Capistrano complete this deployment?
