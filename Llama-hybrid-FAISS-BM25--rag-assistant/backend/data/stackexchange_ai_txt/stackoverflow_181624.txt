C++: what regex library should I use?

I'm working on a commercial (not open source) C++ project that runs on a linux-based system. I need to do some regex within the C++ code. (I know: I now have 2 problems.) QUESTION: What libraries do people who regularly do regex from C/C++ recommend I look into? A quick search has brought the following to my attention: 1) Boost.Regex (I need to go read the Boost Software License, but this question is not about software licenses) 2) C (not C++) POSIX regex (#include , regcomp, regexec, etc.) 3) http://freshmeat.net/projects/cpp_regex/ (I know nothing about this one; seems to be GPL, therefore not usable on this project)
