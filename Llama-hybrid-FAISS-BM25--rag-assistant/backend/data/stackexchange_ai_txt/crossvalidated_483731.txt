SPSS GEE: which type of model to select?

I would like to conduct a GEE analysis (repeated measures logistic regression) but I am not sure whether my data allows me to run a GEE Binary Logistic Model or if I should use GEE Binomial Identity Model (custom). My participants took a pre-test then learned words and were tested on the same words again. My dependent variable = score on posttest/word (0 or 1) (words already known on pre-test are left empty) My subject variable = participant My within-subject variable = words Predictors: two categoricals and one scale (that characterized words) + 1 scale (that characterized participants). Here is what my data looks like: I want to know whether words that have the value 1 for the predictors are more likely to be learned than words that have value 0... Can someone help please? Is it allowed to use a Binary Logistic in this case? Thanks!
