How should I deal with features with time related values in Bayesian network?

I would like to apply Bayesian network on some data. However, some of the variables are related to time. E.g. Number of time he/she visit library. As the value can be defined as Total number of this person visits, Average weekly number of he/she visit, Daily number of visits, or even Number of visits in the last 3 days etc... I do not want to include all these different variations in my network Then how should I treat feature like this properly? Many thanks for your help
