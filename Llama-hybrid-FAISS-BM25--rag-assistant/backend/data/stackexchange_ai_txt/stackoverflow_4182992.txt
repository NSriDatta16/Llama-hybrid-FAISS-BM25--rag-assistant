How to force ImageMagick to produce single output image?

I'm trying to convert tiff file to jpg in bash script, although I get 3 jpeg files (good, average and poor quality, I assume, same image) instead of one. Here's an example of command: convert -resize 200x200 -quality 90 "$CURRENT_DIR/$i" "$OP/$WITHOUT_EXT.thumb.jpg" I've also tried without resize and quality params, but result is still the same. Is it possible to get a single output file? Thank you!
