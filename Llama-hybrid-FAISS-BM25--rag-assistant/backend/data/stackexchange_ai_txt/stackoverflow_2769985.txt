I don't think the accepted answer is an elegant approach. The possible problem here is that Chev is reading Events from the database and then assigning a new EventItem list to the EventItems property. NHibernate throws this exception when you just ignore the previous children list and assign a new children list. What you need to do here is, If you want to discard the old EventItems , do this instead: events.EventItems.Clear(); events.EventItems.Add(new EventItem { blah blah });
