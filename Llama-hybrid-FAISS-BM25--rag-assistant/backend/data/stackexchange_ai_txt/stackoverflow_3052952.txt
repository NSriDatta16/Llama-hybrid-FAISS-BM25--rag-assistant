How does Apache Cassandra do aggregate operations?

I'm fairly new to Apache Cassandra and nosql in general. In SQL I can do aggregate operations like: SELECT country, sum(age) / count(*) AS averageAge FROM people GROUP BY country; This is nice because it is calculated within the DB, rather than having to move every row in the 'people' table into the client layer to do the calculation. Is this possible in Apache Cassandra? How?
