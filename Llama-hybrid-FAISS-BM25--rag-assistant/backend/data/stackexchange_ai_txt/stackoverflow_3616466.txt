You need to sample texture at current pixel coordinates, something like this vec4 pixel_color = texture2D(tex, gl_TexCoord[0].xy); Note,- as i've seen texture2D is deprecated in GLSL 4.00 specification - just look for similar texture... fetch functions. Also sometimes it is better to supply your own pixel coordinates instead of gl_TexCoord[0].xy - in that case write vertex shader something like: varying vec2 texCoord; void main(void) { gl_Position = vec4(gl_Vertex.xy, 0.0, 1.0 ); texCoord = 0.5 * gl_Position.xy + vec2(0.5); } And in fragment shader use that texCoord variable instead of gl_TexCoord[0].xy. Good luck.
