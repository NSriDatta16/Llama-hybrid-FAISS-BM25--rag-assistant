It's fairly obvious that the distribution of outcomes are integer valued and you have some sort of positive relationship between the outcome and the predictor of interest. That creates the stratified "downward sloping" lines in the residuals. Luckily, residual plots are practically irrelevant. It comes as no surprise given that these residuals are produced from a logistic regression which models the risk of a binary outcome. Residuals from a logistic regression make 0 sense except for calculation of a Brier score for risk prediction. More specifically, your x-axis is "expected values" that are on the log-odds scale $\mbox{logit}(\pi)$. whereas the outcome is on the risk scale, $\pi$. So in particular, these residuals should have a slight S curve shape to them, but the variability in the distribution of your exposures is not great enough to drive that association. Hence, they appear approximately linear.
