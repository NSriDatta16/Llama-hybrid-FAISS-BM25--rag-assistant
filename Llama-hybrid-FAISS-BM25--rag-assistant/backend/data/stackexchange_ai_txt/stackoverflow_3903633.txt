If you just want to use the editing components (bold, italic, etc. such as the ones above this answer form) then a good option is to use TinyMCE. It's free, cross-browser compatible and available here: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ . It's made in javascipt (a jQuery version is available), and what it does is wrap words (or characters) in html friendly tags, such as for bold, for italic etc. When you want to change colours or the like the selection will be put in a tag, so will not break your paragraph flow. The total selection of options is very large, but can be customised to your wishes. I personally recommend it, as its the best way to allow clients to edit content and save it in the database correctly.
