There is a new tool called Helical Insight which is a open source BI tool using which you can create charts, reports, dashboards & various data visualizations. Using this you can create reports in 2 ways: Self service BI & Instant BI. In Self service BI you drag n drop columns which you want, add filters to ultimately create insights. 'Instant BI' is a feature in which you can type any business question and get instant insights accordingly. As far as data visualization is concerned, you can have inbuilt simple charts, scientific charts & also it is very to embed your own chart in it. Visit www.helicalinsight.com
