Running TFS 2008 build definitions with TFS 2010

I am in the process of upgrading my builds from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010, and in the meanwhile, I am using the Upgrade template to use the TFS 2008 build definitions. I have installed both a build controller and build agent on the machine that used to run previous builds while I was on TFS 2008. The said machine still has TFS 2008 build service installed. It seems like the first Import target causes the following error, but I can't figure out how to resolve it (the file path is from the machine running the upgrade template on TFS 2010. C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\TeamBuild\Microsoft.TeamFoundation .Build.targets (278): The "Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Tasks.GetBuildProperties" task could not be loaded from the assembly C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010\Tools\\Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Tasks.dll. Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010\Tools\ Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Tasks.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. Confirm that the declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.' I have tried the solution offered in here , but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
