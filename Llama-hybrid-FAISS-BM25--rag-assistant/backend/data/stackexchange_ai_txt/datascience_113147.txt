I would like to know from the data science community here for suggestions on nlp courses. I am new to NLP area and would like to take up a course which covers from basic to advanced concepts such as tokenization to embeddings, GPT-3, transformers etc My aim is to become a Applied NLP expert (and I don't intend to invent any new algos). So, basically am trying to find a course where they can teach us existing algos, recent advancements, variety of use-cases etc in NLP Is there any courses that you would recommend?
