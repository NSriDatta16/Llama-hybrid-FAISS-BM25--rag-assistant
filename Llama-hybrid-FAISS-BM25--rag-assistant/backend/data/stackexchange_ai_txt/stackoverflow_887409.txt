I know that there's cool stuff around such as setDragImage in HTML5 but I want to provide a generic abstraction for native DD between browsers. But why do something like this, aren't there libraries like JQuery & Prototype available for cross browser drag & drop? Or else if you want to implement a DD library of your own, you can take help of their methods or extend them, as both the libraries are following object oriented paradigm. This will save much time.
