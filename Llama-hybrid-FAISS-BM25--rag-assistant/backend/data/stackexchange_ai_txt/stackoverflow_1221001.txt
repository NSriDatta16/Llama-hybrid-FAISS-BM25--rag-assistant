You can move directories several ways. The easiest way is to right mouse drag the directory and click "SVN Move versioned files here" when you drop. You can use the rename function to rename a file from "blah.js" to "mydirectory/blah.js". Lastly, you can use the commit window and drag items within there before you commit. A small red dot appears beside the checkbox when a file is set to be moved.
