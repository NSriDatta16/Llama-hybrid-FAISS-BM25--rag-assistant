Regex matching problem

I don't know how to write such a regex. I will start with example. My bad regex: (\d*),?(\d*\.?\d*)-?(\d*\.?\d*),?([0-1]?),?([0-1]?),?([^\/]*) Matches that are OK: 1,2-3,1,1,asdf 1,2-3,1,1 1,2-3,1 1,2-3 1,2 1 But unfortunately this will also be matched and I don't want it to be: asdf 1,asdf Ideally, I would like something like - match, if previous groups was matched. I know that probably positive look behind should be used, but if I'm not wrong, it should be used right in front each group, except 1st and regex would be large and smelly after that. Um, and it would probably be variable length. Is there any elegant way to do that? EDIT I want to match all lines given below Matches that are OK . I would like to match \d* to first group. Then, if there was a match to \d* followed by , , I would like to match (\d*\.?\d*) to second group. After that, if there was a match in first group followed by , and match in second group followed by - I would like to match another (\d*\.?\d*) ... etc. to the end of Regex.
