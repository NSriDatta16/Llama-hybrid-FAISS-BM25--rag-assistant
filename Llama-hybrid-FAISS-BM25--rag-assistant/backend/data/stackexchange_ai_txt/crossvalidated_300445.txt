multi-class in any SVM package (including e1071) is either one vs one or one vs many. From the e1071 manual : For multiclass-classification with k levels, k>2, libsvm uses the ‘one-against-one’-approach, in which k(k-1)/2 binary classifiers are trained; the appropriate class is found by a voting scheme. SVMs are inherently two-class classifiers. They are not designed for multi-class classification so you have to do a voting scheme using one-vs-one or one-vs-many strategy.
