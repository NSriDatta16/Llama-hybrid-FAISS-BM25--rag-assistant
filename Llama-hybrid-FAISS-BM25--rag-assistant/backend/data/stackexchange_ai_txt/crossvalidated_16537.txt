Determine gradient from past samples

Again this question may be simple for you, but it is an important aspect for my classification problem. Let`s say I have 5 attributes, which are: - previous_value_1 - previous_value_2 - previous_value_3 - previous_value_4 - previous_value_5 These attributes are generated with independent events, but I want to combine them for my classifiers therefore I need a way or statistical method to reach that goal. These, values are actually samples that if a process is improving or getting worse. Therefore, taking average of them is meaningless, I need them to generate a function and take its derivative. But, I do not know statistical counterpart for that operation or may be simpler way to do this. To sum up, I need a way to combine these attribute values as one, and that new attribute should indicate whether it is going up or down. I hope I managed to make some details clear to get an answer. Also, many thanks in advance.
