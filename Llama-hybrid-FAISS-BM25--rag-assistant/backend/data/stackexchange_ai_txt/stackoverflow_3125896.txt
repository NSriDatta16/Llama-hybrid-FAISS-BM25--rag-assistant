static would be very very bad here. Data-context does not play nicely with threading, plis you want to throw it away each time to avoid overuse. You could use a static property that relates to the current http context. That might make sense. Then it is just a public static property. Many people prefer things like IOC and instance-based contexts, however; or contexts that sit behind the storage interface. The choice is yours. Note: another option is thread-static, but it should not be assumed that all of your request is serviced by the same thread. So don't do that either.
