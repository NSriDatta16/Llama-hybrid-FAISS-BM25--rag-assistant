Niels, Leverage reflection (as suggested by JDunkerley) is one approach to the problem. Another you might consider is implementing an interface: Create an interface that includes your method. Implement the interface in your master page From your control, reference this.Page.Master via the interface type. Call your method. This is a better OO approach, leads to less coupling, and will certainly perform better than runtime reflection. I hope this helps!
