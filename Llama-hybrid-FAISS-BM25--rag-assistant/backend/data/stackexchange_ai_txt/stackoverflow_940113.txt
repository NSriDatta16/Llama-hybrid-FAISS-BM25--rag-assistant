MS Word Ole Automation, ADO and foreign characters

I'm trying to export WideString texts from the database (ADO / MS Access) to the MS Word document (Delphi 7), but foreign characters are not correctly transferred (i.e. " è " instead of " č "): while not ADOQuery1.Eof do begin WordApplication1.Selection.TypeText(ADOQuery1Text.AsVariant); // TWideStringField WordApplication1.Selection.TypeParagraph; ADOQuery1.Next; end; I've also tried to use CreateOleObject() directly, but no difference. What am I missing? Thanks!
