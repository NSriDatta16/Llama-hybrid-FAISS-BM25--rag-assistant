You can only do this with a saturated model, i.e., one with only categorical predictors that all fully interact with each other so that there are as many coefficients as there are cells of the design matrix. Otherwise, the logistic regression makes smoothing assumptions (i.e., that certain odds ratios are equal) that are not reflected in the contingency table itself.
