more wacky JavaScript shenanigans coming to mind

I just read through Mike Koss on Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript . He briefly talks about sub-classing and touches on "an alternate sub-classing paradigm". After this example, Koss writes... Unfortunately, this technique does not allow for the use of the instanceof operator to test for membership of a super-class. But, we have the added benefit that we can derive from more than one super class (multiple inheritance) ... and it got me thinking. The idea of multiple inheritance seems cool! So I have two sets of questions: Is the idea of multiple inheritance practical? Is it actually practiced? Any advantages or disadvantages? How would I override the instanceof operator to extend its functionality to multiple inheritance?
