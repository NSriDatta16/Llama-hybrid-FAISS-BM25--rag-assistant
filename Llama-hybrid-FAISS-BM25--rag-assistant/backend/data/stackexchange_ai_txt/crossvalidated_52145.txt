Smoothing with fda package when time grids differ

In fda package, function smooth.basis is used to construct a functional data object by smoothing data using a roughness penalty. The usage can be found here . smooth.basis(argvals=1:n, y, fdParobj, wtvec=NULL, fdnames=NULL, covariates=NULL, method="chol", dfscale=1, returnMatrix=FALSE) In the documentation, it said argvals: Argument values can even vary from one variable to another, in which case they are input as an array with dimensions corresponding to observation points, curves and variables, respectively. Note, however, that the number of observation points per curve and per variable may NOT vary. If it does, then curves and variables must be smoothed individually rather than by a single call to this function. My question is how to set it up to use the function when we have subjects with different number of observations observed at different time series. For example, subject 1 has 10 observations at time week 1 to week 10, but subject 2 has only 5 observations at week 1.5, week 2.5, week 3.5, week 4.5, week 5.5. Do I need to use the same basis system like b-spline to smooth two curves to make them comparable or consistent? Can anyone give me some examples to illustrate it?
