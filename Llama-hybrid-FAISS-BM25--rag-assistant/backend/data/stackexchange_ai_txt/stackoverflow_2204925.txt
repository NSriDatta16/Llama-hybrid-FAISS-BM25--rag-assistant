How does overlayViewTouched notification work in the MoviePlayer sample code

I have a question regarding the MoviePlayer sample code provided by apple. I don't understand how the overlayViewTouch notification works. The NSlog message I added to it does not get sent when I touch the view (not button). // post the "overlayViewTouch" notification and will send // the overlayViewTouches: message - (void)overlayViewTouches:(NSNotification *)notification { NSLog(@"overlay view touched"); // Handle touches to the overlay view (MyOverlayView) here... } I can, however, get the NSlog notification if I place it in -(void)touchesBegan in "MyOverlayView.m". Which makes me think it is recognizing touches but not sending a notification. // Handle any touches to the overlay view - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; if (touch.phase == UITouchPhaseBegan) { NSLog(@"overlay touched(from touchesBegan") // IMPORTANT: // Touches to the overlay view are being handled using // two different techniques as described here: // // 1. Touches to the overlay view (not in the button) // // On touches to the view we will post a notification // "overlayViewTouch". MyMovieViewController is registered // as an observer for this notification, and the // overlayViewTouches: method in MyMovieViewController // will be called. // // 2. Touches to the button // // Touches to the button in this same view will // trigger the MyMovieViewController overlayViewButtonPress: // action method instead. NSNotificationCenter *nc = [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]; [nc postNotificationName:OverlayViewTouchNotification object:nil]; } } Can anyone shed light on what I am missing or doing wrong? Thank you.
