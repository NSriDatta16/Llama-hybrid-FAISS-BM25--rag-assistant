Variables significant when changing reference category?

I'm doing a research about risk tolerance and demographic factors using a logistic regression. When I first included generation (Z Y X BB) in my model with the baseline of BB, Z Y X yield insignificant result. When I changed the reference category to Z, the other generations: Y X BB were all significant at 1%. Can anyone tell me why and how should I deal with this problem?
