How to perform a meta-analysis of studies without a control group?

I want to meta-analyse some studies which I've already collected and review. However, the studies did not used control groups, due to the types of questions used. How can I do the meta-analysis or which software can I use? Briefly my problem is as follows: I reviewed studies which the goal was to evaluate the perception of certain samples of their own behaviour. For each study, the proportion of the sample which claims to adopt the behaviour in analysis, is equivalent to the effect size. Do you have any idea how can I determine the average effect size? Thank you
