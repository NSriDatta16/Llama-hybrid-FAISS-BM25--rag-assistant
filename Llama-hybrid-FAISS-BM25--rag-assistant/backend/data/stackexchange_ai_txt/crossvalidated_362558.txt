Looks like you have a very small data set. It may behoove you to use some form of data augmentation ; it would greatly improve your model's performance and assist with the imbalance in your data set. Using data augmentation, you can over sample those classes (i.e. A, C) with smaller number of samples to balance out your data set. This may not completely fix the weighting problem, but should give you a good start. This technical report describes some benefits of data augmentation, see: The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning
