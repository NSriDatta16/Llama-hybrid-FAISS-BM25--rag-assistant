A union allows you to “recycle” the same area of memory for different types of variables. Generally the union takes as much storage as its single largest member, in this case probably 4 floats. You can check with sizeof . In this case the union is probably used to provide 1) alternative names for the same floats in the struct (e.g. x and r share the same memory), and 2) access to the same four floats as an array (e.g. x and flts[0] share the same memory). Sometimes unions are used in various “hacks”, usually non-portable, to access the internals of some data type e.g. the individual bytes in an integer in the machine order.
