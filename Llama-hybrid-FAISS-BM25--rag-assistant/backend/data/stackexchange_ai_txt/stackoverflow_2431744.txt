LINQ: How to skip one then take the rest of a sequence

i would like to iterate over the items of a List , except the first, preserving the order. Is there an elegant way to do it with LINQ using a statement like: foreach (var item in list.Skip(1). TakeTheRest() ) {.... I played around with TakeWhile , but was not successful. Probably there is also another, simple way of doing it?
