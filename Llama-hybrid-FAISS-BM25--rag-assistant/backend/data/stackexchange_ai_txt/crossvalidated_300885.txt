All-pass models in practice

I am new to time series and I read some paper about all-pass models. An all-pass time series model is "an autoregressive-moving average model in which all roots of the autoregressive polynomial are reciprocals of roots of the moving average polynomial and vice versa". The mathematics behind are the same as ARMA & such but in practice, in which situation these kind of models are pertinent ? Here are 2 useful references: Slides by Richard A Davis; "Least absolute deviation estimation for all-pass time series models" by Breidt et al.
