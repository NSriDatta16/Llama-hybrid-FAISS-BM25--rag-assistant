Logistic Regression, Small Sample Size, Issue with Categorization

So I’m looking at a data set. I am thinking about a logistic regression method for it because we’re looking at many different surfaces in households and whether they were positive or negative for a specific bacteria markers, given the distance from some different potential sources and whether the households have pets. The problem is that there are 3-4 surfaces of different types each coming from 21 different homes. Making a dummy that accounts for each different household definitely would be dumb because it would essentially add 21 new variables. haha. So total number of surfaces is around 150. So, we are trying to a lot with very little data. We need to account for the different households in my opinion because different families might be more similar in their carriage,etc... I was thinking of categorizing the houses by similar traits (different combinations of things), then use those as the dummies. Is there any easy solution that comes to mind for you?
