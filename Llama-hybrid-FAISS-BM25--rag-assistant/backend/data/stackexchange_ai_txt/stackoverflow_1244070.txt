I'd maybe suggest using EAN/UPC, especially if you're using it in a small shop. The products in the shop will generally carry their own barcodes (which will be EAN8/13 if you're in Europe or UPCA/E in the States) and so those can be entered into your database and then only print a barcode label for those products that don't have a barcode. The product id's that you generate will be then of the same format of those already on the product. You will need to start your own codes with a 2 (in the case of EAN13) as this is reserved for 'in house' barcodes and will be guaranteed not to overlap with any manufacturers barcodes. One potential downside of not generating your own codes for everything is that a manufacturer is required to change the barcode on a product is there is a change of packaging. For example, an Olympic branded Snickers bar will have a different barcode to a standard Snickers bar. Same product, different packaging, different barcode which can present issues for stock taking, sales analysis, etc. The ANL-80 is a CCD scanner and if you print your barcode at about 40 x 25mm I think you should get good readability, as at that size there is good separation between the barcode lines and the line density of the EAN symbology is not that great.
