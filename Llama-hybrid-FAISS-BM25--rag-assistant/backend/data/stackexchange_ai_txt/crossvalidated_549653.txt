Ordinal Logistic regression with factors - help with interpretation

I've just ran an ordinal logistic regression and I'm having a little trouble interpreting the estimates. The data models attractiveness ratings (likert scale ordinal data) as the DV, with several factorial predictors. The data looks like this (only showing one factor): Attractiveness BMI 7 Emaciated 6 Underweight 3 Normal 2 Overweight 1 Obese The resulting output looks like this: ||Estimate|Std. error|z value |pr(>z)| | --| --| --| --|--| |BMIEmaciated |-5.19249 |0.27646|-18.782| If I take my understanding of how to interpret a simple logistic regression, I know that each of these levels are being compared with BMINormal and that they are log odds. Taking BMI Emaciated, does this mean that when compared with BMINormal there is a 5.19 log odd decrease in scoring higher on the dependent variable (1-7 likert scale)? However, theory would suggest that Emaciated and Obese would have the lowest overall scores. When I use an inverse logit function on these I get BMIEmaciated: 0.0055274370; BMIObese: 0.0239843661; BMIOverweight: 0.1941327100; BMIUnderweight: 0.1493896343, which would represent probabilities. But, these are confusing to me. Does that mean that BMIObese, compared with BMINormal, achieves higher scores on the scale 2% of the time? I'm a bit confused with this interpretation. I may be overcomplicating this, but any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
