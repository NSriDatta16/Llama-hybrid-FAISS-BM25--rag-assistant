Computing the Sample Size for the sum of Bernoulli RVs with different probabilites times a constant

I have the following statistic for which I need to figure out a sample size: $$S= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(c_i+\sum_{j=1}^{100} b_{ij}X_i\right)$$ where $c_i$ and $b_{ij}$ are constants and $X_i$ is Bernoulli with parameter $p_i$ . I need to be able to estimate the precision of this statistic versus the underlying result in the population. The $X_i$ 's are probably not completely independent, i.e. $X_1$ may be correlated to $X_{32}$ but $X_{57}$ is independent of the other $X_i$ 's or combinations of $X_i$ 's. Since I think it would be almost impossible to compute $n$ under these circumstances, can I somehow estimate the error introduced by assuming the $X_i$ 's are independent? I am hoping there is some way to exploit the form of the statistic (it is an average), but in researching the sum of Bernoulli's with different $p$ 's, it's going to be pretty tough. It could be that Monte Carlo methods are the only way, but I wanted to be ask before I did that.
