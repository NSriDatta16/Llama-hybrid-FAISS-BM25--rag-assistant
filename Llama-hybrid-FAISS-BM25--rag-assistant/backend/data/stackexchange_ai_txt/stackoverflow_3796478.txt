How can I parse this text using regex (ruby)?

http://services.tvrage.com/tools/quickinfo.php?show=Chuck I'm trying to parse that info, for example, get the Airtime, Airtime@Monday at 08:00 pm I want to get what's after "Airtime@" till the end of the line, to just come out with "Monday at 08:00 pm". How can I do this?
