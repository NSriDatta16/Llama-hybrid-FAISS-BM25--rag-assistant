Short answer: Not likely In order for this to work, you absolutely would have to use a 64-bit processor. Secondly, it would depend on the Operating System support for allocating more than 4G of RAM to a single process. In theory, it would be possible, but you would have to read the documentation for the memory allocator. You would also be more susceptible to memory fragmentation issues. There is good information on Windows memory management .
