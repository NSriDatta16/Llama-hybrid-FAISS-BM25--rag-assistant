How to model data with unknown attributes?

What are good ways to model data that will need to be queried but where it's impossible to fully define up front? For instance... say I want to model information about the countries of the world . Each country has a population , a flag and a list of languages , that's easy enough. But say we also want to model the win/loss record of their national baseball team and not all countries have one, of course. Or, we want to track the lineage of their kings & queens (again, obviously not applicable to most countries). Or, we decide we want to model the number of yurts the average clan member will erect in a lifetime . Anyway, point is, we don't (and won't ever) know what's coming until it hits us. What approaches are there that are both scalable and query-able? Is this, perhaps, a good use for a Document-centric database (MongoDB?) or perhaps some design pattern could be applied to the classic Relational database?
