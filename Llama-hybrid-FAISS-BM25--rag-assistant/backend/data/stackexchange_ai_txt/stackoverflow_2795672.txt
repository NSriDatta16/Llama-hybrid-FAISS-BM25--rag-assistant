[picker setHidden:YES]; Or picker.hidden = YES; Don't forget that if you had dragged & dropped a UIDatePicker object onto your view using Interface Builder, you must link your object to the defined variable. You can do that by holding the CTRL button while dragging from your UIDatePicker object on your view to the File's Owner. I actually forget to do that more often than not. I end up programmatically creating my objects and adding them as subviews as a result.
