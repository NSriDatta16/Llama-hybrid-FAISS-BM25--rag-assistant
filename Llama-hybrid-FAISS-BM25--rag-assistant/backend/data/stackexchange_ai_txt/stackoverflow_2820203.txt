iPhone: Setup static content of UITableView

" A Closer Look at Table-View Cells " from Apple, explains how to use "The Technique for Static Row Content" to use Interface Builder to setup the cells in a tableview. I have some cells with different heights in my tableview. Without using the heightForRowAtIndexPath method everything get messed up. Do I still need to use this method or can I setup the height of the cells inside the IB as I created them there? Also when using the "The Technique for Static Row Content" from the guide you still need to use the cellForRowAtIndexPath to setup the cells even if they are created in IB. I would like to setup the full layout of the tableview with all cells in IB (drag the cells right into the tableview), is that possible in some way?
