How to build a comunication interface between a reinforcement learning and a videogame?

I want to try to build a reinforcement learning model in order to play old arcade videogame, I know about projects in order to build AI for playing videogames, but I don't know how could I build an interface between a videogame and a python app in order to train the model while the model is playing. is there any library in order to train a reinforcement learning model using an emulator or something like that on python? How can I build an app like that? Thanks
