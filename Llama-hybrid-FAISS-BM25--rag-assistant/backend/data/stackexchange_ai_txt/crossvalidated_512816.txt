If you start out your analysis using a random intercepts logistic regression model, then I would suggest to stick to that framework also for your meta-regression analysis (your model1 does not use logistic regression, but uses the 'standard' inverse-normal model of the logit transformed proportions as outcome). The meta package actually uses rma.glmm() from the metafor package to fit logistic models, so your model m1 could be obtained directly with: m2 And rma.glmm() can also be used to fit your meta-regression model with: m3 The only change required in your code for the plot is size .
