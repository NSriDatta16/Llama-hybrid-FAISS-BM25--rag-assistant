Setting up a one-time installer using Apple's PackageMaker

I'm a newbie at this so I'll explain what I did so far: Open PackageMaker and drag my MyApp from /Applications into the left sidebar Changed the owner/group for MyApp to root/admin and rwxrwxr-x Created a postinstall shell script and selected it in the Scripts tab So now, how do I add that executable (Adobe AIR Installer) that I want to run 1 time (on first install) only? Do I drag it into that left sidebar also? I tried doing that but it gives it a destination of /Applications , which I don't want. I want it extracted to a temp location, installed, and deleted. Also, how do I reference it from the shell script? Would I use the open command to run it? Hope this makes sense...
