Your sessions are maybe cookie based. If that's the case then each of request is starting with the same cookie(session). The cookie holds the session content. Try switching the storage to be on the server. But I in your case with the authentication I think it would be much better to not do this async. Request A (first controller) starts. Session is empty. Request B (second controller) starts. Session is empty. Request A finishes. Request A has done authentication, and stored the user ID in the session. Session contains user ID .....AND returning the session content in a cookie. Request B finishes. Session is empty. THIS one is setting blank session. Request C starts. Session is empty - not what I want. Thats because B has set reset the session
