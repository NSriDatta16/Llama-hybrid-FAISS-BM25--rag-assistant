How to make and apply standards for UI development?

I work in a small and young team of developers and we have problems that we are not sure how to solve. On previous projects every developer have been working on tasks that were based on use cases. So, upon setting the system architecture, each team member worked on user interface and business logic of tasks assigned to him. This kind of organization gave us the problems with UI. Each developer had his own logic about how UI should look like, where buttons should be, etc etc... and even if we've had one css designer a lot of refactoring had to be done in order to make web site to look compactly. How do you deal with this issue? Do you split tasks based on layer, not on whole use case? Do you use some technical solution to achieve this or is it just written standard that every developer need to follow? Thanks
