I am pretty sure you will find that ActiveReports is the only report writer that provides such extensible control over print jobs, especially providing escape support. Surely, if I'm wrong, someone will correct me. What is the bug with Escape that you're running into? It is also worth noting that Windows itself has starting introducing some limitations with escape since Windows 9x was introduced and microsoft has discouraged using escapes ever since Windows 9x started. Just one source from Microsoft that mentions this is KB125692 . Anyway, tell me more about what problems you're facing with escape and I'll try to either get the bug resolved or find you a workaround. -scott
