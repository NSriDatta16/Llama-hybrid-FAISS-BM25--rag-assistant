Java 6 Splash Screen

I've never been able to get the Java 6 splash screen to work. I've tried everything I can think of. My manifest.mf contains: Manifest-Version: 1.0 X-COMMENT: Main-Class will be added automatically by build SplashScreen-Image: geotagsplashscreen.gif I put file "geotragsplashscreen.gif" in the root of my source tree, and verify that it makes it into the root of the resulting .jar file. I've also tried it in various places, again confirming its position in the jar, and put the path in SplashScreen-Image. It never shows up. Attempts to get the splash screen at runtime fail: final SplashScreen splash = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen(); if (splash == null) { return; } splash is always null for me. Any ideas on what I'm missing here?
