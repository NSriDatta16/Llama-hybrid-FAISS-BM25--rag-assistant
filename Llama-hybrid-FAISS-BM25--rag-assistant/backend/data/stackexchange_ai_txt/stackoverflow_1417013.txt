You were doing it almost right, but you're not quite following convention. Allow me to explain. Links are designed, by HTTP specification, to be GET requests - data retrieval. You are not supposed to use links to modify a resource's state. Basically, don't use links for potentially destructive actions, as they could be followed by a spider or accelerator. Rails defaults to making every link a GET request. So, when you did this: { :action => "destroy", :id => guest.id } %> It made a GET request. I assume you have in your routes.rb file something like map.resources :guests This creates a ton of routes that you could use like this: guest_path(guest) %> With resource routes in Rails, the METHOD used determines the controller action called. The URL /guests/1 called with a GET request calls the SHOW action. You need to specify the method in your link_to_remote call - either :get, :put, :post, or :delete. :put is for updates, :post is for creates, :delete is for, well, deleting. { :action => "destroy", :id => guest.id }, :method => :delete %> or cleaner, guest_path(guest), :method => :destroy %> But seriously, don't use links. Use buttons. guest_path(guest), :method => :destroy %> Hope that helps!
