After converting a categorical variable to dummies, can I use all dummies in my decision tree and random forest?

When we learn about statistical models, we learn that we shouldn't have dummy variables that are complementary. For instance, if we have only men and women in the dataset, once we have a dummy variable for men, we shouldn't have a dummy variable for women. Is this still something we need to care when using decision tree, random forest or other methods? And - this is not a statistical question, so don't care about answering if you don't know - should I worry about this when using Python?
