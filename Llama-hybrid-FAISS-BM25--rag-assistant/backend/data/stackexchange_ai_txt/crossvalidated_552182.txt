700K and 1.3M is pretty balanced to me, usually people are talking about 1:1000 or even worse as imbalanced data. For example, fraud detection, it can be 1:100000. In addition, Decision tree (and most machine learning model, such as logistic regression) works fine with the imbalanced data set. Just pay attention to evaluation metrics, and use precision and recall instead of accuracy.
