Interpretation of values contained in a confidence interval

Are the values within a confidence interval those that do not significantly differ from the point estimate? Or, put differently, how do we interpret the values contained in a CI given that the CI is just about the coverage rate? EDIT: Notice that this question is not about the formal equivalence of the t-statistic and the CI (i.e., CI's as significance tests) but how to interpret the values contained in an observed interval.
