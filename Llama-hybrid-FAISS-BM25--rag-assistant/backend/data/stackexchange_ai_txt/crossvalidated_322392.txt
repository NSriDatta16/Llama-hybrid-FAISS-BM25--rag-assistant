Training - Validation - Testing Usage

Just a note concerning the splitting and using of the dataset. So if I understand this correctly, we use the validation set to confirm that parameter changes made are giving us positive results. And the testing set is put aside until the very end after we have optimized the model. So if I had a default SVM, I would use the validation set after say changing the kernel or the gamma to see the performance difference. Then once I have my final optimized model I would use the test set to see how well it generalizes to unseen data?
