Maven dependency for Servlet 3.0 API?

How can I tell Maven 2 to load the Servlet 3.0 API? I tried: javax.servlet servlet-api 3.0 provided I use http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/ but what repository would be correct? Addendum: It works with a dependency for the entire Java EE 6 API and the following settings: java.net http://download.java.net/maven/2 javax javaee-api 6.0 provided I'd prefer to only add the Servlet API as dependency, but "Brabster" may be right that separate dependencies have been replaced by Java EE 6 Profiles. Is there a source that confirms this assumption?
