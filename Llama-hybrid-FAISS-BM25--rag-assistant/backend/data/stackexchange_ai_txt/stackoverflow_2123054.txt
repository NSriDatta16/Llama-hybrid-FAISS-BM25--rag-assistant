Your problem appears to be twofold; there's the issue of getting hold of the data, and the issue of storing it in a manner which allows effective retrieval and use. Obtaining the data is likely to be your biggest problem; you're literally asking for information about every institution in the world (or at least, as many as you can get). The available qualifications and nomenclature varies widely between different countries, and the list of courses at any given institution is going to be vast. Finding a single decent, machine-readable source for this information is probably not going to happen. Your best bet would be to try and find multiple sources, but I'm struggling to think of any really good ones off the top of my head, and Google isn't looking too promising. You could attempt to scrape data from sites such as the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (the UK body which basically catalogues higher education) - I've linked to their "course list" pages. Whether similar bodies (and similar data sets) exist for other regions, I've no idea. The second problem is quite straightforward; you're going to have a ton of data, so you'll need to store it in a database. Then again, it's not that straightforward. Presumably, you want to catalogue courses by institution, and institutions by country, so make sure you normalise the data a little. You'll probably need to do some work to identify equivalent degree grades (as mentioned above) between different countries.
