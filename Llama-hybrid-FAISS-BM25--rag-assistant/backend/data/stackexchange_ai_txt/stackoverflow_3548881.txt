Why are my local dlls taking forever to load after setting _NT_SYMBOL_PATH?

I've setup _NT_SYMBOL_PATH and have pointed it to srv*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols When starting the debugger, I notice that the Windows related dlls load quickly. However, our company's dlls are taking a god awful long time to load. When I get rid of _NT_SYMBOL_PATH, restart visual studio, then everything loads pretty quickly (albeit I don't have MS symbols). It's almost as if the symbol server above is being searched for my internal company dll's pdbs instead of first checking to see if they exist locally. Some of these dlls I do not have pdbs for. Some are part of my solution, so I build them when debugging and always have pdbs. How is Visual Studio searching for symbols? Is there anyway I can control how visual studio searches for symbols? Can I explicitly say that for dlls from a given directory are not to be searched for symbols? Is there anything else that might drag down how fast symbols are loaded or anything I can do to speed up the process?
