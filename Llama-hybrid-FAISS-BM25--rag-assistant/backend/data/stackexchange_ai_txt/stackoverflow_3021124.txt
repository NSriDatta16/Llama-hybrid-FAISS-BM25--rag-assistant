Possible alternative: I've recently discovered SynBigTable ( http://blog.synopse.info/post/2010/03/16/Synopse-Big-Table ) which has a TSynBigTableString class for storing large amounts of data using a string index. Very simple, single layer bigtable implementation, and it mainly uses disc storage, to consumes a lot less memory than expected when storing hundreds of thousands of records. As simple as: aId := UTF8String(Format('%s.%s', [name, surname])); bigtable.Add(data, aId) and bigtable.Get(aId, data) One catch, indexes must be unique, and the cost of update is a bit high (first delete, then re-insert)
