If you have D2007 or newer, just add your RC file to the project manager... The RC file is a simple text file where you declare your resources and the corresponding files (with path if needed) like: SANTA BITMAP "SANTA.BMP" SOUND RCDATA "SOUND.WAV" In D2009 or newer, you can just add the wav to the project manager. And the easiest way to "add" is to drag your file and drop it there.
