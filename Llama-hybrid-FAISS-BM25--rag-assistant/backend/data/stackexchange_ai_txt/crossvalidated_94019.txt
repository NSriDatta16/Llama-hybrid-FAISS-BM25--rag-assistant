If you refer to the 'cor' command, it computes simply the Pearson correlation coefficient between all predicted and observed values in the respective set. Other types of correlation are also available. If we assume the data are generated by a classical "signal+noise" model of the form $$ Y=f(X)+\epsilon $$ where $f$ is the "true", unknown function and $\epsilon$ is a random error term, the random forest algorithm finds a function $\hat{f}$ which approximates $f$ (just like any nonparametric regression method). The predicted value for any argument $x$ is then $\hat{y}=\hat{f}(x)$. If the model is close to the unknown "truth", then the relationhip betwenn $\hat{y}$ and observed $y$ should be approximately linear, and therefore the Pearson correlation is a very good measure of its strength.
