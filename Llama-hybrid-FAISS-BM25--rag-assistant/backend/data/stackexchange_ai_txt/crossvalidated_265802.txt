Neural networks when there are multiple correct answers

How could I train a potential neural network if there are multiple possible outputs? For a simple example, if I'm trying to make a neural network that can find a valid solution to a quadratic equation, there could be 0, 1, or 2 correct answers. I want the network to be able to output all of the correct answers. Is this possible? If so, what techniques exist?
