Binary outcome prediction based on multivariate time series in R

everyone! I have some monitoring dataset for 90 patients. It consists of about 10 parameters (continuous variables) that were recorded each 1 minute 3-4 days for every patient. I know the binary outcome for every patient at the end of monitoring. Now, I would like to predict the outcome (0/1) based on that multivariate time series for each patient. What would you recommend to accomplish this? I am interested in R implementation.
