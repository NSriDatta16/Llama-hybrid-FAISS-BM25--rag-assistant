How To Elegantly Handle JSON Objects in Responses From Ajax Requests?

I'm really new to using JSON to handle my Ajax Request and Response cycle. I've previously used just plain old parameters passed as POST data and I've rendered straight HTML in the response which was then placed into the DOM. As I've looked at various examples and read through various tutorials, it seems like a fairly common practice to simply build a string from the JSON object mixed with HTML that's been hard coded into the string and then assign the string as innerHTML to some element. A common example looks something like this: var jo = eval(req.responseText); var strTxt = ' ' + jo.f_name + ' ' + jo.l_name + ' ' + 'Your Age Is: ' + jo.age + ' '; $('myDiv').innerHTML = strTxt; Is there a more elegant (or correct) way of handling the JSON response so that I'm not hard coding HTML in the javascript? Or is this pretty much how people do it? P.S. Links to tutorials or other sources are appreciated.
