By default console apps don't have a reference to System.Web , MVC apps do. I think you'll find that the error message you're getting is a little misleading. What I think is happening is that TableStorageMembershipProvider has a dependency on System.Web that for whatever reason isn't flowing through to your console app. Trying adding a reference to System.Web to your console app and that should fix it.
