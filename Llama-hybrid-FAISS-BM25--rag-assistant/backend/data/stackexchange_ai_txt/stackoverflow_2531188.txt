A framework is an organized group of code that takes care of some "lower-level" details for you, so you can concentrate on building your application (or whatever it is you are working on). For PHP, most frameworks implement the MVC architecture pattern. These frameworks organize your code for you into models, controllers, views, and other directories of "stuff" (depending on the framework) - this keeps your code cleaner and more maintainable. Instead of trying to maintain this organization on your own, just use the framework and you do not need to worry about many details. Many MVC frameworks also have many other nice features built-in, such as unit testing, classes to simplify database access, etc. So in short, using a (good) framework simplifies development because it solves many problems that you would otherwise have to deal with yourself.
