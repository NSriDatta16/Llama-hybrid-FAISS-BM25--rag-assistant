Detecting IE6 using Javascript/jQuery revisited

I need to detect IE6 in order to work around the lack of position:fixed. I've been using a simple regex: var isIE6 = /msie|MSIE 6/.test(navigator.userAgent); This works almost all the time, except for the user whose browser claims to be both IE6 and IE7: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30) Glorious. I'd love to use jquery.support , but it looks like that doesn't support querying on whether position:fixed is available. So I'm back to detecting IE6. There are various suggested solutions, such as looking for the existence of maxHeight . But those seem fairly random and scare me - if there are exceptions to the regex above, how can I be sure there are no exceptions to maxHeight? I'm thinking of using conditional comments - that way at least it'll be IE itself claiming to be IE6, not a hack. Something like: var isIE6 = true; Alternatively there's a f unction that directly tests if position:fixed is available , but that seems a bit heavy. Any reason my conditional comment approach won't work? Are there better approaches?
