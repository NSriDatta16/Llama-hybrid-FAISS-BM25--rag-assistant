I encountered a very similar issue myself recently, and I wasn't able to find an elegant solution other than using a helper function to do it: dbfunc f b c = (\a -> liftIO $ f a b c) deleteAllRows = do ask >>= dbfunc run "delete from t1" [] At least this pattern is common enough in HDBC that dbfunc is reusable.
