1) By default the CSS Width property is set to value “Auto”. What width value is used on an element when Width is set to “Auto”? It depends on the element. Usually elements will expand to display their entire contents, unless that expansion would exceed existing constraints, in which case that constraint is its width. is there also a more elegant way of forcing nested elements to automatically adjust their width to that of the parent element and so that they wouldn’t overflow? You just described it. Setting width: 100% is the way to have the element fill its parent. If you want to constrain the nested element's width further, you can use the max-width and min-width properties, which allow you to enforce maximum and minimum sizes on elements that have variable widths.
