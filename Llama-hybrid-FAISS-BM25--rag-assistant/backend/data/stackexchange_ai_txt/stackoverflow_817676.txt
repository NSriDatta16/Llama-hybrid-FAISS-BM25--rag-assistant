Serialize Struct in Binary, Packed Format

Is there a way in C# to serialize a struct to a binary stream (MemoryStream) such that the binary representation is equivalent to how the struct is visually layed out (i.e. no padding)? In C/C++, you use #pragma commands to tell the compiler to pack the struct's so that there is no padding between the fields. This is helpful if you have two apps passing messages back and forth via sockets. With packing disabled, you can simply "send" the contents of the struct over the socket and not have to worry about packing each field individually into a binary buffer (also have to do endianness swapping if necessary).
