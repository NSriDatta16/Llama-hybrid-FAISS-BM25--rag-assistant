How do you organize your small reusable cffunctions?

I am reorganizing my ColdFusion directory structures and am curious about how experienced CF developers are organizing libraries of smaller cffunctions. I am not as curious about elaborate components (objects) as I am about the dozens of little utility functions we all build up over time. Do you use a large single file with cffunctions and cfinclude it? Do you use a large single file as a cfcomponent and call creatobject/cfinvoke? Do you put each utility cffunction in its own cfc and call createobject/cfinvoke? Do you use the cfimport taglib syntax? Do you use the CustomTags or cfmodule? Do you have a better way? Since I don't like verbose syntax I have been just cfincluding a lib.cfm that has a bunch of common cffunctions in it. I may refactor them to grouped cfcs I can createobject on just to have better isolation on variable scopes. Is there a better way to do this?
