Recommendations for modelling panel data

sending positive wishes to y'all. I have about 10 years of growth rates in real estate prices and some other macroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment rates, fuel prices, growth in prices of raw materials among many others. I want to analyze the causality of all of these variables on the growth in real estate prices. The simplest thing would be to build a linear regression model, but given this is not cross-sectional and more like a time series data, I'm a little confused. Could you help me understand what should be the right statistical approach here to determine the drivers of real estate growth?
