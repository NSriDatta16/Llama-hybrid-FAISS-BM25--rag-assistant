How to properly use DDX (Data Exchange) with the CComboBox Control?

The MFC offers a function called DDX_CBIndex to get the Index of the current selected ComboBox item. But in most cases I'm not interested about the index, instead I want to get the 32 bit application-supplied value, which I get when calling GetItemData . Therefore I always have to override OnOk and use GetCurSel and GetItemData to retrieve this value. Is there a more elegant way to get/set the CComboBox item not depending on the index but depending on the application-supplied 32 bit value? Thank you!
