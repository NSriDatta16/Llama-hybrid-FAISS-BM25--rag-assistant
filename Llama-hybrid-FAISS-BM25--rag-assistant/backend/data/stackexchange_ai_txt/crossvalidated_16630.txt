Semi-supervised learning, active learning and deep learning for classification

Final edit with all resources updated: For a project, I am applying machine learning algorithms for classification. Challenge: Quite limited labeled data and much more unlabeled data. Goals: Apply semi-supervised classification Apply a somehow semi-supervised labeling process (known as active learning) I've found a lot of information from research papers, like applying EM, Transductive SVM or S3VM (Semi Supervised SVM), or somehow using LDA, etc. Even there are few books on this topic. Question: Where are the implementations and practical sources? Final update (based on helps provided by mpiktas, bayer, and Dikran Marsupial) Semi-supervised learning: TSVM: in SVMligth and SVMlin . EM Naive Bayes in Python EM in LinePipe project Active learning: Dualist : an implementation of active learning with source code on text classification This webpage serves a wonderful overview of active learning. An experimental Design workshop: here . Deep learning: Introductory video at here . General site . Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning tutorial .
