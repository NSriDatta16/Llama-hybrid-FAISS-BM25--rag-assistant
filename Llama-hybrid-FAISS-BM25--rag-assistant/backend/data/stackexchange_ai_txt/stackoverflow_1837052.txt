I strongly recommend you use Weka for your task Its a collection of machine learning algorithms with a user friendly front-end which facilitates a lot of different kinds of feature and model selection strategies You can do a lot of really complicated stuff using this without really having to do any coding or math The makers have also published a pretty good textbook that explains the practical aspects of data mining Once you get the hang of it, you could use its API to integrate any of its classifiers into your own java programs
