The Importance of Being Accessible It may be very important for your website to be highly accessible, especially if the site is being built for an organization which is subsidized by federal dollars. The Rehabilitation Act was ammended in 1998, and now requires Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. There are similar laws applying to e-commerce sites, applying to the online storefronts of traditional retailers. You can look into Secion 508 for more info, but the main idea is that partial page refreshes won't be read by modern screen readers, and if your site needs to be accessible, the extra effort is required, and certainly worth your effort. Many web frameworks are still in use which did not anticipate ajax, and it can require a lot of work-arounds to make things accessible. Still, it's really the best thing to do, even if you are developing a private website. Here are a couple of other articles which deal with the topic: Secion 508 http://www.alistapart.com/articles/saveaccessibility/ http://www.alistapart.com/articles/politics/ Users without javascript As far as "turning off" javascript, users don't do this anywhere nearly as often as they did 5 years ago, though some still may. This will not likely be the case with your audience, and it's generally not considered the major concern it once was. These days, the real concern is just client support. All modern browsers support enough javascript to allow you to do your work. It's the alternative clients, like the accessibility devices you mentioned, which may add requirements to your design. If some of your audience works in a security-sensitive environment (government agencies, etc.), it may still be mandated that javascript is turned off on their work machines. This is also becoming less and less of a problem as time goes on, though it's a more common case than the paranoia issue you mentioned. Of course, if you offer some support for those users, you won't have to worry about it.
