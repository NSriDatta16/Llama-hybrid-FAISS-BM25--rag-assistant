In RDA redundancy analysis, what is the meaning of the principal components that appear in the result

I ran an RDA through the vegan package in R using water quality (dependent variable) and land use (independent variable) data. In my test I got the following results: The total inertia was 9, and the model explained approximately 41.66% (Constrained = 0.4166 = ) of the variance between the quality and land use data. The model still provides the main axes (RDA1, RDA2, RDA3, RDA4) and 6 more Principal Componentes (PC1 to PC6) as shown in the figure. I would like to know what the meaning of these components? how to interpret them? I understand that the components absorbed the unexplained variance (Unconstrained =0.5834)
