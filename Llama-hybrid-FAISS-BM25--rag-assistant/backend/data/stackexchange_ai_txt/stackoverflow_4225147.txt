I had this problem and tried the solutions mentioned here with no success. Eventually, I realised that I was linking to the Google CDN version of the script using an http URL while the page embedding the script was an https page . This caused IE to not load jquery (it prompts the user whether they want to load only secure content). Changing the Google CDN URL to use the https scheme fixed the problem for me.
