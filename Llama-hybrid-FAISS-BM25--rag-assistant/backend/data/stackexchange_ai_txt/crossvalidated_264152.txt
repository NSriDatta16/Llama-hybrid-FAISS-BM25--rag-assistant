Detrending variance of event time-series

I have time series of events. I observe that variance of inter-events intervals increases over the time. Is it possible to detrend my time series? Update: Example of data is here . It is times when I observe event. Inter-events intervals are depicted below: Just now I have the following solution: 1) I transform intervals($I$) to $log_{10}(I)$ 2) Then I simply detrend $log_{10}(I)$ Is it correct approach? Could you propose something more smart?
