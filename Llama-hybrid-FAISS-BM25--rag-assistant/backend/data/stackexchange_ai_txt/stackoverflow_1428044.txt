CMS for Professional Photographer with Pretty Admin Back End

I'm working on a few sites for professional photographers who want to be able to update on their own. I'm looking for a simple CMS solution that has very basic functionality as a gallery and is easy for them to work with. My main concern is with ordering images--I'd like for them to be able to drag their thumbnails around and lock the order. I suspect there is an existing solution out there and am looking for recommendations. I've seen something like this driven by Flash for Flash sites, but I don't know the name of it. I'm looking for something that is similar, but not Flash.
