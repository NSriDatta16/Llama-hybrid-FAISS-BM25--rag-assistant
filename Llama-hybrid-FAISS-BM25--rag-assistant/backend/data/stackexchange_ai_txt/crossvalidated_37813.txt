You have not correctly interpreted user697473's claim. He is not talking about failing to include any data from brand C. He was talking about giving a particular vector of assignemnts $0$ probability. He was not saying that you can magically determine the value of some variable while never testing it. He wants to be able to use a balanced random subset, so that each point is included in the random subset with the right probability, but not a uniformly random one. For example, if the set is $\lbrace x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4 \rbrace$, then the following random subsets of uniform size $2$ all have the property that the probability that $x_i$ is included is $1/2$: $S_1 = 1/6\lbrace x_1,x_2\rbrace + 1/6\lbrace x_1,x_3\rbrace + 1/6\lbrace x_1,x_4\rbrace + 1/6\lbrace x_2,x_3\rbrace + 1/6\lbrace x_2,x_4\rbrace + 1/6\lbrace x_3,x_4\rbrace $ $S_2 = 1/4\lbrace x_1,x_3\rbrace + 1/4\lbrace x_1,x_4\rbrace + 1/4\lbrace x_2,x_3\rbrace + 1/4\lbrace x_2,x_4\rbrace $ $S_3 = 1/2\lbrace x_1,x_2\rbrace + 1/2\lbrace x_3,x_4\rbrace $ These are all balanced in the sense that if you compute the average value of some function $f$ over the random set, the expected value is $1/4(f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3)+f(x_4))$. In the third random subset, the probability of the subset $\lbrace x_1,x_3 \rbrace$ is $0$. That said, the point of the experiment should not be to produce an unbiased estimate. That is just one consideration. Another goal is to provide useful information. If you know that you may want to estimate $f$ on a subset $T$ (say $\lbrace x_1,x_2 \rbrace$) and its complement and to subtract the two, the quality of your estimate depends on $\#(T \cap S)$ and $\#(T^c \cap S)$. Then not all balanced subsets have the same quality. For that task, $S_3$ is worse than random assignment ($S_1$), while $S_2$ is better than random assignment.
