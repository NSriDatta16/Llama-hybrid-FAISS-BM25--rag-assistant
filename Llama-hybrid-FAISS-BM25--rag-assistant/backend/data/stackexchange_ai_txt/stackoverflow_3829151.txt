A CSS injection is nearly as good as script injection. You've got expression() in IE6-7 (and later in compatibility view), you've got behavior: (HTC) in IE, you've got -moz-binding: in Firefox, you've got content: to inject text, and occasionally, mostly in older browsers that don't block it, you've got url(javascript:...) . Even without these you've got a fair amount of risk just from visual UI spoofing. As long as a user stylesheet is limited to the user that made it, a user can only compromise themselves. The problem comes when users start sharing stylesheets. You might perhaps disallow users from picking the same external stylesheet address as another user to discourage this.
