When to use ANN with tensorflow?

I'm new to machine learning and tensorflow and I'm confused as to why (and when) to use the types of ANN (ie recurrent neural network) with tensorflow? I know RNN is good for sequences of data/time series data but when I (for example) search for something like stock prediction with tensorflow, most used RNN and have some form of a model. However, recently google released a machine learning with financial time series which doesn't use any ANN? So do we have to use ANN at all?
