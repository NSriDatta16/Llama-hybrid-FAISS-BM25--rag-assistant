In addition to what's been said, I might suggest that implementing IDisposable explicitly encourages use of the using block, as it can be used on any type which implements IDisposable and it is more natural (to most people, anyway) to write this: using (var response = GetResponse()) { // do something } Than this: var response = GetResponse(); // do something ((IDisposable)response).Dispose(); I'm not sure that would be a developer's intention in explicitly implementing IDisposable , but it's possible.
