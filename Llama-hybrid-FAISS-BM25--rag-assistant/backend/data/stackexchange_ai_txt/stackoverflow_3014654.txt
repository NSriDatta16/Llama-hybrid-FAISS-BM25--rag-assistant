Optimize loading an XAP file with an asp.net website

I've been developing a game using Silverlight 4 and silversprite ( http://silversprite.codeplex.com/ ) This game is HEAVILY content dependent, using a lot of audio and images. My content folder is around 90 mbs worth of stuff. And because of that, my XAP file is around 60 MB, and takes 5 minutes to download from the website before any user can start playing. I am using Visual Web Developer 2010 to create my site and load the XAP. Is there a way where I can take content out of my XAP and put it in my ASP.net site project? Or perhaps upload my content files to the site's storage? This would make my XAP file much quicker to download. Anyone have suggestions? Thanks!
