inferential structure determination

I'm trying to get my head around Bayesian inference and the difference between the posterior and likelihood. Going off the back of these answers , I'm under the impression that the posterior is $P(data|model)$ whereas the likelihood is $L(model|data)$. However, I'm a structural biologist. The landmark paper bringing Bayesian inference to the field can be found here Quoting from the paper: The posterior density $p(X|D,I) \propto p(D|X,I)p(X|I)$ factorizes into two natural components: The likelihood function $p(D|X, I)$ combines a forward model and an error distribution and quantifies the likelihood of observing data D given a molecular structure X ... The prior density $p(X|I)$ takes prior knowledge about biomolecular structures into account and is determined by the physical energy and the temperature of the system. So here the likelihood is the data given the model. Is it okay to switch the model and data around like this?
