I don't know of a single time series book that is as comprehensive as Elements of Statistical Learning. However, here's a list of a few books that i've found helpful: Free online. More of a forecasting focus, but definitely a good starting point. The slides under resources are also helpful: Hyndman, R. J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2013). Forecasting: principles and practice. Retrieved from http://otexts.org/fpp/ Probably the most comprehensive. With information about many of the model types you've listed: Shumway, R. H., & Stoffer, D. S. (2010). Time Series Analysis and Its Applications. Springer. Definitive resource on exponential smoothing: Hyndman, R., Koehler, A. B., Ord, J. K., & Snyder, R. D. (2008). Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing. Springer.
