The first thing you need to do is to figure out is the source of your generalization error. Is it "bias" or is it "variance"? (or perhaps something else?) If it is variance, your training set might be small for what you are trying to accomplish, and you might need more training data. If it is bias, then changing to a different model, or changing the parameters of your SVM might help you get a better result.
