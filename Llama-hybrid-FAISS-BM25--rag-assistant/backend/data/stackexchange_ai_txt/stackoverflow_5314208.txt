XCode 4 crashes with Git

I can load, build and run my app with no errors in XCode 4, apart from Git integration that is! If I select the master branch and create a new branch and either auto switch or manually switch to the new brach XCode 4 hangs and eventually crashes. Than when I try to re-open my project it is corrupt! Lucky I backed it up. Has anyone else ha this issue? Thinking I may stick to console git mode! Any help gratefully received ;-) OK: removed git removed xcode4 installed git installed xcode4 opened project in organiser the repositories are there again...cool select master create new branch switch to new branch activity indicator just spins and spins and spins? click anywhere else in organiser....crash! BUT.... open terminal window and git operates as usual add, commit, diff etc, all ok???
