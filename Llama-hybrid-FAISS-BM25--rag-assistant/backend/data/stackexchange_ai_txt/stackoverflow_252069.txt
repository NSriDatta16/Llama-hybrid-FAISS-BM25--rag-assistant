What is the best way to execute an MS SQL Server 2000 DTS package from a trigger?

I looked around and found some ideas about how to do this, but no definitive best way. One of the ideas was to use sp_start_job to kick off an SQL Server Agent job that runs the DTS package. If this is the best way to do it, then the next question would be, "How do I schedule a DTS package from a job and make it non-recurring?" Thanks, Tim
