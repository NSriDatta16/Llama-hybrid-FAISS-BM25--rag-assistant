Yet another textbook to consider is Programming Language Pragmatics . I prefer it over the Dragon book, but YMMV. If you're using Perl, yet another tool to consider is Parse::RecDescent . If you just need to do this translation once and don't know anything about compiler technology, I would suggest that you get as far as you can with some fairly simplistic translations and then fix it up by hand. Yes, it is a lot of work. But it is less work than learning a complex subject and coding up the right solution for one job. That said, you should still learn the subject, but don't let not knowing it be a roadblock to finishing your current project.
