Organizing Multi-Solution Builds

We are moving to TFS 2010 from SVN/CruiseControl .NET and I am trying to get my head around how to set up automated builds for the following scenario. Assume a large codebase that contains several solutions, that in turn reference a large number of projects: So, in this example Solution 1 references Project A, Project B, Project C and Project D. Solution 2 references Project C and Project E. What is the best way of organizing this type of setup within TFS 2010 when using TFS as a build system. Specifically, we want to avoid TFS building Solution 1 when only Project E has been modified, but conversely we would want both Solution 1 and Solution 2 to build when Project C has been modified. Any good documentation or ideas that anyone can suggest?
