Passing multiple argument through CommandArgument of Button in Asp.net

I have a gridview with multiple rows, each has a Update button and I need to pass 2 values when someone clicks on Update button. Aside from packing the arguments inside CommandArgument separated by commas (archaic and not elegant), how would I pass more than one argument? As a note, the values can't be retrieved from any controls on the page, so I am presently not seeking any design solutions.
