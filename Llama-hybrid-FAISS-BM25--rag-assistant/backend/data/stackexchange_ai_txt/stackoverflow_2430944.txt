Defragmenting the registry

Does any body know how to defragment windows registry . We googled and found several free tools doing the same.But no tool is having open source. One tool is there - ' UltraDefrag ' which is open source tool written in 'C' for file defragmentation. Please provide help in searching open source/ sample code to defragment windows registry...or any windows API functions or libraries for doing the same. Regards.
