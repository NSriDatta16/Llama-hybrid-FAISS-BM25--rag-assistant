I am trying to learn how to bind an IEnumerable LINQ collection to a repeater

I have created an IEnumerable list of racing drivers using LINQ from a string array as such below: string[] driverNames = { "Lewis Hamilton", "Heikki Kovalainen", "Felipe Massa", "Kimi Raikkonen", "Robert Kubica", "Nick Heidfeld", "Fernando Alonso", "Nelson Piquet Jr", "Jarno Trulli", "Timo Glock", "Sebastien Bourdais", "Sebastien Buemi", "Mark Webber", "Sebastian Vettel", "Nico Rosberg", "Kazuki Nakajima", "Adrian Sutil", "Giancarlo Fisichella", "Jenson Button", "Rubens Barrichello" }; IEnumerable result = from driver in driverNames orderby driver select driver; I am just keeping it simple for now. I then bind it to a ASP.NET GridView like so below: GV_CurrentF1Drivers.DataSource = result; GV_CurrentF1Drivers.DataBind(); This works fine. Now I want to take the same output (result) and bind it to a repeater but no matter what I try I can not get the repeater to work and I think I am missing some key understanding of LINQ and how it works with ASP.NET. Below is the full aspx page to show where I have got to so far. Please can somebody (gently if possible) guide me back on to the path? I use the following code to bind the result to the Repeater: R_CurrentF1Drivers.DataSource = result; R_CurrentF1Drivers.DataBind(); I get the following error when I try to run the page with the Repeater in: Exception Details: System.Web.HttpException: DataBinding: 'System.String' does not contain a property with the name 'driver'.
