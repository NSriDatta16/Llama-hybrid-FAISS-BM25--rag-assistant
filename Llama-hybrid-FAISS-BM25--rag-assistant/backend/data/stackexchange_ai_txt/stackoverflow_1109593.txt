Having enormous blocks of memory is never a good idea, even in 64bit. You get big problems with contiguous memory and fragmentation. The problem here is finding a contiguous block. You could try enabling 3gb mode (which might help it find a few more bytes) but I really advise against it. The answers here are: use less memory use a database/file system use x64 You might also want to read Eric Lippert's blog (he seems to have a blog entry for every common .NET question...)
