col2-right-layout is mentioned in app/design/frontend/base/default/template/page/2columns-right.phtml or in Magento 1.3 app/design/frontend/default/default/template/page/2columns-right.phtml If you want to swap the layout I'd suggest changing it in one of the layout xml files. For the shopping cart edit app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/checkout.xml change Shopping Cart page/1column.phtml to Shopping Cart page/2columns-left.phtml And similarly for the checkout page in the same file change One Page Checkout page/2columns-right.phtml to One Page Checkout page/2columns-left.phtml As always it is better to make a copy of the file you are editing to your own theme.
