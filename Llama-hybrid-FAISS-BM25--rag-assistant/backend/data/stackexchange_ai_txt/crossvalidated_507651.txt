The question cites Evan Miller's article " How Not to Sort by Average Rating ." Miller has also published an article, " Ranking Items With Star Ratings " that addresses this exact question. Assume you have possible ratings, indexed by , each worth points. For “star” rating systems, =. (That is, 1 point, 2 points, ….) Assume a given item has received total ratings, with ratings for . Then the items can be effectively sorted with the criterion: $$S(n_1, \ldots, n_k) = \sum_{k=1}^K{s_k \frac{n_k + 1}{N + K}} - z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\left(\left(\sum_{k=1}^K s_k^2 \frac{n_k + 1}{N + K}\right) - \left(\sum_{k=1}^K{s_k \frac{n_k + 1}{N + K}}\right)^2\right)/(N + K + 1)}$$ Where /2 is the 1−/2 quantile of a normal distribution. The above expression is the lower bound of a normal approximation to a Bayesian credible interval for the average rating. Setting =0.10 (=1.65), a sort criterion of means that 95% of the time, the item will have an average rating greater than , at least according to the belief structure. Miller's approach doesn't require a minimum number of reviews to be listed, which is nice.
