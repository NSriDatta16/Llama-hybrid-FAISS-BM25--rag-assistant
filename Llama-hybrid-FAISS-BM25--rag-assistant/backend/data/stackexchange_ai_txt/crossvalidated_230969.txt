It depends on the dataset and application, do you have any more information on them? (Sorry I would have commented but I can't) I had a similar application for a TF-IDF matrix, with ~10,000 rows and 76 columns. I had to get a relevance score. For me, metric MDS gave the best results. I used Python with this function. Since your dataset is not that large, you could try all methods. If that takes too much time then use a subset of the data. Using a subset of data you could also manually check the MDS result to see if it's giving results that are reasonable. Using PCA to verify on the whole dataset is also an option though it's not that reliable.
