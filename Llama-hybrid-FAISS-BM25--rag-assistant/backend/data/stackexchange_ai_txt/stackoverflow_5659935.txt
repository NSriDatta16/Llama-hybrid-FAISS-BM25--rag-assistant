Implement Emoticons in xcode

I am tryingt o build an application where I am giving user liberty to add the emojis as in GTalk (e.g. :P :) :( ...). But I am not able to figure out the exact way to handle and display them once the characters are entered by the user. Kindly pour in ideas for the same, as any form of help could trigger a solution for this.
