UNK in ludwig learnning model

I am using ludwig to train and test on the dataset. There is one independent variable that has a text data type. I used 'Parallel_CNN' as a text encoder for the independent variable. My dependent variable has the category data type and it has a binary value (i.e. 0 or 1). After the model finished I plotted the predicted and actual output in the form of confusion matrix which is shown as below: I was expecting TP,TN,FP, and FN in the confusion matrix. However, which is unknown also found in the confusion matrix. I tried to google it to see the meaning and impact of unknown on model learning but could not find any useful information. Could anyone help me why does 'Unk' comes into model? Does that mean model is not efficient in learning?
