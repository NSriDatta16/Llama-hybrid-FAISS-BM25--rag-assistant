How to hide space for image when no images found in the server?

I have data aggregator, organize the data from different source by specific manner. Sometimes the images given in the source type is not available or the source refused to serve the images. In this case, I want to remove the space given for image tag. Is it possible? I want to hide the highlighted area space when no image found or serve refused to serve the image.
