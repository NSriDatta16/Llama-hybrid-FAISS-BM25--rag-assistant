Time series analysis can also contribute to effective anomaly or outlier detection in temporal data. As an example, it is possible to fit an ARIMA model and calculate a forecast interval. Depending on the use case, the interval can be used to set a threshold, within which the process can be said to be in control; if new data falls outside the threshold it is flagged for further attention. This blog post has a brief and broad overview of time series analysis for outlier detection. For a more in-depth treatment, researchers at ebay explain how they carried out anomaly detection at scale based on the statistical analysis of time series data.
