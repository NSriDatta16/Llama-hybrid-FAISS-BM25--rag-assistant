This is a type of change point analysis. It's often used to evaluate shifts in time series, but you can also apply it to shifts over space as in your data. (Actually, as there evidently is a mapping from distance along the fin to time, you could think of your data as a time series too.) The problem that you face is that there doesn't seem to be any simple expression that describes the shapes of these elemental profiles between potential discontinuities. So you need a method that allows for generic shape-fitting along with detection of one (or more, it seems from your data) change points. This page outlines ways to combine LOESS smoothing and change-point detection, with links to further reading and resources. Other threads on change-point methods might also be helpful.
