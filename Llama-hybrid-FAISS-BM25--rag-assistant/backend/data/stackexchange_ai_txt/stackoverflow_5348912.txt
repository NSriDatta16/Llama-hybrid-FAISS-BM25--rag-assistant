UIWebView intermittently denied access to html5 database storage

I have an iphone app that enables users to login via a native UIView on ios, that then fires up a UIWebView to display the main content. The webapp uses database storage to retain some of the content locally. However, every now and then, the webapp will fail to load when attempting to access the database with the following message appearing in the logs. ..... sandboxd[3203] : APPNAME(3201) deny file-write-create /Databases.db I am unable to reproduce the error with any consistency (at first I thought it would only happen in low-memory situations, but further tests have proved that it happens at other times also). The app is set up to retry with a new UIWebView if a failure like this happens, but I am noticing once it happens once, it will happen until the app is force-closed. Typically, once closed and re-opened, the app will work as usual. Memory footprint is quite low, and I have monitored for leaks not finding anything.
