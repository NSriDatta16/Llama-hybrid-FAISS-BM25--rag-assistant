How to standarize feature vector with data in different scales?

Let's suppose I have a dataset with numerical attributes of different types. Let's suppose I want to employ a Neural Network for supervised classification with that dataset. For that, I need to extract feature vectors from that data. Those feature vectors must be suitable for NNs. (should be normalized/standarized vectors...) As an example, our dataset consist of data from football games. DATASET: ------------------------------------------------------------------- | local_elo| vis_elo| local_pts | vis_pts | loc_goals | vis_goals | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | 2820 | 3250 | 45 | 54 | 13 | 17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | 4230 | 5125 | 87 | 81 | 67 | 65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------- The feature vectors this two data points: x_1 = [2820, 3250, 45, 54, 13, 17] x_2 = [4230, 5125, 87, 81, 67, 65] but they are not suitable for feed them into a Neural Network. How could this dataset be preprocessed in order to extract feature vectors suitables for feeding them into a Neural Network?
