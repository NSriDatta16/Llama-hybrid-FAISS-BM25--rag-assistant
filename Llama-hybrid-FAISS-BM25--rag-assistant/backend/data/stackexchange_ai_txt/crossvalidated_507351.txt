Bayes theorem is one of the many important concepts in the field of AI. And, for the varied application that it is used for, imagine of all the scenarios to which it has been and will be applied, what percentage of them ensure that a particular event will not occur? It rarely or never is the case, and it would be wrong to assume a probability of 0 for some event to occur â€” unless we are absolutely sure of it, and no more such related events are to occur, and the experiment is over. Suppose in an NLP task, where the aim is to correctly classify an email into spam and not spam. We base our model w.r.t. the words that we have seen in the training example. But it is absolutely not certain that the training set emails have all the words in the English vocabulary. And, while your training set had an email with the word "unfaithful" or "deceitful", the test set may throw you "amatorculist". Should a probability of 0 be assigned to the occurrence of this word? Well, it would be wrong to do so! Thus, it would be a wrong assumption about the hypothesis that the "amatorculist" will never occur. Most of the cases that you will find fall in the same line. And for the cases of AI, a probability of zero is seldom ever 0, as most of the time it is data dependent, and to have seen all of the data even for testing is never the case.
