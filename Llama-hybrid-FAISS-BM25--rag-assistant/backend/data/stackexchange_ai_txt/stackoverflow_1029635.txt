Convert a parameter entered as an integer to a string in JasperReports

I have a JRXML file that I use to generate a report built on a massive SQL query for an Oracle database. I have entered a parameter to the report that gets filled as an Integer. However, I would also like to reference this parameter as a String at a different point in the query. Is there a way I can convert the parameter from an Integer to a String within the organization of JasperReports or do I have to create a separate parameter to fill each time the report is generated?
