You are already using a popular and often very effective time series model: an autoregressive model of order two, typically referred to as AR(2). The only non-standard part of your procedure is that you have logit-transformed your data. You can assess the validity of your AR(2) model by examining the residuals in the same way as you would for any other regression model. For example the residuals of your AR(2) model should not be heteroscedastic or serially correlated. Autoregressive models belong to a wider class of linear time-series models called autoregressive-integrated-moving-average or ARIMA. These models are generally more complicated to fit than simple autoregressions, but statistics software packages such as R should be able to fit them out-of-the-box.
