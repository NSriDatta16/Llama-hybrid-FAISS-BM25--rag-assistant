a) You need to make the class public to run it: public class Test { b) the last semi-colon is a syntax error No it's not, it's just unnecessary noise. c) This fails with an IndexOutOfBoundsException : for(int j = 3; j It needs to be: for(int j = 3; j Explanation: List Indexes are zero-based, so the highest position in a List with n elements is n-1 BTW, the above code can be written in a more elegant way like this: Collections.fill(al.subList(3, al.size()), "z"); Reference: Collections.fill(List , T) List.subList(from, to)
