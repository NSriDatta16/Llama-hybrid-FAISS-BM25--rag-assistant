Throughout my research on this, I could not find an instance where UserControls could be managed without using System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlCollection because of the number of functions the assignment of a Control to the Add function provides. It was even worse when I began to incorporate the Designer into the equation. So I have decided to embrace the Controls property using the custom override I gave above. I will now need to keep my private level _tabPages synced with the Control Collection and not the other way around.
