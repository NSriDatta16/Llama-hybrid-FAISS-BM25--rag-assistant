What is out of time validation in logistic regression model?

I understand out of sample validation very well. Can you explain what is out of time validation? Context A team in my organization has build a churn model for a teleco. Churn rate is 27%. The models sensitivity (% of actual churners correctly predicted by the model) on out of sample(test) dataset was 70% but when they rolled out the model and tracked the result after 6 months accuracy is just 47%. Note: There is no campaign which is run till now, so we don't have any campaign start date or end date etc. Questions What is out of time validation? How to do out of time validation? My thought is doing an out of time validation would have helped identify the issue with the model before it was rolled out. Is it correct? Thanks
