jQuery: Add ui-close button to resizable/draggable?

How can I add a close button to a draggable/resizable div? I understand that I am essentially describing a dialog, but I have to be able to take advantage of a few of the properties of resizable/draggable (such as containment) that are not a part of dialog. Any ideas?
