Linq to Entities: How to copy records from one table to another efficiently?

We have an event system which organizes data by date and time. We frequently copy data from the old event to the new event as a starter, then modify it. This is what we do in Linq: Get the source objects locally with .ToList() For each item create a new object Copy the non-primary key values to the new object and set the new primary key Add that object to the table This generates a tremendous amount of database calls. It's wrapped in a transaction at least. This is the statement in SQL. Any way to make Linq that efficient without embedding SQL? insert into targetTable (eventID, two, three, four five) select @newEventId as eventID, two, three, four, five from targetTable where eventid = @eventid
