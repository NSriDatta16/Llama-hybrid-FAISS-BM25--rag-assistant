By setting the expiration of the HTML to the past, I'm assuming you're trying to prevent your HTML from being cached. Unfortunately, you cannot use the Expires directive as it only works for future dates. You can use header commands though to control how your HTML files are cached. FileETag None Header unset ETag Header set Cache-Control "max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" Header set Pragma "no-cache" Header set Expires "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT" The mod_headers module will need to be installed in Apache to use this method. EDIT: Alternatively, if you're using PHP, you can set these headers using PHP's header function. header("Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); header("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT");
