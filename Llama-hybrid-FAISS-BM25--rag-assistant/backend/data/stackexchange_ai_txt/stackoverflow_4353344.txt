DataBinding Between a WPF GUI and a couple of ListBox/CheckBox

The thing i want to do looks easy, but takes me a lot of time without any result.. =/ I'd like to have a WPF window which takes an object with some proprieties and used it to popolate a couple of item. In the specific the object recieved is so defined: public class ParameterForGraphicOptions { public List Variables { get; set; } public List Simulations { get; set; } public List ShowSimulations { get; set; } } public class VariablesOptions { public string Name { get; set; } public bool Show { get; set; } public bool Average { get; set; } public bool Var { get; set; } } And i'd like to populate 2 ListBox with Simulations and ShowSimulations, and also have another list which is connected to Variables Name and 3 check box which change their values when you change the selected item in the list.. The Windows code (.cs) follows: public GraphicOptions(ParameterForGraphicOptions pfgo) //NAME OF THE WINDOW { InitializeComponent(); //STD CALL this.DataContext = pfgo; //CONNECTING THE DATA CONTEXT } The XAML code for binding is this: Simulation in Progress Simulation to Show Variables to Show " Grid.Row="1" Height="35" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="145,30,0,0" Name="OneSimulation" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="35" /> " Grid.Row="1" Height="35" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="145,65,0,0" Name="AllSimulation" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="35" /> I tried in many ways, but always bind only a item, so I can't understand HOW this library works.. Many thanks 4 all :P The question is: is there any wrong thing in the code i posted? P.S.: Sorry for my English :P
