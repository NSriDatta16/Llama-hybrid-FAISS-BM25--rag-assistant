How you organize your data structures will be important. You may want to not only put your dictionary into a binary tree, as Zareth mentioned, but do the same with the article, so you can remove all duplicate words and have them sorted. This way when you start to search through the dictionary, if you go past the letters that your word starts with then you can quit, as the dictionary is sorted.
