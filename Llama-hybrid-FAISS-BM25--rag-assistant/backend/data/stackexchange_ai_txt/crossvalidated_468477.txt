Confused on ARIMA's linearity assumption

The AR(I)MA model or Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model is one of the most popular linear models in time series forecasting. In an AR(I)MA model, the future value of a variable is assumed to be a linear function of several past observations and random errors [ http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.3756&rep=rep1&type=pdf] . However in a lot of other papers I see have the feeling that the data is non-linear. Still they use this method and it produces good results ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9672/ad02c5c7a746658441d6a82221b0420207e0.pdf )? This ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEwLX.jpg ) is an example of my own data, which I assume to be non-linear aswell, thus explaining why the ARIMA models produces bad results. Am I misinterpreting what linear modelling is, or what am I missing here?
