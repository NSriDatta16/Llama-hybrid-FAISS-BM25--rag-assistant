Strongly discouraged. I'd recommend using a C-friendly format (e.g. CSVs) instead of XLS, or using the new XML formats (take your pick on XML and ZIP libraries). Still, for a quick fix, you could export to quoted CSV and then import using VBScript . Something like this , although I'd try to get it to work in VBA first. Note that this will require a copy of Office, and will not scale well (but you can hide the Excel window). I've just found xlsLib , so if you really need to write directly in C, give it a go! Be careful though, because it's very hard to get right, especially if you're writing to already-existing files. There also exists LibExcel , but that's C++, so you'd need to compile a wrapper around, or rewrite for C. One final caveat: the reason I didn't search for these at the start is that it's extremely difficult to get right. I have not used the libraries above, but I suspect they'll break in strange and unusual ways. I trust you've read Joel's take on the Office formats.
