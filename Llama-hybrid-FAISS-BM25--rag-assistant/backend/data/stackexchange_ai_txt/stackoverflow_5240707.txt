Update Here's something interesting; from Bug #6563939 Delay should be respected before hiding a JMenu , open since 2007 Javadoc might be misleading in this point. It says "before submenus are popped up or down". "Popping down" could be understood as "hiding", but it rather has the meaning of "submenu is rendered below his parent menu". It also seems to suggest that this depends on the L&F you're using , so it looks like more like something you can only request or hint at: Each look and feel (L&F) may determine it's own policy for observing the delay property. In most cases, the delay is not observed for top level menus or while dragging. This method is a property of the look and feel code and is used to manage the idiosyncracies of the various UI implementations.
