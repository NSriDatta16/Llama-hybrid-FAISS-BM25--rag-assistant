Linear mixed models in R

Here is a reproducible dataset : db = data.frame( condition = c("Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Experimental","Experimental","Experimental","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Experimental","Experimental","Experimental","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Experimental","Experimental","Experimental","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline","Experimental","Experimental","Experimental","Baseline","Baseline","Baseline"), partner = c("John","John","John","John","John","John","John","John","Albert","John","John","John","John","John","John","Albert","Charles","Charles","Jay","Jay","Jay","John","John","Albert","Charles","Charles","Jay","Jay","Jay","Charles","Charles","Jay","Jay","Jay","Albert","Charles","Charles","Jay","Jay","Jay"), time = sample(c(1:50),40)) I would like to test, for each partner , if they are spending significantly more time in Experimental condition than in Baseline condition . I believe this is done using the lmer function, here is what I have so far : library(lme4) m0 I do not know how to obtain a detailed list of p-values for each partner when comparing the Experimental against Baseline condition . Ideally, I would like to have an output as follows: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 167.217 167.979 212.490 0.995 0.32064 partnerJohn 125.674 50.390 212.490 2.494 0.01339 * partnerAlbert -70.225 233.364 212.490 -0.301 0.76377 partnerCharles -29.141 218.373 212.490 -0.133 0.89397 Could anyone give me some help as to which analysis I should use to get an output like this?
