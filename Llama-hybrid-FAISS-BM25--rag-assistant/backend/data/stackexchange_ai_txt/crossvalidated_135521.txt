Find Arima equation using auto.arima, daily long-term data (msts), 3 seasonal regressors, and calculating K in fourier

I am working with daily data (variables include: temperature, salinity, wind, etc...) from 2002-2013 ( msts ), and I want to identify the ARIMA equation describing the whole data set, while also considering covariates unique to each variable, then use the ARIMA equation to predict each variables' values 7 days into the future from specific starting points in the data set. Thus, tbats is not appropriate for me. First I need to define the "order" and "seasonal" values for my Arima equation using auto.arima . Additionally, I believe there is seasonality in the data that is weekly, monthly and yearly so I am defining multiple "seasonal periods" in auto.arima . Starting with predicting the temperature variable values, I am using xreg in the auto.arima function to include specified covariates, and want to also include the fourier / fourierf function for the dummy variables of month and year as well as a method for determining K. Ultimately, my R code should be written to consider long-term data (2002-2013), seasonality (3), dummy variables (Month and Year), and identify the K value for predictive purposes. Although I have found a lot of great help online, I cannot get my more complex code to work. http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/ (and other Hyndman posts for complex seasonality, forecasting, detecting seasonality, daily data, etc...) and Time Series Forecasting with Daily Data: ARIMA with regressor I am using these packages for various parts of the code development: library(MASS) library(mgcv) library(lattice) library(epicalc) library(caTools) library(forecast) library(McSpatial) My simple R CODE below works - although only has one seasonal period, and no fourier function or dummy variables included. Season The complex code below has the equation components I think I need, but it does not work... The K part is where things keep getting hung up... "Error in fourier(y, K = i) : unused argument (K = i)" . This happens anytime I use fourier . y Even if I use the code below to exclude the selection of the K value, it does not work?! y Where: Temperature = a column of values in deg C with x-rows Month = matrix of zeros and ones with x-rows Year = matrix of zeros and ones with x-rows Covariates = columns of values in appropriate units (i.e. Salinity (ppt), Wind (m/s)) with x-rows Thank you in advance for your help!
