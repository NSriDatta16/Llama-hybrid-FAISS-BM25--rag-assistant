Your choices are fairly binary: Use push notification Use Polling With Push Notification: You control when you contact your users... Heavy Load means you can slow updates down to avoid taxing your infrastructure Contrariwise, you have to push to clients that may not even be there anymore (And thus may need some sort of register model), high load may mean that clients don't get immediate update You can leverage things like Amazon's EC2 to give you more processing power Unless you're out of capacity, users are almost certain to be receiving updates as they happen To pick up messages missed while offline, the SERVER needs to know what message was last successfully received, store older messages and forward many all at once If you choose to use polling: You must have a stable address to be polled You need the ability to have lots of quick query connections checking for new data, then returning that data if required. If your application becomes popular enough you may find you don't have enough resources If your resources are taxed your application will go down, rather then just slow down You don't need to register clients and keep track of their on/offline state Parallelizing on the fly is a bit trickier To pick up older messages, the CLIENT needs to know when they last received a message and then request the server send any message since that time Both can be fast, but they come with different bandwidth and processing profiles. I prefer push for everything that's real-time.
