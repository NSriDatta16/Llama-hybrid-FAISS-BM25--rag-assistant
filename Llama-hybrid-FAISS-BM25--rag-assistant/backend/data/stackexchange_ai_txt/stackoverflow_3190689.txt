First off, I would suggest that you do one of two things: set your fields to disallow zero-length strings. That way you'd have to test only Is Null. if you feel you must allow storage of ZLS, then set the default value to a ZLS. It's still possible for the field to end up Null, though, so this may or may not be helpful. I don't see storage of ZLS's as having any utility whatsoever. It's almost always a shortcut to accomodate data being appended from sources that return ZLS's instead of Nulls for empty fields. You should also read up on Nulls. Allen Browne has a number of pages that explain it all quite well: Nulls: Do I need them? Common Errors with Null Aspects of working with Nulls in VBA code: Nothing? Empty? Missing? Null? The articles are Access-oriented, but could be valuable to those using any database, particularly relative novices because of the conversational style of the writing.
