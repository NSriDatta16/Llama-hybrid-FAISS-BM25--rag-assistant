PCA analysis takes into consideration only the first two moments of the (joint) distribution of the multivariate random variables. In fact the procedure relies on the definition of an Euclidean metric to measure distance between random distributions. If the underlying distributions are normal, then the analysis takes into consideration ALL the information available, as a multivariate normal distribution is described solely and uniquely by its mean and variance-covariance matrix. If the underlying distribution is NOT normal, conversely, you are, so to speak, ignoring information by applying a mean-variance method. For practical purposes, however, if the distributions are not too pathological (and your marginals do not seem so) PCA can still be reliably applied to obtain information about the statistical dependence of the different components. The only thing you have to remember, is that this characterization is not COMPLETE, in the sense that there could be some dependence in the higher moments of the variables that the variance analysis is not able to capture.
