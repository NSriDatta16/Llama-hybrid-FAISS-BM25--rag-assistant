I would use a pan gesture recognizer. The following code will simply move the view up and down along with the user's finger. If you want to limit how far up it moves, have it snap to place or have momentum you'll need to add to it. UIView * view; // The view you're moving CGRect originalFrame; // The frame of the view when the touch began - (void) pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)pan { switch (pan.state) { case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan: { originalFrame = view.frame; } break; case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged: case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded: { CGPoint translation = [pan translationInView:view]; CGRect frame = originalFrame; frame.origin.y += translation.y; view.frame = frame; } break; } }
