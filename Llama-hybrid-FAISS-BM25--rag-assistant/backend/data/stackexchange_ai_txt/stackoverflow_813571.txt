Embedding a Python shell inside a Python program

I am making a sort of a science lab in Python, in which the user can create, modify and analyze all sorts of objects. I would like to put a Python shell inside the program, so the user could manipulate the objects through the shell. (Note: He could also manipulate the objects through the usual GUI.) A mockup that illustrates this: http://cool-rr.com/physicsthing/physicsthing_mockup_thumb.gif How can I make this sort of thing? I considered using eval , but I understood that eval can't handle import , for example.
