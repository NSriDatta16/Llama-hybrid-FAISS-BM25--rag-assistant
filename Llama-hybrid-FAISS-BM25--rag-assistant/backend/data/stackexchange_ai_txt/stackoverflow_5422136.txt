Here's a little thing I like to use when dealing with situations like this. I know it doesn't really answer your question, but it is an elegant way of solving the comma problem. $comma = ''; foreach($settings as $setting => $value) { if (is_string($value)) { $value = "'" . $value . "'"; $output .= $comma . $setting . ':' . $value; $comma = ','; } } So on the first run $comma is blank, but after that it gets put between every new entry.
