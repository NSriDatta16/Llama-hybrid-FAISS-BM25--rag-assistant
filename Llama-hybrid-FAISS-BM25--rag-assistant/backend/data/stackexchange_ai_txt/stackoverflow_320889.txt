In general specificity is favourable, but at a heirarchy level more than a unit level. What I mean by that is that 'div' is superflous, and perhaps damaging (see next paragraph) but #foo .bar .baz is good practice. In general I try and get people to think about CSS in OO terms. If you're defining the style as a class make sure that it is behaving as a class. In this instance asserting div.foo instead of just .foo is a bit like having defined a subclass. It's fine if that's what you intend . Always always think about potential issues with future mark-up. Ideally you want future code to auto-inherit exactly what it needs, neither polluted by a vague CSS assertion, nor missing something because of an overly specific assertion. In practice I find you usually favour the form: #foo .bar {} Reserving root level classes for only the most generic of styles.
