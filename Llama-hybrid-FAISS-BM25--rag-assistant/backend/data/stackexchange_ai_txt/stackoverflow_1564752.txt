Add/Subtract GridLength in WPF

I have three columns containing two expanders in left and right columns. When both the expnders collapsed, I need to arrage the content in the middle column on the full window. For that I need to calculate the gridlengths. For Example GridLength w1= new GridLength( 20 ); GridLength w2= new GridLength( 50 ); GridLength w3= new GridLength( 0 ); How to get w3 = w2 - w1
