Document authorship attribution is a valuable technique in many areas such as plagiarism detection, and lawsuit prosecution. we have few research papers on source code authorship attribution. In these papers, we have discussed simple models such as Naive Bayes classifier and few advanced techniques such as Deep Learning. Though, our papers are specifically on source code authorship attribution, you can apply algorithms we discussed in our papers for general document classification problems. Good Luck!
