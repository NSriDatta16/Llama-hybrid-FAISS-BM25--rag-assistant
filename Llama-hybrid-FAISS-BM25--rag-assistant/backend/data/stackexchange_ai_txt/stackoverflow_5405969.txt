How to connect to newly installed Oracle XE instance?

I have installed Oracle XE on Win7 x64 machine. Installation completed successfully without problem, or perhaps installer didn't tell about them. But after installation I can't connect to database; its web interface is not working. I have looked through list of open ports, and there is no 8080 port as was noted during installation. Also I can't connect via SQLPlus. SQL> connect SYSTEM Enter password: ERROR: ORA-12638: Credential retrieval failed Somewhere in the web it was told to edit sqlnet.ora file, I have changed it in the following way: # SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (NTS) SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (NONE) and now I get next error SQL> connect SYSTEM Enter password: ERROR: ORA-01034: ORACLE not available ORA-27101: shared memory realm does not exist What do I need to change so that I can connect to it?
