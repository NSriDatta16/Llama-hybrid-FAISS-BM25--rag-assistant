All commercial tools have some +s's and -s's. Not all of them can be considered as an exact fit in an automation environment which an AUT requires. I have worked with all the big names it all depends on the automation Engineer how well He/She understands the concept and leverages the tool to the fullest. Last 5 years I came to the conclusion it is high time we divorce these Commercial tools and go after Open Source Why? I can customize the Open source to my needs. I know where and what went wrong and at the same time know how to fix it. I can customize things to the extent required write from planning to the execution to Reporting is in our control as automation engineers so creativity plays a role to implement the needs of the organization and the individuals who are affected by the automation testing.
