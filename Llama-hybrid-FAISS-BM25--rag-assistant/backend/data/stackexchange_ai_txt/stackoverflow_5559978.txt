Create class file in app/code/local/Varien/Data/Form/Element/ . Make sure the file name is prefixed with something that identify your module (this is just to differentiate your custom code from Magneto core files) class Varien_Data_Form_Element_MyDateSelection extends Varien_Data_Form_Element_Date { public function getElementHtml() { // define image url $this->setImage(Mage::getDesign()->getSkinUrl('images/grid-cal.gif')); // define date format $this->setFormat('yyyy-MM-dd'); return parent::getElementHtml(); } } Inside your module system.xml .... ... Run now myDateSelection 20 1 1 1 ... Placing custom code inside lib/ folder or app/Mage/Core/ folder is not the best way to create custom code for Magento. These folders are for core code and not custom code. This approach creates the least amount of code and does not change any of the core files. So, there isn't any harm from having extra file inside the lib/ folder. But you need to remember that you have extra file for your module in the lib/. Hope this helps
