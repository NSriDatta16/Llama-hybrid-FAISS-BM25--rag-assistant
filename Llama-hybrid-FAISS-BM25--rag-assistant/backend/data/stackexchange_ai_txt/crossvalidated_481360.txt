Hilbert space of random VECTORS?

I'm trying to break through H. Buehlmann and Gisler's Cource in credibility theory. At the page 183 they write that we have to show that $$ \boldsymbol \mu (\Theta_i)-\widehat{\widehat {\boldsymbol \mu(\Theta_i)}} \perp \boldsymbol X_{kj}$$ for all $k$ and $j$ . All these vectors are $p$ -dimensional random vectors, e.g. $$ \boldsymbol X_{kj}=(X_{kj,1}, \ldots, X_{kj,p})^T.$$ The authors write that projections of random vectors are to be understood componentwise. Hence I deduce that orthogonality is also to be understood componentwise and that the above means $$ \mathbb \mu_l(\Theta_i)-\widehat{\widehat {\mu_l(\Theta_i)}} \perp X_{kj,l},\ l=1,2,...,p.$$ But a moment later to prove this orthogonality the authors calculate a matrix of expectations $$ \mathbb E[ (\boldsymbol \mu (\Theta_i)-\widehat{\widehat {\boldsymbol \mu(\Theta_i)}}) \boldsymbol X_{kj}^T)] $$ (I suppose that for all $i,j$ , and $k$ ). I'm asking: why? Why do we calculate a whole matrix of expectations instead of a vector of expectations? I'm really confused becuase of the multitude of indices here :( I'm in a muddle. The authors don't explain this very thoroughly. On one hand if the matrix equals to 0 it implies that $$ \langle \mu_l(\Theta_i)-\widehat{\widehat {\mu_l(\Theta_i)}}, X_{kj,l} \rangle= \mathbb E[( \mu_l(\Theta_i)-\widehat{\widehat {\mu_l(\Theta_i)}}) X_{kj,l}]=0 $$ for all $l$ , but on the other hand the authors during their proof use the fact that $\boldsymbol B_i:=\mathrm {Pro}(\boldsymbol \mu(\Theta_i)|L_e ^{ind}(\boldsymbol X_i))$ (orthogonal prodjection) where $$\boldsymbol X_i:=(\boldsymbol X_{i1}, \ldots, \boldsymbol X_{in})$$ and hence (allegedly) $$ \mathbb E [(\boldsymbol \mu (\Theta_i)-\boldsymbol B_i)\boldsymbol X_{ij}^T]=\mathbb E [(\boldsymbol \mu (\Theta_i)-\boldsymbol B_i)\boldsymbol B_i^T].$$ If the orthogonality is to be understood componentwise I don't quite understand why this equation should be true since $$ \mathbb E [(\boldsymbol \mu (\Theta_i)-\boldsymbol B_i)\boldsymbol X_{ij}^T] $$ is a matrix -_- Can you help me?
