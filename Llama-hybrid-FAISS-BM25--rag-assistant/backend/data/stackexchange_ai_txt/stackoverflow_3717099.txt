Upcasting without retaining reference to derived type

I have a class called Resource , this is inherited by a class called ResourceMeta I need to upcast ResourceMeta to Resource without it still thinking it is a type of ResourceMeta . When I try to save my object using entity framework, it will complain about mappings not existing, rightly so because it will be trying to save ResourceMeta rather than Resource . I've tried (Resource)resourceMeta however this still retains the type of ResourceMeta just limits the properties available to Resource .
