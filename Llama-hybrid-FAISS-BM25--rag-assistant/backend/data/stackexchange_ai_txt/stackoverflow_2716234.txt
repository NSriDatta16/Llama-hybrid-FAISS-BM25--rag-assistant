Just don't write this method :) Any time some business logic needs to update specific fields on a person, update the specific fields on that person (and remember to update the datacontext before the http context is unloaded) You were on the right track when you said "Is that redundant since L2S already mapped my Person Table to a Class?". Just use the class that L2S has provided :) If you've got a (winforms) screen that needs to edit this 30 field person object, then the easiest thing to do is to databind the fields on your screen directly to the fields on linq to sql's Person object. Here's a typical screen's lifecycle: Your form is constructed (with a person ID) Your form's load event handler will retrieve a Person object from Linq to Sql: context.tblPersons.Single(x=>x.ID == personID) This Person will be set as the form's main BindingSource's DataSource A whole lot of textboxes on the screen will be setup to bind to each field on that person object, allowing the user to edit the properties directly (you can just drag a detailsview from the data sources tab onto your form in VS to do these automatically) When the user hits save, just call EndEdit on the DataSource, then SubmitChanges on the L2s Datacontext All going well, you should see new values in your database...
