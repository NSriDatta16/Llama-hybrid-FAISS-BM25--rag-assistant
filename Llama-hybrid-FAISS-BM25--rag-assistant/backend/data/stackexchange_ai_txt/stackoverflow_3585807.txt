If you're not aware of this already, there is a rather elegant way in CSS to create a rounded corner: -moz-border-radius: 15px; /* where the 15px is the degree of rounding */ border-radius: 15px; This is only supported in newer browsers (IE7, for example, will still have square borders). Additionally, I noticed you said that this was for a rounded title bar. Wouldn't it be easier if you just used a photo-editing software like GIMP or PS to create a rounded image? This would solve the problem of cross-browser compatibility as well as the problem of obtrusive JavaScript not gracefully degrading (if JavaScript is disabled, the user does not get the image!)
