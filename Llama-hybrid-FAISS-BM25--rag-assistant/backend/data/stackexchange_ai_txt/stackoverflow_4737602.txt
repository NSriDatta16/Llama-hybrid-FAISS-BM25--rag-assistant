Most likely it is related to the UseDevelopmentStorage=true for a connection string. I have accidentally done this a couple of times myself and things just magically don't work and there is no explanation. Missing DLL's are usually a little harder to track down as the application may or may not start depending on where the failure happens. Trace logging and/or infrastructure logging is the best way to find out if the DLL is missing if you can get your application to run that far. As pointed out already, the best place to start is making the simplest "Hello World!" you possibly can and start extending from there. Yes it will take you a while to make progress but the experiences you gain from this will be invaluable moving forward.
