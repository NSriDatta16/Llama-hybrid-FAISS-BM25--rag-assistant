Avoid losing PostBack user input after Auth Session has timed out in ASP.NET

I have a form that sits behind ASP.NET forms authentication. So far, the implementation follows a typical "out of the box" type configuration. One page allows users to post messages. If the user sits on that page for a long time to compose the message, it may run past the auth session expiration. In that case, the post does not get recorded... they are just redirected to the login page. What approach should I take to prevent the frustrating event of a long message being lost? Obviously I could just make the auth session really long, but there are other factors in the system which discourage that approach. Is there a way I could make an exception for this particular page so that it will never redirect to the Login so long as its a postback?
