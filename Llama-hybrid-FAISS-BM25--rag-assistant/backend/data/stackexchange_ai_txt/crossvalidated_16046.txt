Algorithms and methods for attribute/feature selection?

I have data with continuous class and I'm searching for good methods to reduce number of attributes. Now I'm using correlation based filters, random forests and Gramâ€“Schmidt algorithm. What I want to achieve is answer which attributes are more important/relevant to class attribute than others. By using methods that I mentioned before I can reach this goal, but is there any other good algorithms worth noticing?
