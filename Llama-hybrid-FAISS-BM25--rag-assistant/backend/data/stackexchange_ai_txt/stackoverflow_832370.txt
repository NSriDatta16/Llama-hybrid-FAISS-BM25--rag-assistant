Check out FogBugz (hosted or not). Hosted it's free for 2-3 users. For a free alternative, try Bugzilla . And of course there is Jira . Of the two commercial ones, FogBugz on the face of it is more expensive but there are several compelling advantages over Jira: option to have a hosted version (but at $25+ a seat per month, it doesn't come cheap); it includes the emailing component; it has a wiki (you would need Confluence - another commercial product - or some other Wiki with Jira that won't be as nicely integrated); it has project management features, namely evidence based scheduling. I've yet to see this used in a large project but it certainly would be interesting as it seems more flexible (and realistic) than the classic GANTT Chart approach; easily ability to upload screenshots (very useful for testers); opening a new case is as easy as sending an email bug request (and you don't need a license to do this but you do if you want to track it, be assigned it and so on); source control integration; and hosted version is free for up to 2 users. One comment I'll make is that I find the hosted version of FogBugz to be a bit... slow. It feels unresponsive. I've only ever used that version so I don't know how the local version compares but to me Jira seemed more responsive. The advantages of Jira are (imho): cost; it runs on any Windows, Mac OS X and Linux a rich set of plug-ins (particularly for Confluence). Bugzilla I know less about but it seems more narrowly focused on just tracking bugs whereas the other two have integrated a much broader range of features. There are of course other bug tracking tools not listed above but I know less about those.
