In addition to the 2 other suggestions (from Josh & Mick) you could display a placeholder in the xaml and then, in code, download the actual desired image in the background using HttpWebRequest . Then when the image has fully downloaded save it to isolated storage and then update the source to the displayed image. Yes this is more complex than the other solutions but would simplify the visual tree and avoid a blank image being displayed while the image is downloaded. It would also give you offline caching of images too.
