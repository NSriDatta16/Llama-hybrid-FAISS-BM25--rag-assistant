Well, the improvement you observe may be simply attibuted to having more training data , allowing to better exploit the capacity of your model: meaning better accuracy, and wider generalization. Another (or additional) option, is that the added noise regularizes your model making it more robust (and better on test-set.) If you increase the noise too much, you should observe decreasing performance. Also, Gaussian noise have the nice property of being zero-centered (i.e. its mean is zero) so that it cancels-out on average.
