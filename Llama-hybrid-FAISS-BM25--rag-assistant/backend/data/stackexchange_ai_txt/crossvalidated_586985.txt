Ulf Olsson (2005) $^{[1]}$ presents several possibilities of calculating confidence intervals for a lognormal mean. First, let's clarify the notation. Let $X$ be a random variable following a log-normal distribution with mean $\operatorname{E}(X)=\theta$ . Let $Y = \log(X)$ be the log-transformed variable which is normally distributed with mean $\operatorname{E}(Y)=\mu$ and variance $\operatorname{Var}(Y)=\sigma^2$ . The sample equivalents of the mean and variance of $Y$ are $\bar{y}$ and $s^2$ . We seek a confidence interval for the mean of $X$ , defined as $$ \operatorname{E}(X) = \theta = e^{\left(\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)} $$ A possible $(1 - \alpha)\,\%$ -confidence interval for $\log(\theta)$ is given by (see also Zhou et al. 1997 $^{[2]}$ ): $$ \bar{y}+\frac{s^2}{2}\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}+\frac{s^4}{2(n-1)}} $$ where $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the appropriate quantile of the standard normal distribution. The limits of this confidence interval are then back-transformed to give a confidence interval for $\theta$ . Olsson recommends using $t$ -quantiles with $n-1$ degrees of freedom instead of $z$ -quantiles: $$ \bar{y}+\frac{s^2}{2}\pm t_{1-\alpha/2, n-1}\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}+\frac{s^4}{2(n-1)}} $$ He found that this modification improved the performance, although the coverage probability was lower than nominal for $n . Let's inspect the performance of this formula in a very small simulation: # The function to calculate the CI ci_lnorm true_mean && ci[1] The simulated coverage for $n=10, \mu = 1, \sigma = 2.5$ is around $91.1\,\%$ based on $100\,000$ simulations.
