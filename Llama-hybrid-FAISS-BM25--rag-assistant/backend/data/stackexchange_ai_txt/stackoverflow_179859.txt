There is also available now the Managed Extensibility Framework ( www.codeplex.com/mef ) which allows you to leverage a rich plugin platform. You may also find that dependency injection is along the lines of something you could use ( Unity , StructureMap to name just two). You could create a plugin platform on top of a dependency injection framework, though a dedicated plugin platform like MEF will likely be easier to implement.
