Great questions! I'll do my best to answer them: Once you have selected feature 2 as the root and features 1 and 5 as the candidates for the first split , you need to determine whether node 1 should be the left or right node . To make this decision, you will split the data based on the values of feature 2 . Any data points with a feature 2 value less than or equal to the threshold value for node 1 will be assigned to the left node , and any data points with feature 2 value greater than the threshold value will be assigned to the right node . Once the data is split, you can calculate the Gini index for each child node using the remaining features . Node 5 is not automatically assigned to the left or right node after node 1 is determined. Instead, you will select a new random subset of the remaining 3 features (3, 4, 5) to create child nodes for node 1 . You will repeat the same process as before: Calculate the Gini index for each candidate feature. Select the feature with the highest Gini index as the next node Split the data based on the threshold value of that node. Then, you can calculate the Gini index for each child node using the remaining features. You will continue this process recursively until you reach a stopping criterion , such as a maximum depth of the tree or a minimum number of samples per leaf node . Each decision tree in the random forest will be trained on a bootstrapped sample of the training data. The final prediction will be the mode (for classification) or mean (for regression) of the predictions from all the trees in the forest .
