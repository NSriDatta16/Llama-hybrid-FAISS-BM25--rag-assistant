Python exception backtrace tells me where line ends, where does it begin?

When A Python exception is thrown by code that spans multiple lines, e.g.: myfoos = [foo("bar", "baz", "quux", i) for i in range(10)] Python will report the line number of the last line, and will show the code fragment from that line: Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 4, in i) for i in range(10)] NameError: name 'foo' is not defined Is there any way to determine what the first line is? Is there any way to catch the exception and manipulate the traceback object to be able to report something like this instead: Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", lines 1-4 in myfoos = [foo("bar", "baz", "quux", i) for i in range(10)] NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
