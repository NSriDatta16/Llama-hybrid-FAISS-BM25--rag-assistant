Quoting Steve Waldman (C3P0 Developer) in the Hibernate forums : re: why c3p0? mostly because it began as an attempt to see how hard it would be to implement connection pooling as defined by the JDBC 3.0 specification. Connection Pooling 3.0 --> cp30 --> c3p0. Also, I was working on a (never completed, and now obseleted) project for easy-to-use access to berkeley db from java, and that was called bdbd. A robot in an old television show (Buck Rogers) always said "bdbd", and c3p0 was a robot too. The pairing of names was a private little joke.
