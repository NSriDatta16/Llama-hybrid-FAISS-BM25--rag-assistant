Another aspect of reducing packet loss is to mediate the rate at which you send packets. If you are sending data faster than the bottleneck point on the path can handle, this will become apparent as dropped packets. Even if your average data rate is quite low, you may still be sending bursts of packets in quick succession. TCP handles this by limiting the number of outstanding, unacknowledged data bytes to a value called the congestion window. The congestion window starts off small, and is slowly increased until packet loss occurs, at which point it is scaled back (progressively more so if packet loss continues to occur). You could implement something similar, if in your protocol the sender is notified of packet loss.
