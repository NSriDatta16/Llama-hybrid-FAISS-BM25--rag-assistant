There are two things to consider here: Checking if the file exists via its attributes is potentially many orders of magnitude faster - If a file exists on a 'slow' file system - tape, network storage, cd etc then opening the file will involve an actual round trip to the files location. The files attributes on the other hand are queried and cached by the filesystem drivers when the directory is queried, so probing file attributes involves a once off directory enumeration cost - meaning far fewer round trips - which can be a significant saving if multiple "slow" files are being checked. However, the files attributes merely indicate that the file existed at the time the call was made. The file can be deleted, or you might not haver permissions to access it. If you are about to try and open the file anyway, it would be better to dispense with the file attributes check and actually try and open the file.
