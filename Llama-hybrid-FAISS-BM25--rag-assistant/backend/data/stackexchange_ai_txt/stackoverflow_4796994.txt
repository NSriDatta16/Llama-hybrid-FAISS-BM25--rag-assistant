Embed Word document preview in WinForms app

How can I embed a word document in a form or usercontrol like the explorer preview panel does? I found this topic and they say DSOFramer isn't available any more, but what should I use now? A third party tool is only acceptable if its free. The only thing I noticed was that prevhost.exe starts a winword.exe process with the -Embedding command switch, but I can't find any information on this switch.
