Your approach seems reasonable. Acknowledging Savage Henry's answer, your model restricts attention to within-region variation. I would like to add a few additional points: If you can acquire data on tourism rates for additional locales/regions unexposed to the economic crisis, then you could supplement your fixed effects analysis with other regression techniques such as difference-in-differences, which is a special case of fixed effects and a very powerful approach for estimating treatment effects. However, if the event (treatment) you are investigating affected all regions within a particular country, then this might not be a worthwhile endeavor. You should also consider modeling the passage of time. You could enter time (year) into your model as a continuous linear time index. However, incorporating year fixed effects (i.e., $T-1$ dummies for years) introduces problems as your binary treatment (i.e., economic crisis) exhibits the same pattern across all regions. If I interpreted your question correctly, the change in treatment status occurs at the same time for all regions in your sample. Thus, the binary treatment 'turns on' (i.e., changes from 0 to 1) in the year 2000 and 'stays on' until 2010. Depending upon the ordering of your input variables, software may omit one additional year effect (resulting in only $T-2$ year effects), or it may drop your treatment dummy entirely. You could also investigate possible differences in treatment intensity. Ultimately, this requires intimate knowledge of the treatment under evaluation. There might have been a greater dose of economic hardship experienced in a subset of regions. What about the lasting effects of the economic depression on tourism rates? You could investigate this with a good visual plot of the region-specific tourism trends. I hope some of these suggestions help.
