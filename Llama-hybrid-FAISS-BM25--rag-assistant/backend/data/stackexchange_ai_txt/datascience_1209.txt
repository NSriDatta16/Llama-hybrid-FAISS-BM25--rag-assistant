coursera should be a good start. i have seen machine learning on their course list if im not mistaken. once you get the hang of it, a machine learning classic text like "machine learning and pattern recognition" by bishop or other texts can familiarize you with different classes of algorithms. if you want to go in depth, mathematics is a must, but if you just want to get familiar and use the algorithms there's absolutely no need for it
