Is an algorithm to judge the age of person in a photo feasible?

My friend works for a non-profit organization working to stop the illegal exploitation of minors over sites such as craigslist.org, which is one of the more popular mediums. The question is whether or not it is possible, now or in the near future, to develop an algorithm to analyze a photo of a person and return a prediction of their relative age. It sounds like a mammoth task. My only thought was some sort of Bayesian probability system. I know even people often have trouble judging someone's age but Bayesian spam filters are advertised as being "10 times as accurate as a human" so maybe it's possible? I am pretty inexperienced though. I would appreciate it if someone else could suggest whether or not this is feasible and if so how and when? EDIT: Thank you everyone for the responses. Smoore that study was very helpful but I think Hal's solution is the most practical for the time being.
