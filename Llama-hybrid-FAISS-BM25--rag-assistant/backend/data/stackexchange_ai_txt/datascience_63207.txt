Euclidean distance simply refers to a metric of a specific type (a line between two points in a Euclidean space). Whereas RMSE is an error function for a specific purpose (the square root of the average squared distance between the actual score and the predicted score). Where you may be getting confused is that RMSE is an example of a Euclidean distance between two regressions by averaging they specific vector errors over a whole regression, see here for a more in depth summary. To summarise, RMSE is a type of Euclidean distance, but there are others. The rest of your question of a specifc loss function for your problem, like you said, is very problem specific. I suggest posting a specific question with more details of your specific problem and solutions you've considered (need more details than above) to try and find a good loss function. Hope that helps.
