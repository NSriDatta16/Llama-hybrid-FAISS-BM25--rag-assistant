How to report the results of a cross-validation to a paper: Can I manually select the best results?

Good morning. With regard to the interpretation of the results of the N-fold cross-validation with over-sampling (SMOTE), I raise the question to write up the paper. Currently, I have performed 5-fold cross validation by randomly shuffling the patients for a model that predicts the patient's prognosis (good vs. poor) and have thus obtained five AUCs. The average AUC for this was derived to be around 0.90, but my concern is that whenever I perform 5-fold cross-validation and over-sampling, the subject used for training/testing also varies randomly, with an average AUC of 0.85 to 0.96. In this case, when writing a paper, I wonder if there is a problem in selecting a case where the mean AUC is the best. (In the case of related papers I have literature review, they had simply passed the "cross-validation showed the stable result (AUC ** - **).") It would be very helpful if you let me know.
