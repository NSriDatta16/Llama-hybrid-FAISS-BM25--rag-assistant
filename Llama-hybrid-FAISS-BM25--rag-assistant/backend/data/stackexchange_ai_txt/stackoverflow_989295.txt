One possible difference is the initial working directory: if you drag a file onto the executable, the initial working directory is set to the directory containing the executable, whereas if you double click the file, the initial working directory is set to some default value independent of where the file or executable is located. If you want to get consistent behavior in all cases, you can use SetCurrentDirectory() to set the current working directory to whatever you want; I recommend the directory containing the executable, which can be found by calling GetModuleFileName(NULL, ...) and stripping off the executable name, or by examining argv[0] inside main() .
