Just to clarify some language: the principal components don't get rotated: they are the rotation. When you transform your data using PCA, if you keep all the principal components, the new transformed data is equivalent to a rotation onto the basis defined by the principal components . So, can you fit your model in the rotated basis? Sure. In fact, this is actually one method used to deal with multicollinearity, since the components of the new basis are necessarily going to be orthogonal. Now, all that said: it's still not clear to me what you are trying to do with PCA, so I'm not sure if this answers your question.
