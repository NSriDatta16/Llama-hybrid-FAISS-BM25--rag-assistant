How ANN is used for classification?

I am reading about artificial neural networks and it is said that ANN is used for prediction after training with training data. It is also given that ANN is used for classification. Say I have data consisting of input as ( $\theta$ , sin( $\theta$ )) and output as -1 if it is in upper half of sin wave and +1 if it is in lower half. Here is it guaranteed that a trained neural network will always produce output as +1 or -1 (i.e. classify as +1 or -1)? If not, then how is ANN used for classification?
