This is because C_Foo does not exist as a class. C_Foo is the real class and has nothing to do with a C_Foo , these are totally different classes. A template is a tool for the compiler to duplicate code, it is not a real class like generics can be in Java or C#. If you look again at your code by thinking that C_Foo , C_Foo and C_Foo are totally different classes and have nothing in common, then you understand why you can't do what you want the way you want. Like strager said, just use a real base class as the common class
