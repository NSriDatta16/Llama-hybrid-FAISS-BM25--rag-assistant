userInteractionEnabled is not a method but a property. But I think you will want to set this to YES to allow events to get through to the UIView superview. What you might want to do is override the touchesBegan:withEvent: method of the UIView that contains your UIButton and UILabel subviews. Within this method, test if any of the UITouch touches fall inside the bounds of the UILabel . That is, does the CGPoint element [touch locationInView] intersect with with the CGRect element [infoLabel bounds] ? Look into the function CGRectContainsPoint to run this test. If so, then fire off an NSNotification that calls the same IBAction selector as the UIButton .
