How to create a model with mixed regression and classification output in sklearn

In sklearn, there are MultiOutputRegressor and MultiOutputClassifier. We can use them to output only regression or only classification, but what if we want to output a combination of regression and classification? Do I need to create separate models? In tensorflow, we can branch the architecture. I would like to do regression and classification prediction in one model in this way. It was also pointed out to me that I need to be more specific about my problem, which I will explain below. The closest example to the problem I am facing is the following. It is to predict age and gender from mugshots using the UTKFace dataset. https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/ This problem is a mixture of regression and classification. In the case of deep learning, we know that with Keras we can use approaches such as https://machinelearningmastery.com/neural-network-models-for-combined-classification-and-regression/ So, what about machine learning? I found a reasonable approach in sklearn, but I don't think it assumes the case where regression and classification are mixed. How can I solve this kind of problem in machine learning with one model? Or do I need to have more than one model? Thanks in advance.
