Shall I use daily or monthly data for demand forecasting?

Let's say we want to forecast sku-level demand one year and four months ahead, and we have daily demand data for the last 3 years. Taking into account that most daily time series at sku-level contain many zeros. Is it better to group the demand by month and forecast 16 months ahead? With the time series showing lumpy and erratic demand patterns, which model is appropriate for demand forecasting? Taking into account that we only have 3 years of daily data, how would you split the dataset if we grouped it as monthly data? Would it be logical, taking into account that we do not have enough monthly data and that we are talking about product demand, to have the 33 months as train and the rest as test, and look for a model that predicts well at least the first 6 months?
