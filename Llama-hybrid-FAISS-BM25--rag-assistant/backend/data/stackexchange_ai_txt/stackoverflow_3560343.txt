What size is considered 'big' for the tbl_version table in TFS_Main database

We are currently experiencing significant waits in TFS database, and are trying to understand if these are as a consequence of the size of the tbl_Version version history table in the database. Currently this table contains just over 20 million records, and is taking up approximately 6GB of storage space (total index space is just over 10GB). Looking at the queries that SQL Server is having to deal with, we have high PAGEIOLATCH_SH waits whenever this table is accessed. Obviously we don't have control over the queries being thrown at the database (all part of TFS). Currently we have TFS on a Virtual Machine, and in essence want to get to understand whether we should (a) move to a physical machine, (b) attempt to reduce size of tbl_version or (c) follow a combination of these. In our organisation it will be non-trivial to move to a physical server, so I'd like to get a feel for whether our table sizes are 'normal' or not before making any such decision.
