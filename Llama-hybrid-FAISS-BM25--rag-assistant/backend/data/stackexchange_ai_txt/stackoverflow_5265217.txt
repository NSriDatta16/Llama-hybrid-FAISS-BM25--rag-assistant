canvas drawing Paint loop code

I'm drawing circles to the canvas every time I touch the screen. I add them to an arraylist of paths in the onTouch method. In my onDraw method, I loop through the array, drawing them. When I try to change the paint of one of the circles, it changes them all. I don't want this, just want it to apply to one specific circle. How can I do that? Code: //on touch method case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: mode = Drag; x =(int) event.getX(); y =(int) event.getY(); path = new Path(); path.addCircle(event.getX(), event.getY(), 8, Path.Direction.CCW); mpaint.setARGB(255, mcolor[0],100, mcolor[2]); circle.add(path); invalidate(); //on draw method for (Path c : circle) { canvas.drawPath(c, mpaint); }
