svn repo for Magento is very slow!

I'm working on building a website using Magento eCommerce. I set up a subversion repo on the server for the website including all Magento PHP files and checked out a copy to my local system using svn/webdav. I've added magento to the repo and committed. Now, any svn opearation, even an svn status or svn commit , building the list of files so I can enter a commit message, takes forever . I mean upwards of 10 minutes, even if I only changed one file. Any ideas on what could be wrong/how to troubleshoot/how to fix/suggestions? Thanks!
