is there a more elegant way to generate the search indices I don't think there's a more elegant way. Your code is very simple and clear. maybe without defining a special function? Yes, that's definitely possible. >>> [b for a in ((x,-x) for x in range(1, 10 + 1)) for b in a] [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 5, -5, 6, -6, 7, -7, 8, -8, 9, -9, 10, -10]
