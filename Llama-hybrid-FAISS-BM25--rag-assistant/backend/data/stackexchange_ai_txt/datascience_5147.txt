Data Science Methodologies

What are the best known Data Science Methodologies today? By methodology I mean a step-by-step phased process that can be used for framing guidance, although I will be grateful for something close too. To help clarify, there are methodologies in the programming world, like Extreme Programming, Feature Driven Development, Unified Process, and many more. I am looking for their equivalents, if they exist. A google search did not turn up much, but I find it hard to believe there is nothing out there. Any ideas?
