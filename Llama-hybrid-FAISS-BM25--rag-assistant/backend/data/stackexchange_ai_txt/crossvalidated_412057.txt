There are many traditional statistical approaches here, and none are a silver bullet for every circumstance. Sax and Steiner (2013; PDF link ) collect several methods in the R package tempdisagg , namely Denton, Denton-Cholette, Chow-Lin, Fernandez and Litterman. [...] On the one hand, Denton (Denton, 1971) and Denton-Cholette (e.g. Dagum and Cholette, 2006) are primarily concerned with movement preservation, generating a series that is similar to the indicator series whether or not the indicator is correlated with the low frequency series. Alternatively, these methods can disaggregate a series without an indicator. On the other hand, Chow-Lin, Fernandez and Litterman use one or several indicators and perform a regression on the low frequency series. Chow-Lin (Chow and Lin, 1971) is suited for stationary or cointegrated series, while Fernandez (Fern√°ndez, 1981) and Litterman (Litterman, 1983) deal with non-cointegrated series. Also see Montazerin and Zarandi (2015, abstract ) which discusses temporal disaggregation of natural gas time series specifically.
