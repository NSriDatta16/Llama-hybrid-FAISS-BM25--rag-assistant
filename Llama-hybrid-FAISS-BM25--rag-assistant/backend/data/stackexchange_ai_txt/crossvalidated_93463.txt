There are roughly three kinds of datasets: cross section: different subjects at the same time; think of it as one row with many columns corresponding to different subjects; time series: the same subject at different times; think of it as one column with rows corresponding to different time points; panel (longitudinal): many subjects at different times, you have the same subject at different times, and you have many subjects at the same time; think of it as a table where rows are time points, and columns are subjects.
