Feature with very few extreme values

As a set of inputs into a machine learning model with ~10 million samples, I have a feature that exhibits a pretty extreme shape. Most of the values (98.5%) are 0, but those that aren't 0 tend to be very extreme, as high as on the order of 1e9. Despite the overwhelming number of 0s, the mean is 2.59e4 and the variance is 7.92e5. If anything, should I apply some sort of transformation to this dataset? Maybe something like a log transformation? How should I think of something like this?
