Code coverage doesn't mean anything, if your tests contain bugs, or you are testing the wrong thing. As a related tangent; I'd like to remind to you that I can trivially construct an O(1) method that satisfies the following pseudo-code test: sorted = sort(2,1,6,4,3,1,6,2); for element in sorted { if (is_defined(previousElement)) { assert(element >= previousElement); } previousElement = element; } bonus karma to Jon Skeet, who pointed out the loophole I was thinking about
