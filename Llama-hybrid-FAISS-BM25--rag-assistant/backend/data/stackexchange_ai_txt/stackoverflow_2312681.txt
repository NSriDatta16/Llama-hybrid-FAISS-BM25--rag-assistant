Unable to create a .xcdatamodel file in Xcode

I am trying to add a data model to an existing Xcode project. I am doing so by... File -> Add Files... -> iPhone OS/Resource/Data Model -> next -> (name the model) -> Next -> Finish. What I get is an empty blue folder named mymodelname.xcdtamodel and no editor. I tried creating a new windows based (use core data for storage checked) project with the same name as the project I am working on. This properly creates the .xcdatamodel file. I thought I could then add this .xcdatamodel file to my real project, but when I do it shows up as a folder with 2 files in it, none of which will give me an editor. I am stumped. What am I doing wrong? Any ideas for a workaround? Thanks, John
