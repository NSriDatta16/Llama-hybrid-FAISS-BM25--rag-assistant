The plugin itself is really trivial, about 50 lines of code: http://repo.pragprog.com/svn/Public/plugins/annotate_models/lib/annotate_models.rb You can easily adjust do_annotations method to read input parameter (or, maybe, just hardcode your model name in there). But no, I don't see model-selection functionality in there right now.
