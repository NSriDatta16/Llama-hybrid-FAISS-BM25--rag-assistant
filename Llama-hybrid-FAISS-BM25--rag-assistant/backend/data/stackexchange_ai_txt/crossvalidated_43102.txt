Good F1 score for anomaly detection

I will be running a machine learning anomaly detection algorithm on some data. It's a binary classification problem: each data point is either anomalous or normal. I have some known anomalous data that I can use in testing the features I select. I will be using the F1 score for testing the features I've selected for this algorithm. What would be considered a good F1 score?
