You could build a random forest where each of your classes is a group of items (i.e. "green apples with farmed strawberries, with 2% milk"). Then, based on the characteristics of the shopper or whatever your predictors are, you can provide a predicted probability of purchase for each group of items. I would use R's randomForest package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html ) to do this.
