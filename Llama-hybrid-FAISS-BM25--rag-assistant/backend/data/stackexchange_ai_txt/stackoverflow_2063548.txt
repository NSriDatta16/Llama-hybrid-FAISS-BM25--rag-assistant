Trac - Windows - How's trac projects organized?

I'm following official guide to install Trac on windows xp. Now all were installed, and i am told to do trac-admin c:\trac initenv As i have multiple SVN repositories organized like ../SVN/Repository/project 1 ../SVN/Repository/project 2 ../SVN/Repository/project 3 My question is if the folder 'trac' will be a root folder that holds all my projects, in this case, i would name the folder 'projects'. But if it is not the root, i think i should name it by the project name say 'project 1' ? And if the latter is right, does it mean i should run several times "trac-admin c:\projectname initenv" for my projects ?
