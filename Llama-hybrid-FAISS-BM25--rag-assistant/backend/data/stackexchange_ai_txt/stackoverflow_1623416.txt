Let me point out an extremely interesting method of calculating an inverse square root 1/sqrt(x) which is a legend in the world of game design because it is mind-boggingly fast. Or wait, read the following post: http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-quakes-fast-inverse-square-root/ PS: I know you just want the square root but the elegance of quake overcame all resistance on my part :) By the way, the above mentioned article also talks about the boring Newton-Raphson approximation somewhere.
