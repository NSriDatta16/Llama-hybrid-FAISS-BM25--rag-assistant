Is there any model agnostic way to calculate the weight importance for neural networks given a set of inputs?

I was curious if it's possible to calculate what weights are important and what weights are redundant (or have high redundancy) for separate tasks in neural networks? And if this is doable in a model agnostic way (maybe also differentiable..)?
