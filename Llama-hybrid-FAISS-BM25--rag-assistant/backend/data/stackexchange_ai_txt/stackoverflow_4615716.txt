I have several hudson jobs per projects: A main job that just builds the project and runs the tests. If it succeeds, it launches the following jobs: A code metrics job (PMD, FindBugs, Cobertura, CheckStyle, also JavaDoc generation) and A deploy job that builds the project using mvn package -DskipTests and deploys the war on tomcat I find that separating these made things easier, only the first job listens for SCM changes. However, another way would be to let the 3rd job also listen to the SCM (but with a longer interval, perhaps an hour).
