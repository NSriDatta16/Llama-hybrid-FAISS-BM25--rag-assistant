How to manage Tomcat 6 libraries into subfolders under %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib?

I use Tomcat 6.0.20 and JDK 1.6.0.13. How can I load libraries from sub-folders of %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib/ without taking the .jars out of sub-folders and putting them straight into %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib/ ? The reason I want to do this, is because many apps are going to be sharing lots of libraries. So, for the sakes of organization I want to store them into folders as such: %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib/novell/*.jar %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib/mail/*.jar %TOMCAT_HOME%/lib/upload/*.jar etc. How would I go about this? And please provide an example. Do I use setclasspath.bat, catalina.properties or something completely different? Thanks in advance.
