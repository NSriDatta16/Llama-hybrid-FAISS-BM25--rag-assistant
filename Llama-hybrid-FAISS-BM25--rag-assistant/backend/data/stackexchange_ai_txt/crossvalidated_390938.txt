Not at all. I see no reason why such result can be equivalent to the assumptions made for an unbiased estimator in diff-in-diff regressions, namely: 1) a correctly specified equation; 2) average of error term equals zero and 3) error term not correlated with independent variables (the paralell-trend assumption). This result you observe do not replace any of these assumptions, let alone all of them. Please refer to these notes for more details.
