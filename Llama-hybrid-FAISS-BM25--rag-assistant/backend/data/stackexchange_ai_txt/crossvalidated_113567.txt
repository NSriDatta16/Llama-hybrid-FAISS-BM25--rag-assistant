Optimize number of layers and neurons with an optimization algorithm

I have a neural network that i want optimize number of hidden layers and neurons in every layer using an optimization algorithm like Imperialist competitive algorithm . As you know i should set limits of every variable for optimization. I can have maximum 2 layers. Besides this my system select best composition of features (among 21 features) based on cost function of my neural network (5-fold cross validation on test data) using that optimization algorithm. So my optimization algorithm has 21+2 variables. 21 for features and 2 for number of neurons in every layer. What is your idea and what do you recommend for boundary of number of neurons in every layer? I'm using patternnet in MATLAB . As you know we have difference composition of features and neural structure in calling cost function by optimization algorithm.
