Using the ternary operator is the most simple, most efficient, and most readable way to do what you want. I encourage you to use this solution. However, I can't resist to propose an alternative, contrived, inefficient, unreadable solution. int boolToInt(Boolean b) { return b.compareTo(false); } Hey, people like to vote for such cool answers ! Edit By the way, I often saw conversions from a boolean to an int for the sole purpose of doing a comparison of the two values (generally, in implementations of compareTo method). Boolean#compareTo is the way to go in those specific cases. Edit 2 Java 7 introduced a new utility function that works with primitive types directly, Boolean#compare (Thanks shmosel ) int boolToInt(boolean b) { return Boolean.compare(b, false); }
