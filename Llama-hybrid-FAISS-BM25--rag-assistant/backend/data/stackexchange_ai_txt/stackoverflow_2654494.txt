I am the author/maintainer of sharppcap/packet.net . I have a few classes that perform tcp reassembly and http parsing that are in use in a complex network monitoring app to identify and follow http sessions . These are fully unit tested and well commented. They are available for licensing either at the binary or source level. Edit: Why vote this down? It took hundreds of hours to develop the code and tests and it's a drop in solution that has been reused. It's certainly worth considering before re-implementing the same functionality.
