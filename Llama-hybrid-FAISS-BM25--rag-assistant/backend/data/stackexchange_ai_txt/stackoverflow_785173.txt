I am not a fan of having all sort of logic and functionality banged into one line. The example you have shown is a mess and could be broken down into several lines, using meaningful variable names and performing one operation after another. I strongly recommend , in every question of this kind, to have a look (buy it, borrow it, (don't) download it (for free)) at this book: Robert C. Martin - Clean Code . It is a book every developer should have a look at. It will not make you a good coder right away and it will not stop you from writing ugly code in the future, it will however make you realise it when you are writing ugly code. It will force you to look at your code with a more critical eye and to make your code readable like a newspaper story.
