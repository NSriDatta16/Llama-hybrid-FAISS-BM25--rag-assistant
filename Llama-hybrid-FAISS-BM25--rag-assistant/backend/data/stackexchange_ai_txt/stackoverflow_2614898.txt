If you are having problem with sizes, then you are either specifying the wrong size, or else, you have some layout manager that is taking over and changing the sizes. If you are building the GUI yourself without any use of Drag Drop facilities like Netbeans and Eclipse provide, you might want to use this: vehicleListPanel.setLayout(null); This leaves everything up to you though. Just like Sanoj said, it would be helpful if you gace us some code.
