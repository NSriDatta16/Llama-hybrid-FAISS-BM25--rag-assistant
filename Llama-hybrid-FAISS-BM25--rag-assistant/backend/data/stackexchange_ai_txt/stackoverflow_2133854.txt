Shrinking iPhone Memory?

I have noticed in my application that didReceiveMemoryWarning gets called much faster if my phone has not been powered down for a long time. It almost seems like the pool of memory that my application can access shrinks with time. Has anyone else noticed this and is there an explanation for it? Is there a course of action that I can take to keep this from happening? I notice this happening when I use a good chunk of memory taking and manipulating a picture. Powering down and rebooting the phone helps out. Is it possible that the memory that my application can access is shrinking or maybe the existing memory is fragmented and rebooting defrags the existing memory? Any explanation or help with this issue would be great. Thanks.
