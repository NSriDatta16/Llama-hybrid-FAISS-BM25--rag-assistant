I wouldn't use an average, I would do a distribution graph first and find out the distribution of values..and then adjust the percentage cut-off to whatever goals you are trying to accomplish. An average can be really skewed by a few outlying lengths. You may find out, for example, that 95% of your notes are under xxx length, and if you can live with xxx, then 95% of your notes will be fully displayed.
