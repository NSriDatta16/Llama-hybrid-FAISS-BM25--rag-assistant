degrees of freedom in a t-test in Kruschke's BEST paper

This question is based on a comment by John Kruschke in his BEST paper, pages 589-590. Kruschke, John K. "Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test." Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 142.2 (2013): 573. Consider...a case in which there is a windfall of data, perhaps caused by miscommunication so two research assistants collect data instead of only one. That is, the researcher intended to collect $N = 8$ per group, but the miscommunication produced $N = 16$ per group. Most analysts and all statistical software would use $N = 16$ per group to compute a p value. This is inappropriate, because the space of possible $t_{null}$ values from the null hypothesis should actually be dominated by the intended sampling scheme, not by a rare accidental quirk. Why should we take $N=8$ instead of $N=16?$ Yes, I see that Kruschke says "the space of possible $t_{null}$ values from the null hypothesis should actually be dominated by the intended sampling scheme, not by a rare accidental quirk," but why?
