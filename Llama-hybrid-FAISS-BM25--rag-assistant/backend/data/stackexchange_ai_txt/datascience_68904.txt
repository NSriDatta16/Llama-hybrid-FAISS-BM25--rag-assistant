Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with AUC/ROC with multiclass or multi-label tasks myself. According to this question and its answers , the case of multiclass classification doesn't seem that simple. I would be very cautious about simply averaging values across classes, because the properties of AUC/ROC would problably not hold in general. That being said, in case the method mentioned for multiclass is considered sufficient, then there's no reason not to use the same for multi-label: counting each instance N times for N classes is already what you do (or should do) in the multiclass case: the instances not relevant for a class are actually counted as true negatives. ROC curves are by nature built for a binary classification task, which means that every instance is classified as exactly one of the four possibilities True/False Positive/negative.
