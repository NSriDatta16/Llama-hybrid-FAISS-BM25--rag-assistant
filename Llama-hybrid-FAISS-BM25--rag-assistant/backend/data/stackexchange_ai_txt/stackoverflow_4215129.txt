When the admin section redirects back to the dashboard, it is often because there was an exception or an error while loading the page. Try enabling logging and checking your logs to see if you had an exception. If that doesn't work, Alan Storm has a plugin to view routes that you may want to try. As a slightly murkier possible cause, do you have safe URLs turned on right now? If your admin URLs have long alphanumeric tokens specified, you do. Your form may need to specify a token in order for Magento to allow access to that URL. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe UPDATE: For the "secret key", it looks like URLs should be run through Mage_Adminhtml_Model_Url::getUrl . This function contains a method getSecretKey that seems to append a key based on whether the keys are enabled. Also take a look at Mage_Core_Model_Session::getFormKey , which is referenced by adminhtml/url. This should give you more insight into how those URLs are generated.
