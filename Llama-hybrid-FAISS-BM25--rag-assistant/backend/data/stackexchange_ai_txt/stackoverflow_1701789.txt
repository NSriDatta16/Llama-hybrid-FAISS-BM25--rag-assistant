PHP array callback functions for cleaning output

I have an array of output from a database. I am wondering what the cleanest way to filter the values is example array Array ( [0] => Array ( [title] => title 1 [cat_title] => Drawings [sec_title] => Portfolio ) [1] => Array ( [title] => title 2 [cat_title] => Paintings [sec_title] => Portfolio ) [2] => Array ( [title] => title 3 [cat_title] => Drawings [sec_title] => Portfolio ) ) As an example what would be the cleanest way to make all of the cat_title to uppercase and all of the sec_title's to htmlspecialchars? I was thinking if i sorted the array improperly that I could use the array map function. like this improper array Array ( [title] => Array ( [0] => title 1 [1] => title 2 [2] => title 3 ) [cat_title] => Array ( [0] => Drawings [1] => Paintings [2] => Drawings ) ) Then I could do something handy like: array_map('strtoupper', $array['cat_title']); and make all of the cat_titles uppercase in one go. Something like that would sure beat this, which is what I have going on now . $count = count($array); for($i=0; $i Do you guys know of anyway I could callback functions on numbered array's a little bit more elegantly then above? Hopefully without sorting the array incorrectly? something like array_map or array_walk?
