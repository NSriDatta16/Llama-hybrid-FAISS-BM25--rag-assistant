Can I use NAnt to query my database and use the results as parameter values?

I spent 15 minutes searching the Task lists of NAnt and NAntContrib, and searching Google, but came up empty-handed. I want to send an email to every user of my system when I promote my code. I have a list of email addresses in my database, and I have a functioning email task. So, how can I connect the two? Thanks! D When I get time to return to this, I think I will issue a select statement via sqlcmd.exe, saving the results (a list of email addresses) to a text-file. I will then read the contents of the text file, and use the values therein to address my emails. Seems like a hack -- please tell me there's something more elegant....?
