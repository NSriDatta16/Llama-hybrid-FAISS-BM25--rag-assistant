OK, it is definitely a bug in NetBeans, very probably in the build.xml file generated by NB. I am kind of lost in the giant build.xml and build-impl.xml and jnlp-impl.xml, but my dirty workaround for Java Web Start to work in NetBeans is: copy the generated JNLP somewhere, because it is fine turn off the JWS in the NetBeans project instead of letting NetBeans to sign the .jar files, writing some shell script like this ant clean ant jar #because these two works fine for i in `ls dist/*.jar; ls dist/lib/*.jar` do jarsigner -storepass mystorepass -keypass mykeypass $i myname #sign all the .jars done cp launch.jnlp dist/launch.jnlp #copy the .jnlp make the script a target in the build.xml like this Done. It's a dirty hack and works only with bash, because I don't really know how ant works + the build files, generated by netbeans, are really complicated. But it gets the work done.
