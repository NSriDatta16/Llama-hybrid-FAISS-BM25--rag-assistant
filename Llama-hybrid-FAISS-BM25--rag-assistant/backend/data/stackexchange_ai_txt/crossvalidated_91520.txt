$E(\overline{x})$ vs $E(x)$?

If I have a problem down to $$k(E(x^2) - E(x)^2) = E(\overline{x}^2) - E(\overline{x})^2$$ ...can I say $k = 1$? $X$ has an unbiased mean and a variance. Each $x$ in $X$ is independent. Or is it more complex than that? If it's not clear, $\overline{x}$ signifies the average (or mean or whatever, I always thought they were the same until this homework assignment...)
