Visit Unity3d.com and you will be making your game in no time. Animations are done in the modeling software Maya, etc, but some are done in the engine. Unity makes physics easy and you are more or less creating your world and linking how objects interact. Example - You have a camera -> You can set the camera from the UI to follow the main character and the XYZ transformation of where the camera is placed. It can also be done visually. Check it out it is a lot of fun and less code then you would imagine. From there you can of course write your own code to do your own unique gameplay. It's easily explained as writing a script and dragging it onto the object you want the script to run on. That's about as layman as I can get. Cheers.
