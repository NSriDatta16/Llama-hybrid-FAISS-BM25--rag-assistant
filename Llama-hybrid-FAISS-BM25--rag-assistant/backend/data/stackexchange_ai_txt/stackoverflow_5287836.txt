@MR.GEWA - I think the problem is you are using the name of the original textbox, but when using TinyMCE you are actually creating a temporary textbox container for the TinyMCE object. I don't believe without significant JS coding you can accomplish your additiona of smily faces from the CodeIgniter platform. You could refere to pre-existing smiley plugins / paths for TinyMCE: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=5671 http://raincitystudios.com/blogs-and-pods/hubert/a-nicer-tinymce-interface-based-wordpress-ui After all, no point to 're-create the wheel' if someone has started / done it for you. Hope that gets you going where you need to go. Enjoy!
