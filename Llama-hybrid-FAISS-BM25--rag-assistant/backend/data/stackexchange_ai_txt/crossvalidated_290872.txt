PCA provides/is a linear transformation. If you take the map associated with a particular analysis, say $\mathbf{M} \equiv PCA(X_1 + X_2)$ then $\mathbf{M}(X_1+X_2) = \mathbf{M}(X_1) + \mathbf{M}(X_2)$. The culprit is that $PCA(X_1 + X_2)$, $PCA(X_1)$ and $PCA(X_2)$ are not the same linear transformations. As a comparison a very simple example of a process that uses a linear transformation but is not a linear transformation itself: The rotation $D(\mathbf{v})$ that doubles the angle of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ (say a point in 2-d euclidian space) with some reference vector (say $\left[x,y\right]=\left[1,0\right]$), is not a linear transformation. For example $D(\left[1,1\right]) \rightarrow \left[0,\sqrt{2}\right]$ and $D(\left[0,1\right]) \rightarrow \left[-1,0\right]$ but $D(\left[1,1\right]+\left[0,1\right]=\left[1,2\right]) \rightarrow \left[-0.78,2.09\right] \neq \left[-1,\sqrt{2}\right]$ this doubling of the angle, which involves calculation of angles, is not linear, and is analogous to the statement of amoeba, that the calculation of eigenvector is not linear
