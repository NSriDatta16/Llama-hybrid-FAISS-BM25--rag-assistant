Simple File I/O - Read a new line

I have a file that stores exam scores for a class of students. I am trying to write a program that successfully opens the file, reads in the exam scores, finds the average score, the highest score, and the lowest score, and prints these out. The average score should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point. This is what I have so far: static void Main() { string myData = ""; int temp = 0; int max = 0; int min = 0; double average = 0; StreamReader fileReader = new StreamReader("data.txt"); do { myData = fileReader.ReadLine(); if (myData != null) { max = int.Parse(myData); temp = int.Parse(myData); if (temp > max) temp = max; } } while (myData != null); fileReader.Close(); Console.ReadLine(); }//End Main() I don't exactly know how to proceed. How do I read in a new line and assign it to temp? I don't think I'm doing it right.
