Easy to learn Ruby programming language is damn easy to learn. You will start building apps in days. If you enjoy programming, I think you will love programming in Ruby. Web Apps? I have not used Rails for serious web apps. Even though I stick with ASP.NET for my web project, Rails is quite nifty and I strongly recommend it. Comparisons I don't think ASP.NET is a "programming language". I cant compare it to Ruby. However people tell me Ruby on Rails is a good alternative to ASP.NET in some cases. Philosophy Ruby is one of the languages which strongly believes that programming is not about spoon feeding the compiler. See the interview with the creator, Matz. Resources There are plenty of nice resources to learn Ruby. Basics of Ruby Video Envy Casts' Advanced Ruby Topics and Ruby 1.9 Coverage Lot of Free Books on Ruby I strongly urge you to learn Ruby. I learned a lot of new concepts in programming in general and had loads of fun coding in it.
