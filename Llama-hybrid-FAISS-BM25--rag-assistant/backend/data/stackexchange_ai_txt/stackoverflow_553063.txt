NHibernate ManyToMany and eager loading: strange resultset for SetFetchmode combined with SetResultTransformer and SetMaxResult

I've got a many-to-many relationship which I try to fetch eager: *.CreateCriteria(typeof(Class1)) .SetFetchMode("Class2", FetchMode.Eager) .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) .SetFirstResult(20) .SetMaxResult(10) .List (); I'd like to have rows 20-30 returned, but instead I've got 12-18. Why? Because the SetResultTransformer is executed AFTER the SetMaxResult. It returns 10 rows starting from row 20, but then it is distincted (is that a word?) resulting in rows 12-18. I totally understand what's happening, but can't think of a solution using criteria... Does anyone have a solution to that?
