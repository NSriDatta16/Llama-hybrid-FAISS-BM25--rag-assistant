I don't think you need to know Java to get started on Scala. It's helpful to know the broad strokes though, because most Scala documentation I have read refers back to Java features or bugs. Regarding Open Source projects, you cna have a look on Github for scala projects . Most open source Scala projects tend to be frameworks, though. Regarding books, I found both the Artima book, Programming in Scala, and the Pragmatic Programmers, Programming Scala, very good.
