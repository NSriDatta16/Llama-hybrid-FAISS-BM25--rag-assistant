List with multiple indexes

Given a generic List I would need some kind of index (in the database sense) that would allow me fast retrieval. The keys for this index would not be unique, so I can't use a dictionary. Here's what I have in mind: Given a class Foo { P1, P2, P3 } that may have data like this { "aaa", 111, "yes" } { "aaa", 112, "no" } { "bbb", 111, "no" } { "bbb", 220, "yes" } { "bbb", 220, "no" } { "ccc", 300, "yes" } I would need to quickly access all the records where P1 is "bbb" (3rd,4th, and 5th) or all the ones where P2 is 111 (1st and 3rd). I could use a sorted List but if I need more than one way of sorting / indexing I would end up with duplicated lists. Is there something built-in into the .NET framework or maybe an OS library that would do something like this? Thanks. P.S. I mentioned "sorted List" with the idea that a sorted list will return / find an item much faster. I do not need the list to be necessarily sorted; I'm just looking for fast retrieval / finding.
