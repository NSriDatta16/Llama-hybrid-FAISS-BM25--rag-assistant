ML technique to predict next year output based on text quantities

I have a random data that I would like to predict how much a quantity will be in 2020. The data looks like this: year components total_components 2019 [Pen, Pencil, Books 4 Paper] 2018 [Pen, Pencil, Books 5 Paper, Eraser] 2017 [Pen, Pencil, Books 6 Paper, Eraser, Napkin] 2016 [Pen, Pencil, Books 7 Paper, Eraser, Napkin, laptop] In my head, I thought of time series forecasting or RNNs but the data is a bit strange to apply the techniques. Which ML technique would you suggest here? Thanks :-)
