I've implemented your animation at http://www.brainjam.ca/stackoverflow/webglspiral.html . It will give you a "WebGL not supported" message if your browser does not support WebGL. It is adapted from a sandbox created by mrdoob . The basic idea is to show a rectangular surface (consisting of two triangles) and to apply the shader to the surface. The actual shader code is as follows: uniform float time; uniform vec2 resolution; uniform vec2 aspect; void main( void ) { vec2 position = -aspect.xy + 2.0 * gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy * aspect.xy; float angle = 0.0 ; float radius = length(position) ; if (position.x != 0.0 && position.y != 0.0){ angle = degrees(atan(position.y,position.x)) ; } float amod = mod(angle+30.0*time-120.0*log(radius), 30.0) ; if (amod The spiral resizes with the browser window, but you could easily opt for a fixed size canvas instead. Update: Just for fun, here's the exact same implementation in a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/z9EmN/
