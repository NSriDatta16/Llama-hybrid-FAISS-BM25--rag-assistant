Why do sampling distributions provide a major simplification on the route statistical inference?

I was looking up the Wikipedia page on Sampling distribution and the first paragraph makes the claim: allow analytical considerations to be based on the sampling distribution of a statistic, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values I read this over and over again and though I think I understand what it is saying I'd like to get a more rigorous statement and if possible notes on practical considerations. Thanks in advance. The full text of the first paragraph is: In statistics, a sampling distribution or finite-sample distribution is the probability distribution of a given statistic based on a random sample. Sampling distributions are important in statistics because they provide a major simplification on the route to statistical inference. More specifically, they allow analytical considerations to be based on the sampling distribution of a statistic, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values.
