In general, the equation for the logistic regression model is giving you the probability (Pr) of the binary outcome being 1 (yf = 1) given some information about predictor variables (explanatory variables; e.g., X and C). Example: What is the probability (Pr) of suffering a stroke (Pr y = 1) given some well-known predictors like x1 = diabetes, x2 = hypertonia etc. There are two forms of the equations (both are the same just written in an other way): see picture below
