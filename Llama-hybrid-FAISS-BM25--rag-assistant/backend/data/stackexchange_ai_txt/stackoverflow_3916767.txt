Get Control Value From Web User Control

Lets say I have three DropDownList controls in a web user control and they depend on each other. Categories Brands Products Explanation: After I choose a category from Categories dropdown list, related brands are loaded in Brands DropDownList and same happens when I choose specific brand and they are all located in a web user control since I am using it too much on different pages, I don't want to copy and paste the same code on all the pages. Problem: The pages can contain a GridView and DataSource control which needs an additional Where parameter to fetch all the data needed in and that parameter could depend on selected product within the Products DropDownList control. Question: So how can I get that Selected Product Value from Products DropDownList to bind it to SQLDataSource or any other DataSource control. My Thoughts: I belive I can solve this problem in the ways following. I can use static variable which is updated once Products selected. That field variable could be public so everyone can reach it Selected Products DropDownList can create a QueryString Field for me to grap the selected value. In the same way, the dropdownlist can create a Session variable on the fly and I can fetch the value It can create a hidden field maybe. But: Well those are some of my thoughts but I found them so naive to implement. I need something elegant and satisfying to solve this problem. It should be something like a gateway from the Web User Control to outside world. Maybe a separate class or a Property can help me in the gateway solution. Anyways, I am waiting for your answers.
