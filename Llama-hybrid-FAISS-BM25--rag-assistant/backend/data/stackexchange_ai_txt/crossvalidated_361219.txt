How to understand the $\pi(a|s)$ in Bellman's equation

I was reading "Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction" by Sutton and one of the variations of Bellman's Equation in the book confuses me: Equation (3.14) has the term $\sum_a{\pi(a|s)}$ in it. According to my understanding, the $\pi$ stands for policy and it should be a function that takes in states and returns an action. Then how do I make sense of the $\pi(a|s)$ notation? It seems to take in action as one of its parameters as well?
