Shapley value calculation in the case of absent features

The basic assumption in Shapely value calculation (which is also known as situational importance) is the following: $$ v_i(x) = f(x_1, ..., x_n) - E[f(x_1, ...,X_i,..., x_n)] $$ that is, the contribution of the $i$ th feature for the prediction of an instance $x$ is the difference between the prediction for $x$ and the expected prediction in the absence of the $i$ th feature. If $f$ is an additive model then $$ v_i(x) = \beta_ix_i - \beta_iE[X_i] $$ The most crucial aspect of this definition is how to calculate the prediction in the absence of a feature. According to this formulation, it is calculated by expected value that is averaging over the distribution of the absent feature's values. (Note that Shapley value calculation does this over all possible feature combinations but that is not directly related to my question). My question is this: Is defining feature contributions in this way a plausible approach? Consider a simple example: Suppose that we have an additive model for house price prediction. We want to measure the contribution of the "size" feature for the prediction of a particular house. Further suppose that the size of the house happens to be the average value of all area values of all the houses. Then, in this case, according to the above definition the contribution of the "size" feature in the prediction of that instance is 0. So, according to the above definition, in the prediction of this particular house, the "area" feature has no contribution. Is this result plausible? Why?
