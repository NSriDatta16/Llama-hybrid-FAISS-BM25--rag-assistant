Analyzing relationships in 5 time series (cointegration)

I don't have a dependent variable in this case. 5 time series correspond to 5 different sections of the same company. I want to analyze the relationships between the sections based on these 5 time series. So I don't have a specific dependent variable. Using ADF unit root test, it was found that 4 series are I(0) and one series is I(1). Using ARDL requires a dependent variable. What can I do?
