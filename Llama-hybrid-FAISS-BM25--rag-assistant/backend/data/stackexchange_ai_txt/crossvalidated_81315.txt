The answer will depend on what you (or whoever gave you this assignment) means by "poor prediction". However, assuming that you were just given this as an assignment, @Tomek gave you one idea. Since this is self-study, I'll give some more hints, rather than complete answers. You could also take a look at the Anscombe quartet. Other possibilities may spring from other violations of the assumptions in regression. Think about these and about what violating each could mean. Think about what might happen if the data were more suitable for logistic regression.
