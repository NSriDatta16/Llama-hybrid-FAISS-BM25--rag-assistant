Accounting for imbalance in number of time points per observation to estimate average treatment effect

This is a follow up to this question. How can someone estimate the Average treatment effect (ATE) when not every observation has the same number of treatments/exposures? This is not dropout because the patients received the number of treatments deemed necessary. How could someone estimate the ATE in these cases?
