Ali's answer has a link to Joe Celko's Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties , which confirms my suspicion - there isn't a simple database structure that offers the best of all worlds. The best for my purpose seems to be the "Frequent Insertion Tree" detailed in this book, which is like the "Nested Set Model" of Ali's link, but with non-consecutive indexing. This allows O(1) insertion ( a la unstructured BASIC line numbering), with occasional index reorganisation as and when needed.
