How to assign values over this two variables A and B in an apocryphal "Bayesian Network" like A->B->A?

Let's say that we have a graph A->B->C, and its coditional independence representation is like follows: | a0 | a1 | |:-----|--------:| | 0.6 | 0.4 | | A | P(b0|A) | P(b1|A) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | a0 | 0.30 | 0.70 | | a1 | 0.20 | 0.80 | | B | P(c0|B) | P(c1|B) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | b0 | 0.20 | 0.80 | | b1 | 0.90 | 0.10 | This graph is valid since every probability is non-negative and the sum of the graph distribution is 1: $P(A, B, C)=P(A)P(B|A)P(C|B)=0.6*0.3*0.2+0.6*0.3*0.8+\cdots + 0.4*0.8*0.9+0.4*0.7*0.1=1$ But what if I change the C to A? The first two probability tables don't change: | a0 | a1 | |:-----|--------:| | 0.6 | 0.4 | | A | P(b0|A) | P(b1|A) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | a0 | 0.30 | 0.70 | | a1 | 0.20 | 0.80 | But how to draw the third one? | B | P(a0|B) | P(a1|B) | |:-----|--------:|--------:| | b0 | 0.60 | 0.40 | | b1 | 0.60 | 0.40 | I am wonder if it is an infinit loop and the probability tables are not possible for such graphs. Any suggestions are hight appreciated. Thanks.
