Is it possible to calculate F-value for a neural network regression model?

I trained a model using neural network regression and used the F-value equation that is used for calculating F-value for linear regression: F=(SUM(Ypredicted-Ymean)^2/p)/(SUM(Ypredicted-Yobserved)^2/n-p-1) where n is the number of samples and p is the number of independent variables. Can this equation be used to obtain F-value (as a validation parameter) for a non-linear neural network regression model or is it valid just for linear regression models?
