OpenCV with QT on Maemo 5 (N900)

Since the presentation by Eero Bragge at the Amterdam devdays about QT / QT-Creator I've been looking for an excuse to try my hands at mobile development. Now this excuse has arrived in the form of the Nokia N900, my new phone! My other hobby is computer vision, so my first Idea's for applications to try and build lie in that direction. My questions now are: Has anyone tried QT Creator + OpenCV + Maemo 5? I see there is a year old port of opencv for Meamo Diablo (4.1) has anyone tried that one on Maemo 5? I see that improvements to the OpenCV port are were among the Meamo google summer of code 2009 ideas that didn't make the cut. Is there work being done there? How easy is it to acquire images from the phone's camera and convert them to something opencv understands? Does anyone have any useful links to share?
