Can I and should I use CMake for my setup

The projects I work on are organised into root folders (VOBS) as follows: |--BUILD_FOLDER | |-- BUILD_SCRIPTS | |-- SOME_MORE_CODE | |--COMPONENT_A |--COMPONENT_B Because they are ClearCase VOBS there is no higher level root folder to place a CMakeLists.txt This setup doesn't seem to fit the CMake pattern... Is this a show-stopper to using CMake? It seems that CMake requires everything to be hierarchical as it descends down from one point. . Is CMake the right tool for non-windows/Linux targets? The projects use custom c compilers and invoke 3rd party tools to generate application files in several formats.
