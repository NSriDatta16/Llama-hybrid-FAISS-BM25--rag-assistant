It is just really tough to tell exactly what you need. I sounds like you have elements that are generated dynamically in your javascript, and you are having trouble making those draggable. I assume this means that you have successfully made other elements on the page draggable that were not added dynamically. IF this is the case, before you add your new element to the page, just do the same draggable() call on it before you add it. // Create new element var $newElement = $(" I'm a suggestion "); // Make it draggable $newElement.draggable(); // Append it to your container $newElement.appendTo('.suggestions'); If this is not what you mean, then please be very clear and detailed in your question. Please also add a code example, which often explains much. :o)
