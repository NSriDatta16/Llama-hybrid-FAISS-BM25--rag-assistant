I wouldn't have anything too complex in the Core database. You'd put more load on the core database, plus potentially drag a lot more data around. Have you considered replicating the Core tables to the Reporting environment (simple replication) with the MVs built against those replicated tables. The SQLs against core should be simpler and data volumes from Core to reporting should be smaller, and the complex MVs are managed in a single database.
