(1) Looks like a classification problem with words in your text as features, and "Restricted" and "Not Restricted" as your labels. Bayesian filtering or any classification algorithm should do the trick. (2) Looks like a clustering problem. First you want to come up with a good similarity function that returns a similarity score for two images bases on their keywords. Cosine similarity might be a good starting point, since you are comparing keywords. From there you can compute a similarity matrix and just remember a list of 'nearest neighbors' for each image in your dataset, or you can go further and use a clustering algorithm to come up with actual clusters of images. Since you have so many records, you might want to skip computing the entire similarity matrix, and just compute clusters for a small, random sample of your dataset. You can then add the other data points to the appropriate clusters. If you want to preserve more similarity information you can look into soft clustering. Hopefully that will get you started.
