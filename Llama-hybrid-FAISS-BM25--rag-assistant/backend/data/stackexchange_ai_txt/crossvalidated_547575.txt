Is there an equivalent statistic to partial R-squared in logistic regression?

My dependent variable is a binary outcome(Y); therefore, I am using logistic regression. I am interested in what proportion of variance of Y is explained by the variable X1. In other words, I am interested in the unique variance of Y explained by X1 after controlling for X2 and X3. This is the concept of partial R-squared in OLS. But I am not sure if there is an equivalent way or statistic I can use for logistic regression. Alternatively, should I use a linear probability model to obtain partial R-squared?
