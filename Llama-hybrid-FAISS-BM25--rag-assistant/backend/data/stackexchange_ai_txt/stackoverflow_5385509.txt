Python Function with "Pointers"

Ok, I recently started programming in Python, and I really like it. However, I have run into a little issue. I want to be able to define a function to take in some data and assign it to a variable that I designate, rather than have to perform the operation every time I want to submit the value. Here is a code fragment: try: if elem.virtual.tag: virt = True temp_asset.set_virtual(True) except AttributeError: temp_asset.set_virtual(False) if virt: #if virtual, get only faction, value, and range for presence try: fac = elem.presence.faction #an xml tag (objectified) except AttributeError: fac = "faction tag not found" temp_asset.misload = True try: val = elem.presence.value except AttributeError: val = "value tag not found" temp_asset.misload = True try: rang = elem.presence.range except AttributeError: rang = "range tag not found" temp_asset.misload = True #Set presence values temp_asset.set_presence(fac, val, rang) The functions set the values, but I want to be able to perform the error checking with something like this: def checkval(self, variable_to_set, tag_to_use) try: variable_to_set = tag_to_use except AttributeError: variable_to_set = "tag not found" temp_asset.misload = True Is this doable? Let me know if I need to show more code. Edit: I don't need pointers per se, just anything that works this way and saves typing. Edit 2: Alternatively, I need a solution of how to check whether an objectified xml node exists (lxml).
