sql join question

I have the following tables nid timestamp title 82 1245157883 Home 61 1245100302 Minutes 132 1245097268 Sample Form 95 1245096985 Goals & Objectives 99 1245096952 Members AND pid src dst language 70 node/82 department/34-section-2 45 node/61/feed department/22-section-2/feed 26 node/15 department/department1/15-department1 303 node/101 department/101-section-4 These are fragments of the tables, and is missing the rest of the data (they are both quite large), but I am trying to join the dst column from the second table into the first one. They should match up on their "nid", but the second table has node/[nid] which makes this more complicated. I also want to ignore the ones that end in "feed" since they are not needed for what I am doing. Much thanks EDIT: I feel bad for not mentioning this, but the first table is an sql result from select nid, MAX(timestamp) as timestamp, title from node_revisions group by nid ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 0,5 The second table has the name "url_alias"
