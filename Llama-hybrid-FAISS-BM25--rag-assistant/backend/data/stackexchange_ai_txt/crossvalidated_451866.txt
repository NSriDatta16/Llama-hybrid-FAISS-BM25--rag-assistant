Question about regression model selection

I have a regression problem to solve and in order to find a suitable model, I use the following method: 1°) run a CV for each one with default param 2°) Compare mean(MSE), STD(MSE) and calculation time 3°) Keep the quickest one with the best overall MSE The models I tried • RandomForest (scikit-learn) • GradiantBoosting (scikit-learn) • HistGradiantBoosting (scikit-learn, experimental) • Xgboost • Lighgbm My question: Is my method correct?
