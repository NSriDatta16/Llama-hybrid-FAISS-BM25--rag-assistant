What is the optimal way to represent letters for deep net?

If I have to represent a word sky , I can assign each letter its number in the alphabet or an eigen-vector with 1 at i-th place, where i is letter number in the alphabet. I don't much like first approach, because letters a and b don't correlate as 1 to 2. Second approach, on the other hand, makes an average word repsentation way too high-dimensional. Use-case: trying to teach deep net to predict word's part-of-speech in a morphologically rich language. Which of the approaches should I follow? Update. Found some related info in a group I am subscribed to: https://offbit.github.io/how-to-read/
