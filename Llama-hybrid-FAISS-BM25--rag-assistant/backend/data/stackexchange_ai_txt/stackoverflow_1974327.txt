It's been a while from my Blackberry days, but there are two things you should check: Check that you do not have a large class file. A single cod file is limited to 64K, so if a class file is more than 20-30K sometimes the compiler is not smart enough to organize the files in several code files. Compile using ant build file, see here http://bb-ant-tools.sourceforge.net/docs
