Coroutines, at very first glance catches my attention.. some days ago i was searching for workflow solution for parrallel AsyncWCF Method calls and what i found was really fascinating: http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2010/03/sequential-asynchronous-workflows-in.html this article shows a very good use of coroutines to create/manage workflows in Silverlight application that consumes WCF using Async Pattern. I don't know its speed w.r.t to iterators but to me its like an advanced form of subroutines that can be very helpful in mission critical tasks where a normal subroutine can't offer you the luxury to perform a task in parallel.
