The idea to use 'gbox' div is very good. I would like only a little improve it to be able work inside of jqGrid like usual and be able to drag the grid from its header area. The code can look like var myGridId='list'; $('#gbox_' + myGridId).draggable ({handle:"div.ui-jqgrid-titlebar"}); or like following // get DOM element of 'gbox' div var gboxNode = jQuery('#list')[0].parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode; // make full jqGrid drabable jQuery(gboxNode).draggable ({handle:"div.ui-jqgrid-titlebar"}); The structure of divs can be really good seen with firebug or developer tools of IE. I start to described it a little here jqGrid footer cells "inherits" CSS from cells in the main grid . If would be nice to add a full documentation of all jqGrid elements to the jqGrid Wiki documentation http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki .
