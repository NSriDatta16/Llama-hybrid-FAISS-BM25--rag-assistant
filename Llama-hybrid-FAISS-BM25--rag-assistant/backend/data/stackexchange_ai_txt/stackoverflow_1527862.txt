How to replace a section in a word template with multiple fields C#

I'm creating a C# application that fills the MergeFields defined on a MS Word document with data from an external Data Source. I'm using the OpenXml SDK and everything works fine when replacing single fields. What I want to do is, to have a section with several MergeFields defined and being able to copy such section several times according to the input data. e.g. I can have in the document a paragraph containing a product information with several MergeFields, but in the data I have information for several products, I want to generate as many paragraphs in the output document as products are in the input data. Product: [[product-name]], amount: [[product-amount]], price: [[product-price]] Is there something like a "logical section" in a Word document to wrap the paragraph? if not, what would be your advice to do this?
