Even after having written the only XSD file for log4net configuration I'm still not aware of an easy way to achieve this. You might be able to do something like: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties["host"] = new ClassThatToStringsHost(); class ClassThatToStringsHost { public override string ToString() { return "whatever"; } } Now you can reference this value from the Log format with: "%property{host}" To perform the filtering you will need to use a filter configuration in the adapter(s): There may even be a built-in property you could leverage and this should work. See also this post: Link For me, myself, and I... I would approach it another way all together. I would derive my own SMTP appender from the default and in the ActivateOptions() method I'd configure the values according to the environment. This would allow you to use one SMTP appender with consistent rules and yet provide three public properties for each of the email addresses you want to send from. It's not hard, give it a try!
