You will need to use ajax which is 9/10ths javascript anyway. I suggest using a JS framework so that you don't have to code for different browsers. Then you will need something on the server side that will process the request and spit the required data back at you. Popular formats are XML (the x in ajax), JSON, or just plain ol' HTML. Either way you will need a javascript callback to process the result (or error condition, don't forget that) and populate your textbox. Personally I prefer just returning HTML fragments but if you've got a framework chances are you'll find XML and JSON handling in it so go crazy.
