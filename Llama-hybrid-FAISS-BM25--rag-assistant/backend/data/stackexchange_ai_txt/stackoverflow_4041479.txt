Which version of IntelliJ are you using? Note that since last year, IntelliJ exists in two versions: Ultimate Edition , which is the complete IDE Community Edition , which is free but does not support JavaEE developments. (see differences here ) In case you are using the Community Edition , you will not be able to manage a Tomcat installation. In case you are using the Ultimate Edition , you can have a look at: The FAQ for Netbeans users (see question How do I configure a web framework for my project? ). IntelliJ Ultimate edition "Help": Run/Debug Configuration: Tomcat Server
