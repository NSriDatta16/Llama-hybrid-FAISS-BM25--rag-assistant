First of all, you should do a scatter plot of the projection of your individuals on the first two PCs. If instead of seeing a single ellipsis, they cluster in different groups, you'll find an easy interpretation of your data. If they fall in a single elipsis, you can interpret the PCA as giving you low dimensional (approximate) models of your data. If you decide to keep only the first PC, you consider that the individuals are roughly distributed along one axis (the long axis of the mentioned ellipsis), given by this PC. In your case, you can interpret this axis as a "good performer/bad performer" axis. As all your loadings have similar values, this means that you consider that a typical individual will have similar scores at all five tests, and the coordinate of an individual on this axis is approximately proportional to its mean score. If you decide to keep the two first PCs, you consider that they are distributed in a plane. The first axis is as previously; the second axis, orthogonal to the first one, materializes the differences between people with the same coordinate on the first axis. In you case, this means that among people with similar scores, some are more of the muscular type, the others are more intellectuals. The decision to keep one, two, or more PCs, to give a good description of your data, should rely in particular on the eigenvalues associated to the PCs (or on the proportion of explained variance...).
