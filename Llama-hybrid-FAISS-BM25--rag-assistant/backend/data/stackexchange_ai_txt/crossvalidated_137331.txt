Estimating Size of a Set based on two Overlapping Subsets

I've searched everywhere for a similar question and many things come close but are not the same. I'm looking for a way to estimate the size of a set if two partially overlapping subsets are known (assuming both subsets were selected at random). Here's the simplified scenario: One person randomly selects 100 numbers from the phone book and writes them down. A second person writes down 150 phone numbers. You obtain both lists, and find that 75 of the phone numbers are the same. Is there a way to estimate the total number of numbers in the phone book? Obviously there must be AT LEAST 175, but there are probably more. I suppose you could imagine the same phrased as a lottery with non-sequentially numbered balls. After two drawings, you know a certain number of balls came up in both drawings, so can you estimate the total number of balls being drawn from? I imagine there's some Bayesian solution, but I'm not sure. Thanks for your help!
