This is not a flaw in ASP.Net MVC, and I don't think it's going to be it's going to be fixed in the next version. This is a 'limitation' (notice how i avoid the word flaw) in asp.net (not just mvc) that prevents it from accessing header information that's included in the master page. So you don't have access to javascript/css in the content pages/usercontrols. The code provided by Robert Harvey is a hack solution that we've been using to overcome this. It works by using the enclosing the include file in an if block that's always false. So the compiler sees the css file but the runtime doesn't.
