PHP - file_get_contents System Error?

I'm trying to parse the html from a url. I do this: $html = file_get_contents($someURL); echo $html; But when I run that script, the page shows this: UISCGI (software8a-web; software8a-link): This site is best viewed with Netscape 4.6 or 4.7 or Internet Explorer 5 and greater. At this time Netscape 6 is not supported for Link usage. I also tried CURLing the url, while faking IE7 as the User Agent. What's going wrong here? I couldn't find this error anywhere with Google. How do I get past this system error?
