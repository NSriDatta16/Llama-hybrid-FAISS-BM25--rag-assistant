Estimate your model equation-by-equation using OLS. This is the efficient estimator for a VAR where the right-hand-side variables are the same in all equations. In that case, GLS collapses to equation-by-equation OLS. MLE collapses to equation-by-equation OLS in case the errors are normal (and you say they are). A more detailed explanation could be found e.g. in Chapter 3 of LÃ¼tkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" (2005).
