If at the conclusion of your A/B experiment, you know the conversion status (yes/no) for each individual then you can take the following simple approach: Simply conduct a statistical test to determine whether the difference in the average conversion rate in A vs. B is statistically greater than zero (i.e. A is better), less than zero (i.e. B is better) or equal to zero (no difference in conversion rates between the group). You can use an unpaired t-test (assumes that conversion rates are normally distributed) or a Mann-Whitney U test (does not require normality) to compare the average conversion rates.
