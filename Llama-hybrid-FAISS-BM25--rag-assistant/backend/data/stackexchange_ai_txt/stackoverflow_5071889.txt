For #1: yes it is possible to sort a gridview within WPF but not automatically. For that you may need to use a off-the shelf control from Telerik, Dundas, Infragistics etc. MSDN provides a nice tutorial on how to hook this up yourself via code. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745786.aspx For #2: This depends on how you have your Type defined. You could do this via a tooltip on the cell with a custom datatemplate containing a listbox control applied which shows each person or their information. This could also be handled in a separate user control that could appear when the row is selected. You have a ton of options here. As long as you can get at the data you are golden. Just define what you need to show and anticipate the max number of records being displayed. Obvosuly if every row shows approximatley 10 records a small tooltip may not be the best approach but a larger floating usercontrol may be. For #3: If you are using a datatemplate for the definition this object you could set MaxHeight or MaxWidth to control the maximum height of the control. This could also be affected by padding of the element so you may want to set the padding="0" (zero)
