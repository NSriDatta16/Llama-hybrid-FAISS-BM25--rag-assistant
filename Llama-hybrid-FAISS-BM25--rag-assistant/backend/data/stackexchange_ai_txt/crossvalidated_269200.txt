Need suggestion/guide on how to estimate unknown bayesian priors

Suppose I can only observe people who visit Starbucks. My posterior probabilities will be like $\Pr(\text{male} \mid \text{visits Starbucks})$, $\Pr(\text{has hair} \mid \text{visits Starbucks})$, etc. â€“ where all of these are independently distributed. I want to use a naive Bayes classifier to analyze if the probability of someone visiting Starbucks is being dominated by one of those posteriors. Now the problem is, my entire data set is just of people who visit Starbucks, I cannot know the number of people who do not visit. Given this, how can I estimate the priors $\Pr(\text{visits Starbucks})$ and $\Pr(\text{Does not visit Starbucks})$?
