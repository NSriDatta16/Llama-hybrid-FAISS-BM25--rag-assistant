I found Dragonfly: https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly "An on-the-fly processing/encoding framework written as a Rack application." It's close to what I was looking for, but I'd prefer something totally separate. Dragonfly looks like it needs to be embedded in your Rails application as a Rack app. (Not an option for me, since I'm still on Rails 2.2)
