You can measure a lot of things lines of code produced. keystrokes. coffee consumed. trash produced. However, that's just numerosity -- numbers for the sake of having numbers. Before you measure your team, find out how you are measured. Find out how your overall development organization is measured. Find out what measurements the overall organization is trying to optimize. Then -- and only then -- try to find a way to map the big picture goals down to your team. If you're not measuring progress toward the organization's overall goals, then you're just collecting numbers. If you're going to collect numbers, weighing the coffee every morning may be the best indicator of work being done. Seriously.
