I wouldn't advice you to go that route. You're saying you'd like to study for a few years and then start as a beginner (and what other than a beginner can you start at? or a graduate programme). But bear in mind by the time you're 37, there'll be 22 year olds who'll be starting as a beginner just like you, with perhaps comparable skills (though perhaps not your educational background). Why would an employer take on someone fifteen years older? Why would you like also to be as attractive to employers as possible? Do you think that leads to anything other than employers wanting to use you? And what do you think happens after you're used--unless you'll make damn sure it will not? You probably want to be attractive to either get approval, remuneration, or advance in your career, but these three don't go hand in hand. It's difficult to get them in equal measure, e.g., often to advance in your career you have to take extra risks, like resigning, or conversely, to get accepted for more jobs lower your expectations. I don't see why you'd like to be attractive to employers and assume that that'll take care of your success, it won't, or it might not. Why not, rather, think of working for yourself? Find a career in which you can achieve independence. Specially as you get older. Finally, I think it's tricky to try and build a career in a field like data science that's new, 'moving ground' so to speak, and not quite well defined (for some), essentially by way of courses and university studies. If you don't have the computer industry background to know the [future] value of what you're sold, how are you gonna choose? There're plenty of places ready to sell you a course, and many will use vivid depictions of future success or 'professionalism' in order to attract you (because, for these academies and schools, you're the customer, and of course they want / need customers). How do you know you're not going to be spending time and money taking lessons in something that'll be perfectly useless? And why take courses? Since many of these topics, disciplines, and programming languages, are free to learn online? Or do you assume that studying at a certain place means that that place will take care of your career, or necessarily give you a good foundation? Why not, rather, find out how present-day data scientists got to where they are? I think, if you interview some, you'll probably find no two paths were alike. And you can't emulate any of them (because what worked when they got started is not necessarily what will work for you tomorrow). To me it sounds like you'd be more adept to teaching than at data science. This is because you sound like you like to learn, like to teach (to advance yourself and others, I'd like to think), and you say you have time to do it. I'd try and get into teaching through some way other than that PhD in Philosophy you mentioned. Maybe start your own academy, alone or with a partner, and organize yourself to teach others what you already know, or what you're capable of learning, or teach them how to learn, or at least how to strive (motivation). That would sound to me possibly like a better investment.
