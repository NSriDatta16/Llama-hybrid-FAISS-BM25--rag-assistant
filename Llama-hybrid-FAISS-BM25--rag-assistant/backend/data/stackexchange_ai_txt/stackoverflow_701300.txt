SQL Server Agent Job for the first 4 days of Month

I was wondering if anyone knew how to create a job that will run the first 4 days of the month in SQL Server 2000? I found how to run a job once on the first or second day, but the only way I figured I could run each of the four days would be to create a job for each day meaning I would have 4 jobs created. I was hoping for a better way.
