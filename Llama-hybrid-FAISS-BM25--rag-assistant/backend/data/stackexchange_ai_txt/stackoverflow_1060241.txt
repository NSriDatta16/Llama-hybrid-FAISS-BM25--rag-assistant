Storing Array of Floats as a BLOB in Oracle

I am designing a new laboratory database. For some tests, I have several waveforms with ~10,000 data points acquired simultaneously. In the application (written in C), the waveforms are stored as an array of floats. I believe I would like to store each waveform as a BLOB. Questions: Can the data in a BLOB be structured in such a way that Oracle can work with the data itself using only SQL or PL/SQL? Determine max, min, average, etc Retrieve index when value first exceeds 500 Retrieve 400th number Create BLOB which is a derivative of first BLOB NOTE: This message is a sub-question of Storing Waveforms in Oracle .
