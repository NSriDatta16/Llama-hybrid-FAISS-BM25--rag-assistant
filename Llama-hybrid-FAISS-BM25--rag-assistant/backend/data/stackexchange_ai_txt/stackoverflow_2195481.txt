This is probably just a timeout issue. It's taking much longer on postback because it has to process the ViewState... which will be absolutely huge. Like others have said, your implementation needs a re-think. Are these options organized alphabetically? If so, what about a fairly straightforward autocomplete? Type two letters and then get a popup of available options that start with those two letters. The Yahoo library has a decent implementation of this. If you absolutely positively have to have 5000 options in a dropdown... move this dropdown outside the GridView so that it doesn't appear on every row. Basically, the user will select a row, and then use this single "master" dropdown to select the data. You could probably even throw in a javascript hack that moved the dropdown into the row on selection so that it appears the dropdown is in every row, but there is really only one.
