VB.Net SQLExpress 2008 deployment

I have been developing an application for the last 12 months using VS2008, VB.NET(WPF) and SQLExpress2008. It has been running successfully in a single organization but I now need to consider deploying it to other organisations where I won't know the connection string for the DB, app locations, server locations etc. What is the current favoured approach for deploying dotNet apps that use SQL Express 2008? ClickOnce? InstallShield? Also, what's the best way of requesting the initial connection string details. Should I write it myself and maybe store the info in my.settings, are there any 3rd party apps for db configuration that'll make my life easier? Sorry for all the questions but the bottom line is, what's the best way to deploy my app!
