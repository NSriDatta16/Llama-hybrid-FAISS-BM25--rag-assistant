Error in XML, Find and Replace won't fix

I made a huge error in a gigantic XML file. //.. tons of stuff... I need to replace the outer item1 with something else. But find and replace isn't working because of the matching inner item1. I've tried searching by multiple pieces of information, but the single-line nature of every find and replace I find makes it impossible, and all of the data is tabbed. Any ideas?
