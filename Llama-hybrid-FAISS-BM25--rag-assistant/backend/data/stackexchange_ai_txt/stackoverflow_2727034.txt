Maybe too arrogant, but I'm writing my own abstraction. It works most of the times, but it is in a planning state, but gives you an idea how to implements an "OpenGL" OOP abstraction. Look at the SVN: http://sourceforge.net/projects/genomalib/develop Surely it is not a solution for production code, but it's opensource and easy to extents once you get the design. Recntly I've added "deprecated" API, since it was initially written for rendering with shaders only (indeed it still miss support for "older" hardware); but surely I has the fundation for rendering...
