The { and } commands move by "paragraph", and vim's documentation (see :help paragraph ) says: Note that a blank line (only containing white space) is NOT a paragraph boundary. So the only way you can do this would be to remap { and }. Something like: nmap { ?^\\s*$ nmap } /^\\s*$ could work, but you may want to adjust this so it doesn't alter your search history.
