MCMC methods are typically used for sampling from a distribution which otherwise would be very difficult to sample from. They do this by defining a markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is the desired distribution. Neural networks are general function approximators. You can interpret the output as a probability distribution, in which case they can be used to model complex distributions. So to answer your questions yes not really sure what you're asking.
