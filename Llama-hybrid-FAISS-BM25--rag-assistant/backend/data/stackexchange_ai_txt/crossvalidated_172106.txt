Update. I just noticed that kernel SVM are now implemented in the Vowpal Wabbit library . The algorithm used is the LASVM algorithm of Bordes et al. (2005) The following paper: Streamed Learning: One-Pass SVMs remains an interesting reading though. It does not rely on primal formulation, but on the Minimal Enclosing Ball (MEB) formulation of the problem and proposes a clear algorithm, that trains the SVM in only one pass. However, the selection of the support vector is not really clear. Besides, no experiment is conducted on the kernelized versions. But it remains the best paper I have read regarding streaming kernel SVM.
