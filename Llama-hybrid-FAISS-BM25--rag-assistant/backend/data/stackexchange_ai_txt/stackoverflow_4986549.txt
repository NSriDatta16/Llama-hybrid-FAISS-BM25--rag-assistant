extract out text in each line and put it in seperate variables with javascript

I have the following address which is in a paragraph with no great way to select the individual text areas within. I do not have access to this code. I want to extract out each line and put the text values in a variable for each type. Not sure what would be the best way to do it. Use .split(' ') ? then use .split('&nbsp;') to separate the state from the zip same with city and state I am a little lost here. Here are the variables I would like. company name, person's name, address1, city, state, country, zip code, phone, Here is the paragraph that i have. I do not need the '(Residential Address)' XYZ Inc John&nbsp;Smith 555 Anywhere Street New York, NY&nbsp;11150 United States 212-555-1212 (Residential Address)
