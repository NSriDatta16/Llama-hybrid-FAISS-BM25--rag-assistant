Is there a theoretical reason why simple models perform better than complex models on time series forecasting tasks?

Empirically, simple forecasting methods such as damped trend exponential smoothing, STL, or even random walks typically outperform more complex models such as higher order ARIMA models or ML based approaches. See for example the results of the M3 and M4 competitions. Is this just an empirical result or is there a theoretical backing for this? Is this just the ideas of parsimony and regularization writ large? Or is there a more detailed theoretical reason for this?
