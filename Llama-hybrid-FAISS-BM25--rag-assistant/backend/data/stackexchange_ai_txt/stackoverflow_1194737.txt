How to update manytomany field in Django?

Here's an example: If I have these classes class Author(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=45) class Book(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=45) authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author) In the database I have one Author with the name "George" and another one with the name "Georfe". The last one is a mistake. So what I want is in every Book that have "Georfe" as one of his Author replace it by the Author "George". In SQL is really easy to do. If id of "George" = 3 and id of "Georfe" = 7 and the relation table name is "author_book": UPDATE author_book SET id=3 WHERE id=7; Is it possible to do that with the Django ORM? I found a way to do it: I loop trough all the related Books of the mistyped author and do: book.authors.add(Author.objects.get(id=3)) book.authors.remove(Author.objects.get(id=7)) But I don't find this solution really elegant and efficient. Is there a solution without the loop?
