is it possible to use QtConcurrent::run() with a function member of a class

I can't seem to be able to associate QtConcurrent::run() with a method (function member of a class) only with a simple function. How can I do this? With a regular function I cannot emit signals and its a drag. Why would anyone find this a better alternative to QThread is beyond me and would like some input.
