The reason for keeping the elements in sorted order is for faster retrieval. Say I wanted all of the values in the dictionary in a sorted range. This is much faster with a TreeDict then with the regular hashmap. It basically allows you to keep everything in the dictionary in sorted order. I know in the application I'm currently working on uses a class like this to basically query the data structure.
