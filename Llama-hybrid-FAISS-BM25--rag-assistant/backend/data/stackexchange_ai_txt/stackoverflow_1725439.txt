I can't think of a simpler, more naive way to do Sentiment Analysis, but you might consider using a Support Vector Machine instead of Naive Bayes (in some machine learning toolkits, this can be a drop-in replacement). Have a look at "Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques" by Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan which was one of the earliest papers on these techniques, and gives a good table of accuracy results on a family of related techniques, none of which are any more complicated (from a client perspective) than any of the others.
