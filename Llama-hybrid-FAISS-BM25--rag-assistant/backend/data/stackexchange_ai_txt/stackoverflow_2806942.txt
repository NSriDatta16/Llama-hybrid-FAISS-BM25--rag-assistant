Bonus points for enabling the warnings pragma! Have an upvote! You want to use backticks or qx// to capture the output of an external program, not system . To substitute your own error message that will make sense to your users (more points for you!), then you might do something as in #! /usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; no warnings 'exec'; chomp(my $abc = `simple2.pl`); if ($? == 0) { printf("abc %s\n", $abc); } else { die "$0: unable to calculate abc\n"; } In case you're unfamiliar, $? is $CHILD_ERROR $? The status returned by the last pipe close, backtick command, successful call to wait or waitpid , or from the system operator. When $? is zero, it indicates success. Remember that the warnings pragma is lexical, so rather than disabling the warning for the whole program, you might do it for just one sub: sub calculate_abc { no warnings 'exec'; # ... }
