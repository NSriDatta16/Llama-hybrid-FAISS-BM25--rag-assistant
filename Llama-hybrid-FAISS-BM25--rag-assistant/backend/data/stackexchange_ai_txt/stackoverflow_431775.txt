The XPath language is designed to be embedded in another language (such as DOM API, XSLT, XQuery, ...) and cannot be used standalone . The original question does not specify what is the desired embedding. Below is a very simple and short solution when XPath is embedded in XSLT . This transformation : when applied on this xml document : title1 text1 anchor1 Something else here title2 text2 anchor2 Something else here title3 text3 anchor3 produces the wanted result : title1 text1 anchor1 Something else here title2 text2 anchor2 Something else here title3 text3 anchor3
