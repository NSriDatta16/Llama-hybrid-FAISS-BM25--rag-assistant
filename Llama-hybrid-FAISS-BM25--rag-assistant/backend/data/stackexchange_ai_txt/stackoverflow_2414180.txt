It sounds like you're asking if you should use tags like so that, in the absence of CSS, what you want to be small will be small. No. The reason to consider how the page will look without CSS is to know if you are using good semantic layout. If it's usable, your HTML, which is only designed with semantic organization in mind, is okay. That's it. If your users, for whatever reason, don't want to support presentational things like CSS, don't use presentational tags . And, really. If your users don't have CSS for whatever reason, they don't deserve to see something as bold. It's more work for you, it's not semantic, and no one will ever care.
