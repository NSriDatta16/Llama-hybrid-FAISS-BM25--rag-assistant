WCF MustUnderstand headers are not understood

I am using a Java Web Service which is developed by one of our vendor which I really do not have any control over it. I have written a WCF router which the client application calls it and the router sends the message to the Java Web Service and returns the data back to the client.

Router config file is as follows: --> --> Test client config file --> --> If I use the textMessageEncoding I am getting MustUnderstand headers: [{http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing}To, {http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing}Action] are not understood. If I use mtomMessageEncoding I am getting The server did not provide a meaningful reply; this might be caused by a contract mismatch, a premature session shutdown or an internal server error. My Router class is as follows: [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.Single, ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple, AddressFilterMode = AddressFilterMode.Any, ValidateMustUnderstand = false)] public class EmployeeService : IEmployeeService { public System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message ProcessMessage(System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message requestMessage) { ChannelFactory factory = new ChannelFactory ("client"); factory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new MustUnderstandBehavior(false)); IEmployeeService proxy = factory.CreateChannel(); Message responseMessage = proxy.ProcessMessage(requestMessage); return responseMessage; } } The "client" in the above code under ChannelFactory is defined in the config file as: Really appreciate your kind help. Thanks in advance, Raghu
