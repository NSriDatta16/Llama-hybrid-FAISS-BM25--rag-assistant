The first example is exactly how I would have done it. Modeling proportions is what fracreg is for (although it's not the only way, with beta regression being the obvious alternative). You're controlling for year and industry. You're adjusting the standard errors in the way he requested. The second example, even if you could get it to work right (offhand, I'm surprised you can't use a cluster VCE here), would give you the same answer as the first. That's how fractional logistic regression used to be done in Stata, using glm with certain options. I strongly suspect the third example wouldn't work even if you could get the specification right; I don't know for sure, but I've never seen any research on estimating fixed-effect fractional logit models, let alone research that suggests you can just call the likelihood a quasi-likelihood and charge ahead.
