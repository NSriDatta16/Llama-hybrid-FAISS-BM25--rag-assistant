SQL Server: should I use an "Agent Job" or a "Maintenance Plan" to delete old data?

I'm looking for a way to periodically (e.g. weekly) run some SQL statements in a database to delete old data. As far as I can see, there are (at least) two ways to do this: using a "Maintenance Plan" and a "Execute T-SQL Statement Task" using an "SQL Server Agent Job" and specify the statements in a "Step" of that job My question is: what is the difference between these two possibilities and which one should I use for my task?
