Books/resources that teach software developers how to pragmatically use project/bug/task tracking tools

Does anyone know of excellent (in your opinion) books/websites that go over in details how to pragmatically use a bug/task/project management tool to help improve software development process? Ideally, I would like "from-the-trench" kind of resource, not theory. Examples of such mgmt tools are: JIRA/Confluence combo, Visual Studio Team System / Sharepoint, FogBugz, etc. I think I'm looking for books that are like the 3 Pragmatic book series (source control, unit testing, and build automation) Come to think of it, I wish the pragmatic guys also released a book on how to integrate project mgmt tools to their software development process. I know of a few that might fit as the answers to my question: Painless Project Management with FogBugz, Second Edition Visual Studio Team System: Better Software Development for Agile Teams Software Engineering with Microsoft Visual Studio Team System Much like how we learn different programming languages to broaden our thought process, I dont really mind what tool the book/website uses. What I'm most interested in is HOW the tool is integrated into software development process to help improve it.
