Why use differencing and Box-Cox in time series?

Why use Differencing and Box-Cox transformation in a time series? From what I read the usefulness of the procedures are Differencing: Making a time series stationary and stabilize the mean Box-Cox: stabilize the variance Is there anything else behind it? I know that there is some useful properties in a Stationary Process , but why is so important have it?
