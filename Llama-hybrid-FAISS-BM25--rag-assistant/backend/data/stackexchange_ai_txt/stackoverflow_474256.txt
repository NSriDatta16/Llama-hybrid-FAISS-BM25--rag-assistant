From my experience, fragmentation is mostly a problem when you are continuously allocating and freeing large buffers (like over 16k) since those are the ones that will ultimately cause an out of memory, if the heap cannot find a big enough spot for one of them. In that case, only those objects should have special memory management, keep the rest simple. You can use buffer reusing if they always have the same size, or more complex memory pooling if they vary in size. The default heap implementations shouldn't have any problem finding some place for smaller buffers between previous allocations.
