Since you first wrote the question, IE 8 has been officially released and it has a built-in feature that does what you want. From the "File" menu, click on "New Session." This will open a new window that will not share session cookies with the original window, allowing you to be logged into the same site under different logins simultaneously. http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/05/06/session-cookies-sessionstorage-and-ie8.aspx
