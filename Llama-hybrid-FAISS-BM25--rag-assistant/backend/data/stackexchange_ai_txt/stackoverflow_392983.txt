Ragel - validate a String while Input

Assume we want to validate user input, while user is typing in a JTextField. For validating the user input, I wonder if I could use Ragel. Assume the input should follow this example regex: [a-z]{2,5}ABC[0-9]+ How can I do this with ragel? Can anybody give a short example how to validate user input "on the fly" (while inputing) with ragel? The Ragel documentations misses some good examples for a Quick Start, so I ask here.
