Some solutions :- Forecast on weekly data and then use certain hard-coded rules to attribute weekly forecasts to hourly / daily basis. Train yet another AI model using RNN / LSTM - Vector to sequence translator - which learns how to spread weekly total to hourly / daily spread by training on historical data which maps weekly total to hourly / daily spread - this essentially will LEARN the mean mapping from weekly total to hourly / daily spread. Train the model at hourly or daily time series level (do not total to weekly level) - maybe this causes scale issue as too many points at hourly or daily level then first two solutions above can be tried.
