Plone 4.0.5 and Unicode confusion

At first, Im using FreeBSD 8.1, Plone 4.0.5 and testing both Data.fs and RelStorage 1.5.0b2 (Postgresql 9.0.3). Im from Denmark and we use danish letters ("æøå"). Im confused about encoding, but my initial guess is that the best way to go is with Unicode (utf-8). What is the correct way to configure FreeBSD, Plone (and products) and PostgreSQL to comply with Danish letters. Ive already been told that the encoding does not matter for PostgreSQL. Ive been seeing comments about site.py and sitecustomize.py around when googling for errors - please comment. Thanks. Nikolaj G.
