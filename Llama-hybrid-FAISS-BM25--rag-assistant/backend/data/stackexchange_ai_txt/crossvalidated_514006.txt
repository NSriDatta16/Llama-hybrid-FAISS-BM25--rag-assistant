How to deal cards according to probabilities?

Moved here from stackoverflow as it is a logical problem not really a coding one. I am trying to come up with an algorithm to deal single cards to players given a probability distribution. This can be thought of as a dealer who is cheating and wants to give certain cards to certain players but doesn't want to be obvious. So I want to get as many cards as players (no players having the same card as others). Example probabilities for a three card deck and three players: Ace King Queen Player 1 0% 66% 33% Player 2 33% 33% 33% Player 3 66% 0% 33% Choosing player by player can lead to situations when the remaining player has 0% probability to get the remaining card. In the above example - what if Player 1 gets a Queen , Player 2 gets an Ace . Then Player 3 cannot get any card as his King probability is 0%. One way I tried is to deal the cards per player. Then check if there are duplicates and if there are I deal again till there are no duplicate cards. Averaging the samples to get a distribution does not match the probability distribution that I want to sample from. The reason for this (in the example above) is that the re-dealing would happen more often for Player 1 getting Queen because the chance of a duplicate in that case is 66% unlike when Player 1 gets a King (33%). This skews the resulting distribution. Another way that I tried is to deal Player 1 's card. Then remove that from the possible Player 2 cards and deal a card out of that for Player 2 . The card for player 3 is the remaining card. This I saw is clearly stupid because Player 3 can get a King s by this logic which should happen with 0% probability. What would the steps be to make sure we sample following a given distribution and that we don't have duplicates?
