I know this is an older post, but I recently found an elegant solution to this problem using generics and extension methods. This is a combination of the authors works and some comments. A Generic Method for Cross-thread Winforms Access http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/GenericCrossThread.aspx public static void Manipulate (this T control, Action action) where T : Control { if (control.InvokeRequired) { control.Invoke(new Action >(Manipulate), new object[] { control, action }); } else { action(control); } } This can be called in the following manner, for simplicity I used a label. someLabel.Manipulate(lbl => lbl.Text = "Something");
