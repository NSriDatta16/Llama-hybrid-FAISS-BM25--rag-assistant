Distribution Fitting with multiple changepoints

I have a time series of a random variable x, which randomly moves in and out of three broader states- "generally increasing", "generally decreasing", "more or less staying still". The distribution of x in each of these 3 states is gaussian with different means and variances. Given the above time series of x, is there a way to iteratively fit the 3 distributions without knowing when the multiple changes happen? Preferably without using hidden markov models?
