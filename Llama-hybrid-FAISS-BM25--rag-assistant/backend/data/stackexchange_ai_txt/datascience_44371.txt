Technically there is no direct way to do that. But let's us say you are doing some binary classification and the response rate in your training data set is 30% . Now when you use your model to score the new data set (without labels). Ideally average score should be around 30% (considering new data set is similar to training data set) . In case of regression problems, the response rate can be replaced by average of dependent variable.
