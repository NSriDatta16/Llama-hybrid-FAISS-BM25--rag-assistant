What are alternatives to SQL database storage for a web site?

An SQL database is overkill if your storage needs are small. When I was young and dumb, I used a text file and flock()ed it when I needed to access it. This doesn't scale, but I still feel that non-database solutions have been completely ignored in Web 2.0. Does anyone not use an SQL database for storage? What are the alternatives?
