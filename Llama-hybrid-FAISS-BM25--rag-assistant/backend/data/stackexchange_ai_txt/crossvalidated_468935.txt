How to prepare the training data for Support Vector Machine?

I'm currently doing some comparison of Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machine classifying news to see each algorithm's accuracy. I already know how to prepare the training data for Naive Bayes E.g this is my training set for Naive Bayes Sports Bayern end title race and reaffirm game's significance in strange times Culture Gadsby follows up her hit show Nanette with a swaggering set that blazes with well-earned confidence Lifestyle Unproven remedies proliferate in my community, even in the face of a deadly virus For Naive Bayes, I already have tested the classifier and it seems to be working nice. But now I'm stuck with SVM, can someone give me tips on how should I transform e.g the above data to SVM for training? I have downloaded some training data on SVM format, I can see they're formatted with numbers. But I want to know the logic of how those numbers came up, are they random for each word or something? I appreciate the time that you spent reading this, would be very thankful if someone could guide me to the right direction Thanks
