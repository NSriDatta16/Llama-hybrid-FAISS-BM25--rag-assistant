Add Solution Folder for VS 2008?

I just started to use VS 2008 Express. I noticed that I cannot add a new solution folder within a solution in the way like VS 2005 Prof. Not sure if this feature is disabled in the Express version or not. In VS 2005, I can also add project within a virtual solution folder. This makes my projects in a well organized tree. However, I cannot add virtual folder within a solution in VS 2008 (express?). I am not sure if I could add projects within a virtual folder (if possible in Prof) or not. I even tried to use text editor to add folder structure in sln file like VS 2005 sln file. However VS 2008 complains the virtual folder.
