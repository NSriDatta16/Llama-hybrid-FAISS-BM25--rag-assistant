Our solution was to alter our use of the cobertura-report ant task to include the full path to the source directory rather than the relative path. Basically, the relative pathing included in the cobertura xml report crosses up Hudson such that the Cobertura Plugin can't use it to find the source code. In our case, this was was symptomatic of the differences between how Hudson does its pathing for single module projects and multi-module projects.
