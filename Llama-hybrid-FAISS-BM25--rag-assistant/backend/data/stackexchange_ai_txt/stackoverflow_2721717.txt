I believe the answer to all of that is no, no and no. This is one of the reasons that I don't even try to do any of this in my installs. I always encourage application development to write systems that don't need massaging of the firewall and/or get the systems engineers to work with documentation to properly document to the end user the networking requirements. I only attempt automagical in the installer if everyone understands it's a best effort attempt and that documentation must be available to assist users in integrating into their custom environment. That and I'm naturally adverse to having my way with users operating system configuration settings without their (true) consent.
