Extending several lists elegantly

Given several lists: a = ["a1", "a2", "a3"] b = ["b1", "b2", "b3"] ... n = ["n1", "n2", "n3"] And a list of new values: new_vals = ["a4", "b4", "n4"] I would like to get: ["a1", "a2", "a3", "a4"] ["b1", "b2", "b3", "b4"] ... ["n1", "n2", "n3", "n4"] I can do this with loops and temporary variables, of course. It seems like come combination of zip , map , and list.extend should do it more elegantly, but is eluding me.
