Well as far as I know, the only way to really "know" about in-flight XMLHttpRequests is to explicitly "remember" them in the code. It's like timeouts and interval timers - if your code doesn't hang on to a handle, it's lost. If the pages in question do everything via jQuery or some other framework, then it might be possible to worm into that code and leverage whatever's done to track ajax work, but exactly how you'd do that would depend on the framework. It might help your progress if you were to explain more about what it is you want to achieve with this technique. In other words, while what you asked about directly may not be possible, it might be possible to find another way to do whatever it is you want.
