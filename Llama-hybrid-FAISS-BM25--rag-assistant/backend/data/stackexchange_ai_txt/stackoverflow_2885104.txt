You might try moving the #import "Kal.h" to RootViewController.h instead on in RootViewController.m. Edit: Normally what you do to include a framework such as Kal in an Xcode project is simply drag all the source code into your project. You shouldn't have to change the header search path if you copied the source entirely. This might be causing the problem.
