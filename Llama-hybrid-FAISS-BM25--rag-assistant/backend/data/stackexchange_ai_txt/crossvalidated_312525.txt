Assumptions: (1) There exists a population from which infinite draws of $X$ and $y$ may be made, and each of those draws are characterized by the exact same distribution parameters. (2) $n$ is sufficiently large that the variance of a sample of length $n$ is always the same, or may be approximated as such. Let's start out like this: $\hatβ=({X'X})^{-1}X'y$ $\text{Var}(\hatβ)=\text{Var}[({X'X})^{-1}X'y]$ Now, let the columns of $X$ be mutually orthogonal, each with variance $σ^2$ and mean $0$. $X'X$ is then a $(p+1)$-dimensional diagonal matrix whose elements are $nσ^2$. $({X'X})^{-1}$ is just the element-by-element inversion of the diagonals of $X'X$, that is, a $(p+1)$-dimensional diagonal matrix whose elements are $1/{(nσ^2)}$. That brings us to $\text{Var}(\hatβ)=[1/{(nσ^2)}]^2I_{p+1}\text{Var}[X'y]$ $\text{Var}(\hatβ)=[1/{(n^2σ^4)}]I_{p+1}\text{Var}[X'y]$ However, if $y$ is just a univariate response with variance $σ^2$ and mean $0$, then there's no need for the identity matrix in specifying its variance; its variance is a scalar. As specified in the first paragraph, each of the columns of $X$ also has variance $σ^2$ and mean $0$, so the variance of $X'y$ is given by a $(p+1)$-by-$1$ column vector whose elements are $nσ^4$, i.e., $nσ^41_{p+1}$. The presence of the $n$ term seems strange until you realize that we are actually talking about the variance of the sum of $n$ random variables, each with variance $σ^4$ (the product of two random variables each with variance $σ^2$ and mean $0$). That is, $\text{Var}(\hatβ)=[1/{(n^2σ^4)}]I_{p+1}nσ^41_{p+1}$ So we have a $(p+1)$-by-$(p+1)$ diagonal matrix multiplying a $(p+1)$-by-$1$ vector, each of whose elements are $\text{Var}(\hatβ_i)=[1/{(n^2σ^4)}]nσ^4=1/n$ Note the absence of $σ^2$, which is due to our specification that all the vectors have the same variance. The summation of the $p+1$ elements of the variance vector therefore scales linearly with $p+1$, which we also expect. This is essentially the variance of $\hat{y}$, which tends to exhibit proportionality to $(p+1)/n$. Here is a resource I've found useful, and extends this explanation to regularized (ridge) regression.
