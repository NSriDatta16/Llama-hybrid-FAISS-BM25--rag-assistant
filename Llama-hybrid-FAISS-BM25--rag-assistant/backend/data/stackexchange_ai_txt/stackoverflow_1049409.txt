How many integer points within the three points forming a triangle?

Actually this is a classic problem as SO user Victor put it (in another SO question regarding which tasks to ask during an interview). I couldn't do it in an hour (sigh) so what is the algorithm that calculates the number of integer points within a triangle? EDIT : Assume that the vertices are at integer coordinates. (otherwise it becomes a problem of finding all points within the triangle and then subtracting all the floating points to be left with only the integer points; a less elegant problem).
