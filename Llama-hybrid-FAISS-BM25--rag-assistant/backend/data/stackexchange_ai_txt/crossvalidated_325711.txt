Log posterior probability in MCMC is decreasing

I am running a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (of phylogenetic trees using Beast2) and checking the traces, I notice that the log of the posterior probability has been generally decreasing by 1000 log units over the last 400000 samples. I would expect the posterior to move upwards in general until it approaches a (local) maximum and then to jump around in that region, only rarely leaving it for lower-probability areas and probably returning soon. Is something wrong with my expectation; or do I need to check my setup (in particular my operators â€“ but they are standard Beast and should be tested to be reasonably symmetric); or should I just wait much longer because it's likely that the chain will move somewhere else again and increase in probability?
