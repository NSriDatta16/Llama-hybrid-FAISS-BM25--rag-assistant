By reading your line males and females tend to express this same trait in different ways I assume that you will like to do factor analysis separately for men and women to explore underlying factors. If yes, and if you use SPSS, have you explored "Selection Variable:" option in factor analysis dialogue box? precisely this acts as a data filter. So you can drag gender/sex variable into that cell and can set value for male and do the analysis and repeat this for female. All the best.
