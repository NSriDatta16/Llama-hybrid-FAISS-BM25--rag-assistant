Crossover trials are used most often for drug treatments but the design can be suitable for the study of other interventions that do not permanently alter the disease or process under study. In a 2009 publication about 519 randomized trials published in December 2000, Mills et al. identified 127 that were crossover trials. They reported that: "In total, 30/127 (24%) trials measured drug pharmacokinetics, 36/127 (28%) were non-drug interventions while almost half, 61/127 (48%) were studies of drug efficacy." Mills EJ, Chan AW, Wu P, Vail A, Guyatt GH, Altman DG. Design, analysis, and presentation of crossover trials. Trials. 2009;10:27. Published 2009 Apr 30. doi:10.1186/1745-6215-10-27 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19405975/ A published systematic assessment of the topic areas for more recent crossover trials could not be identified. PERMANENT ALTERATION OF THE DISEASE OR PROCESS The crossover trial is not suitable for the study of a treatment that permanently alters the disease or process under study. See Sibbald B, Roberts C. Understanding controlled trials. Crossover trials. BMJ. 1998;316(7146):1719. doi:10.1136/bmj.316.7146.1719 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1113275/ “…..the treatment must be one that does not permanently alter the disease or process under study.” Thus, crossover trials would not be suitable for the study of surgical procedures, other procedures (like laser and radiotherapy) that alter body organs or structures, or interventions that involve the permanent implantation of a device. But there are procedures whose effect is not permanent. One example of such a procedure is acupuncture. Crossover trials can be suitable in the study of acupuncture and this design has been used to evaluate acupuncture. Here is a published example. https://pmlegacy.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060186 There are devices whose effect is not permanent. Examples are blood pressure monitoring devices. VACCINES Crossover trials have been used to study vaccines. Published examples are: Kotloff KL, Wasserman SS, O'Donnell S.

GENERAL USES OF CROSSOVER DESIGNS Experts advise that: “Crossover trials are generally restricted to the study of short term outcomes in chronic diseases or processes because the disease or process needs to persist long enough for the investigator to expose the subject to each of the experimental treatments and measure the response.” See Sibbald B, Roberts C. Understanding controlled trials. Crossover trials. BMJ. 1998;316(7146):1719. doi:10.1136/bmj.316.7146.1719 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1113275/ NUTRITION Crossover trials to study nutrition are common.
