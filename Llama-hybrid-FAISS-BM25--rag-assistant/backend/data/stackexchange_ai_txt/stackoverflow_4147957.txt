Prototype machine whose complete design is based on the relational model

In the Preface to Ted Codd's The Relational Model for Database Management, Version 2 , he writes (first paragraph): Today, if you have a well-designed database management system, you have the keys to the kingdom of data processing and decision support. That is why there now exists a prototype machine whose complete design is based on the relational model. Its arithmetic hardware is quite minor part of the architecture. In fact, the old term "computer system" now seems like a misnomer. Does anyone know what prototype machine Ted Codd was referring to? I would love to read old Computer Science / Computer Engineering papers describing this machine.
