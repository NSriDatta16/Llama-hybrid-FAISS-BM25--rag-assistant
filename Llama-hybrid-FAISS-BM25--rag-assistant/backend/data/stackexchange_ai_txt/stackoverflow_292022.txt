The scenario you explain is a common one and one of the benefits of using replication. No changes or indexes you create on the subscriber will go to the publisher as it is a one way process. If you have to re-run the snapshot agent for some reason and re-initialize the subscriber than you will need to re-create your indexes on the subscriber. There are alot of things you can do to minimize the need to re-initialize the subscriber but some of them require some manual steps. Generally if you keep all of your index creation scripts for the subscriber up to date it usually isn't a big deal to re-run them if needed.
