I haven't gotten around to implementing it for all the models that can accept weights. Right now, it should work for rpart variants, glmnet , gamSpline , glmboost , gamboost , evtree , ctree , ctree2 , chaid , cforest , blackboost , treebag , glm , glmStepAIC , and bayesglm . Note that ksvm function does not have a weight parameter, so those models won't be enabled.
