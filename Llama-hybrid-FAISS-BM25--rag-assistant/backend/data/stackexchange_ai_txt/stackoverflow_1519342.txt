What does the ArrayList consist of? As others said, it may be impossible in certain cases, but quite possible and guaranteed to work if : each string representation of element of the array can be identified unambiguously (as it can be for example if the ArrayList consists of Integer s) there is a way to create an object of original type from its String representation. I find it most elegant to do this using a static method fromString Of course, this mimics the whole (de)serialization framework.
