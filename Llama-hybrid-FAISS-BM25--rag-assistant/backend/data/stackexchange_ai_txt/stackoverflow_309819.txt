CSS Conventions / Code Layout Models

Has there been any attempt and creating a formalized method for organizing CSS code? Before I go and make up my own strategy for keeping things readable, I'm wondering what else is out there. Google hasn't been very helpful, as I'm not entirely sure what terms to search for. I'm thinking more along the lines of indenting/spacing, when to use new lines, naming conventions, etc. Any ideas?
