core data dynamic entities

I want to be able to create a dynamic entity based on attributes that will be defined in another entity. For example: Entity:Lifeform Attribute->name:String Entity:LifeformCharacteristics Attribute->name:String Attribute->type:String Entity:DynamicCatalog So the characteristics entity will be a entity that will be populated by whatever the user adds. An example characteristic could be name:Height type:Number. So these characteristics define what I want the dynamic catalog to be. As such the DynamicCatalog should be created with the attribute Height. The DynamicCatalogs will also have to be visible in a table so the user can add and remove items to the catalogs. I can build and manage the first 2 entities via my DataModel, but the 3rd is dynamic and I'm not sure how to go about it. I was hoping to use core data to keep the headache of managing data to a minimal. This post is the closest thing I've found to an answer, but I'm not sure now to display or reorganize a collection like this: Faking a dynamic schema in Core Data?
