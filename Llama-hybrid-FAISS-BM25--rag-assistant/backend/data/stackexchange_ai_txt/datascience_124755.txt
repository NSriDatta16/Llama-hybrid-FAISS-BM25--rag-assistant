Let's take a look at definitions first. According to Wikipedia: In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software A mathematical model is an abstract description of a concrete system using mathematical concepts and language The first remark might be that both framework and model are multipronged and ambiguous terms. I had to narrow them down to software framework and mathematical model based on the context to attempt to answer your question. Based on these definitions you might note that both these terms describe abstractions that can be used within some broader system. However, as I understand , a model is a description of something, when a framework doesn't have to. I perceive a framework to often be a bag of tools or a set of functionalities when a model attempts to utilise a relationship between some concepts. For instance, TensorFlow is a framework, but a neural network might be a model.
