Is it correct to use categorical inputs in a Neural Network to predict another categorical output?

Let's say we want to predict only whether next day's temperature is going up or down (so two classes as opposed to predicting the actual temperature). Would there be any issues with using another binary predictor in the form of "1/-1" for example as an input? And how can such a setup be made even more accurate? (like, would using one-hot encoding increase accuracy as opposed to just inputting 1 and -1 directly etc)
