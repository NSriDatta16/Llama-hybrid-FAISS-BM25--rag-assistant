How do I scroll a set of UIScrollViews together?

Setup: I have a UITableView , each UITableViewCell has a UIScrollView . What I am trying to do is to get all of the UIScrollViews to scroll together, such that when you scroll one of them all of the UIScrollViews appear to scroll simultaneously. What I've done is subclass UITableView so that it has an array of all of the UIScrollViews within its table cells. I then forwarded TouchesBegan , TouchesMoved , TouchesCancelled , and TouchesEnded from the UITableView to all of the UIScrollViews in the array. This doesn't appear to work. The UIScrollViews do not scroll! The only way I've managed to get this to work is to call the setContentOffset : method on the scrollviews. However, this is a pretty bad solution since it doesn't give you the swiping and deceleration features of the UIScrollView . Any ideas on why my touches methods aren't getting to the UIScrollViews ? Or a better way to implement this?
