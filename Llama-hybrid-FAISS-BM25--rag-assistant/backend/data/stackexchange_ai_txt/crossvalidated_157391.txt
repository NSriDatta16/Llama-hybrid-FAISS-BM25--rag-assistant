Linear SVM - huge differences between libraries' accuracy

I use two libraries to perform SVM: liblinear and sofia (implements PEGASOS). I train them both on the same data (linear SVM), and then test them on two different data sets. The accuracy is very different: In one test set, liblinear accuracy is 95% whereas sofia accuracy is 80% (this test test is made out of only positive labels) In the other data set, liblinear accuracy is 90% whereas sofia accuracy is 97% (this test test is made out of only negative labels) The both perform similarly over the balanced train data, with 95% accuracy in 10-fold CV. Does that make any sense?
