How to organize views and controllers hierarchically when having model with many children

Lets say I've a website that lists Persons, and each Person has multiple properties, some one-to-one (name, address), some one-to-many (favorite colors, bank-accounts etc). In my business layer it's nicely hierarchically organized. How do I organize this is my controllers and views? Should I have a PersonsController, FavoriteColorsController etc? all residing in the same namespace and folder? Or should I have ony a PersonsController with many actions, such as IndexFavouriteColors, UpdateFavoriteColor etc. Both of the options are not quite it. The first one doesn't show that FavoriteColors is a child of Person and can only be used in the context of a person. The second one will create a huge PersonController. The same thing with the views of course. The nicest would be to have Views/Persons/index.aspx Views/Persons/details.aspx Views/Persons/ etc. Views/Persons/FavoriteColors/index.aspx Views/Persons/FavoriteColors/details.aspx In this example I gave only a few one-to-many properties to the Person, but actually there are many (10+), so that increases the need for clarity. Thanks.
