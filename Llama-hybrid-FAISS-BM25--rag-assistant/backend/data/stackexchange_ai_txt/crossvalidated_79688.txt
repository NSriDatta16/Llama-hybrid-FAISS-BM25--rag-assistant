Using ANOSIM or PERMANOVA to abiotics data?

I'm new here and have some doubts. I'm working with a large data set of water quality and want to test for differences between the hydrological stations and between stretches of the river. There is a large internal variability into class factors. For this, I intend to do the following analyses: Exploratory PCA: to select variables that explain the variability in dataset. DA: to sort and visualize the a priori groups. Manova (transformed data) or ANOSIM: to detect statistical significance between a priori groups. In this analysis lies my main doubt, because I frequently use ANOSIM or PERMANOVA for species abundance data. Could I use these analyses for abiotic data? Another doubt: When I use PERMANOVA or ANOSIM, I do SIMPER analysis with a complement, to track what variables (species) that caused the difference detected. Could I use this analysis (SIMPER) too? Or should I test each variable separately by univariate analyses as Kruskal-Wallis or ANOVA?
