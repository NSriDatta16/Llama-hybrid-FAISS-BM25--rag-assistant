PCA on fully centered data vs PCA on "centered around meaningful part of object"?

PCA on fully centered data vs PCA on "centered around meaningful part of object"? So usually PCA (in R at least) centers the data so that e.g. $(0,0,0)$ will be at the center of the data. However, if one's data is such that it has an area relative to which one wants to produce the PCA, then how does one progress? I.e. how does one customize the centering so that PCA is relative to a part/point that one decides?
