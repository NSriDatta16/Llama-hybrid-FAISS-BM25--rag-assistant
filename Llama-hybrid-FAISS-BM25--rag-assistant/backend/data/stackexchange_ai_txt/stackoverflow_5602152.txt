You are battling with the default skin of the button. If you were to create a new button skin based on ButtonSkin , you would see that the alpha for the entire skin is set: alpha.disabled="0.5" . Setting the value to 1.0 solves your problem, but it seems overkill to define this entire skin just to modify this single value. Hopefully, there is a more elegant way. I tried setting alpha: 1.0; in the disabled style, but it doesn't take. The only thing I have been able to do is create a new button style, set alpha.disabled="1.0" and telling the button to use that slightly modified style.
