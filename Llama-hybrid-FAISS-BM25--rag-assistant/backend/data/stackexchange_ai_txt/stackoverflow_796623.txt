To make tests reproducible, simply use a fixed seed start value. That ensures the same data is used whenever the test runs. Tests will reliably pass or fail. Good / bad candidates? Randomized tests are good at finding edge cases (exceptions). A problem is to define the correct result of a randomized input. Determining the number of times to run the code: Simply try it out, if it takes too long reduce the iteration count. You may want to use a code coverage tool to find out what part of your application is actually tested. Are these kinds of tests well suited for unit tests? Yes.
