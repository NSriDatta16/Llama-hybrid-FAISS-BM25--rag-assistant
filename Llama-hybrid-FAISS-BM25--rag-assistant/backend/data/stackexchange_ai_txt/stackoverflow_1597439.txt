Why not copy the div containing the advert into a new blank page, then do a screenshot of that browser window. Then you can easily trim away the browser window and the blank screen. Would that work? Photoshop has a "trim" command to remove all the white borders. So you could easily do an action to crop a certain amount from each side to remove the browser window, then trim to remove the white. Then you have just the advert. You do have a problem that if the advert has significant whitespace at the edges then it would be lost. Another way would be to add a 2px magenta (for example) border to the add, and then programmatically get rid of everything outside the border.
