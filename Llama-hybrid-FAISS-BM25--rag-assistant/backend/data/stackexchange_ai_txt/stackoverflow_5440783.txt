Honestly, if people aren't complaining it's probably not a big deal. If people are complaining, start by looking at the database. In my years of web development most web application performance problems have stemmed from the DB (this doesn't mean that all performance problems come from the DB but it's a good place to start). While I am fascinated for things like minified JS and css sprites, I suspect that these things do not make a difference in a "day in the life of your average web developer". It's good that you consider these things, but unless you are working at an extremely high traffic site, it probably won't make a difference.
