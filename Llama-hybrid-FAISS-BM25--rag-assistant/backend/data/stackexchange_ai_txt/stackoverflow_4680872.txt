Using jQuery templates with complex objects and getting values from subcollections

In my jQuery template I need to get the value of an item that is contained within a subcollection of my data structure. Say I have a data structure that looks like this: Benefit One This is benefit One 5000000 200 Benefit Two This is benefit Two 1000 100 10.99 I can then convert this into a JSON string that looks like this: [{"AgentName":null,"AgentId":null,"QuoteId":null,"ProductId":"abc","ProductName":"Standard","Benefits":[{"Name":"Benefit One","Description":"\n This is benefit One \n ","Value":5000000,"ValueComment":null,"Excess":200,"ExcessComment":null},{"Name":"Benefit Two","Description":"\n This is benefit Two\n ","Value":1000,"ValueComment":null,"Excess":100,"ExcessComment":null}],"Price":10.99} In my jQuery Template I want to create a table that shows the Product ID, Product Name, Price and ONLY the value of Benefit One: ${ProductId} ${ProductName} // Somehow need to query the benefits collection to get only the value of Benefit One ${ ***ONLY BENEFIT ONE*** .value } ${Price} Thanks for your help.
