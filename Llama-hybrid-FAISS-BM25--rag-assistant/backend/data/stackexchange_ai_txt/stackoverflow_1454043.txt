Walking through html searching for first level blocks

In addition to my other question about the analyzing of html, and searching for and / tags this question. $in = ' Bit\'s of text another paragraph item1 item2 paragraph '; function geefParagrafen($in){ $dom = new domDocument; $dom->loadHTML($in); $x = $dom->documentElement; } this is how far i got. What is the way to get an $out as an array containing the following: $out = array(' Bit's of text another paragraph ', ' another paragraph ', ' item1 item2 ', ' paragraph '); Thanks in advance! I'm really lost in the domdocument structure.
