About 3 years ago I built a site for a somewhat large non-profit organization in our state. When it came time to deploy the application to their web host server, I noticed an odd file named "cc.txt" or something obvious like that in their public site. It was under their web root, was getting served, and was a csv file of all their donor's names, addresses, credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV/CVC codes. I cannot count the number of times I brought the issue up - first to my boss, then our company accountant, the client's IT director, finally the client's President. That was 3 years ago. The file is still being served, it can even be googled. And it's been updated. I tend not to respond to their donation solicitations when I get them.
