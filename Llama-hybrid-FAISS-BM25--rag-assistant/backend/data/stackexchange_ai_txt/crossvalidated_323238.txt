How to calculate CV performance?

There seem to exist two ways of calculating the $k$-fold cross-validation performance of a model. For each fold, evaluate the performance measure (e.g. MSE) on the hold-out observations. Then, calculate the average of these $k$ values. For each fold, calculate the predictions on the hold-out set. Then, calculate the single performance score from all pooled predictions together. In my opinion, the first method is easier to implement in parallelized calculations, while the second one somehow feels more stable for small hold-out sets. Take e.g. a leave-one-out CV with R-squared as performance measure. There, only Option 2 is possible. Are both options considered to be proper? Are there any good references or hints about this?
