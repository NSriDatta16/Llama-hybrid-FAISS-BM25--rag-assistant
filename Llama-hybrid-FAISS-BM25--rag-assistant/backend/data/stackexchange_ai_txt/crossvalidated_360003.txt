R or Python Equivalent to SAS Text Miner

I am working on a project where a former member of the team used SAS Text Miner ( https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/txtminer/14.1/tmref.pdf ) to complete some text mining. Unfortunately, this member of the team has moved on and no one has access to the code they wrote to do the analysis. My job is to update the analysis with new data, but I only have two weeks to do it and I have never used SAS. I'm looking for an R or Python equivalent to SAS's Text Mining capabilities. From what I can tell, the former colleague leveraged SAS's Parse, Filter, and Cluster nodes (page 6 of pdf). The deliverable should be a text concept linking diagram or table. Any ideas for good packages for this in R or python? Thanks.
