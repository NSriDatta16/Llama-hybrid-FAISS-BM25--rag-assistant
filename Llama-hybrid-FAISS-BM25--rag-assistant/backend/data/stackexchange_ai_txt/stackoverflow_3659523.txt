TinyMCE in Django Template

Using django-tinymce I have successfully embedded TinyMCE in the Admin before. Embedding it in a front-end form does not seem to work for me however. I have a form which is a modelForm. It doesn't add any extra fields ('comment' and 'statement' are the only fields used and they exist in the model). On the textarea field, 'comment', of that form I would like to use TinyMCE. I have tried the following: class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm): comment = forms.CharField(widget=TinyMCE(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 30}, mce_attrs=TINYMCE_USER_CONFIG)) class Meta: model = Entry fields = ['statement','comment',] and class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Entry fields = ['statement','comment',] def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super(EntryForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.fields['comment'].widget = TinyMCE(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 15}, mce_attrs=TINYMCE_USER_CONFIG,) and class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Entry fields = ['statement','comment',] class Media: js = ('/media/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js', '/sitemedia/js/tinymce_setup.js',) In the HEAD html tags I have put {{ form.media }} (the form is called form in the views and template). I am also using Grappelli and Filebrowser for the Admin. Could someone please explain what I'm missing or the process of getting this to work? Thanks very much!
