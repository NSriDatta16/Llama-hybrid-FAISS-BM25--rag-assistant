When reading data from a pipe or socket, you have three options: Process it and forget it. Add it to a complete record in memory and process it before or after doing so. Add it to a complete file and process it before or after doing so. That's the complete list. There's nowhere else to record it but short-term or long-term storage, so the only other thing you can do with data you read is to not record it at all. The only other way to get the data again is for whatever sent it to you to send it again.
