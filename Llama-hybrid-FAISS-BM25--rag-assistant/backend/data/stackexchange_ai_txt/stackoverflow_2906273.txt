The problem is from the UAC, just as you suspected. What you need to do is not only run your application as administrator, but also run the source program you are dragging from as administrator too. They must both have the same permission/rights in order to drag and drop between the two. So, for example, if the source program is Internet Explorer and its running with user level permissions, but the target is running with administrator, drag and drop will not work. Hope this helps
