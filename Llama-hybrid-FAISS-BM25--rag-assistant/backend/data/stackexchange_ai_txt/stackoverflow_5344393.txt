When creating the request you just need to make sure to keep the GET params in the path: req = Net::HTTP::Post.new("#{uri.path}?#{uri.query}", { 'Referer' => "http://www.example.com/referer", 'User-Agent'=> "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)", 'Cookie' => $cookie }) Notice that instead of just uri.path , I append the ? and uri.query to it. This should pass the GET parameters as well as the POST ones.
