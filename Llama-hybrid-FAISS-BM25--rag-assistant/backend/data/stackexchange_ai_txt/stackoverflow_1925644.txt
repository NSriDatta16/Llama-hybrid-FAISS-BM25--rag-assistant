Ghost requests in asp.net?

In an ASP.Net WAP, the home page /default.aspx is receiving periodic requests from I-know-not-where. Thinking this was BS when it was reported, I fired up my local copy of the site under Cassini and set a breakpoint on the home page's page_load() event. Sure enough, every few minutes the breakpoint is hit. Any suggestions? This is a pretty cut-and-dry site with no monitoring services, etc running, especially on my local machine. When the breakpoint is hit, the site's not even open in a browser. Help! update on the dev box, this appears to be happening in exactly 5 minute increments. update By examining the request object when the breakpoint is hit, I can tell that the request is coming from the local machine. However, I don't even have a browser open that's pointed at any local site. Argh. I've not been to successfully configure Fiddler to capture any traffic that doesn't go to an outside machine. It's also worth noting that attempting to trace/step over when the break point is hit just runs the process - it doesn't break again until the 5 minutes are up. Wahoo. another update running the site on a dev server that no one is touching is producing a hit in the log every 5 minutes +- 1 second from 127.0.0.1. There aren't any browsers running on that machine. Also, I'm logging the request url, user agent and session id for every request, and all three are null. Ideas?!?
