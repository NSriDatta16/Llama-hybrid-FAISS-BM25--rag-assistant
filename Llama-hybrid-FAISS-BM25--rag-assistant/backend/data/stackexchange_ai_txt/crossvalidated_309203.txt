Can I use logistic analysis for two surveys that were conducted at two different time points

I have a two data sets - through two surveys that were conducted in the same organization at two different time points (couple of years apart). Both the surveys were to test if people experienced the event under investigation or not. So my outcome variable is yes or no for both the datasets. The other variables are age, gender and two categorical variables regarding type of job and nature of the contract. My question is can I use logistic regression to see if the odds of event occurring are significantly different between the two groups while controlling for the variables such as age, gender etc.? Thank you for your help.
