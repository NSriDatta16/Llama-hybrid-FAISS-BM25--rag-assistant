Override the Local module directory for cvs using Hudson

I'm using Hudson and I need to change the checkout directory for cvs. Instead of checkout/update the project under the workspace dir, I'd like to specify a dir (as you can do for svn, changing the Local module directory conf) that will match the cvs tree structure. Eg. under cvs dir1/dir2/project on my box workspace/dir1/dir2/project is that possible with cvs and Hudson? Maybe there's a way to override the cvs call? Thanks! Roberto
