Drag/Size Handle implementation

I'm looking for drag/size handle implementations or explanations. Perhaps I'm using the wrong nomenclature, but I mean the "handles" that appear around an object (mostly in drawing programs) when you select it and want to perform an operation on that object such as rotate, size, scale, etc... Can anyone point me to an OSS implementation I can look at or explain how they have/would implement this?
