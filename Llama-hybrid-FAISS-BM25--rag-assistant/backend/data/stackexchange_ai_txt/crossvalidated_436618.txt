How to test between-level significance in logistic regression

I have a logistic regression model which has one (significant) explanatory term and seven levels. I am trying to work out how to test for significant differences between the levels. It seems I have two options: 1) Looking at the p-values associated with each of the level coefficents, and re-running the model seven times changing the reference level each time. I can then construct a table of all pairwise comparisons. As these wouldn't really be separate tests (as I'm only changing the reference level, not the model), I don't think I'd need to correct for multiple comparisons? 2) A Tukey HSD i.e. summary(glht(sp2model, mcp(factor="Tukey"))) I'd be grateful if people could advise on whether option 1 is correct and/or what seems reasonable. I am working in R.
