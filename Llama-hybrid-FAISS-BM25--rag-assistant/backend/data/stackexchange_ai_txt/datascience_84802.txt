How much GPUs are needed for Image ehancement?

I'm looking for a GPU to train my model. Most of the papers that I have followed used 2 or more gtx 1050ti card or higher. ( MIRNet , EnlightenGAN ) I need to that how much GPU power will it take to train my model. I need to estimate my resources before I start my research. I have a very tight budget not more than 1200$. will a Lenovo legion 5 ( ryzen 7, 16gb ram, 1660ti 6b ) will be enough for that? should I go for an RTX 2060 or higher? or can you suggest any other options. I want to know will it be enough to train those models. Thank you!
