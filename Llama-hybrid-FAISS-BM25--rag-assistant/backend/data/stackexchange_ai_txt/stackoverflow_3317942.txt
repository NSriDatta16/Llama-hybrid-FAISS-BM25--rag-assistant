I need to come up with a way to test my code to make sure it comes up with the same answers as the previous code. Unit Testing Since you mentioned that it is about a program that takes parameters in a file and outputs a report, you could generate a few inputs that give sufficient coverage to the portions you want to unit test against the output from the old code. If something breaks don't forget there is also a chance you have discovered a bug in the old code. http://www.junit.org/ Progressive Port I'd go for porting it piece by piece, I kind of feel it will fit your problem since in a report you can grab specific fields and ignore those that you have not ported yet (assuming to output one field/calculation you do not need the whole program to be ported) and verify it against the correct value from the old code (or other correct source in case of bugs in the old code).
