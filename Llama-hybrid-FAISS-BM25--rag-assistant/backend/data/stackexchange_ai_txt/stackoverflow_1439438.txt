Design Patterns (or techniques) for Scalability

What design patterns or techniques have you used that are specifically geared toward scalability ? Patterns such as the Flyweight pattern seem to me to be a specialized version of the Factory Pattern , to promote high scalability or when working within memory or storage constraints. What others have you used? ( Denormalization of Databases , etc.) Do you find that the rules change when high availability or scalability is your primary goal? Possible situations are: Mobile devices with more limited memory, processing power, and connectivity than a Desktop or Laptop High # of users on limited hardware (caching strategies, etc) Optimization of database schema for efficiency in lieu of a normalized design (e.g. SharePoint column wrapping for storage)
