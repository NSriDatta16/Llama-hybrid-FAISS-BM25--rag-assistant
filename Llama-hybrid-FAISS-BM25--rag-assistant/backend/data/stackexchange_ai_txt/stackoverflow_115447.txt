Yes, I frequently use Big-O notation, or rather, I use the thought processes behind it, not the notation itself. Largely because so few developers in the organization(s) I frequent understand it. I don't mean to be disrespectful to those people, but in my experience, knowledge of this stuff is one of those things that "sorts the men from the boys". I wonder if this is one of those questions that can only receive "yes" answers? It strikes me that the set of people that understand computational complexity is roughly equivalent to the set of people that think it's important. So, anyone that might answer no perhaps doesn't understand the question and therefore would skip on to the next question rather than pause to respond. Just a thought ;-)
