There are some cool enhancements in VS2008 that tend to get lost between all the big new features. Drastically improved average build times of solutions with many projects. If you have a solution with dozens of projects, it will take VS2005 about a minute to build it, even if nothing has changed, because that's how long it takes VS2005 to verify nothing has changed. In VS2008, the check for "dirty" projects is instantaneous. Huge productivity enhancement, and I couldn't find this feature noted anywhere. VS2008 allows you use the form designer even when it detects that something may be wrong, VS2005 doesn't allow this. This is a life saver when dealing with WinForms bugs. In addition to the VS2008 Features, check out the features that VS2008 SP1 added. I specifically liked the new C# background compilation. I suggest you just go ahead and try the free version of VS2008. Aside from the big new features, there are countless "small" enhancement you can only find by using the product, some of which may be important to you. BTW, you may also want to check out the features of VS2010. It's still CTP, and it will probably be released near 2010, but depending on your needs it may be worth the wait before upgrading.
