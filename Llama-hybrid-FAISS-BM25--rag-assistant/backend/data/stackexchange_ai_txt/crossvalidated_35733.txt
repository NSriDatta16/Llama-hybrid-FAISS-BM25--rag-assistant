Vector Auto-Regression generalizes time-series methods by allowing multiple time series to be analyzed together. Using standard (i.e., Box-Jenkins) time-series methods, a series can be modeled such that a current value is, in part, a function of previous values (called lags). Vector auto-regression allows a series to also be partly a function of the lags of a second (or more) series, and the other series to be partly a function of the lags of the first series, simultaneously. Important uses of VAR are forecasting and testing for Granger causality .
