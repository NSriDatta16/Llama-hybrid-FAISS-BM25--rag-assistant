I have a similar issue using jQuery UI draggable and sortable (ver. 1.8.1), and it's quite specific, so I assume that you are using same library. Problem is caused by a bug in jQuery UI (actually a fix for other Safari bug). I just raised the issue in jQuery UI http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5678 so I guess you will need to wait till it's fixed. I've found a workaround for this, but it's quite hard-core, so you only use it if you really know what is going on ;) if ($.browser.safari) { $.ui.mouse.prototype.__mouseDown = $.ui.mouse.prototype._mouseDown; $.ui.mouse.prototype._mouseDown = function(event){ event.preventDefault(); return $.ui.mouse.prototype.__mouseDown.apply(this, arguments); } } It simply switches off the fix that's in jQuery UI code, so basically it may break something.
