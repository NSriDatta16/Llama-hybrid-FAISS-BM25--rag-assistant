Can you make a section of a table belong to a form using legal HTML?

I've tried entering the following in the HTML validator , but it failed to validate even when I used the "Validate HTML fragment" option: tables + forms = BOOM I think what I'm trying to do here is pretty clear, but the validator seems to be telling me this isn't allowed :(. What if I want a single table to contain multiple forms? I guess there are alot of possibilities for how to split up a into several forms, but it seems reasonable to at least allow tr and/or tbody be children of form. Using separate tables does not give the same effect, because the column widths may not end up being the same.
