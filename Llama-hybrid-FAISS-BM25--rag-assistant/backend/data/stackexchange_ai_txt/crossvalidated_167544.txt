In a Probit (and Logit) model the interesting factor is (often): $$ \Delta \hat{P} (y=1|\boldsymbol{x}) \approx [g(\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\boldsymbol{x}]\Delta x_j $$ This means that in Probit (Logit) model, the average/partial effect cannot be traced out directly from the estimate of some $\beta_j$. One can show that only the sign (+/-), of the estiamte does not change - however, the effect does change - depending on "where" (how large or small) the other $\boldsymbol{x_j}$ are. So to answer your question, you cannot conclude as you do - it is littearly relative. Unless, as TrynnaDoStat says, you include excatly the same variables.
