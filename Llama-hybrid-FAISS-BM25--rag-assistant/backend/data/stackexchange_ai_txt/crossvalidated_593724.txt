How to measure effectiveness of warehouse pickers?

Workers in a warehouse pick items in a pick-list to fulfil orders. The number of orders a worker fulfils in a shift depends on how quickly they work. But the total number of orders received per day changes - for instance, fewer orders are received at weekends. (More orders means more work available.) Also, the headcount of a shift varies due to assigned staffing levels and absences. (Lower headcount means more work available.) Lastly, the orders can vary in complexity, so some take longer. Is a simple average of number of orders per worker a fair measure of effectiveness or is it biased against weekend staff? Is measuring average picking time fair given the varying complexity? If not, what measures are better?
