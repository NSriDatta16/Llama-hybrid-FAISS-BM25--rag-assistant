Iterable objects and array type hinting?

I have a lot of functions that either have type hinting for arrays or use is_array() to check the array-ness of a variable. Now I'm starting to use objects that are iterable. They implement Iterator or IteratorAggregate . Will these be accepted as arrays if they pass through type hinting, or undergo is_array() ? If I have to modify my code, is there a generic sort of is_iterable() , or must I do something like: if ( is_array($var) OR $var instance_of Iterable OR $var instanceof IteratorAggregate ) { ... } What other iterable interfaces are out there?
