Example of a RoboCup 3D Soccer bot?

I'd like to write a bot to play in the 3D RoboCup software soccer simulation league that runs under SimSpark . Can anyone point me at some code that already deals with communication with the server, etc? (source: sourceforge.net ) Ideally this would be .NET code, but an example produced in any language would still be useful. EDIT For anyone who is not familiar with the RoboCup 3D Soccer league, check out this YouTube video . It has some pretty funny moments, if you're into that sort of thing... EDIT 2 Still no answers? I put together a page on Wikipedia dedicated to the RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer League for further information. Here's another YouTube video of the SEU-RedSun team kicking goals at the 2008 RoboCup championship. Their agents are considerably more sophisticated (and coordinated) than those in the first video I linked to.
