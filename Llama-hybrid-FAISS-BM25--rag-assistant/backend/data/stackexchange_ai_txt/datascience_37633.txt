Is NN with no hidden layer is behave like a regression?

Is a NN with no hidden layer is behave like a regression? What we could say that NN without hidden layer can say us? â€‹ If we have for instance 20 input and 4 output and I have no true label, is it similar to regression? If it is a regression then it will be a supervised learning however there is no true label! What is wrong inside this clarification? more clarification: Also, I have a dqn ( a deep learning structure inside q-learning approach)! Unfortunately I do not have the optimal answer of it! I am looking for a way to compare my results, Maybe I can compare by putting a un/supervised learning approach instead of DNN! For instance, you can put a DNN without hidden layer and as it behaves like the linear regression then you can put every supervised learning instead of it! As there is no True label I have problem with training section and estimate the DNN section with supervised learning! Also,as it is MDP, I can not estimate the DNN section with unsupervised learning!
