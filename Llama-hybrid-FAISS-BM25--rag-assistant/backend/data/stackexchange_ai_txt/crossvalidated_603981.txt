What residuals are used when testing for auto-correlation with time series data?

I'm looking to compare two sets of time series data via T-test (let's call them X and Y) to see if there's a statistically significant difference in means. I understand (I think) the need to test for auto-correlation to ensure there's no correlation between residuals of the regression. What I'm not understanding is what residuals are being referred to here. Would this be the residuals from the regression of X vs Y? I'm unclear on what's considered the "predictor" here as I'm not trying to fit a model to the time series data.
