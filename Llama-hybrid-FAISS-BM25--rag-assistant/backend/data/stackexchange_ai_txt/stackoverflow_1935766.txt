Yahoo invisible

Some friends with the help of various sites check and know when i'm invisible on yahoo messenger and keep bragging about this. Being curious about this I've tested lots of sites that check if a user is invisible on yahoo messenger and all of them sent me a C1 packet type. From what i've tested I'm(my ymsgr client) not sending anything back. So i only receive 1 packet from the bot that performs the check and that's it, they know if i'm invisible or not. Next i thought that if i'm not sending anything back then maybe the yahoo server sends something back to i tested on a friend of mine and i sent him a c1 packet but i did not received anything back from nobody (neither the server neither my friend). So how do they do that? I'm just looking for some hints, not expecting for code or someone else to solve it for me. I just like the thrill in learning and discovering by myself just that now i'm stuck with no idea :) Thanks.
