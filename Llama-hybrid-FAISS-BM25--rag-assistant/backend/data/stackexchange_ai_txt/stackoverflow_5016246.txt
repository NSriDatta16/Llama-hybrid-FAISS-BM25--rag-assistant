The function mode() is used to find out the storage mode of the the object, in this case is is stored as mode "numeric" . This function is not used to find the most "frequent" observed value in a data set, i.e. it is not used to find the statistical mode. See ?mode for more on what this function does in R and why it isn't useful for your problem. For discrete data, the mode is the most frequent observed value among the set: > set.seed(1) ## reproducible example > dat (tab which.max(tab) ## which is the mode? 4 4 > tab[which.max(tab)] ## what is the frequency of the mode? 4 26 For continuous data, the mode is the value of the data at which the probability density function (PDF) reaches a maximum. As your data are generally a sample from some continuous probability distribution, we don't know the PDF but we can estimate it through a histogram or better through a kernel density estimate. Returning to the iris data, here is an example of determining the mode from continuous data: > sepalwd plot(sepalwd) > str(sepalwd) List of 7 $ x : num [1:512] 1.63 1.64 1.64 1.65 1.65 ... $ y : num [1:512] 0.000244 0.000283 0.000329 0.000379 0.000436 ... $ bw : num 0.123 $ n : int 150 $ call : language density.default(x = Sepal.Width) $ data.name: chr "Sepal.Width" $ has.na : logi FALSE - attr(*, "class")= chr "density" > with(sepalwd, which.max(y)) ## which value has maximal density? [1] 224 > with(sepalwd, x[which.max(y)]) ## use the above to find the mode [1] 3.000314 See ?density for more info. By default, density() evaluates the kernel density estimate at n = 512 equally spaced locations. If this is too crude for you, increase the number of locations evaluated and returned: > sepalwd2 with(sepalwd, x[which.max(y)]) [1] 3.000314 In this case it doesn't alter the result.
