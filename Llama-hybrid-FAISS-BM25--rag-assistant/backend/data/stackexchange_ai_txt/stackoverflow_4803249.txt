Adding or Replacing a new Panel to inside a Window in Ext JS

Problem has been solved already, Thanks anyways :) I've got a Ext.Window object. something like: var mypanel= new Ext.Panel({title:'Placeholder'}); var cwin = new Ext.Window({ layout:'fit', width:screen.width-200, x:200, y:150, draggable: false, closable: false, resizable: false, plain: true, border: false, items: [mypanel] }); I'm trying to replace 'mypanel' with another Ext.Panel object when the user triggers a specific event. So i figured I could remove mypanel and than add a new panel to it. I got the removing working. The adding however is a different story, I've tried stuff in the direction of: mypanel= new Ext.Panel({title:'my new Panel'}); cwin.add(mypanel); //dit nothing cwin.items.add(mypanel); //dit nothing cwin.insert(0,mypanel); //dit nothing cwin.items.insert(0,mypanel); //dit nothing I'll be happy with any answer for either replacing the existing panel or adding a new panel. Thank you.
