The individual-neuron calcium signals described in the Kingsbury et al. paper were evaluated "during behavior events" (maybe better described as behavior epochs) within mice. This was done in by placing two mice to face each other in a tube, and determining periods showing behaviors of "push," "retreat" and "approach" for each mouse over time. A continuous fluorescent measure of calcium concentration $(\Delta F/F)$ was evaluated across multiple "behavior events" with what seems to have been a standard AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) approach. That was evidently done individually for each type of behavior event, over a series of different types of events and periods without the evaluated behaviors. The circular permutations were done to estimate a random null distribution against which to evaluate the AUROC values within an individual neuron, to identify cells whose activity was associated with a behavior. 1000 circular permutations were done for each neuron. A neuron was considered significantly responsive (⍺ = 0.05) if its auROC value exceeded the 95th percentile of the random distribution (auROC 97.5th percentile for excited responses). What's important in that application is to randomize the calcium signals among the behavior types and periods without the specified behaviors . I don't see that the (admittedly large) short-term correlations in the calcium signal over time would pose a problem, provided that the signals were adequately randomized among behaviors/lack-of-behavior . If you are considering a similar approach, that larger-scale randomization is what's critical. Figure 5 shows that this approach was successful in identifying subsets of cells associated with increased or decreased activity for each of the 3 behaviors. After that classification into cell types based on individual AUROC values, further evaluation was based on continuous measures. For example: For comparison of response characteristics across subject and opponent cells (Figures S8B and S8C), the response strength for each neuron and each behavior was calculated as the average z-scored $\Delta F/F$ activity during all behavior epochs of a given type. Response probability for each neuron and each behavior was calculated as the percentage of behavior events with average neural activity that exceeded 110% of the local baseline (increased by more than 10% above baseline), taken over the 10 s preceding behavior onset. Those evaluations further supported the AUROC-based classifications of individual neurons into behavior-associated groups. Addendum on exchangeability The lack of exchangeability typical of time-series data doesn't invalidate this method, because of the random variables that need to be considered "exchangeable" here. From Wikipedia , an exchangeable sequence of random variables is one whose joint probability distribution does not change when the positions in the sequence in which finitely many of them appear are altered. In this application, what's important is the exchangeability of the observations among behavioral epochs over which evaluations are made: the periods of "push," "retreat," "approach," and "none" identified from mouse behavior. Within any of those individual epochs, the calcium measurements are certainly not exchangeable in time. What's needs for this type of study, however, is that the random variables estimated from the epochs (e.g., the mean $\Delta F/F$ values within individual epochs) are exchangeable. That's over a much different time scale. For the type of exchangeability needed here, the joint distribution of $\Delta F/F$ values among epochs in a sequence of "approach, none, push" shouldn't be different than it would be if the order were instead "push, approach, none," for example. The structure within each epoch doesn't matter per se . Insofar as that's the case, then the circular permutation to serve as a null for $\Delta F/F$ values within epochs is valid. The circular permutation further maintains the short-term characteristics of the calcium time series even as the mapping between that time series and the behaviors is permuted, removing a potential problem with complete randomization of calcium observations.
