The task you want to perform is known as Named Entity Recognition (NER). The majority of software for doing NER is in Java. For example, the Stanford NER system and the OpenNLP NER system. There are far fewer similar libraries written in C#, however I found SharpNLP through a Google search. I have not used it personally so I have no idea how well it works.
