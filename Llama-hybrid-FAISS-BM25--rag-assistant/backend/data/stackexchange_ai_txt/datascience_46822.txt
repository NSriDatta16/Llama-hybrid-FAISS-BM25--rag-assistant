As a rule of thumb, the data distribution of your test set should be of the same nature as the one in the train set. So for example if you have a network that classifies cats and dogs and you trained it with super clean and good images and then you try to feed it fuzzy images done with crappy phones, you might be surprised about the results... performance will most likely drop. In your case, the same will happen, a draw of a dog is of a completely different distribution when compared with a picture of a dog, so the network will most likely not perform as well as expected. That said, CNNs can actually learn low-level features (borders and so son), so sure, you will still get some sort of accuracy, but certainly not very good. There is a great article in the Keras blog regarding this, I strongly recommend you to read it .
