You need to consider the drift and (parametric/linear) trend in the levels of the time series in order to specify the deterministic terms in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression which is in terms of the first differences of the time series. The confusion arises exactly from deriving the first-differences equation in the way that you have done. (Augmented) Dickey-Fuller regression model Suppose that the levels of the series include a drift and trend term $$ Y_t = \beta_{0,l} + \beta_{1,l} t + \beta_{2, l}Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t} $$ The null hypothesis of nonstationarity in this case would be $\mathfrak{H}_0{}:{}\beta_{2, l} = 1$. One equation for the first differences implied by this data-generating process [DGP], is the one that you have derived $$ \Delta Y_t = \beta_{1,l} + \beta_{2, l}\Delta Y_{t-1} + \Delta \varepsilon_{t} $$ However, this is not the (augmented) Dickey Fuller regression as used in the test. Instead, the correct version can be had by subtracting $Y_{t-1}$ from both sides of the first equation resulting in $$ \begin{align} \Delta Y_t &= \beta_{0,l} + \beta_{1,l} t + (\beta_{2, l}-1)Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t} \\ &\equiv \beta_{0,d} + \beta_{1,d}t + \beta_{2,d}Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t} \end{align} $$ This is the (augmented) Dickey-Fuller regression, and the equivalent version of the null hypothesis of nonstationarity is the test $\mathfrak{H}_0{}:{}\beta_{2, d}=0$ which is just a t-test using the OLS estimate of $\beta_{2, d}$ in the regression above. Note that the drift and trend come through to this specification unchanged. An additional point to note is that if you are not certain about the presence of the linear trend in the levels of the time series, then you can jointly test for the linear trend and unit root, that is, $\mathfrak{H}_0{}:{}[\beta_{2, d}, \beta_{1,l}]' = [0, 0]'$, which can be tested using an F-test with appropriate critical values. These tests and critical values are produced by the R function ur.df in the urca package. Let us consider some examples in detail. Examples 1. Using the US investment series The first example uses the US investment series which is discussed in Lutkepohl and Kratzig (2005, pg. 9) . The plot of the series and its first difference are given below. From the levels of the series, it appears that it has a non-zero mean, but does not appear to have a linear trend. So, we proceed with an augmented Dickey Fuller regression with an intercept, and also three lags of the dependent variable to account for serial correlation, that is: $$ \Delta Y_t = \beta_{0,d} + \beta_{2,d}Y_{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^3 \gamma_j \Delta Y_{t-j} + \varepsilon_{t} $$ Note the key point that I have looked at the levels to specify the regression equation in differences. The R code to do this is given below: library(urca) library(foreign) library(zoo) tsInv The results indicate that the the null hypothesis of nonstationarity can be rejected for this series using the t-test based on the estimated coefficient. The joint F-test of the intercept and the slope coefficient ($\mathfrak{H}{}:{}[\beta_{2, d}, \beta_{0,l}]' = [0, 0]'$) also rejects the null hypothesis that there is a unit root in the series. 2. Using German (log) consumption series The second example is using the German quarterly seasonally adjusted time series of (log) consumption. The plot of the series and its differences are given below. From the levels of the series, it is clear that the series has a trend, so we include the trend in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression together with four lags of the first differences to account for the serial correlation, that is $$ \Delta Y_t = \beta_{0,d} + \beta_{1,d}t + \beta_{2,d}Y_{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^4 \gamma_j \Delta Y_{t-j} + \varepsilon_{t} $$ The R code to do this is # using the (log) consumption series tsConsump The results indicate that the null of nonstationarity cannot be rejected using the t-test based on the estimated coefficient. The joint F-test of the linear trend coefficient and the slope coefficient ($\mathfrak{H}{}:{}[\beta_{2, d}, \beta_{1,l}]' = [0, 0]'$) also indicates that the null of nonstationarity cannot be rejected. 3. Using given temperature data Now we can assess the properties of your data. The usual plots in levels and first differences are given below. These indicate that your data has an intercept and a trend, so we perform the ADF test (with no lagged first difference terms), using the following R code # using the given data tsTemp The results for both the t-test and the F-test indicate that the null of nonstationarity can be rejected for the temperature series. I hope that clarifies matter somewhat.
