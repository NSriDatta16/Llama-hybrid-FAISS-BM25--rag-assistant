It seems peculiar that such a complex model was selected instead of a more simple linear model. However, if you insist on using that model then notice that NumberOfDifferentKindsOfFruits should be strictly greater than 0. Further: If NumberOfDifferentKindsOfFruits equals 1 and NumberOfCustomer equals 0 the expected average price will be -7.095. If the natural logarithm of NumberOfDifferentKindsOfFruits increases by one (that is to say that NumberOfDifferentKindsOfFruits is almost tripled) and all other things remain the same, the expected average price will decrease with 9.471. If the square root of the NumberOfCustomer is increased by one and all other variables remain the same, the average expected price will increase with 53.942. Notice, that the last remark is not easily to be understood in terms of the single NumberOfCustomer variable without square root. Hope that the above will help you
