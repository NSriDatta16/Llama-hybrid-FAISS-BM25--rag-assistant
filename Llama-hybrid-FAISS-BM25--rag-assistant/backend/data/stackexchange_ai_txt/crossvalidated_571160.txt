Logistic regression on correlated data (without clusters)

I would like to create logistic model using the OCA STAT Act data in R, however, since this data is a compilation of court appearances since 2020, some defendants may have appeared before court more than once, meaning the observations would not be independent. OCA does not provide data on specific individuals and I do not know how else I would cluster the data. Is there any way that I could run a logistic regression on the correlated data correctly? I was thinking about using GEE, but this requires clusters. Another thought I had was to use individual courts as clusters or to cluster defendants with the same race, ethnicity, gender, and age. Let me know what your thoughts are.
