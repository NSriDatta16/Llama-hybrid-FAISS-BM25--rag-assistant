Values distribution issue in logistic regression

I have a problem with logistic regression. I have the following variables: Var1: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 NA 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Var2: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 Var1 is continuous (It doesn't seem continuous because of my data, but in my study I have similar variables with 2,3,4.....) Var2 is categorical When I do logistic regression mylogit I obtain a p value of 0.994 but It's not true, because I think that my data should have a p value I think that my problem is that all "1" in Var2 match with a "1" in Var1. I' have checked this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8596160/why-am-i-getting-algorithm-did-not-converge-and-fitted-prob-numerically-0-or and I have tried all the methods described in this post and I never obtain a significant p value. Perhaps my problem is different, I don't know. What should I do to obtain a realistic p value with my data??? Thank you very much.
