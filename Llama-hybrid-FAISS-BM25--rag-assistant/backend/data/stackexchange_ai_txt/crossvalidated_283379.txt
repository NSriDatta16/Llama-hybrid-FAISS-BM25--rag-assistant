What is the proper method for calculating the Coefficient of Variation of a rate?

I have been asked to evaluate the variation between movement rates of fish within different systems (rates are in km/day). I have between 25-100 samples in each system. I understand that when reporting the average rate for a given system, it is more appropriate to use the harmonic mean than the arithmetic mean. If that's the case, how would one calculate the Coefficient of Variation ($CV = \sigma/\mu$) for the movement rates in each system? Does the standard deviation become the (arithmetic) mean difference of each sample from the harmonic mean?
