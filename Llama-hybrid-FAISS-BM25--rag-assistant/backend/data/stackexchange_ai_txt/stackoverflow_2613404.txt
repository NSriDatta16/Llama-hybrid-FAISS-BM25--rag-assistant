Template engine recommendations

I'm looking for a template engine. Requirements: Runs on a JVM. Java is good; Jython, JRuby and the like, too... Can be used outside of servlets (unlike JSP) Is flexible wrt. to where the templates are stored (JSP and a lot of people require the templates to be stored in the FS). It should provide a template loading interface which one can implement or something like that Easy inclusion of parameterized templates- I really like JSP's tag fragments Good docs, nice code, etc., the usual suspects I've looked at JSP- it's nearly perfect except for the servlet and filesystem coupling, Stringtemplate- I love the template syntax, but it fails on the filesystem coupling, the documentation is lacking and template groups and stuff are confusing, GXP, TAL, etc. Ideas, thoughts?
