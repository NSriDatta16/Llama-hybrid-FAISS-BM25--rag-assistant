When does the MLE of the Logistic Distribution exist and when is it unique?

I am trying to understand the procedure for finding the MLE of the parameter $\theta$ of a Logistic Distribution. The book I am reading has the following derivation: I am having trouble understanding how the book's analysis shows that MLE exists and is unique (which is discussed in the last paragraph). The book I am reading has not discussed any theorems on either the existence or the uniqueness of MLEs. Is the last paragraph implicitly based on any theorems? In general, how does one know (and verify) that the MLE of a certain parameter of a certain distribution exists and if is exists, that the MLE is unique? Any help is greatly appreciated!
