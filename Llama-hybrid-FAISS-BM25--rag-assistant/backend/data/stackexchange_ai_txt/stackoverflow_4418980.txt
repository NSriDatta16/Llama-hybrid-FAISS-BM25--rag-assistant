Since you have a management process, I suggest you watch over the created subprocesses. Save the PID of every subscript you start: $running[] = exec("process www.google.com & echo $!"); Where $! will return the PID of the backgrounded process, adding it to a list in PHP. Then in your management loop, just recheck if the processes are still active: do { foreach ($running as $i=>$pid) { if (!posix_getpgid($pid)) { unset($running[$i]); // restart } } } I don't think it's very elegant or reliable. pcntl_fork is often the better approach, but you din't elaborate on your actual scripts. But maybe this works in your case.
