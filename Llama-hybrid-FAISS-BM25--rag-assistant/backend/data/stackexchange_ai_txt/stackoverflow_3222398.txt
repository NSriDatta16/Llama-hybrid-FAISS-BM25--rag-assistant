This does not work with IE 8. A runtime error is produced. I don't know if it is because I am using Google Frame, but I would like to point out that el is one of the public properties not a config option so I don't believe that Ext was design to work like this. Also in Google Chrome you can select the username but the password does not display. I think this is part of the design of Google Chrome but I have also seen it work correctly on other sites with Google Chrome. I am not using AJAX to submit the form but I like the way the Ext textfields look and I like the Tool tips as well. I don't see how this way is safer than using a cookie because now matter how you implement it the password is stored on the client machine. Tomorrow I am going to try a html5 client storage solution. Letting the web browser control this functionally means that different users may have different experiences based on the browser they have access to (talking mainly in how google chrome handles saving passwords). All in all a very good post thanks.
