As far as I know, PCA doesn't assume normality of data. But if it is normally distributed (in more general sense, symmetrically distributed), then the result is more robust. As other people say, the key is that PCA is based on Pearson correlation coefficient matrix, of which estimation is affected by outliers and skewed distribution. So in some analysis involved in, such as statistical test or p-value, then you should care more about whether normality is satisfied; but in other applications like exploratory analysis, you can use it but only take care when make interpretations.
