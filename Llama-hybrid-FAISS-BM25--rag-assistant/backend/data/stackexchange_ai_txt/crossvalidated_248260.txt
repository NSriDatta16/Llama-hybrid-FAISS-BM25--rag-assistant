It already does this: It is a weighted average of the OLS coefficient on the group and the population parameter $B$. The weights correspond to not only sample size, but to the variance in X: $$w*B + (1-w)*\hat{\beta}$$ Where $$w = \dfrac{\Sigma_{0}^{-1}}{\Sigma_{0}^{-1}+\dfrac{X_{j}^{\prime}X_{j}}{\sigma^{2}}}$$ Furthermore, $X_{j}^{\prime}X_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}^{\prime}$, So the lower the variance in X, the lower this quantity will be, but the higher $n$, the higher this quantity will be.
