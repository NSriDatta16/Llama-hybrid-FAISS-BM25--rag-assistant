I need some guidance how to develop myself in deep learning

Few months ago I've taken an Andrew Ng course at coursera and started my data science/machine learning journey. During those months, I've take another courses from the internet - about Deep Learning, statistics - read articles from towardsdatascience website, now I'm reading a book "Hands on Machine Learning". But I feel I'm stuck, I have over a dozen pages of courses at coursera, few books, and I don't know what to do next. I feel like I'm doing the same things all the time. I'll be very thankful for some guidance :)
