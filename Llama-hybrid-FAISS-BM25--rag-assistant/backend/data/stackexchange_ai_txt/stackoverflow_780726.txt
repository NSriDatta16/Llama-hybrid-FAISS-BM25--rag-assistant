How do I construct the biadjacency matrix of a DAG?

For a bipartite graph , you can substitute the adjacency matrix with what is called its biadjacency matrix : The adjacency matrix A of a bipartite graph whose parts have r and s vertices has the form A = O B B T O where B is an r Ã— s matrix and O is an all-zero matrix. Clearly, the matrix B uniquely represents the bipartite graphs, and it is commonly called its biadjacency matrix. Now, a DAG is a bipartite graph, for example, you could topologically sort it and have the sets U and V being nodes that are on an odd or even topological level, respectively. This means, that for a DAG with n nodes, I only need a (n/2) 2 matrix (on average) instead of a n 2 matrix. Problem is, I don't know how to construct it. Any hints?
