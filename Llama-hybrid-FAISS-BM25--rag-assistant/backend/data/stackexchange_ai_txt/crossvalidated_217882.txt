How to determine the distribution of dataset?

I have a dataset whose histogram showed above (the blue part), and I want to scale it for later machine learning process so I am trying to do a parameter estimation. Its histogram shows that looks like a gamma distribution, then I tried gamfit in matlab to get the fit curve(showed in orange). It's obviously that this curve does not fit the data very well so I decided to look for other distribution. I found a page on wikipedia called List_of_probability_distributions and there are just too many of them. One of my friends says that there is a general way to determine the distribution of certain data but she doesn't know how to do it. Is there any guidance to do that?
