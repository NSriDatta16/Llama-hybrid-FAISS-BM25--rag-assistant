Combining a url with urlunparse

I'm writing something to 'clean' a URL. In this case all I'm trying to do is return a faked scheme as urlopen won't work without one. However, if I test this with www.python.org It'll return http:///www.python.org . Does anyone know why the extra /, and is there a way to return this without it? def FixScheme(website): from urlparse import urlparse, urlunparse scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment = urlparse(website) if scheme == '': return urlunparse(('http', netloc, path, params, query, fragment)) else: return website
