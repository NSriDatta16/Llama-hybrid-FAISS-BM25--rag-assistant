Why K-harmonic means is less sensitive to random initialization than K-means?

As we know that K-Means is a powerful clustering, however it often stuck with local minimum problem because of bad initialization . One of the solution is K-Harmonic means that use Harmonic Average as the performance function instead of minimum distance btw the data and cluster's centroid. I am curious that why using harmonic function makes less sensitive to init centroids than ordinary K-Means.
