If you add up $n$ Bernouilli random variables with a different success probabilities then the sum has a Binomial Distribution of Poisson. If the success probabilities are $p_i$ then the mean of the Binomial of Poisson is $n \bar{p}$ where $\bar{p}=\frac{\sum_i p_i}{n}$ and the variance of the Binomial distribution of Poisson is $n \bar{p} (1-\bar{p}) - n \times var(p)$ (Note: for $var(p)$ there must be $n$ in the denominator!). Note that if $var(p)$ is relatively small then the variance reduces to a binomial variance, which was expected because a small $var(p)$ means that the success probabilities of the Bernouillis are more or less equal. I have some code to simulate this: # Function that simulates Poisson Binomial random variable # # parameter 'ps' contains the success probabilities of the Bernouilli's to add up # parameter n.sim is the number of simulations # # The return value is a list containing # - the simulated mean # - the simulated variance # - the 'true' mean of Poisson Binomial namely n x average(ps) # - the true variance of Poisson Binomial namely n x average(ps) x (1-average(ps)) - n var(ps) simulate.Poisson_Binomial In the return of the R-function there is (length(ps)-1)*var(ps) this is because the R-function var() has (n-1) in the denominator. so $-n \times var(p)$ in the formula above should be 'translated' to -length(ps) * ( var(ps) * (length(ps)-1)/length(ps) which becomes - var(ps) * (length(ps)-1) See also this Intuitive explanation for dividing by $n-1$ when calculating standard deviation?
