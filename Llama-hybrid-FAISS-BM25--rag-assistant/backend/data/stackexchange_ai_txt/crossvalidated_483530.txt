Autocorrelation can be calculated for any time series regardless of its interpretation. It can be raw values, residuals from a model or something else. Residuals. In many models, errors are assumed to be free of autocorrelation. When it comes to model diagnostics, it is common practice to obtain residuals as estimates of model errors and test them for presence of autocorrelation. If found, presence of autocorrelation is interpreted as a problem with the model. Raw data. Autocorrelation in raw data may be of interest, too. E.g. if a model without exogenous regressors such as ARIMA is considered, one would look for autocorrelation in the data. If present, one would try to select an appropriate model for it, facilitating a description of the pattern and making forecasts of future values based on past values of the same series.
