How can we set depth of a TreeMap object. You cannot directly set the (maximum) depth of a TreeMap, or even precisely determine what its depth is. However, the depth will be approximately ceiling(log2(table.size())) in the best and worst case. Suppose we are trying to build an auto suggest feature on top of underlying data structure of a TreeMap, how would depth of a tree as we know affect the performance? The average lookup time will be proportional to the average depth of leaf nodes in the tree.
