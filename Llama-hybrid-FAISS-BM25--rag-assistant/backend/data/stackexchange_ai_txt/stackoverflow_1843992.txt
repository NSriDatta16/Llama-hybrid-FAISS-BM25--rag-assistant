Web development depends ENTIRELY on: First, the quality of the web-framework and second the tools for development. I do not know why you want to move to functional languages for programming web applications. Python allows some functional constructs for programming and it has frameworks and tools. Lua allows the same level of functional programming and it does not have either high quality frameworks for web development or tools, however its simplicity/primal-nature is its elegance. Now as a puritan I'd say look at haskell, but that is counter-productive :D,. You my friend are looking for Python. I have not evaluated Ruby, but it might have some functional constructs.
