jQuery Ajax load images problem

I have a code that would call $.load() to get an HTML fragment. In the fragment there will be a list of images and a script that would do some calculation based on the list size. The fragment looks like ... //... script to do calculation on the list width Originally, I use css's max-width to ensure that the image would not exceed 180px. But as IE has no max-width, I use the expression hack. However, it seems when the image are first load, the script cannot get a correct width of image list. Seems like the script load earlier than the CSS expression. If it is a new page, I can certainly call $(window).load() to ensure all the images are loaded. But what can I do in an ajax html fragment request?
