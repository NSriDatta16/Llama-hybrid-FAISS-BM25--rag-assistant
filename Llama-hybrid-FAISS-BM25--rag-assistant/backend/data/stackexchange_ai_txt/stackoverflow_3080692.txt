What I do to accomplish what you want is to use System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb as the Root of a UserControl and set the ControlTemplate to display an image (within a border but it should work without as well), something like: ... see below ... Also, I bind the Source of the Image to a property of the class: The UserControl has a named TranslateTransform (let's say translateTransform ) whose properties X and Y are to be set in the DragDelta event handler: private void MyRootDragDelta(object sender, DragDeltaEventArgs e) { translateTransform.X += e.HorizontalChange; translateTransform.Y += e.VerticalChange; } Don't forget to add: public ImageSource ImageSource { get; set; } Hope this helps. If anything's unclear feel free to ask further.
