Analysis Services 2005 OLAP Cubes : Can I create a distinct count measure on a nvarchar column?

I'm trying to create a cube with a single measure. This measure is a distinct count of a "name" column. The cube works perfectly if the measure is set to "count" type. However when I set distinct count I get this error: "Errors in the OLAP storage engine: The sort order specified for distinct count records is incorrect" I have read in some blogs that you can only have a distinct count on a numeric column. I can't see a good reason for this, and I can't find that info on official documentation. However, it may be true. Anyways, I'm really stuck with this issue. What are my options?
