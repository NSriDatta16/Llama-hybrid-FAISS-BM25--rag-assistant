I attended a talk by Wil Shipley of Delicious Monster fame. His argument for developing on the Mac was quite simple: Mac users buy more software on average Average prices are higher These seemed to me to be quite compelling reasons, couple this with a less crowded market place. This was in the days before iPhone, you have a much broader customer base these days. In addition the 'enforced' MVC for developing Mac and iPhone App make porting between platforms very easy, see the example of Tweetie for the iPhone and now Mac .
