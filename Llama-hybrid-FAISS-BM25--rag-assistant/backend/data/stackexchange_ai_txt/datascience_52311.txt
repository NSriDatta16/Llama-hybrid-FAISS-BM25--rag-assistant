Can this problem be solved using deep learning?

I want to predict price of used cars. I have data like this: Is this problem suitable for deeplearning or Should I use XGBOOST, RandomForest etc.? I used one hot approach for nominal features and scaled numeric values between 0-1. Is there anything I can do to improve my data? I used deeplearning4j on java and predict prices with 10-15% error but I want to predict prices with 1-2% error
