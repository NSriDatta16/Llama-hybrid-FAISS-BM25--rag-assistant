There are three options here: Override all the child classes as well, so that they properly descend from your class (or at least call your class in some way). Place the parent class into the app/code/local/ folder so that Magento finds it rather than the default one. So you'd create the directory app/code/local/Mage/Catalog/Block/Product/ and copy View.php into it. This would be a problem for upgrades, though, as you'd have to merge in any changes that Varien made to the class. Abandon the rewrites and change it in the template. This may be the best option of all, as you won't have to worry about changes in the _prepareLayout method. Hope that helps, Joe
