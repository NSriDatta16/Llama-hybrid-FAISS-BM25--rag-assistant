jQuery: How Do I simulate Drag and Drop in Code?

EDIT: Here's a link to show you my sample code: http://www.singingeels.com/jqtest/ I have a very simple page that references jquery-1.3.2.js, ui.core.js (latest version) and ui.draggable.js (also latest version). I have a div that I can drag around very easily (using the mouse of course): hello and then in JavaScript: $("#myDiv").draggable(); This is works perfectly. But, I need to be able to simulate a 'drag and drop' using code alone. I have it mostly working, but the problem is that the events that are firing are the placeholder events . If you open "ui.core.js" and scroll to the bottom... you'll see this: // These are placeholder methods, to be overriden by extending plugin _mouseStart: function(event) { }, _mouseDrag: function(event) { }, _mouseStop: function(event) { }, _mouseCapture: function(event) { return true; } Why aren't the events being extended properly in my simulation, but when you click down with the mouse, they are? - Any ideas on how to force the _mouseDrag: property to obey the overriding extension in "ui.draggable.js"? Solving this would be huge - and I plan to show the major benefits later. Thanks, -Timothy EDIT: Here's a link to show you my sample code: http://www.singingeels.com/jqtest/ EDIT 2: Click that link above and view-source... you'll see what I'm trying to do. Here's a snippet: $(document).ready(function() { var myDiv = $("#myDiv"); myDiv.draggable(); // This will set enough properties to simulate valid mouse options. $.ui.mouse.options = $.ui.mouse.defaults; var divOffset = myDiv.offset(); // This will simulate clicking down on the div - works mostly. $.ui.mouse._mouseDown({ target: myDiv, pageX: divOffset.left, pageY: divOffset.top, which: 1, preventDefault: function() { } }); });
