Do the other studies also assume the same conditional mean and conditional variance dynamics of the univarate models, i.e. ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1)? I suppose ARMA(1,1) could be omitted in favour of just a constant. [Apparently this does not generate the desired result.] What if you fit the model fo subsamples of your data? Vanilla DCC is a bit inflexible, so I would not expect that it would produce a wide range of correlation dynamics over time for a given time series. There is a function dccroll for rolling estimation and forecasting, perhaps it could be useful. Finally, after having estimated the univariate models you can skip the DCC step and instead estimate correlations in rolling windows. That is another way of assessing how the correlation develops over time.
