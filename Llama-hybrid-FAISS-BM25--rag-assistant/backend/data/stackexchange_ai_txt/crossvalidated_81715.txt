Prove that covariance matrix is diagonal after PCA transformation

For $z=W^\mathbf{\intercal}(x-m)$ where $k$ columns of $W$ are the top $k$ principal components of a given dataset $x$ and $m$ is the mean, how can I prove that $z$ has diagonal covariance matrix? Here $x$ is the original dataset ($d \times N$ dimensional matrix) and $m$ is the mean of $x$ ($1\times N$ dimensional matrix) and $k$ is a number less than $d$.
