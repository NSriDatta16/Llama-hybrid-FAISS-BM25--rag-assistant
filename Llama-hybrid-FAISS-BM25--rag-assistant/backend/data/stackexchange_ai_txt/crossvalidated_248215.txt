Logistic Regression with Interaction Odds Ratio Interpretation

I just want to make sure I'm interpreting my results correctly. See below. The interaction terms confuse me when interpreting. Am I correct in saying that the odds ratio is "comparing" Purebred dogs (S/N yes/no) with Non-purebred dogs with the same spay/neuter status? Thanks!
