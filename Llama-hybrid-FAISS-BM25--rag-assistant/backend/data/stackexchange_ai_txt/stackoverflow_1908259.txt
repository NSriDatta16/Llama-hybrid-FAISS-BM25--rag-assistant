The tag is a p aragraph, and as such, it is a block element (as is, for instance, h1 and div ), whereas span is an inline element (as, for instance, b and a ) Block elements by default create some whitespace above and below themselves, and nothing can be aligned next to them, unless you set a float attribute to them. Inline elements deal with spans of text inside a paragraph. They typically have no margins, and as such, you cannot, for instance, set a width to it.
