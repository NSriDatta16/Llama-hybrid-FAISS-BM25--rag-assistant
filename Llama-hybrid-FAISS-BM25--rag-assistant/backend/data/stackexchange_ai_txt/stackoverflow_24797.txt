Effectively Converting dates between UTC and Local (ie. PST) time in SQL 2005

What is the best way to convert a UTC datetime into local datetime. It isn't as simple as a getutcdate() and getdate() difference because the difference changes depending on what the date is. CLR integration isn't an option for me either. The solution that I had come up with for this problem a few months back was to have a daylight savings time table that stored the beginning and ending daylight savings days for the next 100 or so years, this solution seemed inelegant but conversions were quick (simple table lookup)
