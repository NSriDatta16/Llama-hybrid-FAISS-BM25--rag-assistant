Time series data - A metric to quantify a signal's intensity frequency and duration

I have an time series data with an appearance of a headache events over time. Each headache is characterized with intensity (1-5) and duration (in seconds). Therefore, the signal is represented in 3D - intensity frequency and duration. I would like to have a metric per day - to represent a day with some "rank of headaches". Any suggestions?
