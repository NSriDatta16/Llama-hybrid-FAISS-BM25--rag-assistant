Yes - if you want to be sure the differences in accuracy are due only to the increase in the size of the training set, then use the same test data for each training size. If you want more confidence in your result, then you could create multiple test sets (say 5 test sets of 20% of the data or 10 test sets of 10% of the data, as you would do for k-fold cross validation). For each test set, train models using all the training sizes. This would then give you 5 (or 10) estimates of the accuracy for each training size. The average of these should be a more reliable estimate than the result from a single model.
