A few quick guesses. If this doesn't work, let me know and we can try other things. First, make sure you tell Magento that the layout exists. In your module config, make sure the following XML exists. You may need to change from to if you are currently developing the backend. Make sure that the layout file is in the corresponding layout directory (adminhtml or frontend). rewardpoints.xml Next, make sure that the problem isn't a cached file. Head to your admin panel and click System > Cache Management . Either refresh or disable the cache for "Layouts". When developing a module, it often helps to disable the cache entirely so that you can immediately see your changes. Finally, significantly less likely, but make sure that Magento can read your file. You don't specify anything about your environment, so I can't give specific commands, but make sure that your webserver has permission to read the layout file. Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
