$\phi(x)$ is implied by the kernel $k$. So, in general, you don't have access to $\phi$. This is a remarkable property of kernels. For example, the popular RBF kernel has a corresponding $\phi$ that is infinite dimensional (and so cannot be computed directly). You might have a hard time improving the SVM with anything Bayesian... the magic of the SVM is that the optimization reduces $\phi$ to computing inner products in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space implied by $\phi$... Thus, you never have to calculate $\phi$, which is usually computationally intractable. That said, you can use your Bayesian methods with most convex non-linearities (and just put that in place of $\phi$). But be aware that the computational complexity tends explode... Or you could just do the whole neural network thing and throw convexity out the window and learn $\phi$ (i.e., the neural network).
