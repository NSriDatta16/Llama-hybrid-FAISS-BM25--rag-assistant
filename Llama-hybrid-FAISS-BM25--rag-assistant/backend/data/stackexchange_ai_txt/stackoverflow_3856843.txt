You actually want to add an XML namespace to the string, so that the Paragraph object can be resolved. Like: xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" As you really only want a single xmlns entry, surround it with a Section block. Your complete working string will be this: richTextBox1.Xaml = " Blah "; To work this out, I entered text into a RichTextBox (e.g. "Blah") and then viewed the textbox1.Xaml property (always investigate using working methods first to see what comes out of it) .
