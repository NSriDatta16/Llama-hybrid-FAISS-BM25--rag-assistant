Your formulas are appropriate when the sample is a non-negligible fraction of a fixed population. The variance of $\bar Y_n$ (from a frequentist viewpoint) is the variance over hypothetical replications of drawing a sample of size $n$. If the samples are drawn from the same population of size $N$ there will be some overlap between samples. On average, each observation in a repeated sample will have a probability $n/N$ of having been in the original sample, so only the $(1-n/N)$ fraction of new observations contribute to the variance. At the extreme, if $n\approx N$, all the samples will be nearly identical. If the samples are drawn from a very large population you have $(N-n)/(N-1)\approx 1$ and $1-f\approx 1$. If the samples are drawn from a data generating process that doesn't correspond to a finite population (eg $Y_i\sim N(0,1)$, $N$ isn't a thing, but the formulas still work if you think of $N$ as infinite, so that $(N-n)/(N-1)=1$ and $f=0$. In practice, even samples from a finite population are often analysed this way: the survey sampling jargon is "sampling with replacement".
