Anonymous functions suck. I'm teaching myself jQuery and, while it's an elegant and immensely useful technology, most people seem to treat it as some kind of competition in maximizing the user of anonymous functions. Function and procedure naming (along with variable naming) is the greatest expressive ability we have in programming. Passing functions around as data is a great technique, but making them anonymous and therefore non-self-documenting is a mistake. It's a lost chance for expressing the meaning of the code.
