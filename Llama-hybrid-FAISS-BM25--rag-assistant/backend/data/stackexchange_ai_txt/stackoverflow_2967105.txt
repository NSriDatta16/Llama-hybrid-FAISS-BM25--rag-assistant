public static void main( String[] args ) { int[][][] storage = new int[ 400 ][ 300 ][ 400 ]; long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for ( int x = 0; x Ran with -Xmx1g Time was: 0.188 seconds. That seems pretty darn fast.. you are looking at 48 MILLION elements in the innermost loop. Homerolling a silly little datastructure.. public static void main( String[] args ) { StorerGuy[] storerGuys = new StorerGuy[ 400 ]; long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for ( int x = 0; x Time was: 0.925 seconds. Which is faster than 4 seconds you had in your mixed up order example. I think multi arrays are too much for the problem. You are better off with a more complex data structure, as it will keep the stuff all in 1 memory location (x,y,z,value). Java is an OO language. In most cases, you should use objects and not weird data structures like int[][][]
