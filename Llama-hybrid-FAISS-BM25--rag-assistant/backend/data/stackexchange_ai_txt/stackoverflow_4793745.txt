Are you opening the page with showModalDialog? if so, then it's the caching issue. If so there are muliple work arounds. Some suggest to add a random number or datetime to the query string to the URL so that it does not get cached ever. Personally, I like this way of doing it.Refer here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c4yy9w70.aspx Make sure you set it to HttpCacheability.NoCache
