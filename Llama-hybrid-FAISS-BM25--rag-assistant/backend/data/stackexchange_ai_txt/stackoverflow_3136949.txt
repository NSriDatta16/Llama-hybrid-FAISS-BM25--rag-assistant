I have a site that connects with two databases. One powers the website content (CMS DB) the other drives a web application that runs within the site (large amounts of non-CMS data) In fact, the latter uses replication. I don't feel that's bad design. If one set of data has no relation to the other, then it makes sense even from a pure organization perspective to house it in a separate DB. Otherwise, people would just put all their tables in one DB.
