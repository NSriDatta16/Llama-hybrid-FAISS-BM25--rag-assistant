jQuery split at HTML tags i.e split at every instance of the h2 tags?

I am trying to find all tags the split them and join them with around them. I am so close but stuck. $(document).ready(function() { // finds all h2's within wrapper div grabs the text splits at ? and applies a links around each one var al = $('#wrapper').find('h2').text().split("?").join("? "); // Add all the split h2's from the variable above al to a div called .text $('.text').html(' ' + al + ' '); }); This is my output from alert(al): Appropriate Media â€“ Why radio? Can someone come and speak at my church? Do you distribute radios? Do you partner with other organisations? How is Feba funded? What are your programmes about? What denomination does Feba belong to? What happened to the Chrysolite? What is airtime? What is Feba's Statement of Faith? Where are the programmes made? Where can I find out about the languages & countries you broadcast in? Where does the name Feba come from? Who do you broadcast to? Why do you broadcast on short wave? Ok so at the moment I am able to split them at the ? because each question end with a ? , but my issue is this misses out the first question. So my solution would be to split them at the tags is this possible or is there a better option i have tried so many?
