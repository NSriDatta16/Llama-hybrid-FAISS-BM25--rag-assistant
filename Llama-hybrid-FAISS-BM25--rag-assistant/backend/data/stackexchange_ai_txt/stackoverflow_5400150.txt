Big picture or guide on programming related topics?

I was wondering if someone could give a big picture of how the following topics and others not mentioned are related: "code reuse" "refactor" "design pattern" "coding/programming standard/style" ... I have heard of these from people's talk and books' names, but got overwhelmed by these names. May I get some organization and big picture from here? Thanks and regards!
