Predict next date of incident using R from dates only

I have name of incident and date, which is not univariate. I need to do prediction/forecasting for upcoming event based on date. I have tried to do it by using average of date difference between consecutive dates. Also tried to do it by using rollmean for latest trend. > head(df1$Date) [1] "2014-01-20" "2014-01-22" "2014-03-10" "2014-04-10" "2014-04-15" "2014-04-15" I was wondering is there any other way to do it?
