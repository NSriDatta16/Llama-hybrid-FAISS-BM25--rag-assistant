How to create Python egg file

I have questions about egg files in Python. I have much Python code organized by package and I'm trying to create egg files. I'm following instructions , but they are very common. According to that, it seems I need to have a setup.py file. Would you please tell me what I need to put into setup.py file and where it should reside? I suppose it's enough to create setup.py and then start "setup.py bdist_egg" for getting egg file. Could you please confirm? Is it possible to include only .pyc files into egg file? Having .egg file how I can just start the code from it without unpacking like java -jar does?
