Is there an easy way to use XSLT to detect and correct not well-formed XML?

For example: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Note that the div tag has an attribute id with no value assigned. I would like to correct it with XSLT, but when I apply the XSL to this XML, it errors "XML Parsing Error: not well-formed" before processing. Anyone know a way around this? Thanks!
