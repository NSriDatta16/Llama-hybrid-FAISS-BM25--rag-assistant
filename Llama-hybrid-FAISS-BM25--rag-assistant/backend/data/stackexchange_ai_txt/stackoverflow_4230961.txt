At this year's CodeRage, Boian Mitov of Mitov Software gave an excellent lecture on multi-threading in Delphi. It includes tips and tricks and things to watch out for. Although this isn't directly a "how to debug" tutorial, it discusses common problems, and approaches he recommends and why. http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage5/sessions : Technical Session #44, on Thursday. (Best to download the MP4 and play it full screen so you can read all the text in the IDE. His accent is a bit strong, but he's totally understandable. ) (I use Mitov's real-time video library (VideoLab for Delphi and .NET) and his plotting and signal labs in a commercial product. They make heavy use of threads, are extremely fast and very reliable. This guy knows what he's doing, IMO.)
