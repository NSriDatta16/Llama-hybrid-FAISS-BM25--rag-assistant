Hibernate has no say in whether a table is Inno, MyISAM or another storage engine - that's decided on the MySQL side. There are defaults in the server config, and you can override them when you create tables. The difference would not have given you the trace - all that happens when you use transactions on a MyISAM table, is you get no transactions. Everything succeeds, but there's no isolation and no roll-backs. Per @shipmaster, your trace means you have an underlying problem, which is probably not related to your dialect choice. Take a look in the logs, or attach Spring's sources to the project and trace through them.
