Gaussian processes are suitable for modelling small datasets where some prior knowledge of the generative process exists. GPs do require assumptions about the functional form of the underlying response. GPs do not scale well in terms of dimensionality. They may provide well calibrated uncertainty output. Neural networks are, on the other hand, more suitable for large and very large data sets where little knowledge about the underlying process or suitable features exist. NNs scale well. Work is being done to enable neural networks to output calibrated uncertainty estimates.
