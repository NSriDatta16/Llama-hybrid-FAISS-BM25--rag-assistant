As far as I know you have two options: Use Java Native Interfaces ( JNI ) and call your Java classes from C (Cocoa). Launch a separate java process within your COCOA application to create graphics for you. You can use NSTask for that. In my opinion, even though first option is tougher to implement, it's more elegant and probably faster. But second option will definitely take less time to implement. Hope it helps.
