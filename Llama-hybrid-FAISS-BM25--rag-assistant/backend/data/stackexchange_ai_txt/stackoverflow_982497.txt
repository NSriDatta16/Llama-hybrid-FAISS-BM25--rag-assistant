One of the possible solutions would be use the HTTP::Request::Common module, which exposes some useful functions like GET , POST and HEADER . Assuming you want to use POST to send the data to the remote application, you could do: use HTTP::Request::Common; use LWP::UserAgent; my $url = 'http://localhost/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl'; my $xml = " "; my $request = POST $url, Content_Type => 'text/xml; charset=utf-8', Content => $xml; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(); my $response = $ua->request($request); if ( $response->is_success() ) { print $response->content(); } else { warn $response->status_line, $/; } Hope this helps!
