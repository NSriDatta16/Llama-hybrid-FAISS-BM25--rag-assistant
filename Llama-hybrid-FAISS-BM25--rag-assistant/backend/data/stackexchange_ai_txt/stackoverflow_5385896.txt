JQuery element created and added to sortable connected list not selectable to apply events to

I'm not sure if I've gone about this the right way, but its what I have ended up with. I have a master list on the LHS of the page which contains list items that can be dropped onto a number of droppable div boxes, inside the droppable div there is a ul that is sortable and connected to all the other uls on the page, so that once an item is dropped from the master list it is able to be dragged and dropped into the other uls so as to modify it's position in the connected uls. The problem I am having is that the newly created li when dropped from the master list is not able to be selectable via jquery selectors and have events applied in a way which would be expected, I can apply events by using the id of the new item but this loses it's ability to belong to an event group, if you will, i.e context menu does not hide as it's created for each element rather than a group of elements. I have created a fiddle page here that demonstrates a simplified set up and the issue. http://jsfiddle.net/mJLZu/54/ I think it may be a bug or an anomaly with jquery. removing the ul.sortable code allows the newly dynamically created li to be selectable as a group using jquery. I'm stumped. any help would be appreciated :)
