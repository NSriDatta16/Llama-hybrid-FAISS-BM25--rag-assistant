In your server definition in 2008 (Build -> Manage Build Agents) edit the build agent. In the dialog that pops up then, change the working folder to wherever you like. You can use the placeholder $(BuildDefinitionPath) to create a folder based on the name of the build definition itself to make sure each build has its own folder.
