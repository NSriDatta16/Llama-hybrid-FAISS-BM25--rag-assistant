Why Aren't the _construct() Methods on EAV Resources and Collections Declared as Abstract Methods?

I've been poking around the bowels of Magento systems code. For "regular" model resources, Magento's _construct initialization convention has been declared abstract File: Mage/Core/Model/Resource/Abstract.php abstract protected function _construct(); This makes sense, as it forces developers creating their own Model resources to call the _construct function, which does the necessary initialization. However, the same convention/need exists for EAV Model Resources and their collections, but the _construct method is not abstract in those hierarchies. Does anyone know the reasoning behind this? Are there cases where you don't need a _construct method on these models? Or is this a historical backwards compatibility thing?
