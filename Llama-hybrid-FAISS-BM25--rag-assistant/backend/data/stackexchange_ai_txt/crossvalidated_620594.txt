Creating normal distributions with model uncertainty in Logistic Regression

I have a GLM model, with a count predictor (length) and binary outcome. response = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) input = c(5, 10, 2, 17, 19, 13, 3) model = glm(response ~ input, family = "binomial") summary(model) The summary(model) gives me the standard error of the model - which is pretty high in this toy sample, but Next, I use predict, to see the probability of the response at 2 individual values of the input. So I say prob1 = predict(model, newdata = data.frame(input = 15), type="response") prob2 = predict(model, newdata = data.frame(input = 3), type="response") I want to check if the difference between prob1 and prob2 is statistically significant or not. It is somewhat like comparing levels in a categorical variable, but my predictor is not categorical. So I generate normal distributions with the predicted probability in each case, with model error as the standard deviation. distr_p1 = rnorm(100, prob1, model_SE) distr_p2 = rnorm(100, prob2, model_SE) Now I can do a t.test(prob1, prob2) and report the p-value. Would this be the right approach? Thank you so much!
