I recommend trying to create a new, empty, Win32 Console Application (I usually check the "Empty Project" checkbox as well so as not to get precompiled headers and such for small projects). Add a .cpp file to the project and give it your contents. In the project properties, under C/C++ -> General , in the Additional Include Directories box, add the path to your top-level Boost folder (the one that contains the folder named boost that has all the header files). In my case, it's z:\dev\boost_1_43_0 ; based on your post, yours is probably I:\SophisPal\boost-1_43_0-vc10-32\include\boost-1_43 . Also in the project properties, under Linker -> General , in the Additional Library Directories box, add the path to the folder containing the compiled Boost libraries. On my PC, this is z:\dev\boost_1_43_0\lib ; based on your post, yours is probably I:\SophisPal\boost-1_43_0-vc10-32\lib . You don't need to explicitly tell the linker which libraries you want to link against; the Boost headers use one of the Visual C++ #pragma directives to tell the linker which libraries need to be used. With just that, you should be able to build and run both Debug and Release configurations. I went through exactly these steps on and had no issues. If that works, I'd start modifying the project, one option at a time, until it matches your current project's configuration. Eventually something will make it stop working, then you'll know what the problem is. If that doesn't work, I'd look at downloading the Boost source and building it again.
