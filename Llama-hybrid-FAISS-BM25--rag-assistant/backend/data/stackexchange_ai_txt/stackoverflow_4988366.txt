Document Clustering in Objective-C

I am making an application that organizes a set of documents (ranging in number from a minimum of ~10 documents to a maximum of ~2000) into groups, based on the word/phrase content of each document. Each document can range from a paragraph of words to about a page and a half. I'm not looking for a document clustering library that clusters results based on an initial search term, but a library that clusters without a search term. Are there any libraries out there that do document clustering that can easily integrate with an Objective-C project?
