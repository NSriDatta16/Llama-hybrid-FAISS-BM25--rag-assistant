Unable to write to NSTextField from Model Controller object

After always running monolithic blocks of code from within my AppController object, I've just learned how to modularize my code using separate model controller objects (so much neater and less confusing to work with :-)) My simple test app has a main AppController and two model objects (Model1 and Model2). I can successfully pass data from the AppController to the models, and the models themselves can run methods and process the passed data 'internally' as they were intended to do -- but I can't get them to communicate with a darned NSTextField in the UI. Here's the relevant parts of my code: In AppController.m #import "AppController.h" @implementation AppController - (IBAction)passObjectsToModelController:(id)sender { NSString *stringToPass = @"Hello from Model2 :-)"; int numToPass=12345; Model2 *ObjController2 = [[Model2 alloc]initWithStuff:stringToPass:numToPass]; [ObjController2 release]; } @end ...in Model2.h #import @interface Model2 : NSObject { IBOutlet NSTextField *passedStringField; } - (id)initWithStuff:(NSString*)passedString :(int)passedNum; @end ...and finally in Model2.m #import "Model2.h" @implementation Model2 - (id)initWithStuff:(NSString*)passedString :(int)passedNum { if(self = [super init]) { NSLog(@"now inside 'Model2' controller..."); NSLog(@"the passed string reads: %@",passedString); //••• this works ••• NSLog(@"the passed number is:%d",passedNum); //••• this works ••• [passedStringField setStringValue:passedString]; //••• WTF!!... this DOESN'T work! ••• // do something internally with passedNum here... } return self; } @end Both model objects have outlets to the common NSTextField and I've control-dragged from both objects to the field and connected them. My AppController doesn't know about the NSTextField (and I assume, doesn't even want to know). No IB connections have been made between the controller object and model objects. NSLog tells me that the model objects are being created, and that the passed values are making it that far... but not from there into the text field in the GUI window. I'm not getting any compiler errors or warnings. Am I missing some kind of 'setTarget:' call perhaps? Any help/ideas would be much appreciated. Thanks :-)
