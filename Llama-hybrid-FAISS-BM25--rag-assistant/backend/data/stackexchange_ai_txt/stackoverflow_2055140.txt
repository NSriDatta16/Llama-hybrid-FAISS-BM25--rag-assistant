creating a webpage for iphone

i am creating a web page for iphone, i need the page to display efficiently in the iphone as well as on pc's. I'm coding in xhtml and uses support of JavaScript and css. The problem is that, i'm getting the correct view in the pc's but too small in the phone.how to adjust the size of the page. I am checking the user agent and loading a separate page (other than one for the pc) for the iphone. But i dont know hat changes are to be made to the attributes of body, inputs and other things so as to enable it to view correctly on the mobile browsers also
