OpenID as a Single Sign On option?

I'm just looking for different opinions. Do you consider OpenID a good "Single Sign On" solution? The way it works seems to be a little bit confusing for an average user and there could be problems related to "putting all your eggs in the same basket". Anyway, have anyone tried to implement his own OpenId solution within the context of an Intranet where there are many different applications (Wordpress, Elgg, Media Wiki, ..)?? I consider it could be a great solution to solve the "Digital Identity" problem but I don't know if it will work with the "login once and surf the Intranet" problem. Opinions?
