effect of class 0,1 proportion on logistic regression estimated probability

I am wondering what is the effect of the proportion between samples in class 1 and class 0 on the logistic regression estimated probability. suppose I have 2 lg models l1 and l2 l1 is estimated on a set with 20 samples in class 0 and 200 in class 1 while l2 on a set with 20 samples in class 0 and 20000 in class 1. I am wondering if the probability to be in class 1 obtained with the two models p1 and p2 are "in the same scale" and comparable The application I am looking at is anomaly detection where p1 and p2 are the anomaly score associated to different entities. The final record will be an array P = [p1, p2] containing the anomaly score for each entity. This is why I am wondering if they are comparable. I am afraid that the first entity is less anomalous only because it was trained on a dataset containing less samples in class 1
