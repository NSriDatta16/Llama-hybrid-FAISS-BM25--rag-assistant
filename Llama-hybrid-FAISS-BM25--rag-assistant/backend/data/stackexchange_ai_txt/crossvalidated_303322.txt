What statistics / machine learning model is used to unlock cell phone with fingerprint / face?

I am asking a high level question on what is the model "type" for unlock a cell phone using fingerprint / face. It seems to me supervised learning cannot be used, because we do not have labeled data. Is it a "anomaly detection"? Where we model the normal patterns of a authenticated user and reject abnormal patterns? But for anomaly detection say 1 class SVM, we still need reasonable amount of "normal patterns". But it seems cell phone only needs to collect data from authenticated user couple of times. What is the model used to check fingerprint / face to unlock a cell phone?
