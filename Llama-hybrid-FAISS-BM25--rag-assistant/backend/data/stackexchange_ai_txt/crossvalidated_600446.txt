In addition to Dave's answer, I think this has been already addressed in: What is the difference between logit-transformed linear regression, logistic regression, and a logistic mixed model? My suggestion is to think on the experimental/sampling design. Since your data look indeed binomial, a GLM might in principle be more powerful and appropriate than a linear model ( Warton, D. I., & Hui, F. K. (2011). The arcsine is asinine: the analysis of proportions in ecology. Ecology, 92(1), 3-10 ). However, given the repeated, discrete values of concentration, your data look like from a manipulative experiment (sensu Hurlbert, S. H. (1984). Pseudoreplication and the design of ecological field experiments. Ecological monographs, 54(2), 187-211 ). If this is case, to avoid pseudoreplication a linear model (with some transformation!) or a GLMM (i.e. generalized linear mixed model) might be preferable (see e.g. Waller, B. M., Warmelink, L., Liebal, K., Micheletta, J., & Slocombe, K. E. (2013). Pseudoreplication: a widespread problem in primate communication research. Animal Behaviour, 86(2), 483-488 ; Arnqvist, G. (2020). Mixed models offer no freedom from degrees of freedom. Trends in ecology & evolution, 35(4), 329-335 ).
