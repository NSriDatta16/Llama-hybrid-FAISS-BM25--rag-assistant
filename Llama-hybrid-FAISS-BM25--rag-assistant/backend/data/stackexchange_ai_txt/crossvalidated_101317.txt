What you have is time-to-event data, which is also termed survival analysis. That is not really my area, so I am not giving a detailed answer here. Googling for "time-to event data" or "survival analysis" will give you a lot of hits! One good starting point could be the chapter (13) about survival analysis in Venables/Ripley: MASS, or the classic "The Statistical Analysis of Failure Time Data, Second Edition" by John D. Kalbfleisch, Ross L. Prentice(auth.) EDIT, EXTENDED ANSWER As an alternative to survival analysis, you could approximate that by ordinal logistic regression. By example, in your example case of first freezing date, define some dates for which you give the "have been freezing at or before" state, 0 (no freezing), 1 (freezing). That nicely accomodates the years without freezing, you simply have an all-zero response vector. If your choosen dates are, say, 1:08 15:08 1:09 15:09 1:10 15:10 1:11 15:11 1:12 15:12 1:01 15:01 and the actual date of first freezing was 17:11, then your observed vector will be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 and, in general, all response vectors will have an initial block of zeros, followed by a block of ones. Then, you can use this with ordinal logistic regression, obtaining an estimated probability of freezing for each date. Plotting that curve will give an approximation for a survival curve (survival, in this context, becomes "not having frozen yet"). EDIT One could also see your data as recurrent events, since river freezes (almost) every year. Se my answer here: Finding significant predictors of psychiatric readmissions
