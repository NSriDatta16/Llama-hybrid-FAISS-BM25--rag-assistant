You could change your code to say return new Double((Math.toDegrees(Math.acos(theDistance))) * 111.12).intValue(); equivalent to the conversions already expressed. There are alternate and better formulae for calculating distances given latitude and longitude. Lambert's formula seems excellent, giving an accuracy of 10 meters over distances of thousands of kilometers, and uses some of the code you've already provided.
