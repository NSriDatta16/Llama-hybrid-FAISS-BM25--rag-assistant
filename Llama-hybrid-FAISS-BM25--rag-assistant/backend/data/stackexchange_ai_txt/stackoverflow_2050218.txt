The best way, clearly, is to simply keep track when you are reading the data. You as the programmer should already know whether you are getting text (and its encoding) or binary data. When you're reading text, you Encode::decode() it (see http://p3rl.org/UNI for details) into Perl text strings. If you really don't know beforehand, the -T and -B file tests offer a heuristic. Disregard Kinopiko's answer, in the vast majority of cases, you should not need to know about the internal representation of data, and messing with the utility functions from the utf8 pragma module is the wrong approach.
