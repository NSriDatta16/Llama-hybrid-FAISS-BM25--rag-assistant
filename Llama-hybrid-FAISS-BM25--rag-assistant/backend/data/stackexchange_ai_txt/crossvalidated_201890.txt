Regression of Two Correlated Time Series

I have two time series. One that measures sales data, and the other that measures foot traffic. Both series have some correlated seasonal components, e.g. both are higher around around Christmas. I also suspect that there is some non-seasonal correlation between the two series, e.g. sales are largely driven by foot traffic. Is it valid to regress the two series against each other, and if so how should I go about doing it?
