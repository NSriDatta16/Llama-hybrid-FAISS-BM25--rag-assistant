Why do Bayesians not model the input as a random variable in discrminative models?

From this question: Example of a Discriminative Bayesian Model There is this table comparing Frequentist/Bayesians and Discriminative/Generative models. $$\begin{array}{l|c|c} & \text{Frequentist} & \text{Bayesian}\\ \hline Discriminative & {\quad\quad P(Y; x, \theta)\\\text{Linear Regression}\\\text{Logistic Regression}\\\text{GLMs}} & P(Y, \Theta; x) = P(Y | \Theta; x)*P(\Theta) \\ \hline Generative & {\quad\quad\quad P(Y, X; \theta)\\\text{Linear Discrimant Analysis}\\\text{Quadratic Discrimant Analysis}} & {P(Y, X, \Theta) = P(Y, X | \Theta)*P(\Theta)\\\text{Latent Dirichlet Allocation}} \\ \end{array}$$ Convention: is dependent variable (continuous/discrete), are a set of independent variables and are model parameters. Capital letter denotes RV and small letters denotes elements that are not modeled probabilistically. Items to the right of ; are not modeled probabilistically. In the Bayesian, Discriminative cell, why do we not have $P(Y, \Theta \mid x)$ ? I thought Discriminative models wanted to model the probability of a class, given an input.
