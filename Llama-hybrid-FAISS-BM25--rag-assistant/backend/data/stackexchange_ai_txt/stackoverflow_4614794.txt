I have figured this one out. cURL updates its progress approximately one per second. To calculate idle timeout cURL calculates the average bytes/sec over 6 updates and compares it with the CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT . If this value is less than CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT for more than CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME seconds at a stretch, it times out. So if the CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME is 5 seconds, cURL will calculate the average bytes/sec over the last 6 progress updates (approx 5 secs) and then check if it is less than CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT for at least 5 seconds, thus taking total time of approx. 10 seconds.
