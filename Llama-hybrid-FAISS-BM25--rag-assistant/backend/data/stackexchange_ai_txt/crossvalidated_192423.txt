Average distance in distance matrix

I have a set of many longitude and latitude points within a city. I constructed the nxn euclidean distance matrix. My goal is to know which is the average distance between any two points. So my guess is that it should be as simple as calculating the mean of the matrix. However, I'm not certain if this number would reflect what I'm looking for or maybe there's a better estimator. My ultimate goal is to use this estimator for comparison between cities.
