your question is similar to what I had. I read some items from Facebook walls. I had two dates, one on item creation(user posts the item), one on item retrieval(I read the item from Facebook). I wanted to show items that are posted or retrieved today. SELECT link,time FROM homeWallItems WHERE DATE_SUB(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 DAY) Edit: I was over optimistic in this sentence: It is wrong. in this code, instead of CURDATE(), if you use time , then it should work you.
