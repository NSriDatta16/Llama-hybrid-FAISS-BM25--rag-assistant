libsvm-ruby assumes libsvm installs its header in PREFIX/include/libsvm/svm.h , but the macports package puts it in /opt/local/include . It's a kludge, but the easiest fix is to manually make the directory /opt/local/include/libsvm and move/copy the svm.h header there. You may still need to run your configure command with the LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS settings since it looks like the macports install doesn't update pkg-config (which libsvm-ruby uses to try to find the compiler flags). I'd report this as a package bug to the macports maintainer. If you understand macport's Portfiles, you can probably even provide a patch. Update : I haven't actually tried this, so there may be other issues once you get past the header file detection. Update 2 : I was able to get past configure with: sudo mkdir /opt/local/include/libsvm sudo cp /opt/local/include/svm /opt/local/include/libsvm/ CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-L/opt/local/lib ./configure But libsvm-ruby appears to depend on obstack.h, which doesn't exist natively on OS X. Based on this , there might be a way to copy in the files that you need, but you'll need to patch the libsvm-ruby main.cpp and Makefile to link that in. Good luck!
