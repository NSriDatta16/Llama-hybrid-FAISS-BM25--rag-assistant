How to Findout if a neural network is invariant

In object recognition, translating an image by a few pixels in some direction should not affect the category recognized. Suppose we consider images with an object in the foreground on top of a uniform background. Suppose also that the objects of interest are always at least 10 pixels away from the image's borders. Is the following neural network invariant to translations of at most 10 pixels in some direction? a) Neural network with two hidden layers consisting of convolutions (5x5 patches with a stride of 1 in each direction) followed by max pooling (4x4 patches with a stride of 4 in each direction) and a softmax output layer. Here the translation is applied only to the foreground object while keeping the background fixed.
