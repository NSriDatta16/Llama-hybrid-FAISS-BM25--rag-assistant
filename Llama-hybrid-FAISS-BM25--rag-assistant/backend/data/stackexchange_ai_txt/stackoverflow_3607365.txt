Ruby on Rails is an open-source full-stack web application framework created by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) in 2004 using the Ruby programming language. It is an optimized framework aimed at programmer's happiness and providing sustainable productivity by making use of CoC ( Convention over Configuration ), DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself ), Active Record Pattern and REST ( Representational State Transfer ) philosophies. It is based on the MVC Architectural Design Pattern , which separates web applications into three different modules: Model View Controller This helps to isolate business logic from presentation and makes code maintenance significantly easier as well as more flexible.
