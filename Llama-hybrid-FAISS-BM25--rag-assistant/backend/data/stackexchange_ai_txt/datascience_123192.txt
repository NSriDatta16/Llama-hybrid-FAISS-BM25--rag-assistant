What are machine learning algorithms which rank films?

Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to producing lists of the best films: human vs machine curation. Human curation involves someone, a critic, making decisions and/or creating a canon, based on some criteria for selection. This person specifies a subset of films which in their view belong in a pantheon of the best films ever made. Human curation is ad hoc, bespoke, subjective, thoughtful, usually involves a small set of information wrt criteria or features, and so on. Examples of this include the AFI's 100 Best American Films; 1,000 Films to See Before You Die; A Cinema History for the silent film era and books such as Gilbert Adair's Flickers: An Illustrated Celebration of 100 Years of Cinema , and many more. Criteria can include box office ticket sales, IMDB popularity ratings, critic's annual lists of best of reviews, industry awards, nominations, etc. Machine curation, on the other hand, can involve large, even huge, amounts of data and features and an algorithm of some type which statistically evaluates films to produce a ranked list of the best films. Here, the most subjective part of the process involves the selection of features used and the films included, otherwise, the process is intended to be fully automated. Rotten Tomatoes is an example of a hybrid approach to film curation as there is a panel of approved critics and a panel of people responsible for aggregating and rating the reviews of the approved critics, as explained on the About Rotten Tomatoes web page, Rotten Tomatoes has assembled a team of curators whose job it is to read thousands of movie and TV reviews weekly. The team collects movie and TV reviews from Tomatometer-approved critics and publications every day, generating Tomatometer scores. Our curators carefully read these reviews, noting if the reviews are Fresh or Rotten, and choose a representative pull-quote. Tomatometer-approved critics can also self-submit their reviews. https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about#whatisthetomatometer I'm looking for something that is virtually 100% algorithmic, like a Google PageRank for films. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank What algorithms are out there and what best of film lists have they produced?
