In my PhD Dissertation at Stanford in 1978 I constructed a family of first order autoregressive processes with uniform marginal distributions on $[0,1]$ For any integer $r\geq 2$ let $X(t) = X(t-1)/r+e(t)$ where $e(t)$ has the following discrete uniform distribution that is $P(e(t) = k/r)=1/r$ for $k=0,1,..., r-1$ . It is interesting that even though $e(t)$ is discrete each $X(t)$ has a continuous uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ if you start out assuming $X(0)$ is uniform on $[0,1]$ . Later Richard Davis and I extended this to negative correlation i.e. $X(t) =-X(t-1)/r + e(t)$ . It is interesting as an example of a stationary autoregressive time series constrained to vary between $0$ and $1$ as you indicated you are interested in. It is a slightly pathological case because although the maximum of the sequences satisfies an extreme value limit similar to the limit for IID uniforms it has an extremal index less than $1$ . In my thesis and Annals of Probability paper I showed that the extremal index was $(r-1)/r$ . I didn't refer to it as the extremal index because that term was coined later by Leadbetter (most notably mentioned in his 1983 Springer text coauthored with Rootzen and Lindgren). I don't know if this model has much practical value. I think probably not since the noise distribution is so peculiar. But it does serve as a slightly pathological example.
