Multiclass classification with SVM a question about the feature vectors

I was told I had to direct my machine learning questions to this site. So here it goes. I'm trying to do Multiclass classification with SVM. I have 7 classes. Now I was wondering if the following is possible. I'm thinking of creating 7 SVMs for 1 vs all approach. Am i allowed to create 1 kind of feature vector per class? So e.g. Class 1 vs rest ==> Use type feature vector 1 (designed for class 1) Class 2 vs rest ==> Use type feature vector 2 (designed for class 2) Class 3 vs rest ==> Use type feature vector 3 (designed for class 3) And then assign the class-label with the highest confidence (probability), to the datapoint. Is this cheating ? Or is this allowed ? Is this common practice ?
