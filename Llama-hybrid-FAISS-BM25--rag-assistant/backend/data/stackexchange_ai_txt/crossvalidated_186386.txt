In PCA, do we have to center and normalize eigenvectors or solely to normalize them?

Given such a matrix about the grades of 6 students in Maths, Computer Sciences and French: $$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ Work out the principal componant analysis. I found that the eigen vectors were: $$ v_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ -1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, v_2=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ -1 \end{bmatrix}, v_3=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ Associated with $\operatorname{Sp}(A)=\{0,\frac{2}{3},2\}$ Thus, the two nontrivial factor axes are $v_2, v_3$ which explains $25\%,75\%$ of the inertia. I'm then trying to work out the principal component analysis. After calculating the matrix of centered data $Y=A-g$ with $g =\{1,1,1\}$, Do I have to center and normalize eigenvectors ("explaining vectors") or solely to normalize them? Why? That is to say do I get $$\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\\ 0 & \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \end{bmatrix}$$ or something else and why?
