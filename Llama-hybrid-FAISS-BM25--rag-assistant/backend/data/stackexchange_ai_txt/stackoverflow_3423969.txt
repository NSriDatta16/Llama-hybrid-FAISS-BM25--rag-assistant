Search For NSAttributedString with custom attribute and Remove it? How to?

I have a placeholder string, a space character, in an NSTextView that I want to remove at a future time. My strategy is to assign the NSAttributedString a custom attribute and perform a search on the [NSTextView string] removing it. So far, I haven't found a good way to do this, outside of going through [NSTextStorage attributeRuns] . Anyone have a good idea for this? Thanks!
