L1-regularized logistic regression. It is computationally fast. It has an intuitive interpretation. It has only one easily understandable hyperparameter that can be automatically tuned by cross-validation, which often is a good way to go. Its coefficients are piecewise linear and their relation to the hyperparameter is instantly and easily visible in a simple plot. It is one of the less dubious methods for variable selection. Also it has a really cool name.
