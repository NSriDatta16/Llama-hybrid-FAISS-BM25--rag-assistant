Using macro is pretty simple: #define MACRO_FUNCTION(par1, par2) (par1 * par2) int product = MACRO_FUNCTION(4 ,5); this is an example where MACRO_FUNCTION calculate product. Pay attention that macros are not type-checked. They are just substituted at compile time. So it's up to you use the right types .
