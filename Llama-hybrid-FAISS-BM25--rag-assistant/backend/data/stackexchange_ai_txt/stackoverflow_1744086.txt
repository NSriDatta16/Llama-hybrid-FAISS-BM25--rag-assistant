This is because Internet Explorer likes to cache everything, including requests issued via JavaScript code. Another way to do this, without random numbers in the URL, is to add Cache-Control headers to the directories with the items you don't want cached: # .htaccess Header set Cache-Control "no-cache" Header set Pragma "no-cache" Most browsers respect Cache-Control but IE (including 7, haven't tested 8) only acknowledge the Pragma header.
