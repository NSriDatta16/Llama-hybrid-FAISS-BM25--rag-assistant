Positioning for Scala or Lift jobs

I'm starting to understand Scala and I like it a lot. How can you position yourself to get a paying job as a Scala developer (assuming those become more common)? What parts of the Scala ecosystem have the best job potential (Lift, Actors?). How can you gain credibility with a prospective employer without being able to point to Scala work experience (maybe experience on open-source projects?). (The above questions are hopefully of somewhat general interest to Scala folk. If you want to factor my particular situation into your response, here are a few details about me: longtime developer (mostly Java) with a Computer Sci PhD; not currently working; I'm tied to a non-cutting edge location (Rochester NY), so I may be limited to remote work.) Update 2010/07/30: Thanks for the responses. I'd like to crank up the emphasis on the location issue. I'm tied by family to a location that probably won't have Scala work locally for a long time. Are there realistic prospects for getting remote Scala work, and if so how do you position yourself to get remote work? (A modest amount of travel would be doable, but not a full-on road warrior.) Also, I was wondering about leveraging my teaching background. Would teaching a Scala class at a local university make a big difference in one's marketability as a developer , or just divert more effort than it is worth?
