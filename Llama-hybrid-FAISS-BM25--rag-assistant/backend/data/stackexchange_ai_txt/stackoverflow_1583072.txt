Remember that in English, when two ambiguous words are next to each other, the first one becomes an adjective which describes the second one. Try to stick to this rule and always name things with two components where the first component decribes the second. For instance col_num is a number. What kind of number? A column number. Next rule is the word of. It is a nice short word so please do not leave it out. Same goes with pluralization. And past tense ending in -ed or -d. Maybe even -ing. For instance, num_col is a column. What kind? A number column. If you really wanted to refer to the number of columns, you should write num_of_cols. Received date is recd_date or rcvd_date, not rec_date or rcv_date. English speaking readers are very sensitive to -s and -d at the end of words, as well as of in the middle of a phrase, so don't assume that such short bits of text would be missed. That is very unlikely because we are programmed from a very young age to notice a handful of word endings. Try for consistency, and keep a glossary or data dictionary of any words, or word fragments that you use. Don't use the same fragment for two different things. If you are using recd to mean received, and you need a variable name for recorded, then either write it out in full or come up with a new abbreviation and put it in the glossary. If you use a relational database, try to be consistent with the naming convention used there. Let the dba know what you are doing and tell them where to find your glossary.
