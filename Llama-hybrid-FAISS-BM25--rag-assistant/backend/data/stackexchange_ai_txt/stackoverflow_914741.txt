If you want a distribution that discourages repeat values, you could use a simple repeat rejection algorithm. e.g. int GetRand(int nSize) { return 1 + (::rand() % nSize); } int GetDice() { static int nPrevious=-1; while (1) { int nValue = GetRand(6); // only allow repeat 5% of the time if (nValue==nPrevious && GetRand(100) This code rejects repeat values 95% of the time, making repeats unlikely but not impossible. Statistically it is a bit ugly, but it will probably produce the results you want. Of course, it won't prevent a distribution like "5 4 5 4 5". You could get fancier and reject the second last (say) 60% of the time and third last (say) 30%. I'm not recommending this as good game design. Simply suggesting how to achieve what you want.
