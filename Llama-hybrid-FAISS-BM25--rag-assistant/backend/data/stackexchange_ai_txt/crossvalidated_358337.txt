The maximum likelihood estimator for the probality of heads in a binomial distribution is just the proportion of heads, so if in three trials you only get heads, then the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of heads is 1. In Bayesian analysis you enhance your estimate with your prior believes. The quote said "fair looking" so a reasonable prior would probably be centered around 0.5, and at least not be centered around 1. This will pull the estimate away from 1. Whether you think that is a good or a bad thing depends on how you feel about using your prior believes in an analysis. This is an subject that has been very "lively" debated.
