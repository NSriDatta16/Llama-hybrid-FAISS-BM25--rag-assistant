What non-free tools are popular amongst Java developers

The vast majority of developers I interact with are using Eclipse (I prefer NetBeans) and will leverage many of the free plugins that are available. However, many of them are using few if any tools that require monetary payment. Have developers ever considered that this may be unwise and that they are compromising their own productivity? Are there certain types of tools that the majority of developers will pay for? Likewise, are there tools they would like to use but aren't because they aren't free?
