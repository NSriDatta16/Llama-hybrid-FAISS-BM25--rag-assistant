Is there a radical difference in how bayesian and frequentist approaches treat nuisance parameters?

The wiki article on credible intervals has the following statement: credible intervals and confidence intervals treat nuisance parameters in radically different ways. What is the radical difference that the wiki talks about? Credible intervals are based on the posterior distribution of the parameter and confidence interval is based on the maximum likelihood associated with the data generating process. It seems to me that how credible and confidence intervals are computed is not dependent on whether the parameters are nuisance or not. So, I am a bit puzzled by this statement. PS: I am aware of alternative approaches to dealing with nuisance parameters under frequentist inference but I think they are less common than standard maximum likelihood. (See this question on the difference between partial, profile and marginal likelihoods .)
