How to restrict the columns to be passed to final classifier in PMML Pipeline

I am working on building XGBoost PMML using SKLearn and SKLearn2PMML. I am having some numerical,somecategorical and datetime columns from which i am creating new feature inside the pipeline. When i am trying to train the model, it gets failed as the original categorical features also gets passed to the final classfier by default. Is there any way to restrict the features by specifying the feature names ?
