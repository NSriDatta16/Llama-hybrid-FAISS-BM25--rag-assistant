What is the best approach to perform information extraction from tourist reviews using NLP, DL?

I am interested in performing some information extraction from tourist reviews about different places. I have data of 50 different places and around 300-400 reviews about each of them and I would like to get information like: weather, experience(happy/not happy), costly/cheap, places around, best time to visit, etc. Reviews are like: Mahabaleshwar is a hill station situated nearby Pune. You can reach there by road via Pune. Air connectivity is available up to Pune and from there you can travel by road. Mahabaleshwar is having so many mountain range. Weather is remaining very beautiful throughout the year. There are so many points to be visited in Mahabaleshwar like Parsi point, Elphinstone point, Wilson Point, Arthur seat point. There is Vennna Lake where you can have boating and horse riding. Strawberry is available at each and every place in Mahabaleshwar which is its main attraction. There are so many hotels available but they are somewhat costly. By the way it is the nice place to visit. Mahabaleshwar is a best place for tourists. It is located in Maharashtra. I also visit Mahabaleshwar when I'm free time. It is famous for their's natural beauty. Here is a one river ans when I visit to Mahabaleshwar then I definitely go to ride on small boat, it Is very joyful. Need some suggestions on what algorithm can be used and about data processing approach. Links or tutorials are would be helpful too. Thanks!
