By elegant I mean, is there a way to do this without if/switch/etc... You bet! Whether that will mean 'elegant' in any usual sense, well: static unsigned next_day_set (unsigned today, unsigned set) { unsigned arev = bitreverse (highest_bit_set (bitreverse ((set > 7) | arev) & 0x7f; } That's assuming you have 'elegant' functions to reverse the bits in a word and find the leftmost bit set -- see Hacker's Delight . If you represented the weekday bits in the reverse order, it'd be simpler and actually even sort of elegant for real, assuming I didn't screw up: enum { Sunday = 1 > 7) | a) & 0x7f; }
