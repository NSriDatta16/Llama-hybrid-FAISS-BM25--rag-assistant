Both methods will be beneficial for different cases. If you think that dependencies in the text are more discriminative of the classes, then NLP apporach.

On the other hand layout and position could be very informative and this it could happen is not encoded in text and only image approach can catch this information. Conclusion. Maybe think about hard-encoding layout and position features and pass them along to NLP model.
