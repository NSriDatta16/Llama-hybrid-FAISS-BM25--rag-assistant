I will try to answer, and make a few comments on the Wilcoxon signed rank test (WSRt). You are looking at the before/after data (hence pairs) for the height estimates, by bands. So your data can take 5 possible values: -2,-1,0,1,2. But these are not "numbers", but rather ordinal symbols. So we can not treat them numerically. Hence perhaps your idea of using a WSRt? Now your null hypothesis appears to be that there is no significant change in the band estimate between before and after having seen the map. I will now make some (hopefully not too) wild assumptions about the data. I would assume that most of the data is in the "0" bin (no change), and that the median of the data is in the "0" bin? It would help a great deal if you could share a graph -bar graph- of the data). Now, a WSRt is a test of the pseudo-median, which is, for all practical purposes, impossible to interpret intuitively. If the data is symmetric, it can then become a test of the median (but it is very sensitive to departures from symmetry). In fact, it is probably better as a test of symmetry: just use it to test the sample against the observed median. and the p-value will tell you the probability of the data being symmetrical (around the median, which then, btw, becomes the mean as well) Now, if the data were not symmetrical (which may explain why you get significant WSRt results), that would be a strong indication that the map had an effect (people changed their estimates in a particular direction). However, if the data looks symetric "enough", it does not mean that there was no change of heighht estimate due to the map, but that the changes were "random" or rather symmetrical, i.e. an equal amount of subjects changed up by 1 or 2 than down by 1 or 2: which does not prove that the map had no effect, just that the average population effect is null. Wrt to ties (and yes, there would be a lot, because all your data is only in 5 bins), I would not worry about it too much. Most implementations of teh WSRt deal with it nicely (i.e. employ appropriate corrections for ties). And since you are testing symmetry, a graph will tell you if you believe the test result. The above approach may help, but I feel it is too "coarse". What I mean by that is, for example, that you "lump" together going from 2 to 1, and going from 1 to 0 (and same for going up): you are losing information about the changes. So let me propose a different approach. You are trying to compare the band assignment before, and after having seen the map. I would treat this as a 3x3 contingency matrix: columns are band assignments before, rows are after. For each subject, you add 1 at the intersection. And then you use a test such as Fisher exact, or Chi-square, for the 3x3 matrix (only use Chi-square if all the cells in teh matrix have "large" (>10?) values).Now you can tell if the changes affected only some cells, or only in some direction, etc... It is similar to what @Sextus Empiricus proposed, but there he was comparing UAV to the estimates, by height band, which does not appear to be what you wanted to do in the question (comparing before and after having seen the map)
