As far as I know, there is no cross-browser way to do this: Flash, the most common option when embedding audio on a web page, doesn't play Midi files . The only way is indeed the embed method, and whether that works will depend on how the user's browser is set up. A plug-in (like Quicktime) will have to be installed that can handle the file. If the "install plugin" dialog appears on a computer, it won't work there. I think the only sane way is to convert those Midis to MP3 files.
