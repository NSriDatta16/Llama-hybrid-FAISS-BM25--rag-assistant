dataTables search messed up by input from another form

hello i have a form like this Ragione sociale o denominazione Partita IVA then i have an html table to which i apply dataTables and then i have this code $("#ricerca").submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); oTable.fnClearTable();//Empty the entire table of current row information. oTable.fnDraw(); }); the problem is when i type something in my form, it's as if it gets auto submited as dataTables's search field, and then i can see the same text in dataTables search field, i can't understand why
