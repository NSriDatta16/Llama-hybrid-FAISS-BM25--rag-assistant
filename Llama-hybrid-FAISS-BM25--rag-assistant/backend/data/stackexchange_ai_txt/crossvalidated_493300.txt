Multiple Correspondence Analysis to inform a composite variable

I have 28 categorical variables, some binary, some with many levels (n=161). I want to use some of these variables to make a composite variable to investigate a latent characteristic, and then test the association of this characteristic with the remaining variables in the dataset. My plan is to use MCA and use the variables suggested by one of the dimensions to make a composite variable, check this for consistency using Cronbach or similar and then model the composite using log-linear analysis or logistic regression. Can anyone tell me if this is a misuse of MCA? I wouldn't be using the dimension itself, just taking the variables associated with the dimension and using them in subsequent analysis. All comments welcome. (I don't think I need to submit a sample dataset here as its a theory question?)
