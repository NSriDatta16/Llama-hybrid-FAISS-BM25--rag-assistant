The Hessian matrix is widely used in statistics to obtain an asymptotic approximation to the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates in large sample problems (specifically from its inverse). I presume this particular calculation is in a Bayesian context in which case its not exactly that - it would be an approximation to the covariance matrix of the joint conditional posterior distribution of parameters. In turn that covariance matrix is mainly used to pull out estimated standard errors (standard deviation of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter conditional on the data in a Bayesian context), by taking the square roots of diagonal elements.
