I once did this for one of my class projects. Since I had only one week time to implement, it was not really a good implementation. The way I did was whenever the user drags and drops, I got the final x.location and y.location from javascript and call asmx web service where I will send (x,y). In the asmx file I wrote the code to save it in database.
