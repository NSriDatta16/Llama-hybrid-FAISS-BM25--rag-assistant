The (1-p)^n formula and/or usage of an exponential decay or poisson rate involves assumption of IID - independent, identically distributed repetitions. But what if there are variations of probability among users of contraception? This could occur through poor technique, or misreporting in the survey (yes, every time... not). So, there could be subgroups that have yearly pregnancy probabilities other than 18%. Grouping them all and averaging, you get 18% for one year. But in each of these subgroups the percentage is different and because of the exponential would evolve quite differently over longer time periods. Actually modelling the probability of a particular couple would seem to be more complex than this, even if we assumed groupings... since we are combining men of type A,B,C,D,... with women of type W,X,Y,Z,... and would have NxM different combinations ... perhaps too complex to be a model in previous studies.
