convert nan value to zero

I have a 2D numpy array. Some of the values in this array are NaN . I want to perform certain operations using this array. For example consider the array: [[ 0. 43. 67. 0. 38.] [ 100. 86. 96. 100. 94.] [ 76. 79. 83. 89. 56.] [ 88. NaN 67. 89. 81.] [ 94. 79. 67. 89. 69.] [ 88. 79. 58. 72. 63.] [ 76. 79. 71. 67. 56.] [ 71. 71. NaN 56. 100.]] I am trying to take each row, one at a time, sort it in reversed order to get max 3 values from the row and take their average. The code I tried is: # nparr is a 2D numpy array for entry in nparr: sortedentry = sorted(entry, reverse=True) highest_3_values = sortedentry[:3] avg_highest_3 = float(sum(highest_3_values)) / 3 This does not work for rows containing NaN . My question is, is there a quick way to convert all NaN values to zero in the 2D numpy array so that I have no problems with sorting and other things I am trying to do.
