Question about Bayesian Probability

I have difficulty understanding what I should do for this problem, can you help me? Specifically, I don't understand what probabilities I should start with given that the questions says I can't assume 0.9 to 0.1 probabilities. Maybe I'm wrong. Here's the calculator if you need http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/bayes/BayesCalc.htm
