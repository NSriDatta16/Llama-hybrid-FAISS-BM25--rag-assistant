Instead of a database for this, why not leverage the Windows Search functionality, and Windows abilities to assign categories and keywords to files. Syntax Information: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx How to use Search in a WPF application: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/Vista_Search_in_WPF.aspx Edit for Additional Details Okay, here's the concept, all these files that you're scanning in, they're being digitized, and then you'd have some process for naming them, and placing data in they META data for the file (categories, keywords, etc) For the Service, you'll want to write a Windows Service which contains a THREADPOOL . What you would want is that for every SEARCH request that comes in, you would spin off a new thread to perform the actual search. The threadpool would keep the system from being overtaxed and basically manage these threads for you. The application on the worker computers, would make a search request possibly by writing a message to a MS Message Queue on the server, and then wait for the response from the service (again, possibly via message queues, but you have a number of different options here this communication). When this response comes back, you would then update your UI with a list of file names/locations for the user to view, decide, etc.
