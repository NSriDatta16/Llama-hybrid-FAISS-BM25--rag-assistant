Name for (maximum+minimum)/2 and relationship to average?

Is there a common name for $c := \frac{max(X)+min(X)}{2}$ ? What is the relationship between $\tilde{x} := Avg(X)$ and $c$ ? What metrics or information can I derive from $\tilde{x}$ and $c$ ? If I have $C := \{c_{i}|1 \leq i \leq \frac{|X|}{2}; c_{i} := \frac{max_{i}(X)+min_{i}(X)}{2}\}$ where $max_{i}$ is the i-th maximum and $min_{i}$ is the i-th minimum ( $max_{2}$ would be the second largest element). What can I derive from $C$ ? $|X|$ here means the amount of samples/values in $X$ .
