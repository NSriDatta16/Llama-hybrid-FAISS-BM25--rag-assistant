Correctness of product of densities representing parts of information as prior density in Bayes inference

suppose I've got data $X$ from a model driven by parameter $\theta$ . Model of data is represented by conditional density (likelihood function) $$f(x|\theta).$$ Suppose the prior density of $\theta$ is denoted by $$f(\theta).$$ My question is, is it consistent with bayesian theory to choose ANY probability density as a prior density in our model, if it's correctly defined density with respect to correct measure? I'm asking this question because I have a complicated model with 2 types of information about parameter $\theta$ , and both those sources of informations have probability density as their description. I don't have an idea how to add those two sources of prior information to model, other than multiply those 2 individual densities into one and normalize them. But something inside me is telling me that might be fundamentally incorrect.
