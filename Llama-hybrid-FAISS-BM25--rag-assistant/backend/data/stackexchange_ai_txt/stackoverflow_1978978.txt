If I understand you correctly, you have two result sets with same structure but different datasets (like selecting with different clauses). If this is correct, I believe that better (more efficient) way is to try to solve this task on the database level. Maybe with temporarily/cumulative tables and/or stored procedure. Using CF it is almost definitely will need a ton of loops, which can be inappropriate for the large datasets. Though I did something like this for the small datasets using intermediate storage: converted one result set into the structure, and looped over the second query with checking the structure keys.
