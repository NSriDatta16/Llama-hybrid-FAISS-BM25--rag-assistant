You are doing work on the jQuery object that is created from the string images, not on the DOM object appended under the div with class content . Try: // use last-child to get latest added div console.log($(".content:last-child").find('img')); var img = $(".content:last-child").find('img'); Also note that when using live you only have to set it up once, perhaps towards the start of your ready. You can use the selector .content img to get all img tags in the .content div. If content contains other images you don't want to hvae that click act on, try .imgBox img perhaps.
