Any alternate spatial correlation/regression method than Moren' I and GWR

I have economic and health indicators for a city. I want to find spatial correlation between say mental health scores of the people with their average income. If I use Moran's I, then I can only see one indicator's spatial correlation i.e. the Mental health scores or, the average income scores are not random, there is clustered values. But, I want to find the correlation between mental health and average income or, any two/three variables with geographical location being a factor. Say for example, my research question is - people in high income regions face more mental health problems than people in low income regions. I know I can just do Pearson's correlation to find a correlation between mental health and average income but, it has no location/ spatial component to the analysis. Is there any theoritical/practical way how I can find spatial correlation between variables? I am looking at GWR or, Geographically Weighted Regressions. Any thoughts? By the way, I am using R.
