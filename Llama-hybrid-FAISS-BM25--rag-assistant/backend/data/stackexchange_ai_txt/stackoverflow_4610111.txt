Some Background... ELMAH is designed to log errors to a specified log source . The most common log source is the SqlErrorLog class, which logs errors to a SQL Server database and is part of the core ELMAH library. But there are other log sources available that log errors to an email address, to an XML file, to an Oracle database, and so on. The sequence number to which you refer is something specific to the SqlErrorLog class. If you look at some of the other log sources, like the XmlFileErrorLog , you'll see there's no concept of a sequence number. Given this, it should come as no surprise that ELMAH's Error class - which is what represents an error - has no Sequence property. The "sequence" is something specific to the SqlErrorLog log source. (You can further see this if you examine the T-SQL script used to create the database objects for the SqlErrorLog log source - the Sequence field is an IDENTITY column and therefore is automatically computed by the database on insert. It is not a value provided by ELMAH.) A Possible Solution... MichaelvR suggested modifying ELMAH's source code, but I'd suggest against that since by doing so you'd be tying your branch of ELMAH to a particular log source. Instead, perhaps a less elegant (and simpler!) solution is in order: Create the ErrorLog_Logged event handler in Global.asax as you described, Read the error's Id value (the GUID) of the just-raised error, Connect to the database and query the ELMAH_Error table directly. Here is a sample query: SELECT Sequence FROM ELMAH_Error WHERE ErrorId = TheErrorIdOfTheJustLoggedError What do you think of this workaround? Happy Programming!
