You really need to make up your mind about how to organize and manage credentials first. If you use sp_setapprole that will circumvent Windows authentication and allow access through that app for any user. If that's what you really want to do then if the app is a server create user account for that app and run it under that user's credentials. If it's a client app then make a web service which will only read and send particular data that the app needs and run that web service under new account. Then, in IIS7 you can put an ACL on the web service itself so that it's still protected. Also if that app is not trusted to be clean and know what it's doing then request that it has to be code reviewed before it's allowed to touch SQL server. If it's your own app then start trusting yourself :-)
