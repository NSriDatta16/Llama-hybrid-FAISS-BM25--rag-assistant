Can I use categorical and numerical data variable at the same time in randomForest in r?

I have data in which few columns contain categorical data whereas remaining columns contain numerical data. I want to use random forest regressor from the randomForest library in r. So does this library work with such data out of the box (assuming I have preprocessed the data and is ready to directly feed in the regressor)? DATA (something along this line) : Target | product | status | revenue | MS 0.8 abc NC 1000 0.5 0.5 abc UR 200 0.2 0.2 pqr NC 800 0.04
