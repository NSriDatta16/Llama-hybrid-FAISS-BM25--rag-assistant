Ordinal semiparametric regression models such as the proportional odds model can handle arbitrarily large zero inflation, all the way to the extreme case where Y takes on only two values (this reduces to binary logistic regression). Ordinal regression automatically handles detection limits if the limits are at or beyond the really observed data. When detection limits are interior to the data you need to formally incorporate left, right, or interval censoring into the likelihood calculations. The blrm function in the R rmsb package can fit a Bayesian proportional odds model with arbitrary censoring, as exemplified by one of the examples linked from that site.
