Embedding publisher policy into assembly

I'm developing a shared assembly, version 2.0.0.0. For future compatibility, I'd like to bind all the 2.0.x.x versions to the latest version installed. To do so I need a publisher policy file. Is there a way to embed the publisher policy directly in the "code" assembly instead of having to install two different assemblies? I.e. my assembly will be ALWAYS in the GAC, since it is not allowed to run separated from the application it wraps. Thank you. QbProg
