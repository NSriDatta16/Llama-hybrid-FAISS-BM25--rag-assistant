Check if 2d pointer array has user defined value in C?

Sample code: float** a; a = (float**) malloc(numNodes * sizeof(float*)); for(int i=0; i I am creating a dynamic 2d array above. Before populating, I noticed that each block in the array already holds this value: -431602080.000000 and not NULL. Why is this? There are situations where not all spaces within the array are used. So, my query is simple, Is there an elegant way to check if the each block has this default value or a user defined value? Thanks in advance.
