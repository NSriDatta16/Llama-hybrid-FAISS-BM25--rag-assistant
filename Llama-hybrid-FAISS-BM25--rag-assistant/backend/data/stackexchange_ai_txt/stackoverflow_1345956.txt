Flex and .Net: what should I be concerned about to make my life easier?

I'm a Flash developer but have been slowly moving to developing my applications in Flex . The shift in paradigm has changed the way I work considerably. I am now following a more structured approach to development that has changed the kind of applications I am building. Now I'm relying more on a database and middleware to provide the content. CRUD type applications with better usability. So this has changed the media that I choose to interact with. Whether it a podcast or a webpage. I am taking in more .NET/Java developer centric type of news. I am hearing a lot regarding Maven , Hudson , 100% code coverage. As a sole end to end developer making his own user interface and wiring it up to a hosted server/database (currently .NET 3.5 and MS SQL Server 2005 ). What should I be concerned about to make my life easier? I'm currently developing .NET with Visual Studio 2008 and Using the Flex Builder 3 plug in for Eclipse . Sometimes, I feel I am forcing it to work( using AMF , etc and ActionScript 's crappy date object). Got to say I do like visual studio, and if it could get it's reference dialogue sorted out it'd be even nicer. But the Adobe side also has been getting slicker! Anyway thoughts appreciated. Even stuff like move to Silverlight or use ColdFusion . My current strengths probably lie with ActionScript but it also has to be said that Visual Studio with ReSharper makes writing code very easy, especially like the way it will import stuff for you.
