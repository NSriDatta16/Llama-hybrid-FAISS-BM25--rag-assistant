Just use a join in MySQL to to fetch the correct handle, all the fields selected from handles will show up in your array with the correct key/value specified in the database. SELECT `navigation`.*, `handles`.`redirect_to`, `handles`.`handle` FROM `navigation` INNER JOIN `handles` ON `navigation`.`handle` = `handles`.`id` This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to organizing and fetching data from relational databases like MySQL. Knowing where to use what query type can be incredibly powerful. If you ever have queries embedded in loops of other queries, you can probably fetch all the data at once.
