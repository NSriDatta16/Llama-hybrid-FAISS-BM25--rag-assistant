t-SNE gives no function for embedding out-of-sample data in the low-dimensional space. Consequently, all of the usual machine learning notions about out-of-sample performance are out. If you use a different dimension reduction approach, such as UMAP or PCA, and then develop a functioning model based on that reduced dimensionality, that’s fine. Addressing your exact question about KNN, if you use KNN after a dimension reduction, you’re still using KNN as the classifier, not an unsupervised method.
