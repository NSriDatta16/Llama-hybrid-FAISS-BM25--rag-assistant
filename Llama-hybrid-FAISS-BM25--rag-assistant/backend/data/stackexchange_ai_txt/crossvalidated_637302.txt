Seaborn Boxplot's quartiles

I'm trying to understand how to properly interpret seaborn -generated boxplot s. Consider the following code: import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns df = pd.DataFrame([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) sns.boxplot(data=df) When I run this code in Google Colab, the following plot appears: To the best of my understanding, the y-value of the box's lower side is the data's quartile. This implies that, according to seaborn , the data's quartile is strictly greater than 1.5. This doesn't align with what I know of quartiles. As far as I know, a quartile is any number x satisfying P(X = 1/4 and, if X is discrete, and if x1 are two quartiles belonging to X 's support, then the representative quartile is taken, by convention, to be the average of x1 and x2 . Applying this to the data of the example above, this implies that the quartile should be precisely 1.5 , in contradiction to the plot, which shows the quartile to be strictly greater than 1.5 .
