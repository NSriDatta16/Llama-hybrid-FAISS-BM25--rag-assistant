For the boundaries, you can refer to the answers given by @belisarius and @AakashM. As for centerpoint, you want "center of mass". Good 'ol Wikipedia has explanations and recipes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid . In general, you get a different result calculating the centroid than calculating the average of the vertices. This difference will be pronounced if the vertices are not uniformly distributed.
