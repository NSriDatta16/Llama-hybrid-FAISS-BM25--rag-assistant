In jQuery, how to revert a draggable on ajax call failure?

I want the draggable to be reverted to its original position if the ajax call on drop returns a failure. Here is the code what I am imagining it to be.. It is OK if the draggable rests in the droppable while the ajax call is in process... jQuery(document).ready($){ $("#dragMe").draggable(); $("#dropHere").droppable({ drop: function(){ // make ajax call here. check if it returns success. // make draggable to return to its old position on failure. } }); } DragMe DropHere
