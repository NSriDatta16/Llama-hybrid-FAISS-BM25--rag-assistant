You say that your "goal is to determine which locations (Locs) can be differentiated based on the concentrations of these substances, and which substances are contributing to those differences" . Your analysis so far focuses on the first part of your goal - I haven't run through each step, but it looks sensible to me. Your second goal is to determine which substances contribute to the differences between locations that you have observed. For some context, vegan is normally used for analysis of ecological data, and your question is equivalent to analysis for determining which species contribute most to differences in biological communities. There are several methods - they generally give similar results so it's up to you what to use. I'll give some names and links: simper - see https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame/dissimilarity-based-methods/simper Indicator species analysis - see https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/07/02/Indicator-species-analysis.html model‚Äêbased analysis of multivariate abundance data (mvabund) - https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00190.x
