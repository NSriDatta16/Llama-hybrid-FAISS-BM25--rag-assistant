Validation of Bayesian hierarchical model

Possible Duplicate: Validation techniques for hierarchical model I already posted this to Math.SE , but I realized this would probably be a better place to post to. I have a hierarchical model that I need to validate. My model is as follows: we have a collection of $λ_i$ that we draw from ${\rm Gamma}(α,β)$. Then, we draw our data point yi from ${\rm Poisson}(λ_i)$. I get a joint distribution of $α,β,λ_i$ via a Gibbs sampler combined with a Metropolis step. This part is fine, no problems with implementation. My question is how do I validate such a model? I have my set of data, each one corresponding to one particular $λ_i$. I'm not sure what statistical tests/ other steps I should take to check are. Thanks!
