How to do binary logistic regression on people (couples) clustered within homes?

I am looking at the relationship between housing characteristics and a health outcome. To make the example simple, I have data for a continuous predictor (exposure) collected from 1000 homes and health outcomes S (a binary outcome) for 2000 people (1000 couples) living in each of those homes. I would like to look at the relationship between S and E using binary logistic regression. Apart from sharing the same exposure, there is no mechanistic reason to believe that status of partner 1 in the couple can affect the status of partner 2 e.g. its not a transmissible disease etc. Can I do an ordinary logistic regression? Or must I take into account the fact that people are clustered within homes? If so, why? What syntax would be appropriate in Stata, xtlogit with i(house) ? or some kind of xtmixed ? Many thanks
