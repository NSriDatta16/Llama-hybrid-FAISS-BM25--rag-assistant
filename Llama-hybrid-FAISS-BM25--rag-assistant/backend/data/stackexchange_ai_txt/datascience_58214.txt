Can you think of any domain of application, other than 2D images, where it could make sense to use max pooling or convolution? Convolutions and max pooling are both used in other areas. Here you can see both being used for text: Text Classification using CNN And they do not even have to be 2-dimensional. Here is another example with 1-dimensional audio data: Keras Sequential Conv1D Model Classification Convolutions and max pooling are used to build models with the assumption that features close to each other will have a stronger relation to each other. This is independent of the domain, so it does not matter if they are pixels in an image or words in a text.
