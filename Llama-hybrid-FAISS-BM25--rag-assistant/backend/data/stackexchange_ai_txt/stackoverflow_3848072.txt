Revised Suppose that we can get one of the three outcomes when we try to fit a screw into a hole: The screw is too small for the hole, such that the screw becomes loose and falls out. The screw fits the hole exactly. The screw is too big for the hole. Divide-and-conquer solution. Stage #1 Pick one screw. Use this screw to test through all holes. (requires N trials) This partitions all holes into one of three cases: The hole is bigger than the test screw (A). The hole is the same size as the test screw (B). The hole is smaller than the test screw (C). Use the hole which has the same size (chosen from B) to test through all screws. (requires N trials) This partitions all screws into one of three cases: The screw is bigger than the test hole (D). The screw is the same size as the test hole (E). The screw is smaller than the test hole (F). Result: Any hole picked from B will fit any screw picked from E. This will be the "Pivot" of the partition. They do not require any further testing. The holes in set A and the screws in set D have diameters wider than the pivot. The holes in set C and the screws in set F have diameters narrower than the pivot. Thus, we successfully partitioned the initial problem into two smaller problems. Analysis Average case: O(N log N) Worst case: O(N^2) because we do not know the rank of the pivot until we have finished partitioning the set using the pivot. Same analysis as QuickSort . About a variant of the question There is a variant of the question in which it's not possible to distinguish between loose-fit with exact fit. That is, for each test only two outcomes are possible: hole screw hole >= screw This variant is much much harder. I do not know if it can be solved in O(n log n) or not. (Edited)
