What is better for PHP developers - Unicode or UTF-8?

What is better for PHP developers - Unicode or UTF-8? I am going to create an international CMS. So I am going to have clients all over the world. They will speak all possible languages. What encoding format is better for browser recognition and for DB data storage?
