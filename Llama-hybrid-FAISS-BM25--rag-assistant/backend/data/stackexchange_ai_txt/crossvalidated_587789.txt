Poisson Model Interrupted Time Series Analysis

I've run an Interrupted Time Series Analysis on count data, fitting a Poisson Model as below: glm(`Subject Total` ~ Quarter + int2 + time_since_intervention2 , df, family = "poisson") This is intended to show the change in number of application received and needs to be interpretable as such. The plot shows a diminishing trend in the [longer] pre-intervention period with a level change and potentially slight trend change. The output summary from the model is: Call: glm(formula = `Subject Total` ~ Quarter + int2 + time_since_intervention2, family = "poisson", data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.72350 -0.67721 0.06528 0.68167 1.35607 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.681163 0.088844 41.434 I can't really present the ITS outcomes as above as I need to make such more interpretable and intended to do so by just using exp() on the coefficients. However, whilst exp(Intercept) does reflect the plotted value - the others do not. I am sure this is due to my lack of understanding of the Poisson model, but could do with some advice/help as to how to derive a more usable figure?? For example int2 equates to the level change in the post-intervention period. Under the summary output it is -0.164817. Exp(int2) = 0.8480492. However, the "real difference" between the fitted value and relevant counterfactual = -4.2 applications. Whilst I can report said level change in an interpratble way the trend is much more problemtaic. Anyone have any ideas/is it just me not really understanding the Poisson model. Thanks
