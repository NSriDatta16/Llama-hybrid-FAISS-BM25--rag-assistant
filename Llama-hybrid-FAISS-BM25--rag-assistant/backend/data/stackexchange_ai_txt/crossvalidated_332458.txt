How do you incorporate seasonal differencing into a regression in R?

I've spent like 3 hours trying to figure this out. I've found millions of articles on how to remove trends and seasonality in a time series data. However, none of the articles tell me how to incorporate this into a linear regression equation in R without some fancy package. To remove trend, you can add time to your regression. For example: lm(y ~ t) where y is your data and t is just the time associated with each data point. Most times you'll include a lag1 regressor so it'll be: lm(y ~ t + y_(t-1)) How do you add seasonal differencing into the equation - let's say you have monthly data and the cycle occurs yearly. So you would want a lag12 difference. How do I incorporate this into the lm formula above?
