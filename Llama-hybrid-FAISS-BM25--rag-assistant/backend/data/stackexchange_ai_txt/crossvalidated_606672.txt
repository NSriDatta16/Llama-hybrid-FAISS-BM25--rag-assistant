Yes, it's still a rate ratio (per one unit of time - or whatever else the "per" is, e.g. per 1 km road driving, per 1 m of string etc.). Of course, this gets harder to interpret, if the time (or whatever else it is) differs between unit of analysis and the offset was just not included. Perhaps, it still makes sense, if the distribution of times is representative for a population (e.g. number of times a human will break a bone in their lifetime over a representative distribution of years lived), but notice that this distribution might change (e.g. people on average live longer nowadays than they used to, but of course lots of other things changed, so I'd not expect to break bones at the same rate as in medieval times).
