Control group selection

I am currently migrating some code from SAS to Python. I am trying to do the following in python: I have two groups of customers: those that were exposed to a campaign, and those that were not (the ones that were not exposed is a much larger group). I have some metrics for each customer, such as sales before the campaign started, and some segmentations. What I need to do, is to select from the non-exposed group a control group that would be most similar to the exposed group. Example, if in the exposed group, the average sales were $20, 20% of customers were of segment A, etc., I would like the control group to be as similar as possible to the exposed group.
