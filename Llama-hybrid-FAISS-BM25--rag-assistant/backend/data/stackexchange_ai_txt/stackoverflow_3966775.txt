Nunit and code coverage for C#

I am using C# + .Net 4.0 + VSTS 2010. I am wondering whether Nunit is the best and easy to learn unit test tool for this platform (C# + .Net 4.0 + VSTS 2010)? If yes, I want to learn basics of Nunit, and also want to find how to generate code coverage report based on Nunit result (e.g. code coverage report to show which function is tested, which function is not tested, how many lines are tested.) Any recommended tutorials for Nunit and code coverage for a newbie?
