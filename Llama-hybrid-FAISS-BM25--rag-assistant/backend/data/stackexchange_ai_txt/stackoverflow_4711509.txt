In the second case, z2 counts as a constant expression , because it's a final variable of type int . From section 4.12.4 : We call a variable, of primitive type or type String, that is final and initialized with a compile-time constant expression (§15.28) a constant variable. Whether a variable is a constant variable or not may have implications with respect to class initialization (§12.4.1), binary compatibility (§13.1, §13.4.9) and definite assignment (§16). Section 15.28 includes "constant variables" in the set of items which can be used to form a constant expression. z1 is not a final variable (even though nothing else assigns a value to it) so it's not a constant variable, and thus not a constant expression - so the paragraph you quoted from the spec doesn't apply.
