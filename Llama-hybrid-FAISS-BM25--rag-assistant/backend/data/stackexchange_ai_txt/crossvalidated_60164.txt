Your results don't have to do with the way missing values are marked. On the face of it, you need to put a comma between "-2" and "-1". Then you'll be recoding those values into a "1". But that contradicts your first paragraph, which says it's the cases that are missing values (not those with "-2" or "-1") that should be assigned a "1". (Where did the "-2" and "-1" come from?) If you really want to assign a "1" when v204 has a missing value and a "0" otherwise, then use: recode v204 (lo thru hi = 0) (else = 1) into NewVariable. exe.
