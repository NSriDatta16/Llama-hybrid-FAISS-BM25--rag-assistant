How to predict months/time using neural network?

Assume I have a problem where I have to predict time let it be years, months or days. So I think it's a regression problem but the problem is how to do it. I mean usually dense layers prediction will be in floating number right? But months or days are usually interger. That is we can predict 8.65 months when the y_true is 8 months right? How do deal with this? Should I just round it? What type of loss function can I use in this case?
