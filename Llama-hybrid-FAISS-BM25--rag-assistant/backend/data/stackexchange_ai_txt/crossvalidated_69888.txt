Recently I published a paper reporting mean and 95% confidence intervals for a number of performance statistics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity etc) for a logistic regression model. We used 10 repetitions of 10 fold cross validation, taking the test set result for each fold produced 100 values for each performance statistic. If you can reasonably assume these values are independent then 95% confidence intervals can be calculated from these values. If you can't assume independence then bootstrapping as discussed above may be more appropriate.
