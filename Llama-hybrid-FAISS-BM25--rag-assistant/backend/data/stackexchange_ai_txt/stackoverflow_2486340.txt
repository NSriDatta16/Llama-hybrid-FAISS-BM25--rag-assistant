That's a non-portable and messy way to check if something is in a file. Imagine you have 1000 lines, you will be making system call to gawk 1000 times. It's super inefficient. You are using Python, so do them in Python. .... ligand_file=open( "2WTKA_ab.txt", "r" ) #Open the receptor.txt file ligand_lines=ligand_file.readlines() # Read all the lines into the array ligand_lines=map( str.strip, ligand_lines ) ligand_file.close() for line in open("unique_count_a_from_ac.txt"): sline=line.strip().split() if sline[1] in ligand_lines: print line.rstrip() Or you can also use this one liner if Python is not a must. gawk 'FNR==NR{a[$0]; next}($2 in a)' 2WTKA_ab.txt unique_count_a_from_ac.txt
