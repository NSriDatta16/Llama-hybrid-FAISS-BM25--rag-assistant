I would argue that the analysis FFDs are a subset of the analysis techniques for RSM. Furthermore, the analogy I would use is the comparison of a multiple regression model where you are deciding between including an ordinal variable as a purely categorical variable (estimating each levels response separately) vs as a scalar variable (where you can assume some element of continuity across the spacing of the ordinal levels). What is true in both FFD and RSM is that you are not examining every possible combination of experimental cells possible. With FFD this is often because if the number of cells can become quite large (10 dichotomous factors would required $2^{10}=1024$ experimental cells), and with RSM you have continuous variables (so a selection of all possibilities is impossible). However, with careful selection of a subset of the possible combinations, you obtain enough information to tease out most 1st and 2nd order effects. I am currently teaching a DoE course, and I would recommend the textbook we are using: D.C. Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments . (We are using the 10th ed.) This book provides a very detailed breakdown of the variations of FFDs you might encounter (chapters 8 & 9). The coverage of RSM is very thorough (chapter 11), and the information is presented in a manner that shows how multiple regression analyses of the models from FFDs and RSMs are similar in nature. I hope this response is useful.
