Credit card processing between Magento & Oracle

We have an oracle erp system through which orders are shipped. Magento is our ecommerce system for web orders, we are trying to find a solution to get the authorization code once a credit card is processed and then send it to oracle from Magento and charge the credit card only when the item is shipped from oracle. Has anyone implemented such a system and do you have any suggestions to get a credit card information from Magneto to oracle without storing the credit card number? Thanks, Aarti
