Is it ok to use the web view to render non web content web developing for iOS4

I'm just learning the iPhone SDK and about drawing with CG and UIKit and whilst I can see the usefulness for building interfaces as a web developer I can't help but think it would be a hell of a lot easy if I could layout content (ie heading, paragraphs, lists, images) with html and css presumably this is possible using the web view and injecting custom html and css into it is there any reason this is a bad idea?
