One thing I've found very useful is the svn:external property which means you can reference directories from other repositories into your own. It's gives really nice ways of organizing your code and data. Some examples are: If you have a separate repositories for code different modules/libraries and reference in the ones you are using. This means that you can have a meta repository for every executable. If it's a small executable that only uses a few modules, you won't need to checkout the entire tree. An effect of this is that you get SVN revision numbers per module. Adding large binary data such as compiled versions of libraries to code repository is generally considered a bad habit, but it can be really convenient. If you just add all versions of all libraries you use to a different repository you can get the best of two worlds. You reference in the versions of the libraries you use into your code repository. When checking out your code repository you'll get both the code and the binaries as well. However the binaries are stored in a large repository which you don't need to backup as rigorously as your source code and the source code repository stays small and contains only text.
