How does Ruby on Rails handle "Select count(*) from products group by category"?

Say if there is a table with fields Products -------- ID CategoryID Name Price ... etc How can Ruby on Rails give a table that returns select count(*) from products group by categoryID which is to show how many products in each category? How will the result be like, as opposed to Products.find(:all) which is an array of Product objects? As a more advanced operation, how about select count(*) from products p inner join category c on p.categoryID = c.ID group by categoryID and select average(price) from products p inner join category c on p.categoryID = c.ID group by categoryID ?
