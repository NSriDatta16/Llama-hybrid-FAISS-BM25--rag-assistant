When you want to do something like logistic regression but with $3+$ outcome categories instead of two, the $y$ is multinomial instead of binomial. Consequently, the analogous model is multinomial logistic regression, sometimes called polytomous logistic regression or softmax regression. In R , this can be performed by using multinom in the nnet package.
