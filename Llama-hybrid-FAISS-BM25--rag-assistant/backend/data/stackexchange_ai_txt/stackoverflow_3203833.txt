The return false in mousedown prevents the mouse button press from having its default action, which is to focus the child . You could test event.target in the mousedown function to see if it's the element, and if so just stop trying to handle it ( return or return true straight away). If you wanted to still allow the element to be dragged when the mouse is in the , you could still return false but manually call focus() on the input in mousedown . The disadvantage of that would be that the user couldn't use drags to select part of the text, as inputs would normally allow.
