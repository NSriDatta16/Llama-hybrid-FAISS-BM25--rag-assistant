The differences between BNF and JSGF in NLP?

I wonder what the differences are between the BNF (Backus-Naur Form) and JSGF (Java Speech Grammar Format)? The former is a kind of context-free grammar taught in CS224 , but I learned that the latter is also being used. Could anyone tell me which one is better and what are their differences?
