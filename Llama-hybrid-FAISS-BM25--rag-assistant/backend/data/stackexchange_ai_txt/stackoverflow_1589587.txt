Take this with a pinch of salt: B-tree when you're managing more than thousands of items and you're paging them from a disk or some slow storage medium. RB tree when you're doing fairly frequent inserts, deletes and retrievals on the tree. AVL tree when your inserts and deletes are infrequent relative to your retrievals.
