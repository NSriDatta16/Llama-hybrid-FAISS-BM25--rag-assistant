Ok, beside the problem of implementing the actual check (in my opinion this is very similar to a path coverage and thus not practical) - here is the way to write a new FxCop rule it: At first some articles that helped me once: Writing Your Own Custom Rules Three Vital FXCop Rules Implementing a simple rule is no big deal. In your project you need a Rules.xml file as an embedded resource (see here ). You derive your class from BaseIntrospectionRule and add your code to the Check()-method: public override ProblemCollection Check( TypeNode typeNode ) { if( type.IsPublic ) { Problems.Add( new Problem( ... ) ); } return Problems; } I did this some times ago. I hope it still works as described :)
