PropertyGrid - Dynamically changing ReadOnlyAttribute

Sigh, another PropertyGrid question. I thought I could get around this until I ran into a problem where I couldn't actually avoid it. I have a boolean property that sometimes needs to be read-only and sometimes needs to be changeable depending on the object selected from a TreeView. My question is how can I change the ReadOnlyAttribute of a property dynamically? Obviously, creating a boolean variable and then trying to set it like ReadOnlyAttribute(boolVar) doesn't work and now I'm out of ideas. The only solution I can think of is creating separate, near-identical classes for items where this property is writable and one for read-only, but this seems a bit unelegant to me. Help? :)
