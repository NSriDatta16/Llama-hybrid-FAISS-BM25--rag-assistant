The role of the constant is to force the mean of the errors to be 0. In your program the mean of the error term is 0 in your population, but the variance is very high, so it will deviate a lot from 0 in many of your samples. This means that in each sample the constant can deviate a lot from the population value. So much so that a 1000 replications is not enough to find that on average you will get the right constant. Try and increase the number of replications to say 10,000 or 100,000 and see what happens. Update As promised I tried to replicate HÃ©ctor's results, but I gues I did something wrong the first time I tried, as I can't reproduce it anymore. Maybe I set the residual standard deviation at 1000 instead of 100, maybe I tried 100 replications instead of a 1000, or some silly typo like that. Anyhow here is my simulation with a 1000 replications in Stata, and a constant that is close enough to 10 given the spread. . set seed 123456 . clear all . program define sim 1. drop _all 2. set obs 100 3. gen x1 = runiform()
