Discrepancy in probability calculations in paper 'Multi-digit Number Recognition...'

In the paper, ' Goodfellow, I., et al. Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. ICLR, 2014 ', on page 10 there is a table which calculate $\log(P(S|H))$ given $\log(P(s_1,s_2,...,s_l))$ and $\log(P(l))$. From the equation given in page 4 it should be $$\log(P(S|H)) = \log(P(s_1,s_2,...,s_l)) + \log(P(l))$$ but if you see from the first two lines in the lower table it is: $$\log(P(S|H)) = 10\cdot\log(P(s_1,s_2,...,s_l)) + \log(P(l))$$ and on third line it is correctly specified as: $$\log(P(S|H)) = \log(P(s_1,s_2,...,s_l)) + \log(P(l))$$ Did I miss anything?? Here is the table of probability (idealized) predicted by the model:
