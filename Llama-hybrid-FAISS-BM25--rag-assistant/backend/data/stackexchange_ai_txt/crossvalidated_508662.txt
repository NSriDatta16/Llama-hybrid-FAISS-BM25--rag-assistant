Using a Panel Regression to Explain Aggregate Effects/Interpreting the "size" of panel regression coefficients

Suppose I've estimated a two way fixed effects regression using unit level panel data: $$ y_{it} = \beta_1x_{it} +\beta_2x_{it}H_{it} + \beta_3H_{it} + a_i + \gamma_{t}+\epsilon_{it} $$ with $(a_i, \gamma_{t})$ being the usual two way fixed effects and $y_{it}$ being some unit level outcome e.g. individual wages. How can I relate $H_t$ to overall changes in $y_t$ . I know that in each of the T cross-section regression(s) of: $$ t=1,...T;\; y_{it} = \delta_0 + \delta_1x_{it} +\epsilon_{it} $$ that $\delta_{T} \neq \delta_{T-1} \neq \delta_{T-2} $ and so on. Is there a way to evaluate the contribution of the average trend in $H_{t}$ over the whole period to the changing sizes of $\delta$ . I have in mind a very specific application where say, $\delta$ is a the impact of having a college degree versus no college degree and $H_{it}$ might be any continuous unit-specific policy variable i.e. local AFDC levels, job openings, pollution. The overall goal is to decompose $\delta_t$ at the aggregate level into a component explained by changes in $H_t$ and a component that isn't and estimate the overall contribution of $H_t$ to $\delta_t$ using individual level panel data. I've heard that this is related to the "missing intercept" problem for difference-in-difference designs but haven't been able to find much.
