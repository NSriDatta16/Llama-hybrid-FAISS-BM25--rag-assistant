How to quickly retrieve only a subset of a Set in Redis

I have need to store an unordered set of items in a manner that allows for fast Insert Membership testing (and/or intersection) Random subset retrieval Redis seems like a great candidate for this kind of storage, but as I read the docs, there's not one data type that fits this perfectly. Having a SUBSET command for the Set type would be perfect. What's the best way to store and query this kind of data structure?
