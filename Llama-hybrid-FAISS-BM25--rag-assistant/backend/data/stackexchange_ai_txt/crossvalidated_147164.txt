Fit and evaluate a second order transition matrix (Markov Process) in R?

I already built 1 first order discrete state Markov Chain model. It was built with R using the function 'markovchainFit()' in 'markovchain' package. dat Now I am going to build a second order Markov Chain model. I am not sure how to find the transition matrix, and if the second order Markov Chain model is better than the first order MC model? How to evaluate the them? Should I choose the first order model or second order model? Is there any standard or test for doing this? Thank you!
