If you are talking about CPU intensive, its quite relative term, however .NET is not but ASP.NET is very much. Web Apps doing thousands of postbacks and recreating/destroying controls on every request is quite expensive. Think of it this way, in pure ASP.NET (non ajax ones, the old ones) calculate visibility/color.. all attributes of every element of html page for 1000s of users only on server and distribute them to clients. Not only that badly written ASP.NET Server Controls eat up more CPU as they do too much calculations. To improve ASP.NET performance, more AJAX should be used or RIA like Flex/Silverlight will drastically reduce CPU overhead because you can use client's CPU to do your Data Visualization. RIA Client (Flex/Silverlight) + ASP.NET Web Services is the future, I dont have detailed statistics to share but we moved away from ASP.NET almost a year back and our CPU usage has been reduced to 18% average from 99% before RIA based web sites.
