Joomla - Determining whether logged-in user is an Admin

I am having tons of fun working on a big project that was, for reasons hard to justify, based on Joomla! (which I don't mean to criticise, Joomla! is great, just not for the task I am faced with currently) and when I googled for a way of determining whether the currently logged-in user is an Admin, I found a post that quite boldly recommends using the following code: $user =& JFactory::getUser(); if($user->usertype == "Super Administrator" || $user->usertype == "Administrator"){ ... } To me, this looks like a rather strange way of checking for Admin users. I would appreciate a $user->isAdmin() method to do this rather than a couple of hard-coded strings. I fail to find a more elegant solution to checking for admin users within the Joomla! framework. Can anyone help?
