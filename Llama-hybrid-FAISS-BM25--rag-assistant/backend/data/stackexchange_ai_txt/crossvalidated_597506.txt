Should I expect changes in my predicted probabilities when increasing the number of categories I am predicting membership in?

I calculated the predicted probability of membership in group A and not A with binary logistic regression. Then I broke the not A category into two distinct buckets of which it is comprised - B , C. I then used multinomial logistic regression to calculate the predicted probabilities of membership in A, B, C. These two different predictions showed some variation in my probabilities. Category Binary Log.Prob Revised Categories Multinomial Log. Prob A 74% A (same as orig) 67% Not A 26% B (B + C = not A) 12% C 21% For example the estimate of A changed from 74% to 67% and the not A estimation changed from 26% to 33% (B + C). Is this expected? And what might account for these differences?
