Such a graph combining accuracy versus its variance is interesting, when the perturbation (variance) in the data is known. It seems that you are building classifiers. You can vary many factors in this process: Varying the subset of feature variables used, Varying the model complexity The graph will then show different combinations of a so-called bias-variance tradeoff . A more complex model, with more parameters, can model the underlying data mechanism more precisely. But the model variance increases too, thereby making the risk of overfitting larger. You need to have a well-formed expression for this perturbation/variance, which is derived for a number of statistical classifiers: linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant and logistic regression. For most other types of classifiers you will need to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to provide estimates of the variance of the accuracy.
