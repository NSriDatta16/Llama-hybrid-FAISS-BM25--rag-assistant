I don't have enough reputation to comment, thus writing this as an answer. Do you have an access to the datasets used during training of neural networks? Or at least some labeled dataset? If so, you can train a separate model that weights the predictions of existing models. The goal of this new Meta model would be to predict correct class given soft-max values of the existing models as an input.
