How do I configure JUnit Ant task to only produce output on failures?

I am configuring JUnit in Ant so that unit tests will be run on each build. I would like the output of failing tests to be printed in the Ant console output whenever they are run. I don't need to see any output from succeeding tests. Here is the relevant bit of my build.xml file: This produces almost what I want, failing tests are detailed in the Ant output, except that succeeding tests also write the following output: [junit] Testsuite: my.tree.junit.ExampleTest [junit] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.002 sec I believe I have tried all the combinations listed in the JUnit task documentation, including: printsummary attribute showoutput attribute formatter element with each kind of type My use case is running ant from the command line. As I write more tests, I don't want the output from succeeding tests to be so large that output from failing tests scrolls off the screen. I just want ant to be quiet unless there's a failing test that needs my attention. How can I configure Ant/JUnit to do this? I am using Ant version 1.6.4 and JUnit 4.6.
