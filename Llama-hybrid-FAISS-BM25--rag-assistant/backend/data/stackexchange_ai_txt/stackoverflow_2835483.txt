You can use Access databases as well. They let you form your own queries by dragging and dropping in Access 2010. However, if you are looking for easy to access data without the worries of SQL syntax, you might want to look at using Ruby ActionViews. If you are talking about live editing of the entire database if the database is of any importance (you can easily delete or clear an entire database on accident), I would do it in pure SQL, or better yet, not do this at all. If you are using MySQL, you should look at the possibility of using phpmyadmin for maintaining your database. It is a web based tool that makes database administration easy and can help you form your queries.
