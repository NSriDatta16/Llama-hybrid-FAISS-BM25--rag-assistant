Tools for Ruby on Rails projects in Perforce

we are using Perforce for source configuration management and I have just started to hack some small stuff in Ruby on Rails. As Perforce follows the "check-out before modify" paradigm, and RoR expects to have all files writable for the various script/ stuff, do you know/use any helpers to make RoR work together with Perforce? I know I could just open all files for edit all the time, but is there something more elegant? Thanks, Henrik
