As far as I know correct definition of pointcut should looks like this @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.company..*(..))", throwing = "exception") public void logException(Throwable exception) { System.out.println(exception.getMessage()); } Please pay attention that throwing should contain name of parameter you're binding in the method itself ( exception in this case). While I don't see how it relates to exception you're getting this might be the root cause.
