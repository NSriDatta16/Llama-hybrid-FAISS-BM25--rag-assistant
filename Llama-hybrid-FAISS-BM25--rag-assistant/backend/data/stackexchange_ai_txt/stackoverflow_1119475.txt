const_cast can only change the constness of a type. If you want to call the implicit operator you have you need a static_cast and then a const_cast . While it's annoying it makes sure you are explicit in what you are doing. myPtr = const_cast (static_cast (obj)); You can also use the old school c-style cast operator myPtr = (int*)(const int*)obj; But this is highly discouraged for several reasons: It isn't grepable You can very easily do more than you intended. Most of the time you don't want to mess with const_cast type operations and using static_cast enforces this. In fact you very rarely want a const_cast . If you find yourself doing it regularly you have some design mistakes. Edit: I was slightly off, I fixed it now. It makes the c-style cast a little uglier
