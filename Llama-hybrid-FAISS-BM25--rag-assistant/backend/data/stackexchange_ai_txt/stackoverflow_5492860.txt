I believe the code from Chromium just wraps things into a nice shell. But you can get the same effect without using the Chromium wrapper container. Because the allocator object gets copied so often, it needs to hold a reference or pointer to the memory. So what you'd need to do is create the storage buffer, create the allocator object, then call the std::string constructor with the allocator. It will be a lot wordier than using the wrapper class but should get the same effect. You can see an example of the verbose method (still using the chromium stuff) in my question about stack vectors .
