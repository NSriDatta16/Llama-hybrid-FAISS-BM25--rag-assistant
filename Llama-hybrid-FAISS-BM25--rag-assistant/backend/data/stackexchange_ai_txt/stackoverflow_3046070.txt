app engine modify xml

I am writing a GWT app running on App Engine, which needs to modify a XML File serverside. As far as I know there is no way to modify a XML file in the WAR directory or any subdirectories. What other possibilities do I have to store that data? Can I use the Data Store somehow or should I look for storage space somewhere else and access it there (if so any recommendations?)? Any help is appreciated!
