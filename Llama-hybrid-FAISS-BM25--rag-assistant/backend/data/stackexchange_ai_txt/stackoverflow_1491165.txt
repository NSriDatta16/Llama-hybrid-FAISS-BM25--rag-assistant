The problem happens because your dependency declarations declare a minimum version to be used, so on Ganymede the requirements aren't met and your plugin is not loaded. If the plugin is compatible with Ganymede, specify the dependency versions as such, e.g. org.eclipse.ui;bundle-version="3.4.2" And you'll be able to use the plugin on both platforms (and future versions too). I would use this approach. Note, you can also set dependencies as version ranges if you want to include a specific range of versions you support. For example: [3.0.0, 4.0.0) Will allow any version from 3.0.0 inclusive to 4.0.0 exclusive (i.e. any 3.x version) As Eclipse 4 comes into the reckoning, this may be an issue for you to consider. Whatever you do, don't include the 3.5 plugins in your distribution, it will cause all kinds of problems for Ganymede users as other plugins may not work correctly with them
