Have you tried using http instead of https? http://test-server.local/svn/test/Websites/test.com/trunk After comment: Try this : Do a local svn checkout on the build agent, you will probably get the same error and be able to proceed after you permenantly accept the certificate. Then you should be able to use from ccnet as well. Make sure the account which you are logged on when manually doing it and the account ccnet is running are same. http://danhounshell.com/blog/subversion-error-certificate-verification-failed-with-cruisecontrol-net/
