Using GNU gettext you get support for placeholders like with printf and international plural forms. Placeholders order can be changed in translation or skipped. Example from PHP documentation: Another pro is that you can use standard tools for terminology management, translations memory and machine translation as pointed by @middus. For shared environments there is a great php-gettext library from Danilo Segan.
