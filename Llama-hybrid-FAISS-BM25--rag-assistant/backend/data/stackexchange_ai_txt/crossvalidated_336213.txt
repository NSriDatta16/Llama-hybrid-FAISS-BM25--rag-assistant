Which algorithm to use for clustering word occurences?

I'd like to know whether the occurence of certain keywords in a long document is representative or is it limited to a few paragraphs and the primary topic of the document is something different. I think this can be verified by clustering the locations of the keyword matches in the document. We can use a word index for that: for example the 15th or the 56th word of the document. If we have a few small clusters compared to the size of the whole document, then the primary topic of the document is probably something unrelated. If we have many small clusters or a few really big clusters, then we can assume that the whole document is about the keywords. I am not that educated in statistics, I just learned k-means and I know there are many other algorithms for clustering. I'd like to know from an expert, what do you think, for this kind of data what are the best algorithms?
