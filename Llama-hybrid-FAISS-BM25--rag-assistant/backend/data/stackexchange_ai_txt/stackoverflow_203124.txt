Yes, but that would strictly be for the purposes of unit testing: You could abstract your CSV reader implementation from any particular StreamReader by defining an abstract stream reader interface and testing your own implementation with a mock stream reader that implements that interface. Your mock reader would obviously be immune to errors like non-existent files, permission problems, OS differences etc. You would therefore entirely be testing your own code and can achieve 100% code coverage.
