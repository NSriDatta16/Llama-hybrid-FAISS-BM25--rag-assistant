JQuery finding an element within Iframe (by its text) and adding .click function to it

I have a webpage (A) and I am embedding (A) to my mainpage (B) using iframe. This (A) contains a link which closes the browser window: Close The Page Since I embedd (A), the close ability in (A) is no more functional. What I need to do is, when this link is clicked from (B), I want to hide my iframe, in other words make it look like closing. So I have to reach that link in the iframe and understand if it is clicked or not (B)? Help please. Thanks
