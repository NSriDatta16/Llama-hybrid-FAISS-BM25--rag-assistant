What is unclear from various papers is the details of facilitating such a model which does not represent explicitly the temporal dependencies when the data is produced with different temporal features. GMM is simplistic model of speech, it does not account for temporal dependencies indeed. There are more advanced ones like GMM-HMM or LSTM neural networks. Questions such as 'what if the class source changes the rate of signal production?' It might harm or might not, depends on the change. or a question 'does the methodology examine only the latest temporal component (block/window)?' It depends on how you apply it. You can apply it to a window or to the whole audio. So that if $\mathbf{\mu}_i \in \mathbb{R}^\tau$ , the signal data $D$ being examined is $D_{T-\tau,\ldots,T}$ ? It usually considers the whole audio and just matches the components inside.
