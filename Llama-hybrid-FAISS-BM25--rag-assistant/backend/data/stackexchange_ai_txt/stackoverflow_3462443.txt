There is no universal model, but what you're looking for is essentially a templating solution - a template language plus a template evaluation engine that transforms a template into final XML by executing the code embedded in the template. So, you can take, for a model, ANY templating language you're familiar with. The very best approach is of course to leverage an existing templating engine solution if you have access to one; so you don't have to write one. E.g. JSP for Java, EmbPerl for Perl, XSLT etc... Here's what a sample EmbPerl template would look like: [$ foreach my $i (1..5) $] ./image[+$i+].png [$ endforeach $] A lot of templating solutions would look very similar, with slightly different markup and obviously different logic syntax (Perl vs. Java vs. xxx) If you go with homebrew solution, the templating language can of course be XML itself, something like ./image .png
