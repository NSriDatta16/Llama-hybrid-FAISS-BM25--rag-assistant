Average FPS throughout the length of an entire game doesn't seem to be a very useful statistic. Typically you will wish to measure peaks and valleys, such as highest fps / lowest fps and amount of frames spent below and above threshold values. In reality though, I would not worry. Even if you were to just use a 32 bit unsigned int, your game could run at 60fps for 19884 hours before it would overflow. You should be fine. EDIT: The best way to detect overflow in this case is to check and see if the integer decreased in value after being incremented. If so, you could just keep another counter around which is the number of times you have overflowed.
