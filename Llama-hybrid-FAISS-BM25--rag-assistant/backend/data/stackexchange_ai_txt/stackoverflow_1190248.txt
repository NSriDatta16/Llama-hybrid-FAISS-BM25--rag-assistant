As has been mentioned before, refactorings such as renames or moves will be automatically reflected in the test cases as long as you refactor using the Eclipse tooling and not by manually renaming for example. As for new methods, it's impossible to generate tests automatically. Of course there are some exceptions for auto-generated code where you control the generation and where you could generate test cases as well but for "normal" manual code the best you could do was to provide stubs (empty methods), and what's the use in that? A better approach is to track code coverage using a tool such as Cobertura or Emma , which happens to have a nice Eclipse plugin that allows you to see, inside your source code, what code is being covered by tests and which isn't. This then is your report of where you need more testing.
