How can you use a neural network to extract the needed information from social media ads?

How to solve the following problem using neural networks / and machine learning / artificial intelligence? Input data - is an ad from a channel or group of a social network. For example, this: A room for rent in a tqo-room apartment (preferably a married couple), the Verkhniye Likhobory metro station in a 3-minute walk. You can move in from September 21 The room is large, with a balvony, the apartment has everything. A family lives in another room. Details by p. 8922five682461. And I expect the following output result (as human can parse it instead of the artificial network): { address: "m. Verkhniye Likhobory", releaseDate: "2020-09-21", phone: "89225682461, isBalcony: true, roomsCountTotal: 2, roomsCountForRent: 1 } This is my whole question. And below are important notes to it - why exactly a neural network is needed here, and it is difficult to get by with algorithms and other simple means . There is no clear address in this ad, but the address itself is present - the Verkhniye Likhobory metro station. There were also mistakes in the ad: "tqo-room apartment" instead "two-room apartment", "with a balvony" instead of "with a balcony". Also, the ad used to bypass the prohibition of some groups to publish phone numbers: 8922five682461. And I think this ad is useful in terms of content, because it can lead to conversion, that is, monetization can be done with such data. This ad may be in demand, although a lot of data is lacking. It is necessary that the system be able to extract data from the text and distribute it among the fields of the structure - even when some of the data does not correspond to the standard.
