Why won't this HTML work?

I have a span text block inside a paragraph. Inside this span block I have two paragraph breaks. On webkit, the browser renders the first paragraph correctly but fails back to browser default settings on the last two. Why? span.post-content { font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } Some text here From here text loses style and adopts browser default same here This works in all browsers except Webkit based ones: chrome and safari.
