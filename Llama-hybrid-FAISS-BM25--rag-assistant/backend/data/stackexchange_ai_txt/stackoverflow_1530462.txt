Problem including dynamic image in Eclipse BIRT 2.5.0 report on Windows

I have a BIRT 2.5.0 report design with a dynamic image (URL is specified through report parameter, image formats tried - .png, .bmp). When running the report from our application on Ubuntu, everything renders OK. When doing exactly the same thing on Windows, there's following message instead of the actual image: Current report item is not supported in this report format. Same problem occurs when including image with a fixed URL - even though the image is displayed and loaded in the Report Designer, it's not rendered in report generated from our application. Again, this happens only on Windows. The only way I managed to get the image into a rendered report was through embedding it into the report design file, which is not suitable as the image has to be dynamic.
