Find repetitive patterns in matrices below

How can I identify the repetitive patterns from the matrices below? My problem is that the patterns in the matrix are different from matrix to matrix (dependent on the input data). I need some machine learning technique that detects these square like patterns at each position really accurately. Hence I believe that using a lowpass filter to reduce the noise in the pattern would be counter productive. I am pretty good in image processing, but here I am quite lost. Any suggestion is appreciated. The matrices below are different and display the variation in the patterns. Red is low values and white / blue are high values. I used the RdBu colormap for plotting.
