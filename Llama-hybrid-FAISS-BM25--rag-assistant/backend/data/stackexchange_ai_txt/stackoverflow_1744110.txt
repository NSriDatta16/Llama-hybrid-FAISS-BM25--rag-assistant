The most pedantic reason is that it's not required by the HTML4 specification (emphasis mine): This attribute specifies a comma-separated list of content types that a server processing this form will handle correctly. User agents may use this information to filter out non-conforming files when prompting a user to select files to be sent to the server. It's an optional feature. I would personally love to see this. When given image/* , for example, the browser could bring up the user's photo library as the default location and use large icons. text/* could go to the documents folder, etc. Mobile browsers, such as the iPhone, which typically don't allow file uploads at all, could use this to bring up the gallery when the form is expecting an image. We could get crazy and connect to the scanner if desired. The possibilities are endless. However, this feature is not in common use, and it could be terribly confusing for file upload dialogs to operate differently depending on what the web site supports.
