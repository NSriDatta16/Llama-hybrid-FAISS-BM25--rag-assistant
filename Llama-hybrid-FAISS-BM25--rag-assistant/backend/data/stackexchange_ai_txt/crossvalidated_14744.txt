Well, the answer depends upon exactly which algorithm you have in mind. I would take a look in Brian Ripley's 1996 book, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, page 116. Here is a (very simple) proof of the convergence of Rosenblatt's perceptron learning algorithm if that is the algorithm you have in mind. This is replicated as Exercise 4.6 in Elements of Statistical Learning. The algorithm presented on the Wikipedia page looks a little different from the algorithm in Ripley's book, but from what I can tell they are up to some initial normalizations doing the same. Please note that convergence means that for a linearly separable data set the algorithm reach a fixed point after a finite number of iterations, but the value of the fixed point depends upon the start value for the algorithm.
