php emailer link after submit button is clicked

How does one link to the submit button, I am thinking of embedding a or just using href or actually have the entire php emailer code embedded somehow inside the submit section? I can submit the information supplied by a user to a MySQL database and log it there; however, I was just wondering if there is a more elegant way to send email using the information saved in my database by the user after clicking on submit, or would I have to just script some php emailer and use the code below to link to it, so that when the user clicks submit, I have a copy on my database and the other copy is sent to my email in box? More code can be supplied as requested, thank you for not flaming the newb. Submit
