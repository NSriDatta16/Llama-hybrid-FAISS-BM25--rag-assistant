I agree that the term "model" is too vague and could refer to different degree of precision when describing a ML implementation. I think that there are at least three levels of descriptive precision of the term "model": top level - for classification that could be K-Means, SVM, NN, etc. middle level - for SVM that will refer to the different types of kernels; for NNs, that could be some combination of: convoluted, recursive, SLTM, etc. low level - will be the number and size of hidden layers and their specifics - sigmoid, ReLU, pooling, dropout. Further, there is the choice of gradient descent algorithm and meta parameters. Maybe some of these choices could be considered a part of the training process, rather than the choice of the model, but it's hard to define where one ends and the other begins. Even if we only consider the "top level" as "choice of the model", in the end, it still takes expertise and experimentation to get good results. Especially if ML is being applied to a new domain.
