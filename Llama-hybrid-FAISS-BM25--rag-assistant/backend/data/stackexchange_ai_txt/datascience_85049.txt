Is smoothing in NLP ngrams done on test data or train data?

Is smoothing in NLP ngram done on test data or train data? Since smoothing is to avoid the language model predicting 0 probability of unseen corpus (test). So I wonder is smoothing done on test data only? Or on train data only? Or both? I don't seem to find an answer to this yet.
