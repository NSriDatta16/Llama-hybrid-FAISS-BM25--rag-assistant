There is a difference between a well-evidenced effect and a strong effect. For example, there is good evidence that eating bacon causes cancer, but the risk is low; and there is weak evidence that smoking marijuana leaf causes cancer, but the risk is probably high. (The reason for the gap is that the bacon eaters are subject to more medical surveillance than ganja smokers.) So a useful statistical test of whether the correlation is well evidenced is not based on the correlation coefficient, but on the sample size. Another feature of the situation that matters is how much of the variation is explained by the correlation: this is the R-squared statistic, coefficient of determination.
