Can it be written an automatic 'code transformer'? =) No. str and unicode are two different types which have different purposes. You should not attempt to replace every occurrence of a byte string with a Unicode string, neither in Python 2 nor Python 3. Continue to use byte strings for binary data. In particular anything you're writing to a file or network socket is bytes. And use Unicode strings for user-facing text. In between there is a grey area of internal ASCII-character strings which could equally be bytes or Unicode. In Python 2 these are typically bytes, in Python 3 typically Unicode. In you are happy to limit your code to Python 2.6+, you can mark your definitely-bytes strings as b'' and bytes , your definitely-characters strings as u'' and unicode , and use '' and str for the “whatever the default type of string is” strings.
