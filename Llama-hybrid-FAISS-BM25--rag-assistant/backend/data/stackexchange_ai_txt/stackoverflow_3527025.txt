Until now if a program ran under any release of Java SE - Java 1.1, Java 1.2, Java 1.3, Java 1.4, Java 5, Java 6 - it runs under any later release too (except for unintentional bugs, but these has been very few). Sun has given this extreme attention, and it has meant that upgrading has been a non-issue. You just do it. With the advances achieved in the JVM this has also been highly desirable. Hence, unless you have very good reason not to, your users should use Java 6. The Sun Java 6 gives very good performance but at the cost of memory to do so. I have only worked with the "web application" part of Java EE, but here the Servlet API has been very stable and well supported. A given WAR file can be deployed on any web container, plus some configuration glue. This includes web containers much newer than the specification the web application was written against.
