You are right that logistic regression does not make any assumptions about the distribution of your independent variable. What will occur as a result of your situation is that you will have less power than if you had equal $n$s. However, reducing the $n$ in the Rich group will only lessen your power further. Rather, the idea is that if you had the same total $N$, but equally divided, you would have more power. Although written in a different context ( viz , t-tests), you can get the general idea from my answer here: How should one interpret the comparison of means from different sample sizes?
