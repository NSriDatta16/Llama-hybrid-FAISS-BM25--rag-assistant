One formulation of this model in terms of the back-shift operator $L$ is that $$\phi(L) X = \theta(L)\varepsilon$$ where $X$ is the time series process, $\varepsilon$ is the "white noise" process of innovations, and $\phi$ and $\theta$ are polynomials. When $X$ and $Y$ are two such processes, let $\delta$ be the innovations for $Y.$ Then because these polynomial functions of $L$ are linear operators, $$\phi(L)(X-Y) = \phi(L)X - \phi(L)Y = \theta(L)\varepsilon - \theta(L)\delta = \theta(L)(\varepsilon-\delta),$$ thereby exhibiting the difference $\varepsilon - \delta$ as the innovations for $X-Y$ and explicitly showing $X-Y$ is an AR process with the same parameters as both $X$ and $Y.$ Notice that since $\operatorname{Var}(\varepsilon_t - \delta_t) = \operatorname{Var}(\varepsilon_t) + \operatorname{Var}(\delta_t)$ at any time $t,$ the scale of $X-Y$ is greater than the scales of either $X$ or $Y.$ Of course this distinction will not be revealed in the autocorrelation function (ACF) plot, but it will show up in plots of autocovariance.
