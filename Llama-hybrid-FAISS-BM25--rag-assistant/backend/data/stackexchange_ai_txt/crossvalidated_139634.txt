Spectral density estimation for limited data

We need an idea of the frequencies in the time series shown. What can we expect from nonparametric spectrum estimation? Observing that much power is in frequency 4 years, of which we have only one period. May we improve the result by proper window design, and what recommendations then? We have modeled the logseries with an AR1 process. Far from perfect fit, but it serves some practical risk management purposes. How would you decide between nonparametric spectrum estimation or using the model's spectrum? We are doing our research on spectral methods, but hope for some advice from practitioners. Given the limited data, how best go about obtaining important frequencies?
