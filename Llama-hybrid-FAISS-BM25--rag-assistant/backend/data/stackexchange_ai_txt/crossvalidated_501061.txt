Does it ever make sense to average the median, mean, and mode?

Consider four subjects (A,B,C,D) competing 12 times in a game with 5 possible scores (5,6,7,8,9): A) Median: 7 Mean: 6.92 Mode: 5 5:##### avgL||avgR 6: 6.9||8.5 (+3.2) 7:## 555557789999 8:# ^^ 9:#### B) Median: 7 Mean: 7.08 Mode: 7 5:# avgL||avgR 6:### 6.2||8.0 (+1.8) 7:#### 566677778899 8:## 9:## C) Median: 7 Mean: 7.00 Mode: 7 5: avgL||avgR 6: 7.0||7.0 (Â±0.0) 7:############ 777777777777 8: 9: D) Median: 7 Mean: 6.83 Mode: 7 5:## avgL||avgR 6:## 6.0||7.7 (+1.7) 7:###### 556677777799 8: 9:## In this case: Who won? Going by the median, they're all equal A has the lowest mean and the lowest mode, but the highest average right half of the scores B has the second-highest mean and the most normal distribution C has the most consistent score D has the highest mean, but the second-lowest skew toward the higher scores Would it make sense to average out or otherwise combine a few metrics?
