Which hypothesis test should I use?

I'm doing a personal project and would like to see if High Caloric Food has a statistical significance on Weight Level. I've tried Chi Squared Contingency test as suggested by chatgpt but it gives a p-value of 1 which fails to reject null hypothesis that there is no association between High Caloric Food and Weight Level. Visually I can see that High Caloric Food does increase the Obesity Count. What test should I use in this scenario? Code: weight_order = ['Normal_Weight', 'Overweight_Level_II', 'Insufficient_Weight', 'Overweight_Level_I', 'Obesity_Type_I', 'Obesity_Type_II', 'Obesity_Type_III'] df[['High Caloric Food Freq', 'Weight Level']].groupby('High Caloric Food Freq').value_counts(normalize=True).reindex(weight_order, level=1).unstack() I've normalized the data since the 'yes' to High Caloric Food count is almost 3x greater than 'no'. Here is what the table looks like: Edit: sorry for the confusion. The numbers represent the proportion of each weight level that answered 'no' or 'yes' to frequent High Calorie food consumption. For example, 32.24% who have answered 'no' to frequent high calorie consumption have a normal weight.
