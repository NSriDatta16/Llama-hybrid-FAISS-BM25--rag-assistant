You force a new address space by making all variables local (i.e. by giving them automatic storage duration). That's the whole purpose of automatic variables - each call gets its own independent set of local variables. By declaring your variable static you are moving in opposite direction - you are explicitly requesting the compiler to use the same variable in each call. So, decide what it is you are trying to do and then do it. If you can't modify the variable and/or function declarations, then you are out of luck. It can't be done.
