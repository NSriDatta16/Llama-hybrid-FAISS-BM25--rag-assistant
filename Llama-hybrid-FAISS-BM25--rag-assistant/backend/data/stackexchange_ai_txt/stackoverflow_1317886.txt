External exception C0000006

I've wrote some program in Delphi and when I am running it from a disk on key. At some point I'm required to unplug the disk on key while the application is running. If I do this on a computer with at least 1gb of ram everything is okay. When I do this on a machine with 512mb I get an external exception C0000006. If I'm not mistaken, this is because the OS is trying to read the next line of code but cannot find the resource for it (meaning, the application wasn't loaded to the ram) which is absurd because it's a 500kb application. How can I solve this? or at least handle this exception in a more elegant way? (Since I can't catch it since it's an external exception). Oh, and my Delphi application is a console application under windows xp.
