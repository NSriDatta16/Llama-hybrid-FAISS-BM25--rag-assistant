I created a set of CMakeLists.txt for protobufs for embedding into our build systems, and offered to contribute these to protobufs, but the people at Google weren't interested. If you'd like, I can provide them "as-is". They work for 2.2.0, but you will probably have to do some hacking on your own to tweak them for your specific build system.
