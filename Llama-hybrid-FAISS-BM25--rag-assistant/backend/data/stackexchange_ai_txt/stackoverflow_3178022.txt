Callbacks / Events in C#

Iv'e pretty new to C# ATM and I seem to be having trouble with Jabber-Net Im trying to create a basic chat application that will connect users via Jaber Services, the issues im having are with the Callbacks. The main error I seem to get is about the "Event required but used like 'type'", or something along those lines.. Im at work atm so i cant give you full details but it seems to be when i try adding callbacks.. For example: JabberClient Jabber = new JabberCLient(); Jabbaer.OnConnect += new jabber.connection.XmppStream.OnConnect(Some_event_function); Now this code was just of the top of my head and may be wrong, i work by fixing errors as I'm learning but I get an error that basically telling me that what im doing should be done as an event but im using as a type Can anybody shed some light on the matter please.
