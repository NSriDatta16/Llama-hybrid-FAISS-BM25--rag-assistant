How can I degrade from Jquery carousel to css scrolling list gracefully

update I added these two lines to the script below: I ran the debugger and the execution appears to be removing the attributes, but the webpage continues to show the scroll bar. $("#newsticker-demo").removeAttr("overflow-y"); $("#newsticker-demo").removeAttr("height"); $(function () { $(".newsticker-jcarousellite").jCarouselLite({ vertical: true, visible: 1, auto: 1, speed: 8000, circular: true }); $("#newsticker-demo").removeAttr("overflow-y"); $("#newsticker-demo").removeAttr("height"); }); -- IN IE8 is my number 1 concern right now -- Hello, On our homepage there is a vertical scrolling carousel. What I want to do is have it gracefully fail to use only css if javascript is turned off. So that the result is text with a vertical scroll bar the user can click and drag to move through the list. Similar to what you mind find on a textarea element, that has too much data to display at once. link to homepage. http://beta.sc-pa.com/home/pasite-home.asp Once this is done.
