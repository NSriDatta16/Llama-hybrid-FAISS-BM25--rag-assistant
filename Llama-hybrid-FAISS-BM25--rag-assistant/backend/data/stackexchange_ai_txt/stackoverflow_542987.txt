Invoking built-in operators indirectly in Python

Let's say you have a small calculator program that takes numbers and an operator to perform on those numbers as input, then prints out the result of applying the specified operation. So if you input "4 + 5" it will print out "9". Simple, right? Well what I want to be able to write is something this: a, op, b = raw_input().split() print somehowInvokeOperator(op, a, b) The problem is that "somehowInvokeOperator()" part. Is there anyway to do this without resorting to either (a) eval() or (b) some type of dictionary mapping keys like "+" and "-" to functions that perform the appropriate operation? getattr() doesn't appear to work for this. I don't really need this code for anything, I'm just curious to see if this can be solved in Python as elegantly as it can in other dynamic languages.
