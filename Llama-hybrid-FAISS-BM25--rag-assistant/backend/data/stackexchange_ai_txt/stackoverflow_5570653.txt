I don't think there is a way, without first playing content. But... you could sequentially bitmapdata.draw each frame as a streamed video (not necessarily in the display list) plays, until you have one large array of bitmaps to navigate through. There's two big problems with this: One, obviously, is that you would only have access to the frames that have already played. This might be dealt with by whatever else is happening in your app - say a user is interacting with some introduction content while the video is streaming/being captured. The other, maybe insurmountable, problem is with memory. The reason you stream content is so that you don't have all 24 megs (or whatver) of the flv in memory at all time. This type of scenario would mean that you would have to. That being said, depending on the size / number of frames - this may not be such a big issue. Frankly, if you decide to go this route, you'd be better breaking the video into frames outside of flash (in after effects or premier), and embedding them with the swf (or loading them individually). It would mean you would have better control over compression, at any rate. Maybe that helps ?
