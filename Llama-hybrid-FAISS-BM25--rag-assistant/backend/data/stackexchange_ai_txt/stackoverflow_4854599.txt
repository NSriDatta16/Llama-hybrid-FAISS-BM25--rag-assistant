How much extra memory does garbage collection require?

I heard once that for a language to implement and run garbage collection correctly there is on average of 3x more memory required. I am not sure if this is assuming the application is small, large or either. So i wanted to know if theres any research or actually numbers of garbage collection overhead. Also i want to say GC is a very nice feature.
