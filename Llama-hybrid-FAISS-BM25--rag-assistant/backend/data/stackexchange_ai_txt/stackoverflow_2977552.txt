How to stop propagation of a bound function not the entire event?

I have a click function bound to many elements. It is possible that sometimes these elements may sit within one another. So, the click event is bound to a child and also bound to its parent. The method is specific to the element clicked. Naturally, because of event bubbling, the child's event is fired first, and then the parents. I cannot have them both called at the same time because the parents event overwrites the event of the child. So I could use event.stopPropagation() so only the first element clicked receives the event. The problem is that there are other click events also attached to the element, for example, I am using jQuery's draggable on these elements. If I stop the propagation of the click event, then draggable doesn't work, and the following click events are not called. So my question is: Is there a way to stop the event bubbling of the method the event will call and not the entire event? Brilliant John, but here is the problem: Click event is bound to #Elm1 and #Elm2 . The .Elmchildren are width and height 100%. So they are actually the current targets.
