How do I implement a customized list in Cocoa?

I want to build a Cocoa App with a list of entries very similar to the ToDo list of Things.app ( see the screencast ). The question is whether I should use a TableView, a CollectionView or a WebView. I think it could work with all of them, but which one suits the following requirements best? have a list of entries -> 1 column & many rows reordering with drag & drop select single entries & use keys for actions like delete open up an entry: the row should expand to show more input fields customized look: rounded corners, shadow, background gradient So far my research says that the TableView has most of the functionality, but is harder to customize in its appearance, the CollectionView doesn't have drag & drop (right?) but is easy to design and the WebView would take much effort to not hurt the user experience and I can't bind my model directly to input fields. What pros and cons am I missing and what would you recommend to use?
