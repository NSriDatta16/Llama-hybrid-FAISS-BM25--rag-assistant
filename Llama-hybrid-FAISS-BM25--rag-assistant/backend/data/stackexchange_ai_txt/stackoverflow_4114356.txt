xslt with xpath that get some information from xml file doesn't work in JavaScript

I've got an xml file. It is meant for being transformed by xslt processor. The specific template is ready, however it use some information from two additional xml files. All information is used to produce the proper output. It works fine when I open the main xml file with my browser. The problem is: the result is just a fragment of website, it is an HTML element ready for being appended as a child. That is why I want to transform the xml with the xslt processor within a JavaScript function. Unfortunatelly, the result is half-way done. All what don't need the additional information from these two xml files imported by xpath expression is transformed well. The rest is shortly speaking absent. JavaScript: var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest() var xsltProcessor = new XSLTProcessor() xhttp.open("GET", "contentTemplate.xsl", false) xhttp.send() xsltProcessor.importStylesheet(xhttp.responseXML) function buildElement(what) { var xmlDoc = document.implementation.createDocument("", "root", null) xmlDoc.documentElement.appendChild(xmlDoc.createElement(what)) var resultDocumentFragment = xsltProcessor.transformToFragment(xmlDoc, document) return resultDocumentFragment } xslt: there is lots of stuff, I paste just the xslt with xpath expression and that is just absent. Just like no information was delivered. EDIT: it works in firefox, doesn't in chrome. I need to improve it. Actually, I don't know how.
