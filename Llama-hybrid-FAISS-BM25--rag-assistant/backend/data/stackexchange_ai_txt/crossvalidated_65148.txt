For the random variables $X_1,...,X_n$ with the joint density $f(X_1,...,X_n|\theta)$ the likelihood function $L(\theta) = f(x_1,...,x_n|\theta)$ gives the conditional probability of the observed realizations $X_1 = x_1,...,X_n=x_n$ for a given parameter $\theta$. Note that the likelihood function is not a probability density function and thus usually does not integrate to one. The likelihood function is frequently used in both Bayesian and frequentist analyses. For instance, the maximum likelihood estimator is obtained by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function.
