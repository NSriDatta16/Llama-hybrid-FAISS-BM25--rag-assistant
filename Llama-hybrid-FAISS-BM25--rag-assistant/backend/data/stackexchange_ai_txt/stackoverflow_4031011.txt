Cache-control in IIS6 not working

I'm using IIS 6 and added Cache-Control: no-cache header in IIS management console for entire website. However, when inspecting returned content with fiddler, I still see that Cache-Control: private is sent back to browser along with the response. No Cache-control: no-cache is sent though... Any ideas why? On the other hand, when I used EndRequest method in Global.asax and set: protected void Application_EndRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) { HttpContext.Current.Response.CacheControl = "no-cache"; } I saw following headers in HTTP response: Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Expires: -1 But I have a great deal of applications and would like to set the no-cache in one place, like IIS. Thanks, Pawel
