Fitting density through regression model

I found in a paper a way to fit a density through a regression model, and i wanted to know if you have some other referenes that uses it, or maybe the source of this idea. Here it goes : Suppose that we have $i.i.d$ samples of a $d$ -dimensional random vector $x_1,...,x_n$ coming from an unknown density $f$ that we want to estimate, on a given support, say $[0,1]^d$ . Construct $x_{n+1},...,x_{2n}$ from another candidate density $f_{sim}$ (for exemple uniform on the support). Let $y_1,...y_n$ be all equal to $1$ and $y_{n+1},...,y_{2n}$ be all equal to $0$ . Use a regression algorithm to fit $y = g(x) + \epsilon$ with a given error $\epsilon$ , for exemple with a $RMSE$ loss. Then, consider a given region $\mathcal{R}$ of the support. We have that the number of (true) points on this region is $n \int\limits_{\mathcal{R}} f(x)dx$ and that the number of simulated points on this region is $n \int\limits_{\mathcal{R}} f_{sim}(x)dx$ . If the region $\mathcal{R}$ become small enough, say a ball around a point $p$ with diminishing radius, this integral becomes approximately equal to $f(p)$ and $f_{sim}(p)$ . Finaly, since $Y$ is one for points from the true model and zero for points from the simulated data, $$\mathbb{E}(Y | X \in \mathcal{R}) = \frac{n \int\limits_{\mathcal{R}} f(x)dx}{n \int\limits_{\mathcal{R}} f(x)dx+n \int\limits_{\mathcal{R}} f_{sim}(x)dx}$$ and hence at the limit, $$g(p) = \frac{f(p)}{f(p)+f_{sim}(p)}$$ and we finaly have that : $$f(p) = f_{sim}(p) \frac{g(p)}{1 - g(p)}$$ Hence, we estimated the density through a regression model. This thing is quite general as it allows to use any regression algorythm to fit a density. Therefore, i'm looking for a reference on it. Also, if it's wrong, tell me :) Thanks, PS : The paper i'm refering to : @article{article, author = {Colla, Valentina and Vannucci, Marco and Reyneri, L.M.}, year = {2014}, month = {10}, pages = {}, title = {Artificial Neural Networks Applied for Estimating a Probability Density Function}, volume = {19}, journal = {Intelligent Data Analysis}, doi = {10.3233/IDA-140694} }
