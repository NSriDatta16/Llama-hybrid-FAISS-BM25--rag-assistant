I assume this question will be helpful Can support vector machine be used in large data? Specifically, using SVM with large amount (does not need to be large, even 100K will make it stop working) of data is almost infeasible, because of the size of the kernel matrix. The next question will be why SVM or can you get a good representative sample from the large amount of data to use SVM.
