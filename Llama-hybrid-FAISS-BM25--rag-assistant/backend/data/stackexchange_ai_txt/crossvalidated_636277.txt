If you're doing financial audits, there is some research that Stratified SRS does a better job hitting the nominal confidence levels you're shooting for: http://www.asasrms.org/Proceedings/y2002/Files/JSM2002-000704.pdf In general, SRS gives you an equal chance of hitting all transactions, low and high, which is a nice property if you think there is risk spread evenly across the population. PPS can be a good way to make sure you get "coverage" of high dollar items, which is not a statistical consideration necessarily, but is sometimes a leadership consideration. The issue of non-equal chance of selection, especially low chances for small dollar items, could be an issue since large dollar items often received better oversight than smaller transactions, so you might be unintentionally excluding low-dollar, high-risk items.
