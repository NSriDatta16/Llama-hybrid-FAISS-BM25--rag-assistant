When making a predictive model that is predicting a continuous outcome, how does one arrive at the final prediction?

For instance, a prediction of 1 million could be: A weighted average of various predictions. ex. a .5 chance of 2 million, a .5 chance of 0, for an expected value of 1 million; or The prediction could be a distribution centered around 1 million where the 'peak' of the distribution happens to be 1 million; or The model could be determining a range of possible predictions, each with a specific probability, and choosing the single most likely one. ex. a .5 chance of 1 million, a .3 chance of 0, and a .2 chance of 50,000 - 1 million is the most likely, so it makes that prediction. Other? I'm trying to make a predictive model (in either SAS or SPSS) for data with a high proportion of zeros and continuous data that begins after a certain threshold. (ex anything between 0 and 1000 is considered a 0). I'm not sure if I need to run a second model to predict categorical outcomes (0, not zero) to multiply by the results from the continuous prediction. If the models are doing 1 or 2, I shouldn't need to run a second model to predict categorical outcomes, but if its doing the third one I would have to. Thanks! I'm a bit out of my depth
