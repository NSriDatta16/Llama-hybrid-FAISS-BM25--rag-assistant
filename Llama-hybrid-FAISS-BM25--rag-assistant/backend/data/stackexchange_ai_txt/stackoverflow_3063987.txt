need help with C++ using maps to keep track of words in a INPUT file

Let say i have a text file with today is today but tomorrow is today tomorrow then using maps how can i keep track of the words that are repeated? and on which line it repeats? so far i have each string in the file read in as a temp and it is stored in the following way: map storage; int count = 1 // for the first line of the file if(infile.is_open()){ while( !infile.eof() ){ getline(in, line); istringstream my_string(line); while(my_string.good()){ string temp; my_string >> temp; storage[temp] = count } count++;// so that every string read in the next line will be recorded as that line. } } map ::iterator m; for(int m = storage.begin(); m!= storage.end(); m++){ out first second right now the output is just but: line 1 is: line 2 today: line 2 tomorrow: line 2 But instead.. it should print out(no repeating strings): today : line 1 occurred 2 times, line 2 occurred 1 time. is: line 1 occurred 1 time, line 2 occurred 1 time. but: line 1 occurred 1 time. tomorrow: line 2 occurred 2 times. Note: the order of the string does not matter. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
