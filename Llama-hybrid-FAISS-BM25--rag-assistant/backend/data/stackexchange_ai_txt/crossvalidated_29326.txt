Linear regression uses the general linear equation $Y=b_0+âˆ‘(b_i X_i)+\epsilon$ where $Y$ is a continuous dependent variable and independent variables $X_i$ are usually continuous (but can also be binary, e.g. when the linear model is used in a t-test) or other discrete domains. $\epsilon$ is a term for the variance that is not explained by the model and is usually just called "error". Individual dependent values denoted by $Y_j$ can be solved by modifying the equation a little: $Y_j=b_0 + \sum{(b_i X_{ij})+\epsilon_j}$ Logistic regression is another generalized linear model (GLM) procedure using the same basic formula, but instead of the continuous $Y$, it is regressing for the probability of a categorical outcome. In simplest form, this means that we're considering just one outcome variable and two states of that variable- either 0 or 1. The equation for the probability of $Y=1$ looks like this: $$ P(Y=1) = {1 \over 1+e^{-(b_0+\sum{(b_iX_i)})}} $$ Your independent variables $X_i$ can be continuous or binary. The regression coefficients $b_i$ can be exponentiated to give you the change in odds of $Y$ per change in $X_i$, i.e., $Odds={P(Y=1) \over P(Y=0)}={P(Y=1) \over 1-P(Y=1)}$ and ${\Delta Odds}= e^{b_i}$. $\Delta Odds$ is called the odds ratio, $Odds(X_i+1)\over Odds(X_i)$. In English, you can say that the odds of $Y=1$ increase by a factor of $e^{b_i}$ per unit change in $X_i$. Example: If you wanted to see how body mass index predicts blood cholesterol (a continuous measure), you'd use linear regression as described at the top of my answer. If you wanted to see how BMI predicts the odds of being a diabetic (a binary diagnosis), you'd use logistic regression.
