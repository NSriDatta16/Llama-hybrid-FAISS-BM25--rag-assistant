Many questions/answers on this site could give ideas for good questions. I will give a list with some such links that I think are good. Posts where I answered are overrepresented, because I know those posts better, not because they necessarily are the best! I give short comments to each link, so you can decide if you want to follow the link. What is the intuition behind SVD? "Can you explain to one of our clients how the SVD works?" Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in layman terms "Can you explain in nontechnical language the idea of maximum likelihood estimation?" Taleb and the Black Swan "Tell me, what is a black swan, and why is that relevant? When is it relevant?" Statistical inference when the sample "is" the population "What can you say about statistical inference when the sample is the whole population?" Goodness of fit and which model to choose linear regression or Poisson "We have a regression problem where the response is a count variable. Which would you choose in this context, ordinary least squares or Poisson regression (or maybe some other)? Explain your choice, what is the main differences between these models?" What is the difference between finite and infinite variance "Can you explain, in as simple a language as is possible, what it means for a random variable to have infinite expectation or infinite variance? What is the practical importance of this distinction? Explain with an example." What are modern, easily used alternatives to stepwise regression? "How would you build a complex regression model when there are many possible predictor variables? Describe different possible strategies, and tell about the problems with each of them" How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? "What is the problem of separation in logistic regression, its causes, symptoms? What can you do to solve it, if it is really a problem?" Why does correlation matrix need to be positive semi-definite and what does it mean to be or not to be positive semi-definite? and What does a non positive definite covariance matrix tell me about my data? "Explain why a covariance matrix must be positive (semi) definite, and what that means. How can that fact be used?" What are the multidimensional versions of median "Can you propose some way to generalize the median to multivariate data?" Interpreting interaction terms in logit regression with categorical variables and What are best practices in identifying interaction effects? and Two negative main effects yet positive interaction effect? and Including the interaction but not the main effects in a model and How to interpret main effects when the interaction effect is not significant? "Explain what is meant by interaction in regression models. Specifically, what does it mean if interaction is significant while main effects are not? Is there some difference in interpretation of interaction between ordinary linear regression and logistic regression?" What could be the reason for using square root transformation on data? and Appropriate data transformation "When, how and why do you transform the response variable in a regression (or ANOVA) model? Are there any alternatives? Can I trust ANOVA results for a non-normally distributed DV? "How would you treat an ANOVA with non-normal residuals? Why is statistics useful when many things that matter are one shot things? How can I efficiently model the sum of Bernoulli random variables? When to use generalized estimating equations vs. mixed effects models? What is happening here, when I use squared loss in logistic regression setting? "Why do we use maximum likelihood for logistic regression? Why not least squares?" What is the difference between linear regression on y with x and x with y?
