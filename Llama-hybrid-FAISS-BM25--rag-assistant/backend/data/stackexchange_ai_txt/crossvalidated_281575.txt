Is a machine learning model just a mathematical equation?

Recently I attended a seminar where they said that a machine learning (ML) model is just a mathematical equation. Having been studying neural nets and deeper models as such I feel it is not a precise statement. A ML model could be better said to be a black box in which there are signals to tune its parameters. Internally, it may be very hard to represent a model as an equation. Many models have lots of moving parts too but as long as they are end to end differentiable (e.g. in neural nets) or have some way to tune the components they can work. Is there any way to give a precise definition of a ML model? Can all ML models be written as mathematical equations?
