How can I generate dynamic charts with MySQL data?

This is not a question about the names of libraries for making graphs. I have a project that needed a way to make graphs with data that comes from MySQL. My question is: A library that provide a good integration and flexibility with external data , in this case MySQL data? I need to calculate averages, make pie charts, change the data in real time, etc. I would prefer a library that doesn't use JPEG images in final graphs. I would like something like http://raphaeljs.com/analytics.html (anyone know if there's MySQL integration for this library?). I saw the Google Charts API but I don't like the idea of not having library control on my server, and I read that it has limitations.
