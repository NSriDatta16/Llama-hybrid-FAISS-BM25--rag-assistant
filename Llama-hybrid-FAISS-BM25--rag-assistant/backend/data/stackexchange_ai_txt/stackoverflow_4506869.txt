Business Analytics: What platform should I use?

If I want to run business reports that are better than what Excel and Access does, where can I go? I have seen Google charts API, and some of the things like the time series chart with events really appealed to me. I have seen Adobe AIR and Flex, that is something really strong. Amount of coding needed seems to be quite a lot too. Needs: Fast live reports Good graphic tools for visualization Ability to drill down to specifics Online front end (Minimize sending chunky reports through emails) Yes, I am almost asking for a mini-Bloomberg terminal, or something like Business Objects by SAP. Cost wise: hopefully not too much. Not looking into a 5 man IT support team, hopefully everything can be done by 1 guy. About me: I have strong background in using Excel for Business Analytics, reports, forms, automated population of fields, statistical studies, forecasting, scenario and model building, and optimization. But that's about it. I am willing to learn, but hopefully it would be a strong platform that withstands the ages.
