I don't think it's fair to say that conditional probabilities are unique to Bayesianism. (Measure theory experts, please feel free to correct me.) One way you could view a conditional probability - particularly when you have equally likely outcomes - is basing your probability calculation on a subset $\Omega^{\prime} \subset \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the sample space. For example, consider some fictitious data gathered (N.B.: we have no "prior" information) in a survey: $$ \begin{array}{|l|c|c|} \hline & \text{Male} & \text{Female} \\ \hline \text{Owns a TV} & 75 & 72 \\ \text{Does not own a TV} & 25 & 28 \\ \hline \end{array}$$Let's assume that the probability of choosing any person surveyed above is equally likely. Consider the sample space $\Omega$ of all people surveyed and let $\mathbb{P} : \mathcal{A} \to [0, 1]$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a non-empty $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. By definition of an equally likely event, for any event $A \in \mathcal{A}$, $$\mathbb{P}(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$ where $|\cdot|$ denotes set cardinality. If we were interested in, say, the probability of owning a TV given that you are a female, letting $A$ be the event of being a female and $B$ being the event of owning a TV, we would calculate the probability as $$\dfrac{|A \cap B|}{|A|}$$ and we're treating $A$ as our new sample space $\Omega^{\prime} = A$. But notice that we can write $$\dfrac{|A \cap B|}{|A|} = \dfrac{|A \cap B|/|\Omega|}{|A|/|\Omega|} = \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} $$ This is precisely the definition of conditional probability, and does not use Bayes' theorem. All we're doing is restricting our sample space.
