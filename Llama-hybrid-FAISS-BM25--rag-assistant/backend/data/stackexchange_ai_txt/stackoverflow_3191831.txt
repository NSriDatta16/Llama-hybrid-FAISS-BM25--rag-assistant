After MUCH searching, I found a few things. Magento can export .csv files that can be imported into Quickbooks (or any other RMS/POS software). Magento can export/import these .csv files (and i think xml files) automatically with cron. And i believe that Quickbooks/Sage/Dynamics or any other RMS can automatically export/import .csv files as well. I am still very new to this and have not implemented this solution yet, so i could be wrong on the exact details. Also, i think that you need an ftp server to act as the medium for the .csv files. I hope this helps anyone else who comes across this problem.
