Deep Neural Networks to combine regression and multi-class classification problems

I have a dataset obtained from a mobile app which is applicable for regression problem since the output values are numerical. I need to predict the numerical values and then predict their classes (High, Medium, Low) in order to provide feedback to the app users. I am using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) separately for regression and multi-class classification. My question is: Is there any way to use DNN to combine regression and classification problems? I need the DNN first to predict the numerical values (using regression) and then predict their classes (using multi-class classification) with the same input features.
