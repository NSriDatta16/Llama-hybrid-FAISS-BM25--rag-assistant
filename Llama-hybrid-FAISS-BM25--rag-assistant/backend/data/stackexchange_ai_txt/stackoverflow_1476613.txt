ETL Tool for transfering old Firebird Database to a new organized Firebird Database

After looking at a lot of questions..i found no real answer for this. I redisigned an Database for our customer. With Microsoft Access i found a good Tool to get old table Data in my new well formed Database Structure. It is really easy but takes a lot of time (cause handling old Data with a lot of care). Are there any Open Source Tools that bring that facilities like Microsoft Access? To clear it up: I "just" want to reorder old Firebird Database Data in a new "best-practise" Way. Edit: I would be really nice if i can get a Log File or something similar to have some documentation on the changes. Update: After checking some of the Tools of that Wikipedia Site. I found no real Logging Mechanism. How do you documentate the changes on a Database? Simply by writing it down? Result: So i dont got an real answer...i ma still searching for an nice tool. thnak you guys for the hints and your thoughts regarding this question. I want to reward Kenneth Cochran with the Bounty cause he pointed me to ETL. Thank you!
