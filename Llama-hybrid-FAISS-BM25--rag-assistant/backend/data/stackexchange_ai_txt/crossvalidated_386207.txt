Simulating noise around future known data points

I am creating a simulation model of an electricity market. One of the important characteristics is fuel price. Whilst I would like to set the future fuel price, I would like to sample from a distribution to add noise. For example the time series [14, 16, 13] becomes [14.5, 15.32, 13.4] or something similar. I would like to estimate this distribution from a historical dataset. The dataset in question is shown below, and the dataset is available here : I removed the trend by differencing of a single step, and 12 steps (yearly cycle) and now have a distribution: Would I take the standard deviation of this and just apply it to my future time series [14, 16, 13] or would this be dependent on the difference between the previous point and previous 12 points? Any other ideas are welcome!
