The data You have count data. Each observation is therefore something like '10 calls at time point 1 on day 4'. This has two implications: Unless you forgot to record at one of the 45 day/time combinations, your data are balanced. This is true even if there were no calls at some combination. In that case the observation is simply 0. Unless the counts are high with very similar rates, the 'sphericity' assumption (i.e. that all 45 observations have the same standard deviation) that @gung mentions is unlikely to hold. You might therefore be better switching to a generalized linear regression framework that will allow you to model the counts as conditionally Poisson. If you really don't want to there are various transformations of your counts (e.g. square root) that might be useful to keep you in a broadly in ANOVA's linear normal framework. It may or may not be worth getting hung up about this. It's hard to tell without playing with the data. Try things a couple of ways and check your residuals. Random effects / Repeated measures If you consider that some days are just noisier than others and that it is scientifically irrelevant which particular days you chose to record on, but scientifically interesting to see whether and how measurements at time points 1 2 and 3 differ from each other, then it seems quite reasonable to me to treat the day of recording as a random effect and the time of recording as a fixed effect. The interpretation would be that each day has some intercept relating to the average call rate which is a random draw from the population of all the days you could have recorded, and the time you recorded adds or subtracts something from this rate. The observation is a random draw from a distribution with this mean. You're then asking whether the time of recording stands out from the day variation.
