Interpretting arima xreg output in R

I have an interrupted time series consisting of 200 observations that I've cleaved into two subseries: a sub-series of 150 pre-interrupted observations, and a sub-series of 50 post-interrupted observations. So the overall structure looks like this: series = pre-interrupted + post-interrupted I've fitted the pre-interrupted series with an ARIMA(1, 0, 0) model, and everything looks good. When I run the model in R I get good residual plots and something like this: > arima(pre-interrupted, 1, 0, 0) ## Coefficients: ## ar1 xmean ## 0.792 51.472 ## s.e. 0.082 2.418 I created an indicator variable, which to my understanding functions like a dummy variable. It looks like this: indvar And then I run the arima command with that included: > arima(series, c(1, 0, 0), xreg = indicator) And get something like this: ## Coefficients: ## ar1 intercept indvar ## 0.761 59.721 -8.178 ## s.e. 0.082 2.996 1.842 And I'm not exactly sure how to interpret this. Specifically: Why did the xmean change to intercept? What is the role of indvar in the context of the output?
