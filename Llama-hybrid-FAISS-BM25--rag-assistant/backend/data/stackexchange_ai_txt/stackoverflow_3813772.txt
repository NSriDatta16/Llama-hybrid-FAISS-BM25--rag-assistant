Database User Interface Design Process

I am the only developer at my organization and am expected to develop databases and interfaces to those databases. Developing online front-ends using web frameworks is time-consuming. Do other people in this situation usually write a text-based interface to the database to perfect access and update methods, or is web-based CRUD the usual solution?
