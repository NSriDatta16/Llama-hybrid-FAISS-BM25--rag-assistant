Exactness of p-value in testing by simulation

When I use simulation to determine a p-value I am aware that the exactness of my p-value will be at most an estimate because I am using the scores of my sample and not my population, so that my computed p is on average close to its true p-value. How do I deduce whether my estimate is a good estimate or a not-so-good estimate? Is there a some kind of rule? My guess would be that it should be something like N â‰¥ 30 but I would appreciate an official answer.
