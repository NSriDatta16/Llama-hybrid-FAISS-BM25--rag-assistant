Another great answer from @mkt on this forum. Here are a few more pointers you might find useful. GLMs include some widely used types of regression models: Binary Logistic Regression Models; Binomial Logistic Regression Models; Multinomial Logistic Regression Models; Ordinal Logistic Regression Models; Poisson Regression Models; Beta Regression Models; Gamma Regression Models. As pointed out by @COOLSerdash in his comment, beta regression models share some features - such as linear predictor, link function, dispersion parameter - with GLMs (GLMs; McCullagh and Nelder 1989), but are NOT special cases of the GLM framework. However, I included them in the above list because of their similarity with GLMs and their practical value. A good place to start would be to familiarize yourself with each of these types of models and when it might be used. Binary Logistic Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable Y and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, Y could represent the survival status of patients at a local hospital assessed 30 days following a surgical intervention for treating a particular disease such that Y = 1 for a patient who survived and Y = 0 for a patient who died. Furthermore, if p = 2, then X1 could represent Age (expressed in years) and X2 could represent gender. For all the subsequent examples below, it will be assumed that p = 2 and that X1 and X2 will have the same meaning as in the current example. Binomial Logistic Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a binomial dependent variable Y and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, Y could represent the number of correct questions (out of 10) answered by patients on a questionnaire eliciting their knowledge of the symptoms associated with their disease. Multinomial Logistic Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a nominal dependent variable Y with more than 2 categories and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. Ordinal Logistic Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between an ordinal dependent variable Y and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, Y could represent the degree of pain experienced by patients immediately after surgery, expressed on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5, where 1 stands for no pain and 5 stands for severe pain. Poisson Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a count dependent variable Y and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, Y could represent the number of hospital days (out of 30) when patients had to use pain relieving medication following their surgery. Beta Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a dependent variable Y expressed as a continuous proportion taking values in the open interval (0,1) and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, if the disease in question is a brain disease, Y could represent the fraction of the brain area still affected by disease 30 days post-surgery relative to the total brain area for patients who survived the surgery. Gamma Regression Models These types of models are used to model the relationship between a positive-valued, continuous dependent variable Y and a set of independent variables X1, ..., Xp. For example, Y could represent the healthcare utilization costs of patients who survived up to the 30-day mark.
