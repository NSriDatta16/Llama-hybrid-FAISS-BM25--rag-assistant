Magento Order Import Extensions, Commercial or Otherwise

Is there a standard third-party module that everyone/anyone is using for programming batch order imports in Magento? I need to do a complicated history import for a client, and the SOAP API doesn't have an order creation API, and an Order model existing in the system is dependent on so many other things already existing that it's not a simple straight forward "create an order model". Has anyone created tools to solve this problem? I'm interested in hearing people's experiences with modules that are specifically aimed at importing arbitrary orders, and extensions that are aimed at importing orders from third party systems (like the M2E extension for eBay). I know how to approach the problem from a "raw programmatic" approach; I'm looking for tools that have already solves a lot of the bumps you'll run into on the way.
