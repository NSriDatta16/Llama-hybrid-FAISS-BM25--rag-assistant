Recently several comments by Wilhelm, Wolfgang MÃ¼ckenheim, caused me to reconsider certain formulations in my answer. I am posting this as a new answer mainly because the different approach of this answer, not arguing about the teaching of this problem, but instead about the paradox being invalid. Wilhelm discusses in his lengthy manuscript that Transactions are only possible at finite steps $n$ (there is no action possible "between all $n$ and $\omega$ "). This reminded me of the term $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \prod_{n=k}^\infty \left( \frac{9n}{9n+1} \right)$$ which is derived from Ross' work. This term is indeterminate when the path to infinity is not defined for the following limit. $$\lim_\limits{(l,m)\to(\infty,\infty)}\sum_{k=1}^l\prod_{n=k}^m\left(\frac{9n}{9n+1}\right)$$ This seems to resemble the point that Wilhelm discusses and is also mentioned in aksakal's answer. The steps in time become infinitely small, so we will be able to reach 12 p.m. in that sense, but we will at the same time need to add and remove an (unphysical) infinity number of balls. It is a false idea to attach this supertask to a process like Zeno's arrow, just like the switch of Thompson's paradoxical lamp can not have a definite position at the end of a supertask. In terms of the limit we can say that the physical path to infinity that we take is $$\lim_\limits{l\to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^l\prod_{n=k}^l\left(\frac{9n}{9n+1}\right) = \lim_\limits{l\to \infty} \frac{9l}{10}$$ so not zero but infinite.
