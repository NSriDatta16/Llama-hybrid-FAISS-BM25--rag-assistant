The FFT is probably the best answer, but if you really want to do it by your method, try this: To normalize, first make a histogram to count how many occurrances of each value from 0 to 255. Then throw out X percent of the values from each end with something like: for (i=lower=0;i Now normalize with A[i] = 255*(A[i]-lower)/(upper-lower)-128 Throw away results outside the -128..127 range. Now you can count zero crossings. To make sure you are not fooled by noise, you might want to keep track of the slope over the last several points, and only count crossings when the average slope is going the right way.
