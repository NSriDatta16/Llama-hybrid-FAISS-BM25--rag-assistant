You can't join two tables using different connections to the database, not from PHP, nor on the MySQL server. ( @RobertPitt has a good point: do you actually need two connections? It's possible to join two tables on the same host, but in different databases, within one connection - assuming your connection has the necessary privileges to access both) If you have control over one or other of the databases, you might try setting up a federated table; make sure that the performance is OK though (if the db machines don't have a fast, low-latency connection (i.e. directly joined by a cable), don't bother), and there is a long list of limitations . Possible lesser evils: replicate the table from one server to the other (tricky to set up) "join" them manually in PHP (gross, inefficient, but pretty much your only choice if you don't have control over the database)
