Probably not the most elegant answer you'll get, but just to throw this out there: You could return purely json from your action method, something that would look like this: { Html: " etc...", Json: { // your object here } } in your controller you'll need something like this to render your view: var existingContext = HttpContext.Current; var writer = new StringWriter(); var response = new HttpResponse(writer); var httpContext = new HttpContext(existingContext.Request, response); var viewResult = myAction(bla); HttpContext.Current = httpContext; viewResult.ExecuteResult(this.ControllerContext) HttpContext.Current = existingContext; var viewAsHtml = writer.ToString();
