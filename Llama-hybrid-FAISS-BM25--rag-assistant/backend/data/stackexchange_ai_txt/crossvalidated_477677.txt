Bayesian Credibility applied to Regression

I have a set of points $(x,y)$ with the goal of predicting $y$ . I am fitting a regression model of the form $\ln(y-1) = A + B\ln(x)$ . I am reading an article that gives me the following information: "using Bayes credibility, Bayes' formula would be used: $$f(\text{Parameters}|\text{Data}) \sim f(\text{Data}|\text{Parameters}) * f(\text{Parameters})...,$$ and later on, "the regression parameters would be used for calculating this prior likelihood component, which is the credibility component of the likelihood". The article also mentions complement curves, non-weighted curves, and credibility weighted curves. I am not familiar with how to apply credibility as described in this article. I only understand the basic fitting of the regression. Given the following I have fit the regression model to this as described initially (without Credibility). I would like to know how to create the points for the complement and the points for the credibility weighted portion. I think that seeing an example would help me understand the concept. On this graph I want to ultimately show all curves leading to the credibility weighted portion. The author provided a similar graph that I would like to eventually replicate on the full dataset: As a side note, if anyone can suggest a good reading on this topic for a novice like myself it would also be appreciated. Thank you. The referenced article can be found here: http://www.variancejournal.org/issues/11-01-02/95.pdf
