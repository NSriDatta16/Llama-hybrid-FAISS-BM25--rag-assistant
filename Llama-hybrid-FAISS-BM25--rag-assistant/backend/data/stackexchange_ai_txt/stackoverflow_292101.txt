Browser Neutral Way to add options to a select element in javascript

I just learned something interesting. The add method for the javascript select object in IE 6 takes only one parameter. It throws an error when you pass it two parameters which I believe is the standard , even as documented on the MSDN site. My question is this. What is your best-practice recommendation for programmatically adding option elements to a select element in javascript? Call the add method differently based on the value of the user agent? Wrap the select object in a class that provides the proper method signature? Use a javascript library which does this for you (specify which library)?
