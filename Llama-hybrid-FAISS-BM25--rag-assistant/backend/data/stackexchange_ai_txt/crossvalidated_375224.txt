A few ideas (out of many possible approaches) Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality (i.e. keep top 10 PCA dimensions) Use some form of feature selection to remove the non-informative features Use a different machine learning model to select top features (e.g. random forest, gradient boosting...) Use lasso regression with an appropriate regularization value Use ElasticNet regularization (which is a combination of l1 and l2 really) ... ... and then perform L2 regression on the resulting features For your second question: correlation would only work if your features are linearly related to the outcome. Wont work for polynomial or interaction terms or anything else non linear...
