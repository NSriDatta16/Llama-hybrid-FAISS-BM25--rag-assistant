It's just another application and it is totally up to you how you want to organize your files in Xcode, have it in a separate project or a sub project. That said I would usually just add a target. The new target could include NIBs - but does not have to. Really depends on what your helper is supposed to be doing. Not sure what you mean exactly with "relaunching". (Maybe launchd is just what you are looking for?)
