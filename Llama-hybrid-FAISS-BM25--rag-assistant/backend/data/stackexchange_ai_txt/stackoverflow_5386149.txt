Eshell with Elisp for interactive use: "Eshell is capable of invoking almost any elisp function loaded in Emacs. That sort of flexibility is unmatched; there are no shells out there capable of approximating what Eshell can do. In fact, this functionality is heavily used (and encouraged!) by Eshell. If you want to open the file foobar.txt in Emacs you simply invoke find-file foobar.txt and Eshell will map that to the elisp call (find-file "foobar.txt") and open the file for you." from http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/12/13/complete-guide-mastering-eshell/
