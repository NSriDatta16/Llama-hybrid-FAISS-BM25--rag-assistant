How to get a properly typed List from a ReflectionDBObject

I have a model classes like public class MyClass extends ReflectionDBObject { private List attributes; ... } public class NiceAttribute extends ReflectionDBObject { ... } I create it in a typesafe way, like List attrs = new ArrayList (); attrs.add(new NiceAttribute()); MyClass myClass = new MyClass(); myClass.setAttributes(attrs); then save it to mongo, and retrieve with a code like DBCollection col = ...; col.setObjectClass(MyClass.class) MyClass foundObject = (MyClass)col.findOne(); But the problem is that foundObject 's attributes becomes a list of BasicDBObject . Looks like a driver can not (or does not want to) detect a list items type. Is this a driver limitation, or I missed something? What would be an elegant workaround for the problem? BTW, I know about Morphia etc. Maybe it solves the problem. But my project is tiny, and I don't want to complicate things having one more layer of abstraction.
