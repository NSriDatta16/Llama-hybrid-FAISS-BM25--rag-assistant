In practice the organisation of the work-in-progress board is best left for the team to determine depending on your circumstances and environment. (Agile == selfmanagement.) That said, here's what we did in my previous team, part of a 300+ developer effort that was relatively new to Agile and Scum: We had two boards - one with index cards for forthcoming stories so we could tell what was coming up, and one with the current sprint's work. Our columns on the current sprint board were simply Not Started Under Development Dev Done In QA Complete ("Done Done") and a box in the corner for Blocked . A post-it note represented each story. Developers each had a little magnet which they used at the standup each morning to signify who was working on what. Our team was quite big (~ 12 at one point) so this really helped figure out who was paired with whom. We didn't bother with an electronic version (no point), although our Product Owner did have a Scrumworks system that he needed to keep up to date. We kept as far away from that as we could!
