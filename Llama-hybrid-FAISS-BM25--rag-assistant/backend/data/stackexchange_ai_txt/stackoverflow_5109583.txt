I haven't tested your code however: As far as I can tell there seems to be nothing wrong with your code I've tried the url you're searching and had no problems downloading the csv without any cookies In my previous experience with google, you might be looking at the problem the wrong way, it is not that you don't have the right cookies but that google automatically blocks requests from bots. If this is the case you must replace the user agent http header to mimic an actual browser. Beware however that this is against googles terms of service and if you make too many requests per minute google will block all requests from your ip for about 8h.
