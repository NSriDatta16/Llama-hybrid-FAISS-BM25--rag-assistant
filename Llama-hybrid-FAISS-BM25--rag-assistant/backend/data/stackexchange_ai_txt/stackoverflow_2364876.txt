In addition to Julians reference: In general, entity tags enable client, server and intermediaries to agree on the specific representation (hence entity tag) of a resource. The agreement is used for reducing network use (conditional retrieval) and concurrency control (conditional updates). The former works along the lines of "Send me the current representation of this resource if it is not the representation I already have" and the latter works along the lines of "Apply this change to that resource if it still has the state that I expect it to have"). The rest is explained in detail in the HTTp spec. Jan
