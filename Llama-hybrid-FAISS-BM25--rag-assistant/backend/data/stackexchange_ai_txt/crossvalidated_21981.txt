Yes. I find clustering to be a very effective approach to data reduction for reducing survey data for both understanding and management presentation. Latent Class analysis (treating the response scales as ordinal) or k-means (treating them as continuous) can be both viewed as a form of information compression . Classifying respondents into their most likely segment generally yields a categorical variable that has intuitive explanations when profiled in terms of responses. You can then name the segments, and use those variables for summary level analysis and presentation. Fit a cluster for groups of related item (e.g. below) or possibly all together. Q14cluser I often use LatentGold, but find FASTCLUS in SAS to be a good expedient. Before doing so, you'll want to consider adjusting responses of each individual for their use of the scale (controversial but pragmatic). Some people just lean on one end of the scale, either avoiding the negative or the positive. Clustering raw responses typically tends to divide people by that behavior. Standardizing each respondents' answers to their own mean and clustering on that often exposes variables that move together in very interesting ways.
