What are best practices for permissions on Apache-writable directories?

Sometimes I want to allow users to upload files through Apache. There are two different ways I could set the permissions so that Apache can write the uploaded files to the directory. I can make the user Apache is running as the owner of the directory so that it looks like this: drwxr-xr-x 2 www admin 68 Sep 24 2007 uploadedfiles I can give write permission to "others" where Apache is one of the others: drwxr-xrwx 35 egbert admin 1190 Mar 9 13:17 uploadedfiles Is one of these safer than the other?
