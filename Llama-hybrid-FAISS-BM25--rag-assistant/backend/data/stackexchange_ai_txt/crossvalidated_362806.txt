The whole point of CNNs are that they learn the filters that are the best for the task at hand. By using existing filters, we wouldn't be able to achieve such high performance. CNNs are built so that each layer's filters are applied to the features extracted from the previous layer. This way the features extracted from CNNs are hierarchical . Imagine a CNN used for facial recognition. Typically the first few layers are formed to extract basic shapes (lines, curves, etc.), layers near the middle extract more abstract facial features (eyes, noses, etc.), while the final layers would extract face-like features. This way the filters of each CNN are tailored to extract the best features for each task. By using generic existing image filters, we wouldn't be able to get this result.
