Modifying the pretty printer from haskell-src-exts

The haskell-src-exts package has functions for pretty printing a Haskell AST. What I want to do is change its behavior on certain constructors, in my case the way SCC pragmas are printed. So everything else should be printed the default way, only SCCs are handled differently. Is it possible to do it without copying the source file and editing it, which is what I'm doing now?
