HMM Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian

I aim to use Hidden Markov Model for regime detection in time series. My question might be a little too blurry: in which cases it is crucial to use Bayesian version of HMM and in which cases it is not? Also, am I right that if the amount of data grows, then both methods will tend to be very similar (which is true in a Bayesian statistics under some mild conditions)?
