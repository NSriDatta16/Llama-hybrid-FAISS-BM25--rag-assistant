Like masterik said, you're comparing apples and oranges. An object is just a collection of key/value pairs. A closure relates to variable scoping. You can create a closure in any scenario, by wrapping that part of your code in a function. This creates a new closure within that function scope. http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/ The difference between your two examples of object creation is related to different patterns of writing classes/objects in JS. The first example I believe is called the Module pattern? The second example is another common way of defining classes in JS, or you could also use the object's prototype to add those methods. For more information on how to write classes, try googling "js class patterns" (there are quite a few resources, with different patterns - module, revealing module, singleton, etc)
