My Entity Data Model (ASP.NET MVC) that was generated is missing a View I created in my database.. why?

I created my database in SQL Server, and then in Visual Studio I created an Entity Data Model using my database. Everything was generated fine, all my tables and views, EXCEPT for one particular view. The difference between this view and my other views is I use the UNION ALL in the view syntax. See below for the SQL view setup, and below that for my code in Visual Studio which complains about missing v_contactMasterList : select clicontfin_cli_fk as clientPK, contfin_firstName as FirstName, contfin_lastName as LastName, contfin_institutionName as InstitutionName, contfin_contactType as ContactType from f_linkClientContactFinancial lccf inner join f_contactFinancial cf on lccf.clicontfin_contfin_fk = cf.contfin_pk UNION ALL select clicontins_cli_fk as clientPK, contins_agentFirstName as FirstName, contins_agentLastName as LastName, contins_agencyName as InstitutionName, contins_contactType as ContactType from f_linkClientContactInsurance lcci inner join f_contactInsurance ci on lcci.clicontins_contins_fk = ci.contins_pk UNION ALL select clicontleg_cli_fk as clientPK, contleg_FirstName as FirstName, contleg_LastName as LastName, contleg_firmName as InstitutionName, contleg_contactType as ContactType from f_linkClientContactLegal lccl inner join f_contactLegal cl on lccl.clicontleg_contleg_fk = cl.contleg_pk UNION ALL select clicont_cli_fk as clientPK, cont_FirstName as FirstName, cont_LastName as LastName, NULL as InstitutionName, cont_contactType as ContactType from f_linkClientContactPersonal lccp inner join f_contactPersonal cp on lccp.clicont_cont_fk = cp.cont_pk And my C# code is below - note, that where the mainDB.v_contactMasterList.ToList() is is where the problem is. It does NOT recognize the v_contactMasterList at all. It recognizes every other database object such as my tables and my other views: public ActionResult Index() { var viewModel = new ClientContactInformationViewModel { ClientContactRecords = mainDB.v_contactMasterList.ToList() }; return View(); } Also, notice where I declared SelectLifeManagementDBEntites , how it sees that, which was created from my Entity Data Model, as well as EVERY SINGLE ONE of my other tables and views. When I created this view, I just copied and pasted my SQL Syntax into the view SQL area, and executed it. I then saved it. I did get a dialog box saying that views containing UNION ALL operators cannot be graphically represented in the diagram layout. Which that's fine, but I don't know if that might be causing the problem. Please help???? Thanks in advance..
