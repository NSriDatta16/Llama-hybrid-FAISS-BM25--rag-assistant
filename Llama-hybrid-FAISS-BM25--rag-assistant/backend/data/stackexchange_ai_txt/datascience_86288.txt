Predict customer behaviour with Transformer(attention is all you need)

Please advice, am I thinking correctly: is it possible to represent customer behavior data from an online store as a sequence data? Because it is describing interactions of the customer with the shop through time. So in this case N would be the number of users (or number of user sessions), T / time window I could set myself and D I could set also myself taking only event type (purchase, view, etc.) or something else like price, brand etc.(please see screenshot below) Please share your opinion Many thanks in advance
