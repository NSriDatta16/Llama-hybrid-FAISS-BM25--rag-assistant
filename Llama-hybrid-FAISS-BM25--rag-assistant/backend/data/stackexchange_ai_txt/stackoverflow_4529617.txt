ASP.NET is the platform for developing .NET web applications. Sitting on top of that platform is two technologies to choose from: ASP.NET Web Forms ASP.NET MVC Web Forms uses WinForms-style development - drag/drop, event handlers, page lifecycle, statefulness with ViewState - all things evil in my opinion. MVC as you know has no page lifecycle, no event handlers, no server controls (you can, but not recommended/required), no ViewState. Don't really know what else i can say without going into too much detail. Both technologies will be continued to be supported/enhanced. But since your already versed in ASP.NET MVC - i seen no benefit in learning Web Forms. It would be a step back if anything. As for this statement: just humor me and perhaps list the different ways of utilizing C# to develop great web applications That's a bit too broad/subjective. What is "great"? Well performing? Looks good? Maintainable? All of the above? No doubt - MVC will do a better job at most things than Web Forms. Only feasible choice for a Web Forms app might be a intranet application where tons of complex grids/controls are required, and things like SEO/AJAX is not required. Everything else should be done in MVC IMO.
