Here is one way to try. Construct a time series for each comparison of "X ranks better than Y"; with the values of win, lose, tie or NA. So for from your example data you have: a-b: win win win NA NA a-c: NA lose win lose tie b-c: NA lose lose NA NA Then you need to decide for yourself what you mean by consistent over time - what tolerance margin of inconsistency do you have? For example, the a-c comparison already shows inconsistency. Is this enough to throw it out? You will also need to decide if you therefore want to reject the consistency hypothesis just for the a-c combination; for the whole system; or perhaps just for a and c (and there are various ways you might give yourself consistency measures for the margins ie all a, all c, etc). If you want to allow a certain tolerance for minor inconsistency you will need to create some underlying latent random variables with distributions you can specify. This becomes your null hypothesis and you use it to generate simulated data that will give you an idea of the tolerable inconsistency; which you can compare somehow (with whatever summary statistic/s seems most relevant) to what you have actually observed. On the island question, as the ids being ranked are not in common across islands I think you can treat each island as a completely independent problem.
