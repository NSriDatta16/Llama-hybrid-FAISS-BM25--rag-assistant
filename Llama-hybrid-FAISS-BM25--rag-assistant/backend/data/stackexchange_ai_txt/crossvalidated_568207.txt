1/3 would the value of the population mean that would maximize the probability of getting the observed outcome This is a more profound statement than you might realize, as it alludes to maximum likelihood estimation, a common estimation method in statistics. Being a little loose, there is a technical sense in which the calculated $\bar x$ is the most likely value of the population parameter in order for you to obtain the data you obtained (and it isn't always true, but it's true under nice-enough conditions, such as normality). That sounds good, right? And that's why statisticians like maximum likelihood estimation. To address your final paragraph, you're onto something by saying that finding the "probability maximizer" (likelihood estimator) is a good approach, perhaps better than the sample mean, but the sample mean often is exactly that likelihood maximizer by being the maximum likelihood estimate! Getting away from maximum likelihood estimation in particular, "estimating a population parameter" means "guessing the correct value of the population parameter". There are ways of guessing that we know have desirable properties ("good" estimates of the unknown value). Since, the usual sample mean $\bar X$ has a number of desirable properties, we often like $\bar x$ as our estimate of $\mu$ .
