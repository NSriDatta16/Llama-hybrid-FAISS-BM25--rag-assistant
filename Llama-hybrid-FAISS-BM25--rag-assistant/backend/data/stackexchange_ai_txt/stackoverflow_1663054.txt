I will make mine a CW and plug my own free product, TheKBase (.Net on Windows only, although I've got a top-secret version in Mono that I'm running since September: I'll give it to anybody who wants it, of course). Once you figure it out, it will organize your work and any other knowledge you may have. It's a multiple-hierarchical notepad, and saves to XML (and will convert to whatever you want with XSLT). Several users organize entire academic disciplines with it. I try to get away from it, myself, but I can find nothing better (I was in love with Evernote for a while, but that turned sour). There's a lot of stuff it doesn't do, of course....
