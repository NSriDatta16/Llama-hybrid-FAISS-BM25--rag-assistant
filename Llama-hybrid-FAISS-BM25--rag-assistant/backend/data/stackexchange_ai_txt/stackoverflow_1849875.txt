As your form is in GET (see the method parameter) , and sends data to agent.php (see the action attribute) , agent.php will receive the data entered by the user, in the $_GET superglobal variable -- which is an array. There will be one entry in that array for each field of the form ; and the key for each value will be the name attribute of the corresponding field. Which means the $_GET array will contain something like this, for instance : array 'LASTNAME' => string 'my last name' (length=12) 'CITY' => string 'my city' (length=7) 'state' => string 'DE' (length=2) 'ZIP' => string '12345' (length=5) 'Submit' => string 'Submit' (length=6) (I got this output using var_dump , with Xdebug installed) To store those data to a database, you'll have to use mysqli_* functions, or PDO .
