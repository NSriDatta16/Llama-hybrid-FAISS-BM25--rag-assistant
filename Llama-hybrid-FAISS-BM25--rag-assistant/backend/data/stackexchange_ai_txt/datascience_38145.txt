In machine learning how to find feature interdepencies?

Given a data set of N features, wherein some the features in this set were derived from other features from the same set, I am trying to discover inter dependencies between features (something like this Input feature(s) -> output feature(s)). Note that,there can be multiple dependencies in the same feature set. Can someone suggest some technique to approach this problem.
