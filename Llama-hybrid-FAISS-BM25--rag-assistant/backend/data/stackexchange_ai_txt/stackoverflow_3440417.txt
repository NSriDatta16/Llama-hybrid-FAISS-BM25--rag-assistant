ASP.net c# basic question

Willing to admit I'm a complete .NET newbie, but I have extensive experience in classic ASP, which is making this quite tricky as the whole structure of .net is completely different. I know I'm meant to use code behind, but for now I'm happy embedding it into the pages because: Each page is going to be simple, so there wont be too much mixing up It's probably too much of a step to do everything the 'right' way, I'd rather step up to that slowly as I get to grips with .net So excusing my lack of code behind, on this page I am trying to get the ID returned by the querystring "mid" (Menu ID), and then display a different CSS class for the menu button we are currently on. Two menu classes, navButton and navButtonO (over). protected int menuID; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { string menuIDdata = Page.Request.QueryString["mid"]; menuID = 0; // Check the user is allowed here if (!Roles.IsUserInRole("Admin")) { Response.Redirect("../default.aspx"); } // Get the menu ID if (int.TryParse(menuIDdata, out menuID)) { menuID = int.Parse(menuIDdata); }else{ menuID = 0; } } Administration "> Admin Home "> User Manager "> Products Products Categories Welcome to the Admin Thanks for any help, don't pull any punches.
