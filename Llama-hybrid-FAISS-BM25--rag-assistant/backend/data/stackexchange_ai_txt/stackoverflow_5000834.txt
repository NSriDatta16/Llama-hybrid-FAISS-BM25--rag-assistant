Quicksort is a sorting algorithm invented by C. A. R. Hoare that has an average-case complexity of O(n log n) and worst-case quadratic complexity. It is one of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms. Quicksort has a space complexity of O(1) as elements in the array are swapped into place so no new arrays are created. The logic of a quicksort is to pick one of the elements and divide list into two based on this element, with the smaller element in the one list and the larger elements in the other list, and then sort the two lists.
