how it produce multiple token for each lexeme?

I just started reading The Dragon Book and I'm finding difficulty in understanding some statements. It says: "lexical analyser produce sequence of token for each lexeme in the source program". Can you please help me to understand the above line? I know about tokens and lexemes, but what is meant by producing multiple token for each lexeme....AFAIK LEXEME itself compromising a single token. The complete quote is as follows: "As the first phase of compiler, the main task of the Lexical Analyser is to read the input characters of the source program, group them into lexemes, and produce as output a sequence of tokens for each lexeme in the source program." The above quote is from chapter 3..section 3.1 under the heading "role of lexical analyser" page number is 109
