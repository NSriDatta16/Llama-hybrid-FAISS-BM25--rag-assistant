Need advice on organizing an SVN repository

I've been working on a one-person project for a while and I'm using an online-hosted SVN repository as source control. Now, we are hiring a few offshore developers to help me on the project. My concern is, I don't want them to start checking code in to my repository at least while they are learning. I'd rather have them check it in to some intermediate place and then I'd merge it into my repository myself. I'm not too familiar with internals of SVN, my use of it pretty simple, so I don't know if it supports such a workflow. Just as a side note, I use TortoiseSVN as SVN client. Could someone please help me figure this out?
