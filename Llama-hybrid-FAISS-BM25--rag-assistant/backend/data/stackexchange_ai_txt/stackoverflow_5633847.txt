Did you install and start mongo-db on your system? This error is mostly because of a missing mongo instance running on the local machine. Check out the follwing code excerpts from chat.io. main.js: /** * Configure the user provider (mongodB connection for user data storage) */ var userProvider = new UserProvider('localhost', 27017); Creates a new UserProvider object using host and port for database (localhost:27017, mongo-db default). UserProvider.js: UserProvider = function(host, port) { this.db = new mongo.Db('node-mongo-chat', new Server(host, port, {auto_reconnect: true}, {})); this.db.addListener('error', function(error) { console.log('Error connecting to mongo -- perhaps it isn\'t running?'); }); this.db.open(function() { }); }; Opening the connection to the server, printing out an error on failure (the error you mentioned above). Consider reading up on the mongo-db docs concerning installation and setup here
