I would recommend separating your data access layer from your ViewModel and using an observable collection. Once you leverage MVVM better this sort of thing isn't that hard. I suggest that you read Josh Smith's article on MVVM , it will give you a great insight to WPF and it's binding capabilities. Accomplishing what you're trying to do in WPF is quite easy once you understand how it's working. Good luck!
