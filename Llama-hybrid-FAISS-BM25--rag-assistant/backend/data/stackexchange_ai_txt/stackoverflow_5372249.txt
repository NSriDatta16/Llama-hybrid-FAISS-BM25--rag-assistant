WCF Configuration - basicHttpbinding

I have problem with basic configuration of WCF. I am working on MobilePhone Application . First I created test desktop appliction which use basicHttpBinding and everything was fine. Next I used the same code (Only difference is in ServerReference - In phone I used Two Server Files generated using NetCFSvcUtil). In Phone Application I am getting Endpoint no Found Exception. Below I am putting my configuration. I would be grateful for help or suggestions. Regards. Exception on Phone side: There was no endpoint listening at http://localhost:4444/Service/PhoneService that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details. Phone Configuration: ** revelant fragment of Server Configuration** //______________________________// * Configuration in browser * PhoneService Service You have created a service. To test this service, you will need to create a client and use it to call the service. You can do this using the svcutil.exe tool from the command line with the following syntax: svcutil.exe http://localhost:4444/Service/PhoneService?wsdl This will generate a configuration file and a code file that contains the client class. Add the two files to your client application and use the generated client class to call the Service. For example: C# class Test { static void Main() { PhoneServiceClient client = new PhoneServiceClient(); // Use the 'client' variable to call operations on the service. // Always close the client. client.Close(); } }
