Getting the answer wrong is what I want from an applicant in some cases. One of the reasons I like to ask a question that I think the applicant will get wrong is to see how they adjust to the situation. How they handle getting something wrong and handle someone telling them how they should have answered etc. If they are very defensive or rude when you tell them they are incorrect then it is a good indication of how they will work on a team when many times your ideas will be challenged. If they take the solution or recommendation and realize they can learn from it or even add to it that is usually a sign of someone what is easy to work with and willing to work 'outside of their box'. If they just make excuses and dance around trying to say why they could be right or should be right (in cases where they are clearly not) then this tell me when the same issue arises in the future this applicant is going to cause headaches. Not so worried about the answer, more interested in how they react to the question / solution. Another reason would be to gauge their level when hiring as well. You might be hiring for a bunch of positions but not sure where this applicant fits. Hard questions that show problem solving and attention to detail can sometimes make it easier to categorize their skill set.
