The better long-term solution is to not use mod_python, since mod_python is no longer in development, and will not be supported in future versions of Django. Consider using mod_wsgi instead. The Django documentation has this to say about mod_python: Support for mod_python has been deprecated, and will be removed in Django 1.5. If you are configuring a new deployment, you are strongly encouraged to consider using mod_wsgi or any of the other supported backends.
