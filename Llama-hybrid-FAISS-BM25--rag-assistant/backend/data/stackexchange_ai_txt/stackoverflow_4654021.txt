No it's not - you can have a table stored as data (i.e. in an XML file), but you cannot modify the file and update it inside the XAP file (not reasonably - see SLak's answer). What you can do instead is either use Isolated Storage to store a local copy of your high scores - note that this file is per user per machine, so you cannot share one file amongst multiple users. Your other option is to use a web service (asmx or WCF) which can be hosted on the same website that serves up the XAP file. The webservice can store the high scores however it likes, and all users will be able to access all the scores. If you are using SL4 and Windows Phone 7 then you could also send push notifications to the phone upon high score updates. (You can possibly do this with the regular desktop SL app as well using WCF duplex messaging, but i don't know enough about that to comment).
