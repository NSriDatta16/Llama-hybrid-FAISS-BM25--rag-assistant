Is it legit to estimate an AR(1) model for non-stationary time series?

Suppose ${X_{t}}$ is a non-stationary process. The goal is to estimate the following AR(1) model: $$X_{t}=\alpha +\beta X_{t-1}+\epsilon_t.$$ From classical time series analysis, we know that estimating a model with non-stationary time series could yield spurious results (unless dependent and independent variables are cointegrated). From another hand, we also know that $X_{t}$ time series is stationary if $|\beta| , and non-stationary otherwise. Question: Having the above said, is it legit to still estimate an AR(1) model for ${X_{t}}$ and hope that the estimated $\beta$ will exceed 1 in absolute terms, and therefore indicate that the series is not stationary? Or it is not legit to estimate the model, and first differencing is still needed? EDIT: The motivation for this question is the following. I have thousands of univariate time series, and data generating process (DGP) for each is unknown. For each of them I want to estimate an AR(1) model to estimate the magnitude of $\beta$ . Also, I want to determine if the series is stationary or not (or at least have some hint about it), as it is not realistic to manually conduct a formal ADF test for each series (since specification of the test equation requires some manual work -- for example, AIC is not always best way to select lag order of the equation).
