Longitudinal ordinal regression using Markov models can deal with the situations you described. For example in a first-order Markov proportional odds logistic model the current count has the previous count as a covariate, and the way in which you model the previous count can give rise to increasing, decreasing, or stable current counts. A large amount of background information, detailed case studies, and R code may be found at https://hbiostat.org/proj/covid19 . Examples show how to marginalize over the previous count to get the unconditional distributions over time. For that purpose the Bayesian examples are most relevant because they easily allow you to get posterior probabilities and uncertainty intervals about any derived quantities you want, including mean counts and mean time in states. Ordinal models don't assume a distribution for the counts.
