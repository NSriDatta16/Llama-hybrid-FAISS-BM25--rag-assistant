Classification with one labeled sample in population

I'm a new to machine learning and data science in general but I'm eager to learn. I consequently apologize in advance for how this question will appear very basic and be completely out of contenxt. If it is the case, don't hesitate to stop me, I'll be happy to remove the question from this stackexchange. That being said, I was wondering, in my quest to learn Machine Learning, what would be the best way to solve a problem involving tweets. I have in one hand around 800 tweets taken from a specific account and on the other hand around 80,000 tweets taken randomly from twitter's stream. What I want to do is to train the machine to recognize any tweet taken from a general flow as "relevant" or "unrelevant" compared to this specific account. My first asumption was that a large number of randomized tweets against a small amount of "labeled" data could be enough to classified the set in two categories. Am I correct? Is 80,000 too little? If it is a good approach, I was thinking of using a Navie Bayes or KNeighbors Classifier as estimors. Is that also correct? I'm sure your feedbacks will be very helpful and I thank you in advance for your precious time.
