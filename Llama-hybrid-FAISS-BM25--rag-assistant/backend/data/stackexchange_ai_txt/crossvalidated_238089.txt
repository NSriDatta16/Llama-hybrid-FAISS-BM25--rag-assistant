Beta distribution on flipping a coin

Kruschke's Bayesian book says, regarding the use of a beta distribution for flipping a coin, For example, if we have no prior knowledge other than the knowledge that the coin has a head side and a tail side, thatâ€™s tantamount to having previously observed one head and one tail, which corresponds to a = 1 and b = 1. Why would no information be tantamount to having seen one head and one tail -- 0 heads and 0 tails seems more natural to me.
