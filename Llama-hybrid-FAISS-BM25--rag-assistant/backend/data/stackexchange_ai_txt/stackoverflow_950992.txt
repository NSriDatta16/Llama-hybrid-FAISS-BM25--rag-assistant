Version Tolerant Serialization - How to find AssemblyName of the original

In .NET 2.0 (and upwards, I presume), Version Tolerant Serialization will succesfully deserialize a serialized object from an older version of the assembly in which the object resides. When I open such a binary formatted serialized stream using a hex viewer (a simple drag'ndrop into VS will do) I can see there's assembly information contained in this stream. Is there, during deserialization, a way to retrieve this information? This can be used, for example, to apply fixups to known issues when reading in older content. UPDATE: It looks like it can't be done (apart from changing the class itself, as in Paul Betts answer, didn't test that either) so is there any other way to read this value? Is the binary format published?
