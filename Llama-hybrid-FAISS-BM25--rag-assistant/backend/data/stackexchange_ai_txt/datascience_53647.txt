Surface Pro 6 vs Macbook Pro for Professional Data Science Practice

[I strongly agree this is totally very opinionated question, thus narrators feel free to vote to close it if you feel it is right, but I find endless pros and cons on the Internet, I've decided to ask the community here.] Surface Pro 6 or Macbook Pro for Data Scientist Job? About 8 years ago I was a Windows user. The most annoying part was that it was a quite unstable. It is noted that I was not a developer or a data scientist back then. Anyways, I moved to Mac OSx both at work during my PhD studies since it was a better choice for doing Computational Physics. I totally felt great with such a smooth, stable OS that allows access to Linux kernel as well, and eventually I bought a Macbook Pro for my personal use. At present I am about to start my new role in industry as Data Scientist. The whole team is based on Microsoft, even very few developers in the team using the latest Surface Pro 6. They give me a choice of either Surface Pro 6 or Macbook Pro, although I felt it was implied they would rather me going with Surface Pro 6 (still I can choose!). The configues will be exactly the same as I wish, so this wouldn't matter. Obviously I am leaning towards Macbook Pro as I have been with for some time now and am quite efficient and productive. Nevertheless, majority of other employees are Windows-base, and I feel if I go with Mac I would be an outlier. At the same I am not feeling completely stranger around Windows and I am not totally blind! In fact recently I hear in the news a lot about Microsoft drastic changes naming: incorporating Linux kernel starting from end of this month (would be so sure if it would work as the Mac one though) in Windows 10 Pro, Visual Studio Code is a product of Microsoft that has been gaining lots of interest and I am using and loving it and perhaps would run even more smoother in Windows machine than Mac, and not that it is very relevant but Widows acquired GitHub. it is worth to mention that I will have GPU if I go with Surface Pro 6, and has a nice touchscreen feature too! I guess I still looking for an actual use case, where someone did in fact had such a transition recently, and would appreciate sharing your thoughts and feedbacks.
