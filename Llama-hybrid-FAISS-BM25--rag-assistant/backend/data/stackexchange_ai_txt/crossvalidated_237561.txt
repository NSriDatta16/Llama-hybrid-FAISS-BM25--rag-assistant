To answer your question, yes there are. There are numerical ways to determine the best cluster form. However, it is subjective which one you use. I do not think you are still looking for this 5 years after date but this can hopefully help people in the future. If you have any question on clustering, see @Ben 's elaborate answer in how to determine optimal cluster Here he discusses 8 ways to determine the number of clusters: look for a bend in the WSS elbow plot (I am currently using this, because it's easy, however, difficult to automate) Partitioning around mediods with the pamk function of fmc in R Calinsky criterion (I am not a fan, don't understand the background that well) Determine the optimal model and number of clusters according to the Bayesian Information Criterion for expectation-maximization. This is nice, maybe the closest you will get to feeling it is not subjective, because it gives an 'optimum'. Affinity propagation (AP) clustering Gap Statistic for Estimating the Number of Clusters clustergrams to visualize cluster assignment, see http://www.r-statistics.com/2010/06/clustergram-visualization-and-diagnostics-for-cluster-analysis-r-code/ The NbClust package Ben explains each one with examples with nice plots.
