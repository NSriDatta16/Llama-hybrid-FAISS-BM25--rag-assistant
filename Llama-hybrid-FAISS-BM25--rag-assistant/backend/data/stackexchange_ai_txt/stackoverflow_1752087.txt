WCF is a web service framework. Java also provides its own web service frameworks. They should be able to interoperate quite easily, although you'll need to ask a much more specific question if you want a better answer. edit: The ProjectTango link you ask about says it all in the first paragraph: ... to ensure interoperability of enterprise features, such as security, reliable messaging, and atomic transactions. These are fancy additions to basic web services, and the specifications alone are not enough to ensure compatibility. Basic web service interaction, which is all 99.9% of us ever need, will work just fine between WCF and Java.
