A couple of things: After refactoring the test, you run the test again Then, you refactor the code, then run the test again Then, you don't have to check in right away, but you could In TDD, there is no purpose in adding a test that passes. It's a waste of time. I've been tempted to do this in order to increase code coverage, but that code should have been covered by tests which actually failed first. If the test doesn't fail first, then you don't know if the code you then add fixes the problem, and you don't know if the test actually tests anything. It's no longer a test - it's just some code that may or may not test anything.
