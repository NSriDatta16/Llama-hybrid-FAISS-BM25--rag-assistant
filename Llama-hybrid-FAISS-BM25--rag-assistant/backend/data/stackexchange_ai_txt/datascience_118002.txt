You can also leverage the combination of transformers and tf-idf for topic clustering. A perfect example of this is BERTopic pip install bertopic Then, I would extract the top k topics, where k in your case would be 2. from bertopic import BERTopic from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups docs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))['data'] topic_model = BERTopic() topics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs) Read more on BERTopic here .
