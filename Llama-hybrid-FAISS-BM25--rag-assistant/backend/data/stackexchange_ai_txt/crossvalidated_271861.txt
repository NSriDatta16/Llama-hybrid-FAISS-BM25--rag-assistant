Proportions are telling a different story than odds ratios

Context Stimuli: 2 different designs (A, B) Outcome: task success (binary y/n) n = 100 Between-subjects (50 Design A; 50 design B) Interpreting the proportions suggests there is no real difference in success b/t designs Error bars are largely overlapping. Design A has an 80% success rate Design B has an 75% success rate chi-squared test (example below) suggests that success isn't contingent on design. E.g., Prop.test(c(80,75),c(20,25)) I do a logistic regression, which suggests the odds ratios, however, are significantly different. This suggests that I should generalize Design A has a significantly greater odds of success vs. non-success than Design B I get an odds ratio of 1.33, suggesting Design A has 1.33x better odds at bringing success vs. non-success than Design B. The 95% CI is large, suggesting a good deal of uncertainty, but it doesn't include 1. Sample size is low, but based on what I've garnered, 100 people and 1 predictor variable is okay for logistic regression. dilemma : these are two contradictory interpretations. I cannot seem to reconcile them. Should I choose one? How would I justify this choice? Growing hunches : Feels like my confusion is on the conceptual distinction between odds and proportions. I feel like since odds are derived from the proportions they should tell a similar story.
