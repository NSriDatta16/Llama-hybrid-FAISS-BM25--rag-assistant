If you don't have a good algorithms textbook, I'd recommend getting a copy of Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms in C, Part 5: Graph Algorithms. I own the C++ and Java versions of the book, and both are very good. I do not own the C version of the book, so it might be atrocious (I doubt it; it's probably very good too). The Parts 1-4 book is a good algorithms reference book as well; the material is presented very clearly.
