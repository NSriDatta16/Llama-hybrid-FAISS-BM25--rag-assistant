Development on mod_python has stopped and its use is no longer recommended. I suggest mod_wsgi From the mod_python Django documentation : Support for mod_python has been deprecated, and will be removed in Django 1.5. If you are configuring a new deployment, you are strongly encouraged to consider using mod_wsgi or any of the other supported servers.
