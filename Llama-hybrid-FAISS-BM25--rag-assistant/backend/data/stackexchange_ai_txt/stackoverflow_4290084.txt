CCNx Java Code Help (ProcessBuilder)

Has anyone played around with the CCNx code over from http://www.ccnx.org/ . I unzip the project and loading the .project file in the javasrc directory into Eclipse. The project builds with no errors. I'm guess I need to start the CCNDaemon (org.ccnx.ccn.impl.support.CCNDaemon) but I get an error at: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "../ccnd/agent/ccnd": error=2, No such file or directory at java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start(ProcessBuilder.java:460) at org.ccnx.ccn.impl.support.CCNDaemon$CCNDWorkerThread.initialize(CCNDaemon.java:93) at org.ccnx.ccn.impl.support.Daemon$WorkerThread.run(Daemon.java:125) It looks like its trying to build a new process with private static final String DEFAULT_CCND_COMMAND_STRING = "../ccnd/agent/ccnd"; protected String _command = DEFAULT_CCND_COMMAND_STRING; ... ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(_command); I don't have the ccnd operating system process. Do I need to build the C++ code? Or is there some way to run this with pure java? Thanks for the help!
