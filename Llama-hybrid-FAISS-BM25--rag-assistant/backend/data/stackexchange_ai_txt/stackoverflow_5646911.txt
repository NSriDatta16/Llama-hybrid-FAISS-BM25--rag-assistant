Don't create the SearchFormFragment in XML. Instead have an empty FrameLayout which you populate in Activity.onCreate() without adding it to the back stack. This way the Activity will keep the current Fragment instead of trying to add the one specified in XML. Also, using AsyncLoader may be a better approach, see http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=14944
