Why using MCMC, not LHS (Latin Hypercube Sampling)?

Let's say I have to find the posterior distribution of a Bayesian estimate. Why should I use an MCMC chain of length 10,000 but not do a Latin Hypercube Sampling of 10,000 samples and calculate* the corresponding posterior distribution values? What is the advantage of using MCMC over LHS? *calculation: (prior) * (likelihood) / (normalizingConstant) at the lhs points.
