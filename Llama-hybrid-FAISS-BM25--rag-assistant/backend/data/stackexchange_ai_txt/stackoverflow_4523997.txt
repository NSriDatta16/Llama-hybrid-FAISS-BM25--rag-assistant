Looking for a simple example to fire "make" from Maven2

This is a transitional solution. I don't want to write my own plugin. I have too many small, scattered makefiles to convert to pom.xml all at once. I'm trying to move to Maven2 as a skunkworks project and gradually migrage new + changing code to pom.xml files. The arch-independent C/C++ solutions are not needed - plus the Makefile run multiple scripts to generate code before compilation. Any pointers to extending "mvn deploy" to handle "make deploy" would be great. Thanks AJ
