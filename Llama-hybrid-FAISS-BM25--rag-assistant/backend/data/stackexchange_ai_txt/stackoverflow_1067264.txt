The best way to learn in my opinion would be to work on a small hobby project. For instance, lets say you are interested in sports, pick up your favorite sport and envision how you would model the sport statistics in the most elegant way in the form of a SQL database. You would start thinking on the lines of how to pull data out of the db, update the data , so on and so forth. Whenever you encounter an issue, you can go look at the reference books (The T-SQL querying book mentioned above is a very good one) and figure out the best way of doing it. Toy examples,exercises are good. But in my opinion, unless you really face a problem and solve it on your own, the fundamentals don't stick into your head. Articles like this http://www.sommarskog.se/dynamic_sql.html are also extremely helpful, since they provide insight into how, why and why not.
