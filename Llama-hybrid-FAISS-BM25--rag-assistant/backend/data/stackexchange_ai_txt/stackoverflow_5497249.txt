No, you need to fire an event. If it's just Internet Explorer then it's easy to pass the required button value of 2, i.e. NameValueCollection eventProperties = new NameValueCollection(); eventProperties.Add("button", "2"); yourElement.FireEvent("onmousedown", eventProperties); If you are working with FireFox then it is not so simple, you can read my older question to which the WatiN developer kindly responded. As he notes elsewhere this should be within WatiN. The same approach will let you drag and drop within FireFox.
