I cant be sure but It feels like you are not accounting for the use case where one page may not have finished rendering while another comes into the pipe. The line in loadSinglePageWithWidth:(float)width andHeight:(float)height myPageRef = CGPDFDocumentGetPage(... feels especially unstable even if wrapped in the @synchronised pragma. I think you need to account for that situation and cancel any existing renderings/animations before allowing the next one to begin. SO isnt a debugger.
