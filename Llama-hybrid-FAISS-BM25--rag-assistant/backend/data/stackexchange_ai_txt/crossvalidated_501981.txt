Making a continuous distribution from a discrete histogram

I was handed a discrete histogram of a random variable $x$ . How do I generate 2,000 continuous samples from the histogram which represent the original random variable $x$ ? My first thought is to fit a line to the cdf of the histogram then generate samples under the line using the inverse transform method. Is this a good approach? Do other sensible methods exist? Clarification By continuous I mean that the random variable $x$ is continuous, but all I have is a histogram which is a discrete representation of $x$ . Background/Purpose I have millions of models, each with 40,0000 samples from Bayesian models. I do not have the space to store the 40,0000 samples generated from the these prediction. The goal is to store a function, histogram (the focus of this question), summary statistics, samples, etc. that represent the original distributions. A simple solution would be to store a smaller number of the samples, but I am interested in trying other methods.
