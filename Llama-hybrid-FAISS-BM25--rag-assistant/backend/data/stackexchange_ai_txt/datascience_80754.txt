How to convert DNA sequences in FASTA format to OneHot Encoded Pandas Dataframe for Neural Networks?

DNA sequences in FASTA format look like: CATGCATTAGTTATTAATAGTAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCA... I am trying to convert them into one-hot encoded data in a Pandas dataframe so that I can use various neural networks to analyze them. This has probably been done many times. Can someone point me to references or Python packages for it?
