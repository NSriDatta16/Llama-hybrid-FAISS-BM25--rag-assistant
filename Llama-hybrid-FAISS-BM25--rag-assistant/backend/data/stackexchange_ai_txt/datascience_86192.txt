Modeling Encoder-Decoder according to instructions from a paper

I am new to this field and I was reading a paper "Predicting citation counts based on deep neural network learning techniques". There the authors describe the code that they implemented if someone wants to reproduce the results. I tried to do this but I am not sure if I succeeded. Here is their description: -RNN module - SimpleRNN -Output dimension of the encoder - 512 -The output layer - Dense layer -Activation function - ReLU -Overfitting prevention technique - Dropout with 0.2 rate -Epochs - 100 Optimization algorithm - RMSProp Learning rate - 10^{-5} Batch size - 256 And here is my implementation. I am not sure if the model I created is sequence to sequence. epocsh = 100 batch_size = 256 optimizer = keras.optimizers.RMSprop(lr=0.00001) model = keras.models.Sequential([ keras.layers.SimpleRNN(512, input_shape=[X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1]], activation='relu', return_sequences=True, dropout=0.2), keras.layers.Dense(9) ]) model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=[keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()]) The summary of this model is: _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= simple_rnn (SimpleRNN) (None, 154521, 512) 266240 _________________________________________________________________ dense (Dense) (None, 154521, 9) 4617 ================================================================= Total params: 270,857 Trainable params: 270,857 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ Any help would be appreciated. Thank you! Update: Here is the dataset. year venue c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 1989 234 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 8 8 10 11 12 1989 251 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1990 346 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I need to give as an input all the columns until c5, and try to predict the other c's (which are citation count for the upcoming years).
