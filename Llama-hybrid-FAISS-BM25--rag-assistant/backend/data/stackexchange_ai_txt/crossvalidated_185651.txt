Plenty of good counter examples in here. Let me just add a paragraph about the heart of the problem. You are looking for a correlation between $X_i$ and $Y_i$. That means that $X$ and $Y$ both tend to be large for the same $i$ and small for the same $i$. So a correlation is a property of $X_1$ linked with $Y_1$, $X_2$ linked with $Y_2$, and so on. By sorting $X$ and $Y$ independently you (in most cases) lose the pairing. $X_1$ will no longer be paired up with $Y_1$. So the correlation of the sorted values will not measure the connection between $X_1$ and $Y_1$ that you are after. Actually, let me add a paragraph about why it "works" as well. When you sort both lists, let's call the new sorted list $X_a$, $X_b$, and so on, $X_a$ will be smallest $X$ value, and $Y_a$ will be the smallest Y value. $X_z$ will be the largest $X$ and $Y_z$ will be the largest $Y$. Then you query the new lists if small and large value co occur. That is, you ask if $X_a$ is small when $Y_a$ is small. Is $X_z$ large when $Y_z$ is large? Of course the answer is yes, and of course we will get almost perfect correlation. Does that tell you anything about $X_1$'s relationship with $Y_1$? No.
