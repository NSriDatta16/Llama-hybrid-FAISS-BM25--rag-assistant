If your shop is predominately C# and that's really what you want your project to be developed in, I would encourage the other developer to learn C# rather than compromising your project to account for lack of knowledge of one of your team members. That's not to put down your other team member, but if he/she has a good grasp of .Net in general, then there's no reason that this person couldn't learn C#. We have a mix of both at my company, however, the choice to use VB.Net always depends on if we are porting an existing VB6 application to .Net, in which case it makes sense to use VB.Net since less code has to be rewritten (in most cases). But we'd never let developer skill dictate whether to use C# or VB.Net, we'd choose the best tool for the job, and that should always be the decision point.
