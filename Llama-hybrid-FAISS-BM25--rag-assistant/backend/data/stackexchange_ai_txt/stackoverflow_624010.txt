Although NSStatusItems appear near Apple's internal "menu extras", they are distinct and behave differently. It would be nice if Apple unified the items that can appear in the right-hand area of the menu bar, but for now the section is split into distinct "apple internal" (on the right), and "app-provided (NSStatusItem)" on the left. You can visualize the distinction by putting your computer into screen capture mode (cmd-shift-4), and pressing the space bar to switch to "capture whole window". When you hover over Apple's menu icons, you'll see that they all live in a single window. This explains their ability to be easily managed and dragged about. Hovering over the other items reveals that each NSStatusItem is in fact living in a single window of its own (which happens to be owned by the application that installed it). It's best to stick with NSStatusItem even though you can't drag them. It's a shortcoming from Apple which most users will understand, even if it's annoying. Emphasizing the positive tradeoffs of offering a more stable application for the long term will usually soften the opinions of your customers (or managers?) who are pushing for the draggability.
