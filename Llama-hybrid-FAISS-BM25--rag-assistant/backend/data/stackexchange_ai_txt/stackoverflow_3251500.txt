Is an e-mail queue necessary in an e-mail-heavy web app?

In a couple of recent projects, I've written an e-mail queue as a database table that is checked every minute by a cronjob. The cron script waits a few seconds in between sends. The reason I did this was because I read somewhere that it helps your e-mail not end up in the spam folder if it's not blasted out from the same server all at once. I don't remember where I read it. What do you think? Should I just mail things immediately or is an e-mail queue a good idea? What are some pros and cons to this approach? EDIT: Added last paragraph.
