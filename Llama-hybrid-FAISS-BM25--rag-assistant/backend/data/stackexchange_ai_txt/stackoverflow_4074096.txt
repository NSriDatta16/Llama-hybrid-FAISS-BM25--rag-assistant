Okay, I seem to have found a workaround. I had initially tried doing the dataTable init in each of my html files that contained the table fragments. It didn't work when I first tried it, but when I tried it again, it worked (not sure why, but I'll take it anyway. That event/rendering issue still bugs me, but at least now I don't have to worry about it for this application. Next up: getting the back button to track more than just the tabs, but the content links inside the tabs :-)
