There are many ways to estimate how good a feature is, in predicting y_i. One of the good methods is to build a proper ML model using just the feature you wanna check its importance. In this case, we will build a logistic regression model using only features which you wanna check if it is important or not. Do remember that if it a Categorical Feature encodes it to vector form based on the model which you are using, for example (one-hot encoded) works best for linear models and Response Coding works well for tree-based Models.
