How to interpret multiclass logistic regression coefficients?

I am looking to understand the printed coefficients from logistic regression for my classification problem. I have 4 classes (certain, likely, possible and unlikely, for a gene to be related to a disease). I run logistic regression like this: logreg = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', C=0.5, max_iter=500, solver='liblinear', multi_class='auto') logreg.fit(X_train, Y_train) print('All LR feature weights:') coef=logreg.coef_[0] intercept=logreg.intercept_ classes=logreg.classes_ print(coef) print(intercept) print(classes) The coefficent output looks like this: All LR feature weights: [ 0.44250477 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.53959074 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.43750937 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.2460205 0.19828843 0. -0.01036487 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. ] I understand that negative weights relates to the ability to class negative samples and vice versa with positive samples, but how do I interpret this with 4 classes? Do I need to calculat the coefficents in another way? Any help wuld be appreciated.
