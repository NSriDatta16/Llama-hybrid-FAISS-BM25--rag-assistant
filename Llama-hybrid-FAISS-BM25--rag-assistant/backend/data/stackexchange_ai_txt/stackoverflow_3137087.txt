iphone touch coordinates

Is there a way to get the coordinates off all touches currently on the display at any given time without having to keep track of all of the touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded. Because as far as I can tell getting the coordinates within any one of these functions by doing: NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; UITouch *touch = [[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; ... only reports the touches that move end or start. I need to the the cords off all fingers not just the fingers who's locations have changed.
