Training and testing transformer model from scratch

As you know, transformers are one of the strongest model in the field of NLP and machine translation. I know there are many resources, but I still could not find a good tutorial teaching how to use and train and test transformers on your own dataset (so I also want to obtain the word embeddings using my own algorithms) If someone has good recommendation, I appreciate to let me know. Thanks in advance
