I'm going to argue from an applied perspective that the mean is often the best choice for summarising the central tendency of a Likert item. Specifically, I'm thinking of contexts such as student satisfaction surveys, market research scales, employee opinion surveys, personality test items, and many social science survey items. In such contexts, consumers of research often want answers to questions like: Which statements have more or less agreement relative to others? Which groups agreed more or less with a given statement? Over time, has agreement gone up or down? For these purposes, the mean has several benefits: 1. Mean is easy to calculate: It is easy to see the relationship between the raw data and the mean. It is pragmatically easy to calculate. Thus, the mean can be easily embedded into reporting systems. It also facilitates comparability across contexts, and settings. 2. Mean is relatively well understood and intuitive: The mean is often used to report central tendency of Likert items. Thus, consumers of research are more likely to understand the mean (and thus trust it, and act on it). Some researchers prefer the, arguably, even more intuitive option of reporting the percentage of the sample answering 4 or 5. I.e., it has the relatively intuitive interpretation of "percentage agreement". In essence, this is just an alternative form of the mean, with 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 coding. Also, over time, consumers of research build up frames of reference. For example, when you're comparing your teaching performance from year to year, or across subjects, you build up a nuanced sense of what a mean of 3.7, 3.9, or 4.1 indicates. 3. The mean is a single number: A single number is particularly valuable, when you want to make claims like "students were more satisfied with Subject X than Subject Y." I also find, empirically, that a single number is actually the main information of interest in a Likert item. The standard deviation tends to be related to the extent to which the mean is close to the central score (e.g., 3.0). Of course, empirically, this may not apply in your context. For example, I read somewhere that when You Tube ratings had the star system, there were a large number of either the lowest or the highest rating. For this reason, it is important to inspect category frequencies. 4. It doesn't make much difference Although I have not formally tested it, I would hypothesise that for the purpose of comparing central tendency ratings across items, or groups of participants, or over time, any reasonable choice of scaling for generating the mean would yield similar conclusions.
