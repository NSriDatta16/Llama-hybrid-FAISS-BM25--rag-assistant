The direct answer is to call GetProjectProperties . However, I agree with John that you may be tackling a harder problem than necessary. Certainly you'd agree that writing a fully generic WIT client is hard. However, work item customization is very common, even within organizations that use a standard process template. So you probably can't get away with a one-off solution, unless you're willing to update it every time a project admin updates their bug template. Is there some reason WIWA doesn't work for you? (Note that the download link isn't valid anymore; it's now part of the broader TSWA SP1 release.) Also remember that any such application that's available to customers (not internal staff), whether WIWA or something you write yourself, requires an "external connector license" according to the TFS CAL model.
