In response to I did not fully understand why we are multiplying the intermediate conditionals i.e.: $...Pr(Burglar|Storm=T)xPr(Cat|Storm=T)...$ and Is there a logical explanation for the multiplication of the intermediate probabilities - or is it just a trick? Denoting each random variable with their first letter, the model represented using the Bayesian network suggests the following factorisation of the joint probability distribution: $$P(S, B, C, A) = P(S)P(B|S)P(C|S)P(A|B,C)$$ Via marginalisation, we have that $$\begin{align}P(A, S) &= \sum_{b \in \{0, 1\}} \sum_{c \in \{0, 1\}} P(S, B =b, C=c, A) \\ &= \sum_{b \in \{0, 1\}} \sum_{c \in \{0, 1\}} P(S)P(B = b | S) P(C=c|S)P(A|B=b,C=c) \end{align}$$ Which can be used to compute $P(A | S)$ via Bayes theorem $$P(A | S) = \frac{P(A, S)}{P(S)}$$ Lastly, in response to So, my question is where is the bayes in bayes networks? What is the relationship between bayes rule (not naive bayes) and bayesian networks? Bayesian networks are also referred to as directed acyclic graphs. Whilst you do often use Bayes theorem repeatedly when using these representations, and the representation is often associated with a Bayesian statistical approach, most texts I have seen on the subject tend to emphasise that one should not read too much into the naming. And to the best of my knowledge the name is due to historical associations rather than any deliberate semantic choice.
