If $y_t$ is a time series with autocovariance $\gamma$, does $\gamma$ necessarily have to be absolutely-summable?

If $y_t$ is a time series with autocovariance $\gamma$ , does $\gamma$ necessarily have to be absolutely-summable; i.e., ${\sum_{i=\infty}^\infty |\gamma (i)}| ? If not, what could be the simplest counter-example? If we impose the condition that $y_t$ is a stationary series, then does this condition guarantee the absolutely-summability of its autocovariances?
