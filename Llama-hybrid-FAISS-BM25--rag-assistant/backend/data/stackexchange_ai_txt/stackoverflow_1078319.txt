What to do when java.util is missing on a Mac

This is kind of weired but my Mac/Eclipse isn't offering me any java.util classes. I am still able to run the project which contains heavy use of (let's say) Vector, but I am not able to add a new Vector in the code anywhere. Eclipse isn't offereing me... I spent the last night reconfiguering the installed JRE's and build path etc. but it remains ... I am running Java 1.60 on mac. I tried Eclipse Galielo, Ganymede. What am I missing?
