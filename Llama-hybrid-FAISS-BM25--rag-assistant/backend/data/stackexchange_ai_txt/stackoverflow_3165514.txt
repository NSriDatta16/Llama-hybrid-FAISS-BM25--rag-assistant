The Infragistics controls in 2010.1 and 2010.2 are still compiled against .NET Framework 2.0. So you don't need to worry about that. You should worry about breaking changes they have made (I can remember one in UltraCombo regarding the AutoComplete, where the old property was replaced by a new one, and after upgrading the new property had the default value, which I think was "No AutoComplete").
