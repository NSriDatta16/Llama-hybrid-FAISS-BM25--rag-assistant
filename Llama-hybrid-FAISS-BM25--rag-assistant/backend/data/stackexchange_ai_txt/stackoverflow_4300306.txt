Are you running the package via SQL Server Agent? Try running the child packages individually, it may be throwing other errors. If the package runs without error, the problem is probably on the Main package settings. Some questions that may help you? 1. when you loaded the packages to the server, did you set any Protection Level (eg encrypt sensitive data with key, user key, etc?) setting these can make a package fail loading when run via SQL Server Agent 2. Try adding /msdb/ to the path of the child package.
