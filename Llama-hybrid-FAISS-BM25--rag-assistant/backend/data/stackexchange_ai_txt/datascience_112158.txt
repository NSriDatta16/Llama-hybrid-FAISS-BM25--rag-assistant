Modeling any industrial process is quite complex because there are a lot of physical and non-linear events. That's why I usually recommend simulating the most important processes first with a scientific tool like Scilab, Simulink, or Labview: https://www.scilab.org/use-cases/powerful-modeling-and-big-data-analysis-energy-transition A simulation is interesting, not only to understand how physics between things works, but also to apply a partial or complete machine learning model to optimize energy consumption. Finally, you can apply a machine learning model with Reinforcement Learning: https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/energy-py https://github.com/smasis001/smart-grid-peak-tariff-optimization/blob/master/notebooks/OptimizationAlgorithm.ipynb Or gaussian: https://github.com/jaimergp/easymecp These are just examples, there are plenty of existing energy optimization models available on GitHub.
