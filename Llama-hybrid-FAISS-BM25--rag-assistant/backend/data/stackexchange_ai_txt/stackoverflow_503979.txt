The problem you describe is vector intersection. This depends on the size of the input vectors. If the sizes of both vectors are close to each other a merge (like in merge-sort) is best. If one vector is much smaller than the other do the following: For each element of the smaller vector search for that element in the larger vector using binary search. This is a common problem in information retrieval, where you have to intersect inverted indices. There are some research papers on this.
