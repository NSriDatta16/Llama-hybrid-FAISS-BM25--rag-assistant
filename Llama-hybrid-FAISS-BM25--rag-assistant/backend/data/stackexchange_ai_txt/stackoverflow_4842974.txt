I am not using this vertnav module so I hope my answer won't be out of topic even if it is a good and Magento-correct solution. The idea is to use the "catalog/navigation" class (Block) that is just perfect for what you want to do. A bit of twicking with CSS and / or jQuery UI carousel if you will, and you're perfectly done! 1- Update layouts Open your theme's catalog.xml layout file and add the following in the node : Make sure that : your node doesn't already have a node. If so, just append the to it the template for this page is 2columns-left.phtml or update the reference name stated above accordingly. 2- Create the template file In your theme's template folder create this file : /catalog/navigation/categories-left.phtml and add the following content : renderCategoriesMenuHtml(0,'level-top') ?> On the frontend you now have a nice list of all your store categories with all necessary CSS classes already in place for tweaking and making the ones you want to appear where and when you want whether you're on an active category or want to display only any level of depth or anything else. It is as simple as playing with CSS ! You can get inspiration from the #nav lines in the original template (blank theme is really to be preferred).
