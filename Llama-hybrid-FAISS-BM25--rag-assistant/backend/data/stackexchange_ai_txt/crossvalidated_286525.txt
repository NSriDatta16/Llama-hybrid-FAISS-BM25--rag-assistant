You should not do stepwise regression or any similar approaches whether based on p-values or AIC or anything else (most certainly not without adjusting the final inferences for it), see e.g. Algorithms for automatic model selection . Whether you are looking at a Poisson or a negatie binomial model does not affect this answer, at all. Approaches like LASSO/elastic net (with cross-validation) or Bayesian shrinkage priors (e.g. the horseshoe, easily available e.g. in rstanarm) are generally preferrable.
