Deep learning with global connections/correlations

Deep learning for 1D/2D inputs usually assume some sort of local connections, whether it is using local filters, or recurrent connections etc. What if for our problem we think a connection between neighboring values/pixels is as likely as one between those far away? Suppose we get a signal with time values (or an image with pixel locations) completely randomized. Obviously this increases the complexity of the problem etc. What kind of network topology would work for this? Has anyone addressed a problem such as this? I'd still like to use things like pooling at some point to try to decrease the complexity.
