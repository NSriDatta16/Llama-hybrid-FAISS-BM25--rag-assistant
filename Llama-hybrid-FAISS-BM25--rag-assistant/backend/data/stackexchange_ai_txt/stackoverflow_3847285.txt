$sub = substr($string, 0, 10); But if you actually want to parse the URL (that is, you want it to work with all URLs), use parse_url. For "http://domen.com/aaa/bbb/ccc", it would give you an array like this: Array ( [scheme] => http [host] => domen.com [user] => [pass] => [path] => /aaa/bbb/ccc [query] => [fragment] => ) You could then compile this into the original url (to get http://domen.com/ ): $output = $url['scheme'] . "://" . $url['host'] . $url['path']; assuming $url contains the parse_url results.
