I've tried to manage data migration as I change my code and my data representation through various releases. Each time, I've ended up writing specific sql to query for objects in the old state, and to populate new columns. If there's a straightforward way to manage data migration while viewing everything as an object, I haven't thought of it, and so far, the new columns have always have simple interpretations that I could calculate in sql. Some of them have been simple enough that the code has ended up in java, and other changes have been complex enough that I wanted multiple sql statements, and so I ended up embedding them in shell and python (both, for portability) scripts. The scripts are here and the java code with method names like updateDB2008_4().
