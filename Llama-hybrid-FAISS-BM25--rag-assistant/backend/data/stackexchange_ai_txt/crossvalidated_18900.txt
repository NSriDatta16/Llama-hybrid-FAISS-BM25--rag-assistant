The output says that a2 is really insignificant. What you have is (essentially) a hypothesis test that assumes homoscedasticity and can be rejected so that you would infer there really is heteroscedasticity. What you seem to want is a test that assumes heteroscedasticity that you can reject in order to infer homoscedasticity. In principle you could have such a test, but in practice I don't think you can. Thinking like a Bayesian will help some, but it still isn't going to make a nice dividing line between "has volatility clustering" and "close enough to homoscedastic".
