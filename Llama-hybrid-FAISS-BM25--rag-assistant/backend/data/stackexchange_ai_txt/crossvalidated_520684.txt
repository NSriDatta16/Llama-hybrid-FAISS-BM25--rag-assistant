Question about the formulation of SVM

The formulation of the SVM optimization problem is: \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} & max_{w,b} \frac{1}{||w||} \\ & \text{ subject to } \\ & y_i(w^{T}x_i+b) \geq 1 \end{aligned} \end{equation} What I do not understand is why do we use $w^Tx_i+b=1$ in the setup. My question is specifically about why 1? I understand that $w^Tx_i+b$ is the equation of a hyperplane and multiplying it by binary class labels $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ we get the inequality but why do we initially not use $w^Tx_i+b = 2$ or 0 or any number. I am assuming we can adjust for this number since we have b as a hyperparameter. Thank you!
