Database table needed in different databases, how do I organise this?

I am sure this is a common problem, but I would be interested to know the best solution to this. I have an employee table in my database, and I am sure I will need it in many other databases as well. I do not want duplicate data all over the place. So how show I organise this? Should I have a company wide database as well? I am using SQL Server 2008.
