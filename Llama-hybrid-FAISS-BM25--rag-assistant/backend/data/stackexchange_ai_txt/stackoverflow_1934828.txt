The latest version of Agile Web is written for 2.2.2 I believe. For this basic app they walk you through I'm very certain it should work with 2.3.x The answer to the question for how you keep up is that you update your apps as needed and read the api and Changleogs to find out what has changed and fix the stuff that upgrades break. A great way to help with this is having a good test suite with good test coverage.
