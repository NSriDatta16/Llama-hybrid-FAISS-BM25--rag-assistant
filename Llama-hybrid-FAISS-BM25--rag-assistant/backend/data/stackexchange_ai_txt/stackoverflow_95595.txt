I guess it depends on where you want to store the text, if you need things like transactions etc. Databases like SQL Server have a type that can store long text fields. In SQL Server 2005 this would primarily be nvarchar(max) for long unicode text strings. By using a database you can benefit from transactions and easy backup/restore assuming you are using the database for other things like StackOverflow.com does. The alternative is to store text in files on disk. This may be fairly simple to implement and can work in environments where a database is not available or overkill. Regards the format of the text that is stored in a database or file, it is probably very close to the input. If it's HTML then you would just push it through a function that would correctly escape it. Something to remember is that you probably want to be using unicode or UTF-8 from creation to storage and vice-versa. This will allow you to support additional languages. Any problem with this encoding mechanism will corrupt your text. Historically people may have defaulted to ASCII based on the assumption they were saving disk space etc.
