From what I can understand _thefunction() does something to another object($headBlock?). Your class (B) changes something in that object, then class D goes and changes it back to something else. Only way to fix this is to somehow disable D's intereference or have class B's method run after it. You could use inheritance by having C inherit B instead of A, although I don't know what side-effects these might have to the structure of your program. Edit: Seeing as this is Magento we are talking about, maybe you should ask specifically about Magento either in SO or the Magento forums. There's very little you can't override in it; maybe you've taken a wrong turn somewhere in your approach?
