Sourcing multiple xml docs from single xslt

I am trying this and cannot seem to get it to work. Can someone take a look and see if I am missing something obvious. I am referencing the extra doc like this in test.xsl. This is the xml test1.xml. configuration This is the fragment call in my asp page index.aspx. I am architecting a site that will have several hundred products. I would like to have one xml doc that contains high level details such as name and image path for every product that can be sourced from everywhere, this would have a unique schema. Then have another xml doc with a unique schema that contains items specific to a sub section such as support that would contain document paths, phone numbers and etc. My question is how do I source both xml documents from within a single xslt? Thanks
