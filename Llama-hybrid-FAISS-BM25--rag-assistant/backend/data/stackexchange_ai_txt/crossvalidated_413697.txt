What does this graphs mean in linear regression?

I don't know how to interpret these graphs. Is model well fitted? And how to analyze Cook's dist Vs Leverage plot? I would be very grateful for help. Linear regresssion model shows dependence between drinks’ price=value ( given in $) and information about sunny day (1- it was sunny, 0- it wasn’t sunny).
