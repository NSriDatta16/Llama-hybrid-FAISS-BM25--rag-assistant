Out-of-sample $R^2$ is subject to one problem: it neglects the average bias of the predictions. Suppose you have a vector of realized values $r$ and two competing prediction vectors $f_1$ and $f_2=f_1+c$ where $c$ is some constant. Then the $R^2$ of $r$ versus $f_1$ will be exactly the same as the $R^2$ of $r$ versus $f_2$. Therefore, using out-of-sample $R^2$ is not a very good idea if you care about the bias of the predictions and not only the variance. Now to answer your question, MSPE is not invariant to prediction bias while the out-of-sample $R^2$ is. Therefore, in general the MSPE-optimal prediction need not coincide with the out-of-sample-$R^2$-optimal prediction given a group of competing forecasts.
