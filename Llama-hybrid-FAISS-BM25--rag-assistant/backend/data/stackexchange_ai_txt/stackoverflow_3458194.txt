sed or perl + inserting text between two lines

I have the following file: (example.txt showing down) I need to edit the file , the main issue is to append text between two known lines in the file first_line=")" second_line="NIC Hr_Nic (" For example Need to add the following: haattr -add RVG StorageRVG -string haattr -add RVG StorageDG -string haattr -add RVG StorageHostIds -string haattr -delete RVG Primary haattr -delete RVG SRL haattr -delete RVG RLinks Between The first match line ")" And the second match line "NIC Hr_Nic (" As described in example.txt file How to do this by sed ... (If its difficult by sed it can also possible with perl) remark (sed need to get two arguments the first argument is the first match line (first_line arg) the second argument is the second match line (second_line arg) example.txt file: group Hr_Grp ( SystemList = { london1 = 0, london2 = 1 } AutoStartList = { london1, london2 } ) NIC Hr_Nic ( Device = qfe0 ) IP Hr_Ip( Device = qfe0 Address = "1.1.1.1" // Virtual IP ) DiskGroup Hr_Dg( DiskGroup = hrdg ) RVG Hr_Rvg ( RVG = hr_rvg DiskGroup = hrdg ) Hr_Rvg requires Hr_Dg Hr_Rvg requires Hr_Ip Hr_Ip requires Hr_Nic Example of the file after sed edit: group Hr_Grp ( SystemList = { london1 = 0, london2 = 1 } AutoStartList = { london1, london2 } ) haattr -add RVG StorageRVG -string haattr -add RVG StorageDG -string haattr -add RVG StorageHostIds -string haattr -delete RVG Primary haattr -delete RVG SRL haattr -delete RVG RLinks NIC Hr_Nic ( Device = qfe0 ) IP Hr_Ip( Device = qfe0 Address = "1.1.1.1" // Virtual IP ) DiskGroup Hr_Dg( DiskGroup = hrdg ) RVG Hr_Rvg ( RVG = hr_rvg DiskGroup = hrdg ) Hr_Rvg requires Hr_Dg Hr_Rvg requires Hr_Ip Hr_Ip requires Hr_Nic
