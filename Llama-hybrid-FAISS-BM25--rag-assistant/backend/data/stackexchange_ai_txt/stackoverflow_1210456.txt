CoverStory for iPhone testing?

I'm trying unsuccessfully to get CoverStory working in an iPhone project. Unfortunately XCode build settings and gcc flags are a big mystery to me. :( I've managed to generate .gcno files but the .gcda files don't show. I've added -lgcov as an other linker flag, set both the GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES and GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS flags to YES as specified in the documentation but I still have no luck. I also downloaded the fat libgcov.a file from CoverStory's site and included that in my project. I am trying this with the new built in support for iPhone unit tests using a logic unit test bundle. Could this be the cause? Does the app need to run as an application in order to generate these files?
