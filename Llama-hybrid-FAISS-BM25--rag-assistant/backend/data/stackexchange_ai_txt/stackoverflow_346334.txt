I think this is what microsoft has done in SQL Server 2008 with FILESTREAM storage. It allows storage of BLOB data inside of SQL Server, but allows you to access the files directly off the disk, which gives you kick-ass performance. Microsoft released a whitepaper on managing unstructured data that you may be interested in. THere's also an MSDN article describing FILESTREAM as well as the pros & cons of file storage & whether to BLOB or not to BLOB
