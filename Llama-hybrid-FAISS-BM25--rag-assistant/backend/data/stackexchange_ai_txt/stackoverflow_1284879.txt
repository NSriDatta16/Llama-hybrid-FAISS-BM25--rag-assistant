Organization of Unit Tests in Visual Studio

I'm currently creating a paired unit test assembly for every assembly in my project, both are in the same folder. MyProject/MyProject.csproj MyProject.Test/MyProject.Test.csproj Looking at open source projects, I've seen some smaller project put all tests in one assembly, and other split it out like mine. I'm dealing with a large solution so it would be pretty crazy to put all tests in one project. I currently have msbuild logic to run tests on all *.Test.csproj files. If I had all my tests in a different folder I wouldn't need to do this. Just wondering if there are any good arguments to do things a certain way. Thanks
