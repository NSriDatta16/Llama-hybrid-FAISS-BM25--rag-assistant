You should make sure to do this with the DOM, not innerHTML (and if using the jQuery solution provided by jk, make sure that it moves the DOM nodes rather than using innerHTML internally), in order to preserve things like event handlers. My answer is a lot like insin's, but will perform better for large structures (appending each node separately can be taxing on redraws where CSS has to be reapplied for each appendChild ; with a DocumentFragment , this only occurs once as it is not made visible until after its children are all appended and it is added to the document). var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); while(element.firstChild) { fragment.appendChild(element.firstChild); } element.parentNode.replaceChild(fragment, element);
