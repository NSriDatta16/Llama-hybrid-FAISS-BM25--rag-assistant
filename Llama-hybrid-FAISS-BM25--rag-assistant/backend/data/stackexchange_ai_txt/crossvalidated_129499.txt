It appears that you are not calling pca function properly. Your array's must be X(200,3000), while you provide X(3000,200). This is from the description of princom function: the n-by-p data matrix X, and returns the principal component coefficients, also known as loadings. Rows of X correspond to observations, columns to variables. It seems that you mixed up the rows and the columns of your input matrix.
