Embedding a control in a QTableView?

I'm working a small qt app (using PyQt4) and I've come up with an idea but I'm unsure as to how to implement it. I have a QTableView that represents some data and I'd like to add another column to the QTableView that contains a checkbox control that could be wired up to some piece of the model. For example, something like this: Note the Delete column has a checkbox widget for each row (although this is a web app, not a desktop Qt app, the principal is the same). Bonus points if I can select multiple rows, right click, and choose "Check/Uncheck Selected". If any of this is unclear, drop a comment here and I'll clarify.
