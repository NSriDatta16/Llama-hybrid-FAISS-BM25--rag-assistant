Warning: Smalltalk's live dynamic environment is a red pill . Static, frozen languages will never be the same for you ;-) In a nutshell: Morphic is a virtual world where you can directly explore live objects (just like the real world). Did you ever look at a UI and... wonder "wow, that's really cool! How did they do that?" kvetch "I wish they had done X instead!" While these thoughts would lead to pain and frustration in any other environment, not so in Morphic. If you want to blow your mind, become a god in a Morphic world: Launch a Pharo image, and click on the background (which is actually the "World") to bring up the world menu: Bring up the "halos" on one of the menu options (shift-alt-click on my Mac): Drag the "Pick Up" halo (top-middle) and drop it somewhere in the world: Enjoy your menu item which is now available wherever you want it: Seriously, click it and watch the Browser open!! Ever have an option you always use that a vendor has buried three-menu-levels deep? Could this be useful?! This is a glimpse of the power of a live direct GUI environment like Morphic. If you're intrigued, read John Maloney & Randall Smith's paper Directness and Liveness in the Morphic User Interface Construction Environment
