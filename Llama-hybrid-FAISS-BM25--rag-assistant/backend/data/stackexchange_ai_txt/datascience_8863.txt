Using a word-based metric would explicitly favor word-level retrieval methods. The theory is that (just as you suggest with dwell time), the URL-level metric measures more directly the desired result. More concretely, consider a search of "alcohol from potatoes." Assume we have two pages: 1) A page that is simply a grocery list (containing "alcohol" and "potatoes") 2) A page that describes vodka or moonshine which only uses the words "ethanol" and "potatoes" but not "alcohol." A word-level metric would prefer the first result, since it contains both alcohol and potatoes.. A URL-level metric would likely label the second result as more relevant, which would allow a model to form associations beyond simple word-matching (i.e. it could learn that "alcohol" and "vodka" are associated).
