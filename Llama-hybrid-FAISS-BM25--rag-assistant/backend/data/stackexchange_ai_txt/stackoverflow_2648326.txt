You cannot cast ObjectRawRow to HeaderRow unless one inherits from the other. Interfaces have nothing to do with it. Consider: class Shape interface IHasCorners class Rectangle : IHasCorners, Shape class Triangle : IHasCorners, Shape Rectangle myRectangle = new Rectangle(); Triangle myTriangle = new Triangle(); //upcasts Shape s = (Shape)myRectangle; IHasCorners hc = (IHasCorners)myRectangle; //downcasts Rectangle r2 = (Rectangle)s; r2 = (Rectangle)hc; //upcasts s = (Shape)myTriangle; hc = (IHasCorners) myTriangle; //these downcasts won't work //the variables now reference a Triangle instance Rectangle r3 = (Rectangle)s; r3 = (Rectangle)hc;
