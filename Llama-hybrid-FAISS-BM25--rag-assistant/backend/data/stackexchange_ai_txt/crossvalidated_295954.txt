Classification Problem with large number of predictors and huge training data

I have a classification problem with over 700 predictor variables and training data with 200,000 observations. There is only one response variable. I have a feature selection problem. I am looking for techniques to determine out of the 700 predictors, which are relevant for the model. I am aware of some techniques such as regularization (Lasso and Ridge) and PCA, but not sure which technique would be feasible for my dataset. Also, are there any packages in R that can help me achieve this? Thanks, Gaerik
