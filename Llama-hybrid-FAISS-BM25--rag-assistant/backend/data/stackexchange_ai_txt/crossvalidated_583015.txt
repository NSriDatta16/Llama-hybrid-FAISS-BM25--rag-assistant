You don't need any distribution for numerical predictors, neither in logistic regression nor in any other method, nor in regularization methods like GLMNet or similar. (A variable could be "number of children". That certainly won't be normally distributed, but it is perfectly fine as a predictor.) Use all the data you can get, and if cost is a concern, sample over ranges where the model is important to you (what that means depends on your context).
