What is the difference between Binary Clasification and Multiclass classification?

Apology for posting almost one question daily. I am trying to learn some aspects of Statistical Machine learning, so every day many questions coming and if I am not finding answer in my offline peer community, I am trying to ask to you. You answer so nicely it encourages people like me to ask. I was trying to go around Naive Bayes model. It seems it supports Multi-class classification. Now there are some binary classifiers also like logistic regression. I was thinking how would be the difference of estimation between binary classification and multiclass classification.( not multinomial logistic or multilabel). If any one of the esteemed members of the group may kindly absolve my query. Thanking you in Advance, Regards, Subhabrata Banerjee.
