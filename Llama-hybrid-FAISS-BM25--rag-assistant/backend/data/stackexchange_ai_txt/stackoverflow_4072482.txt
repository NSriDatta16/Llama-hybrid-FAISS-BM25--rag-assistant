There's no reason to need C#, after all you can use Vb.net for ASP.net development :) (no joking, its a better language especially considering the embedded xml support VB has) However, for mobile development, I think you're going the wrong route for cross-platform development. For this, you're always going to get 80% of the coverage, that last 20% is going to be a pain. For example, if you choose C#, you'll get Windows and XBox, but not Playstation and very poor iPhone. So, you need the lowest common demoninator - and that's probably C++. You can put a Qt GUI on top (with the excellent QML which is possibly the best UI tech at the moment), and that'll run on most platforms - including Android. But not WinPhone7. C++ is still a good option for all platforms as even Windows will run it (C++/CLI) and there's easy bridge between objective-C and C++ anyway. Your best option is probably to go that route (and a lot of games development is done in C++ anyway so its not wasted effort). Chances are though, you're not ever going to get a single codebase to work well enough on all platforms. Perhaps javascript would be the ultimate though, as MS' Bob Muglia has said they're not focussing on Silverlight anymore, preferring HTML5+javascript for cross platform work.
