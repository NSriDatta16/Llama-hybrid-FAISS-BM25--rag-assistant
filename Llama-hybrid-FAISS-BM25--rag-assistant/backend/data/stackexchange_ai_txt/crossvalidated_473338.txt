For prcom, the principal component is implemented via SVD, where the matrix $X$ can be decomposed into: $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{W}^T $ where $\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the principal component score and $\mathbf{W}^T$ is the transpose of your eigenvectors, or transpose of your loadings as returned by the prcomp() function. So to subtract the first principal component out, you need to multiply the principal component by the transpose of the loadings and then subtract it from your original values In the example below, USArrests.2 = USArrests.1 - pca.1 $x[,1,drop=FALSE] %*% t(pca.1$ rotation[,1]) head(cbind(prcomp(USArrests.2) $x[,1],pca.1$ x[,2])) [,1] [,2] Alabama -0.8338118 0.8338118 Alaska 1.5239622 -1.5239622 Arizona 0.4983038 -0.4983038 Arkansas -0.3247326 0.3247326 California 1.2725770 -1.2725770 Colorado 1.4264063 -1.4264063 The directionality is flipped but you get back the components.
