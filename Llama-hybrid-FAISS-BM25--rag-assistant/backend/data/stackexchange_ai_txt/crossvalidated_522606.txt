Units of measurement for different feature selection techniques

I am trying to use multiple methods to select the best features, more especifically, ANOVA, Mutual information selection, Chi-2 and the internal feature selection method of Random Forest. I came across this article on how to use selection feature techniques and the references inside to the sklearn api. However, I haven't found information on the units of these methods. As you can see in the figure attached, they are significantly different and it would be nice to have each technique properly measured. Would anyone be able to share with me the units or a source where I can find them? Thank you in advance for any help!
