Synonyms of independent variable and origins of the names

The independent variable(IV) of a statistical model is a variable that is not dependent on the other variables in the model. While I have been studying statistical modeling, I've kept embarrassed with the use of different names indicating the independent variable(IV) even in the same field. It would be nice to organize the synonymous names for IV and what the origins of the names are such as the research field the name is used often. If we know this, we might be able to use a suitable term for a specific context. It's interesting to know also. You may write down the synonymous terms to the IV and the simple explanations and their origins. Thanks.
