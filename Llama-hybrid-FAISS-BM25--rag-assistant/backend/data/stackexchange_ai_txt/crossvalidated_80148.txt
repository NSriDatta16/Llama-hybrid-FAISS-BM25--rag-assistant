The method you link to in your comment should work, if you choose to follow the neural-network survival analysis approach in the article I linked to in my comment. For each patient in the model that approach uses a list of probabilities of being alive at each time of interest: 1/0 for patients known to have died, and for "censored" cases a 1 until last follow-up and thereafter the KM survival estimate. Having said that, however, I urge you to consider looking at the other neural-network approaches noted in that article and any other more recent developments; I have a fair amount of experience with survival analysis, but not with neural-network approaches. Also, although neural-network approaches can give good predictive behavior, the hidden variables make it difficult to say what predictor variables really "matter," something that clinicians typically care about. The Survival Task View page available at CRAN mirrors shows other approaches for high-dimensional data like yours that might give results easier to interpret heuristically, and the MachineLearning Task View page shows what's available for neural network and other machine-learning approaches in R.
