PDF of function $\mbox{max}(x,f(x))$

This is from the book Python for Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning . It's a good book for people that already have a math background, I believe. Anyway, there is something I don't understand and I hope you guys could give me a hand. Given $Z = \frac{X}{Y-X}$ , where $Y$ and $X$ are uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$ . I would like to obtain the density $f_Z(z)$ . That is, $$P(Z with $$ B_1 = \{0 From here it is true that $Y>X$ and that $Y>X(1/z+1)$ , but the author then states, and I quote: Putting this together gives $$A_1 = \{\mbox{max}(X,X(1/z+1)) Integrating over $Y$ as follows $$\int_0^1 \{\mbox{max}\left(X,X(1/z+1)\right) \frac{X}{1-X}$$ I get that $\frac{z-X-Xz}{z}$ is a fancy way of writing $1 - X(1/z+1)$ , but I don't know how to obtain that result and particularly how to integrate over this function $\mbox{max\{\}}$ . Plus I don't get the condition of $z$ How would you explain this? I hope this is the place for such a question. Thanks
