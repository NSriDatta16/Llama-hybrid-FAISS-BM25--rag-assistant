Depending on the size of your device's texture memory, you should implement it in this area. Indeed, texture memory is based upon sequential locality cache mechanism. It means that memory accesses are optimized when threads of consecutive identifiers try to reach data elements within relatively close storage locations. Moreover, this locality is here implemented for 2D accesses. So when each thread reaches a data element of an array stored in texture memory, you're in the case of consecutive 2D accesses. Consequently, you take a full advantage of the memory architecture. Unfortunately, this memory is not that big and with huge arrays you might be able to make your data fit in it. In this case, you can't avoid to use the global memory.
