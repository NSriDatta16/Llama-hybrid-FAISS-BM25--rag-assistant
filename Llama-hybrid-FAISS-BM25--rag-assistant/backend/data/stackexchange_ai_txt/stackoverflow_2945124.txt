You're making a common mistake of database design, storing name in one column and value in another column. This is not a relational database design. Each attribute should be named by the column name. Color, pages, shirt size, publish date, should be column names . If each product type has a distinct set of attributes, there are other solutions. See my answers to: Product table, many kinds of product, each product has many parameters for details. How do you model custom attributes of entities? Design question: Filterable attributes, SQL How to design a database schema to support tagging with categories? How to define structure in a tag-based organization? Also please read this story: Bad CaRMa: Introducing Vision before you implement a database designed around name-value pairs as you are doing.
