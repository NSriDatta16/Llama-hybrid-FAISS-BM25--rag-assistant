Classification and regression tree at once

I would like to understand if there is a machine learning algorithm that is able to handle both, polytomous (categorical) and continuous independent variables at once, to predict a continuous dependent variable. For instance, the dataset would look something like: Independent variables: Age (non categorical), Sex (categorical), Native country (categorical), Work hours per week (non categorical). Dependent variable: Income. If there is not such an algorithm to predict using at once categorical and non categorical variables, which approach you would suggest to solve this problem? Many thanks.
