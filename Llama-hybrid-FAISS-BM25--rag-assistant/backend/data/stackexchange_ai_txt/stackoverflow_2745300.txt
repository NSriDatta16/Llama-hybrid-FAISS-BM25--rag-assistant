I'm glad you're looking for percentage, because that's easy to get. Just get it running. If it runs quickly, put an outer loop around it so it takes a good long time. That won't affect the percentages. While it's running, get stackshots . You can do this with Ctrl-Break in gdb , or you can use pstack or lsstack . Just look to see what percentage of stackshots display the code you care about. Suppose the loops take some fraction of time, like 0.2 (20%) and you take N=20 samples. Then the number of samples that should show them will average 20 * 0.2 = 4, and the standard deviation of the number of samples will be sqrt(20 * 0.2 * 0.8) = sqrt(3.2) = 1.8, so if you want more precision, take more samples. (I personally think precision is overrated.)
