Signal 11, segmentation fault on iphone App exit

I have an iphone app. It seems to run fine. When I connect to a provisioned iphone to Xcode and run the App, the console log in the Organizer window, always complains about a Segmentation fault when quitting the app with the home key. Has anyone else seen this, and do you have an idea of what the problem might be? I use a thread to load web pages in the backround, but I stop the thread when exiting. My app does save some persistent information. When I use the build and analyze function I get some 2 potential memory leaks, but in each case I'm allocating an object and keeping it in an array. Any ideas, or is this normal?
