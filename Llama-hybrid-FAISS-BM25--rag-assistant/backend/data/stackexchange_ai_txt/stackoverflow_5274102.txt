Let's say you have a php file name submitForm.php, and you basically point the action of your form to submit to this php script. With in this script you handle your php side business logic, and after you are done with that you can use cURL to post a form to google doc. This is one way to do it. Here is cURL tutorial on how to submit form: PHP cURL Submit Form Try modify your code to this: $curl_connection = curl_init('https://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse'); //setup options for client url connection curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)'); //set data to be posted $post_string = "hl=en&amp;formkey=dHXVVeEUybk9UNEVYdEdrNlVOSTZMbFE6MA&amp; theme=0AX42CRXMsmRFxMDNhN2Y&amp;ifq"; curl_setopt($curl_connection, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_string); //execute the post and then close the connection curl_exec($curl_connection); Better yet Format your POST data with this traverse: //traverse array and prepare data for posting (key1=value1) foreach ( $_POST as $key => $value) { $post_items[] = $key . '=' . $value; } //create the final string to be posted using implode() $post_string = implode ('&', $post_items);
