System Requirements to train a Image Recognition Neural Network

I have 6000 Images to be trained on a Neural Network. My current PC Specs :- 32GB RAM, i5 2 core Processor, Standard GPU (No work going on GPU), 1TB Hard Disk My Neural Network Specs :- 3000 Epoch Size, 6 Batch Size Process is getting killed with these specifications. How much Hardware is required to trained it well? What would be the ideal Batch Size and Epoch Size?
