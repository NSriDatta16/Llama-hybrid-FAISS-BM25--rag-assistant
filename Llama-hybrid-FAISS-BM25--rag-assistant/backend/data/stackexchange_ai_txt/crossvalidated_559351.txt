I'll first explain the warnings. In eval(family$initialize) : non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! This occurs when you have non-integer sampling weights supplied to the weights argument. The warning is unimportant, but to prevent it from displaying you can use family = quasibinomial() instead. More on this below. glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred This means the model perfectly predicted some cases, which implies the model failed to converge to stable maximum likelihood estimates. You have perfect separation. The error comes from confint() , which calls profile() on the regression object. Because the model failed to converge, profile() produces this error. You simply cannot fit the model as-is and you need to adjust it. There are many posts on this site dealing with perfect separation in logistic regression. An additional complication is your survey weights. You cannot use the standard errors and confidence intervals produced by glm() . Instead, your uncertainty estimation needs to take into account the survey weights. The svyglm() function in the survey package does this correctly. It will still not help the model converge in the face of perfect separation; for that, you need other adjustments. This is a fairly advanced statistical problem: perfect separation in a logistic regression with survey weights. I advise you consult with an applied statistician familiar with these topics to ensure your analysis is valid.
