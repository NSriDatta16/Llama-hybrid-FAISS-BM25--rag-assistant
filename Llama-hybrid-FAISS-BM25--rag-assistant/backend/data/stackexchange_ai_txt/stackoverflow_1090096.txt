Pros: You can easily use the tag and let it degrade to flash or other filetypes/codecs for backwards compatibility without using javascript . Doesn't need a proprietary plug-in Is platform-independent while flash is not (see nr. 2) Using it will encourage other browser vendors to implement it (read as IE) The tag has semantic meaning. Comes built into the browser. No vendor lockin Cons: It's a part of an unfinished standard. A very small percentage of installed browsers support it Browser vendors have yet to agree on a standard codec
