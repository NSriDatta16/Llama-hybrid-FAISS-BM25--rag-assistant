Yes it's possible. Try this: int index = arc4rand() % count; // picks an index 0 to 4 if count is 5 // iterate through total number of elements in array for (int i = 0; i EDIT: When I first answered this I thought you were asking about picking the random index. I probably misunderstood. I also use the modulus operator to iterate arrays as in the first answer, and that's probably the more elegant approach. You can also use the if statement above, so I'll leave my answer here as an alternate.
