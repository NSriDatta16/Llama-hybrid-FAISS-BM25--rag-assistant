Given a prior distribution $\pi$ on a functional space and observations about the function values at some points, or noisy observations of the function itself, the posterior distribution $\pi(\cdot|\mathcal{D})$ can be used to derive an HPD region, $$\left\{f\in\mathcal{F}\,,\ \pi(f |\mathcal{D})\ge k_\alpha\right\}$$ at least in principle since the derivation may prove too complex in a general situation. For instance, Breth, M. (1978) Bayesian confidence bands for estimating a function . Annals of Statistics Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 649-657 seems to address this problem.
