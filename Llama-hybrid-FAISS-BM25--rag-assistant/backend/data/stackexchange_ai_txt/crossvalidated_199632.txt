Since the "change" doesn't affect the Poisson event arrival rate (correct?), it seems that you can ignore the arrival times entirely, and simply infer the change point with respect to the indices. At this point, the problem of Bernoulli change point detection has many approaches (and has been asked many times on stackexchange). If you're willing to go Bayesian, it's much easier, imho. If you do aggregate, you should definitely aggregate with a likelihood function (which mostly solves the "small number of observations" problem).
