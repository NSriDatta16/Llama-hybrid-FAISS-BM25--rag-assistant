Clearly this old question didn't get much attention, but my solution was to do the optimization, then evaluate the sum of residuals with values nearby the optimal values explicitly. This will give a parabola near the minimum. Measuring the curvature of that parabola, $b$, results in an uncertainty of $2/b$ (see Bevington & Robinson, Data Reduction and Error Analysis, equation 8.11).
