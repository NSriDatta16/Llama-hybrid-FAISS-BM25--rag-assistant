Is it possible to interpret the bootstrap from a Bayesian perspective?

Ok, this is a question that keeps me up at night. Can the bootstrap procedure be interpreted as approximating some Bayesian procedure (except for the Bayesian bootstrap)? I really like the Bayesian "interpretation" of statistics which I find nicely coherent and easy to understand. However, I also have a weakness for the bootstrap procedure which is so simple, yet delivers reasonable inferences in many situations. I would be more happy with bootstrapping, however, if I knew that the bootstrap was approximating a posterior distribution in some sense. I know of the "Bayesian bootstrap" (Rubin, 1981), but from my perspective that version of the bootstrap is as problematic as the standard bootstrap. The problem is the really peculiar model assumption that you make, both when doing the classical and the Bayesian bootstrap, that is, the possible values of the distribution are only the values I've already seen. How can these strange model assumptions still yield the very reasonable inferences that bootstrap procedures yield? I have been looking for articles that have investigated the properties of the bootstrap (e.g. Weng, 1989) but I haven't found any clear explanation that I'm happy with. References Donald B. Rubin (1981). The Bayesian Bootstrap. Ann. Statist. Volume 9, Number 1 , 130-134. Chung-Sing Weng (1989). On a Second-Order Asymptotic Property of the Bayesian Bootstrap Mean. The Annals of Statistics , Vol. 17, No. 2 , pp. 705-710.
