I understood your original question and the clarification to be asking for two different things. If you're trying to make a page that displays short text centered and a long paragraph justified then you could use javascript to check the length of the text and apply the appropriate style. It would be pretty straightforward to do something like this with jquery: Text above a certain length can be displayed as justified and shorter text can be centered ... var maxLength = 100; function sizeParagraph(){ if($('#fixed_text').text().length > maxLength){ $('#fixed_text').css('text-align','justified'); } else { $('#fixed_text').css('text-align','center'); } }
