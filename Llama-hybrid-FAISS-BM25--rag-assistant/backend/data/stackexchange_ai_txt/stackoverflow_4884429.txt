Export Facebook Friends Email Address Android

I am on a project that involve facebook integration. Following the http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile i am able to integrate the sdk into my application and it runs pretty smooth as well. Its like a portal where i just need to enter my facebook credential and it will open the facebook content for me within my app screen.We cant manipulate anything from here. What i want a way to enter my facebook credentials and retrieve my all friends email addresses as list which i can use in my application as i want.like displaying them in a ListView Like the yahoo.com which on asking facebook credentials , saves a csv file on to the desktop that has all the list of friends addresses. That means facebook do allow retrieval of friends email after proper authentication. I tried FBRocket as well. it didnt seem to work... How to programatically achieve this.
