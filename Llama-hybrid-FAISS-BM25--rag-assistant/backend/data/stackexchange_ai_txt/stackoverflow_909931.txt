There is a "Faceted Search" module ( http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search ) that offers an interesting concept of search, also applicable to CCK fields too. You can see a demo here . It rather offers you to select existing value sets (facets) and browse them elegantly, but still it's a search. (Use together with http://drupal.org/project/cck_facets )
