Multinomial regression

When I run my multinomial regression (SPSS) I get errors that there are too many empty cells in the sub populations. I have merged categories in my IVs to the extent possible. My DV has 4 categories. While less than ideal, could I run multiple models, each containing only a few IVs? Alternatively, I could take each category of my DV and merge the remaining three and conduct logistic regression on each category of my DV but using all my IVs. For example, my 4 categories are occupations: transportation, healthcare, education, and service. Could I create a dichotomous variable transportation and non transportation (comprised of healthcare, education, and service) and run each as a binary logistic regression. I'm not sure which option would be best?
