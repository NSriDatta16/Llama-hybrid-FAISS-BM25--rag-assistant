If flat file formats are being used take a look at this library: http://www.filehelpers.com/ . The library will allow you to represent a format using a class with class and member attributes. Also, it is easy to get carried away with re-use at this level of granularity. If generating file formats is not the core of what you're working on, it is more important to pay attention to architecture at a higher level then re-usability in file generation. Moreover, it might be helpful to keep formatting routines isolated from each other, so that changes for one format do not affect the other. Incorporating unit tests will further improve maintainability.
