How to minimize prediction lag using LSTM model?

I am trying to use LSTM model to do prediction on index, but I find that it has quite obvious time lag on prediction. I tried different timestep and seems no significant improvement. Actually what, in LSTM model , is affecting the lagging issue? Below is part of my code. Dataset (moving average, Stop&Reverse, Exponential Moving Average of S&P500):
