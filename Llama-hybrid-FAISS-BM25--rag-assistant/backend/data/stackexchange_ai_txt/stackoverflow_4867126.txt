Win 7 and ODBC with 64 bit

I am developing an ASP.NET Application and am trying to use the 64-bit driver version of ODBC on my 64 bit win 7 machine, because the deployment server has Windows Server 2008, which is naturally in 64 bit, since Microsoft decided not to make a 32 bit version afaik. The first issue was an System.Data.Odbc.OdbcException "ERROR [IM014] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the Driver and Application" . Despite the fact, that I am developing on a 64 bit operation system, the compiler seems to have decided to compile for 32 bit. After some research I changed the target platform to x64 in every of my (own) assemblies. I am using NHibernate and Spring.Net, but I read somewhere that 64 bit is no problem for NHibernate. I did not check Spring.Net yet. The compilation began. I got some warnings that quite every .net assembly is built for another platform, but I read somewhere again that I can ignore these warning and the application should run just fine because the runtime (or compiler?) will figure out the right assembly. So I tested the application right away and was rewarded with an System.BadImageFormatException (wrong format). It was again an exception concerning 32/64 bit issues although every one of my assemblies is compiled as 64 bit. I am slowly starting to hate 64 bit. Seriously. Is it that difficult to build an 64 bit application on an 64 bit operation system for a 64 bit server with 64 bit drivers? Does anybody have a solution or have experience with this issue? I found many workarounds with using 32 bit, but that is not an option here. It has to be a 64 bit solution. Nevertheless I will continue trying for myself to solve this. I will write any progress here. Update: Spring.Net seems to be just fine on 64 bit since the assembly is "dynamically compiled at runtime to the native machine architecture".
