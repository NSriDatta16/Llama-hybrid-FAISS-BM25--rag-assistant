What does xgb's scale_pos_weight parameter do for regression?

From other posts (see Unbalanced multiclass data with XGBoost ) and the documentation, scale_pos_weight in XGBoost appears to balance positive and negative cases, which seems to apply only to classification. However, it also appears to be an option in XGBRegressor (see documentation ). Before I dive into the source code, can someone explain what this does for regression?
