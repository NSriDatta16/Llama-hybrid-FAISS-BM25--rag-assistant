You might take a look at Ragel . It is a state machine compiler/lexer that is useful for implementing on-the-wire protocols. I have read reports that it generates very fast code. If you don't need a parser and template engine, ragel has less overhead than ANTLR. If you need a full-blown parser, AST, and nice template engine support, ANTLR might be a better choice.
