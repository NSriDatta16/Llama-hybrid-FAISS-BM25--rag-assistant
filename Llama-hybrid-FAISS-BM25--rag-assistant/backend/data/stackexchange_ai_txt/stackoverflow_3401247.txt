Set ListView Scrollable

When I do a ListActivity my ListView works correctly : I can scroll by dragging with the TouchScreen or with the Mouse Wheel. However when I incorporate a ListView in a layout (with buttons, textview, linearLayouts, ect... ) I can't scroll it by dragging, I can just scroll with the mouse wheel. How can I enable the "touch" scroll of a listView (outside a list activity) ?
