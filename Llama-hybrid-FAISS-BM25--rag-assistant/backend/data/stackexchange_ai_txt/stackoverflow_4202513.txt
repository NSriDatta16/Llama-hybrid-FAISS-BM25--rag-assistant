Qt manually change the ratio between items in layout

I have two QTreeView s in a QHBoxLayout . QAbstractItemView::NoEditTriggers QAbstractItemView::NoEditTriggers When I resize the QMainWindow the two QTreeView s get resized with an 1:1 ratio between them. Now I would like to manually change it in the running program through dragging the space between them. This is somewhat a standard behavior but I don't get the name of it.
