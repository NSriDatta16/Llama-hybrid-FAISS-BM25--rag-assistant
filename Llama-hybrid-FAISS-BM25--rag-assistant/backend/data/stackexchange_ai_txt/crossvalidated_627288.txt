LSE is a deterministic metric, but MSE is a stochastic (statistical) metric. to choose a proper metric you should know your question. if problem is stated in statistical expression, you should use MSE, and in deterministic approaches like deterministic regression you should use LSE. In neural network training, because output is given, deterministic approach is desirable. But in when you know statistics of output, weighting with probability metrics will give better results, which is MSE.
