I suggest you compare DVCS on features and workflow rather than speed and disk space. Disk space is pretty cheap and both Git and Mercurial are pretty efficient for storage. As for speed, neither one will let you down even for very big projects. Go for features and one that agree with the workflow you use (or want to use). As for the difference in storage space in your example, git doesn't track individual files so it will notice the content being repeated and be more efficient (while taking more time)... yet, how often does that happen in real life? I suggest you read mpe's linked posts/articles too. :D
