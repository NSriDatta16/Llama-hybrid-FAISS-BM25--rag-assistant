Emerging/Disappearing correlation in time series (Pearson correlation)

[My first question here. Thanks for taking the time to look into it!] I am working on public health data where I calculate the correlation between incident counts (zero or positive integers) from two different locations. I calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient r - as I am testing for a linear relationship. Every month, new data points become available. I am looking for an effective tool to identify when two locations start (or stop) to be correlated. I want to answer the following kind of question: Were the incident counts at the two locations correlated in the most recent N months? Currently, my approach is to take data for the N (N=9) most recent months from two locations and calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and track how it develops over time. I check whether it is increasing or decreasing and whether it is statistically significant. Is this approach valid? Assuming that this approach is solid, I need to choose the appropriate N: I am concerned to end up with spurious results if I use not enough data points. However, if I use more data points, the information becomes available too late to be useful, in other words, decision makers need to know as soon as possible. With a lower N, the p value for the correlation coefficient increases. It gets harder to get statistically significant results as N decreases. Fair. Is there anything else that can help me set N appropriately so that I don't miss real correlations as they emerge and don't report spurious correlations?
