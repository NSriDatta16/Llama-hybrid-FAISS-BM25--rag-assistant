LSSVM: the estimation function in the case of multiclass classification task

A version extended from the SVM is the LSSVM (least square support vector machine) lssvm wiki . The y(x) is like in SVM it gives us the sign y(x)= sign(alpha* k(.,.)* y + b) in other words the sign of " alpha* k(.,.)* y + b"= Q which is +1 or -1 I guess I missed somthing does this means that it gives me the sign of the Q (since this Q is number and could be positive or negative is not it if positive it would be affected to class +1 otherwise -1 ? am I correct! suppose now that we deal with multiclass please see the figure I'd joined I would have for example for an object of the first class [-1 1] see the first columns of the matrix in this case what the " sign(alpha* k(.,.)* y + b)" would give me !! there is no +1 or -1 it is a couple ! How to interpret this please !
