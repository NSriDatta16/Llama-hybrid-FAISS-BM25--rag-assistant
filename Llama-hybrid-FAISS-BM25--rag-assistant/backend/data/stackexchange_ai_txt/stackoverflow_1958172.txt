When security is high, a new session ID get generated on every request. It is practically impossible to create a single-sign-on solution between two applications by sharing a session cookie in this case, since Cake will constantly change the session ID without notifying the other application. When security is medium (or higher), session.referer_check is enabled. When security is low, you don't have either of the above features, but it is still just as secure as any average PHP website/CMS out there.
