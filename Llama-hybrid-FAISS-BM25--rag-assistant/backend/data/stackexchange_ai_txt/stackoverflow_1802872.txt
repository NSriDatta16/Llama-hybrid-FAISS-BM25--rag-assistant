Google Maps centering or marker positioning issue

I develop a simple Google Maps application. I need just to place one marker on the map. For whatever reason, the marker is placed outside of the visible area of the map. It's a little bit strange, because the map is centered to the marker's coordinates. Here is the code: var point1 = new GLatLng(location1.lat,location1.lon); map1.setCenter(point1, 15); var marker1 = new GMarker(point1); map1.addOverlay(marker1); map1.setCenter(point1); When we drag the map a little bit, we can see the marker. What do I need is to center the map in the way the marker will be visible without map dragging. Can anyone help me?
