When you attempt to instantiate a block object, if Magento can't find the class it will log the error, not render the block, and move along. This happens in a few places throughout the code base, but the most likely place is in File: app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Layout.php protected function _getBlockInstance($block, array $attributes=array()) { if (is_string($block)) { if (strpos($block, '/')!==false) { if (!$block = Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName($block)) { Mage::throwException(Mage::helper('core')->__('Invalid block type: %s', $block)); } } if (class_exists($block, false) || mageFindClassFile($block)) { $block = new $block($attributes); } } if (!$block instanceof Mage_Core_Block_Abstract) { Mage::throwException(Mage::helper('core')->__('Invalid block type: %s', $block)); } return $block; } //... public function getBlockSingleton($type) { if (!isset($this->_helpers[$type])) { $className = Mage::getConfig()->getBlockClassName($type); if (!$className) { Mage::throwException(Mage::helper('core')->__('Invalid block type: %s', $type)); } $helper = new $className(); if ($helper) { if ($helper instanceof Mage_Core_Block_Abstract) { $helper->setLayout($this); } $this->_helpers[$type] = $helper; } } return $this->_helpers[$type]; } So, your two specific errors. Magento can't instantiate a Mage_CatalogInventory_Block_Qtyincrements That's probably because in the layout that ships with 1.8 the core code tried to use a block that would instantiate a This is a 1.8 bug. I'd contact Magento Enterprise support for a patch. As mentioned by @clockworkgeek it looks like the community edition suffered a similar problem. The patch in that thread is worth looking at for a fix, but I'd be wary of applying a patch meant for Enterprise Edition to Community Edition. In your second error, Magento can't instantiate a Mage_Navadmin_Block_Navadmin There is no Navadmin module that ships with Enterprise 1.8. Based on the block name, that means there's probably some block XML somewhere that looks something like My best guess if someone, at some point, installed this extension on your site. It's supposed to install files to (among other places) app/code/community/Mage/Navadmin Templates or XML layout files that reference the block are likely left on your system, but the actual class file that defines the block in app/code/community/Mage/Navadmin/Block/Navadmin.php is missing.
