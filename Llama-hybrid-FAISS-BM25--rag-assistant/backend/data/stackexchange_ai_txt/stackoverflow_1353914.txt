I am no sound expert, but if you are sampling with 44100 (I guess samples per second) and use 1024 datapoints. You are working with about 1/40th of a second worth of data. I doesn't surprise me that the current pitch varies a lot, depending on which piece you pick. If you want to find the average or main pitch of a voice, I'd expect to need about 1second worth of data.
