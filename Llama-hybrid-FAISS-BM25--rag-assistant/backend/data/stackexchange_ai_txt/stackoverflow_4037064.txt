Ideally, if every form links to the same parsing page, you have two options Option 1: Created a hidden form variable on EVERY form page that records the URL of the page via static input, or from Javascript or PHP, both of which are detailed in the earlier answers. Option 2: On the parsing page, use $url = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"] to get the page that directed to your parsing page, and record that in the database. I would probably go with Option 2, as it is a bit more elegant and easier to modify, and can even let you know if a user attempted to inject the form with a copy they stored locally on their hard drive.
