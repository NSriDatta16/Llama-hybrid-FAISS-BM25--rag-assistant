Answer: none of the above. Detrend the data, if your analysis technique requires detrended data, but don't smooth. Building on @whuber’s insightful comment below, I would again emphasize “analyze”: if you’re exploring and looking for an idea, go ahead and smooth or whatever inspires you, but if you intend to do something that has diagnostics or analyzes, don’t smooth. Also I am assuming Time series here. People also smooth images and Laplace Smooth sparse contingency tables. (The latter is a good idea.) It's almost always a mistake to analyze smoothed data. Smoothing can introduce false correlations, change phases, and cause information leaks, among other problems. I think there's a strange attraction, that we all experience at some point, to smooth or to categorize noisy continuous data. It feels like it makes things more precise, but it does not. True experts who know exactly what they're doing might be able to get away with it under the right circumstances, but I'd highly recommend against it. (@whuber didn't shut the question down, and as always in these forums, I defer to more experienced judgement, but I would still argue that it's tricky and often of little benefit even if done right.) In general, the techniques you'd use on time series either account for noise or even explicitly model it (State Space methods, for example). Why blur -- which is what smoothing is essentially doing -- your data before working with it? For visualization purposes, it can be handy to run a smoothed "trend" line through the data to help focus a viewer away from extreme noise, but as a step before analysis... Again, State Space methods (Kalman methods) can explicitly model trends and noise. In which case you'd neither detrend nor smooth. Perhaps you would find them useful? [ORIGINAL] In my understanding, smoothing should really only be done as the last step, and only for display. Trying to analyze smoothed data is full of pitfalls. Detrending can be accomplished in a couple of ways, which were you going to use? What is your goal?
