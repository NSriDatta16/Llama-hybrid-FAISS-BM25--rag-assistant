To use the pem file I generally add the pem to the ssh agent, then simply refer to the username and host: ssh-add ~/.ssh/ec2key.pem fab -H ubuntu@ec2-host deploy or specify the env information (without the key) like the example you linked to: env.user = 'ubuntu' env.hosts = [ 'ec2-host' ] and run as normal: fab deploy
