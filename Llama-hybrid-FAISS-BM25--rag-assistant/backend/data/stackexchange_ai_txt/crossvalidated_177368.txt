Variational Bayes: Understanding Mean field approximation

I am looking at the mean field approximation as used in Variational Bayes inference and I looked at this section on wikipedia with the factorised approximation as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods#Factorized_approximation I can understand the approximation we make which is that the parameters are independent a-posteriori but what I do not understand is the update that follows. For example, the derivation of $\ln q(\mu)$ that follows takes the expectation wrt to the other variables. This is stated as a fact here ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods#Mathematical_derivation_of_the_mean-field_approximation ). Where the "In practice" section says that using calculus of variations we can show that. I could not derive it myself and neither could I find any proof for it in any of the books I own. Can someone explain me why the log posterior in this factorized approximation is given as an expectation of the log joint model with the expectation taken wrt to the other parameters?
