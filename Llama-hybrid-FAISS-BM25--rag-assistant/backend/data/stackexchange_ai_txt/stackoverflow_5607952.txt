How to monkeypatch an existing gem (Rails engine)?

I'm getting started with Ruby and Rails 3. There is a Rails Engine (packaged as a Gem) that I would like to use but it doesn't work exactly as I would like it to. I want to make some slight modifications but don't want to have to create my own forked version. I think this is where monkey patching becomes useful. Being new to Ruby (and coming from a PHP background) monkey patching is a new concept to me. How would I go about monkey patching an existing gem, and how would I go about organizing my modifications? I'm looking for some "best practice" approaches to this.
