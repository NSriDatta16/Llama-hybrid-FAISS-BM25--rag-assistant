Comparing yearly data that has different $n$ values per year?

I have been collecting soil moisture data at my research site for almost 20 years. However, I have not been consistent with the number of times that I have been taken these measurements. The problem that I am having right now is that I am trying to compare my data throughout the years. If I do this by the average, my comparison is not going to “real”, because in some years, I have 10 measurements, and in other years I have only 2 measurements. Due to that my question is, what would be a good way to make this comparison with my data? Normalize my data? If so how? Just as an example I am attaching a plot of what I have so far.
