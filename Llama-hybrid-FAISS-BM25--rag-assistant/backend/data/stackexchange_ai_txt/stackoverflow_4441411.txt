Have Magento respond to several domains with the same store

I would like to have my magento install respond to two different domains, e.g. a.mydomain.com and b.anotherdomain.com I need magento to respond with the same store, showing the same customers, the same catalog, same prices, etc. The difference, of course, is that when the store is accessed through a.mydomain.com all the links and urls should use this domain as baseurl, and when it is accessed through b.anotherdomain.com all links and urls should use b.anotherdomain.com as baseurl. Is there any way to do so? All the documentation I've found so far deal with having different stores on the same magento instance, while what I need here is to have the same store respond to two different URLs. Thank you!
