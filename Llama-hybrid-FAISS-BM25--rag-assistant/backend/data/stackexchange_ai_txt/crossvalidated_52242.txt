The x-axis is labeled in "number of cycles per unit of time". It is a bit akward at first. For instance, assume you have a monthly time series starting February, 2000. You might define it as: series This means that the time unit is 1 year and there are 12 data points per time unit. Then, functions like spectrum and cpgram label the x axis in frequencies giving their number of cycles per year. So 6 is the Nyquist frequency, 6 periods per year or a two month long cycle, the highest frequency observable with monthly data (higher frequencies are aliased). HTH.
