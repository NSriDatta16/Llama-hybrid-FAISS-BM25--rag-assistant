dynamic content overlap footer but remain within content flow?

My footer if quite high so I'm wondering if it is possible to get the content to overlap it slightly whilst still remaining in the content flow? I suppose the alternative is to make the footer a few thousand pixels high and position it at the bottom. It's not an elegant solution though, anyone have a better idea? http://www.digiflipconcepts.com/temporary-images/footer-overlap.jpg http://www.digiflipconcepts.com/temporary-images/footer-overlap.jpg
