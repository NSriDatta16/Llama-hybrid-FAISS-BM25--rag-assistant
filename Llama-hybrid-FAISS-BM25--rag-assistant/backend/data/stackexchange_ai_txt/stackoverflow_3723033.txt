Worker & Web Role in same application

We have a WebRole which deals with request coming in off a WCF service, this validates then puts the messages into an Azure queue in Cloud storage. In the same application we have a WorkerRole which reads the information from the queue and makes a call to our persistence layer which processes the request and returns the result. We were wondering why the worker roles didn't pick up any of our configuration settings and hence was not providing the Trace information we were looking for. We realised that the worker role was likely looking for an app.config and couldn't find it. Is there a way to point the worker role to the web config, or to be able to load our Enterprise Library settings into the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file which in either case would mean both could read from a common place? Many thanks in advance Kindo
