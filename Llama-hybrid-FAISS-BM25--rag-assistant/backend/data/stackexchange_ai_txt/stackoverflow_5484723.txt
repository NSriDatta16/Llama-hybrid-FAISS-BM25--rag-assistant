int i; //i is an int. int *i; //i is a pointer to an int int **i;//i is a pointer to a pointer to an int. Is the * sign interpreted differently in declarations and expressions? Yes. They're completely different. in a declaration * is used to declare pointers. In an expression unary * is used to dereference a pointer (or as the binary multiplication operator) Some examples: int i = 10; //i is an int, it has allocated storage to store an int. int *k; // k is an uninitialized pointer to an int. //It does not store an int, but a pointer to one. k = &i; // make k point to i. We take the address of i and store it in k int j = *k; //here we dereference the k pointer to get at the int value it points //to. As it points to i, *k will get the value 10 and store it in j
