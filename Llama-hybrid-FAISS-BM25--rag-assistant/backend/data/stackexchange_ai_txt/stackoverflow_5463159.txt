I think you have misread ON as IN in the article. However, the order it is showing in the article is correct (obviously it is msdn anyway). The ON and JOIN are executed before WHERE naturally because WHERE has to be applied as a filter on the temporary resultset obtained due to JOINS The article just says it is logical order of execution and also at end of the paragraph it adds this line too ;) "Note that the actual physical execution of the statement is determined by the query processor and the order may vary from this list."
