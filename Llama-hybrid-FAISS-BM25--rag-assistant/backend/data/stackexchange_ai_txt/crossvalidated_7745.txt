Terminology question concerning regression

hopefully you can help me with the meaning of the following, I don't really understand the terminology: "regression of a vector of ones on the matrix $W$", where $W$ is something like $(W_t)' = (w_{1t},w_{2t},w_{3t}, w_{4t})$. I don't understand, which regression I actually have to compute. If it is of help for you, I'm trying to understand the Godfrey/Wickens test according to this article: Ghosh, S., Gilbert, C. L., & Hallett, A. J. H. (1983). Empirical Economics , 8, 63â€“69. DOI: 10.1007/BF01973190 Greeting, Julius
