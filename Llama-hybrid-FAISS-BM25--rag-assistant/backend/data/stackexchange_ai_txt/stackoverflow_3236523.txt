Design your app as a whole and then break them into modules for easy development. This way you need not worry about integration part. You can have each functionality into different folders and not club them into a samefile/folder. These will make the overall project well organised. However building independent modules and later integrating will lead to a bad design unless you have taken care of making those modules independent of each other.
