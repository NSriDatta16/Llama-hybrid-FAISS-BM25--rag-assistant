In a simple Bayesian application to a binomial experiment, one can begin with the prior $\mathsf{Beta}(5,7)$ that places about 95% of the probability of the success probability $\theta$ in the interval $(.15,.7).$ [Computation in R.] diff(pbeta(c(.15,.7), 5,7)) [1] 0.9624924 Then suppose $n=200$ Bernoulli trials result in $x = 83$ Successes, so that the likelihood is proportional to $\theta^{83}(1-\theta)^{117}.$ Finally, the posterior distribution proportional to the product of the prior density and the binomial likelihood: $$\theta^{5+83-1}(1-\theta)^{7+117-1} = \theta^{88-1}(1-\theta)^{124-1},$$ which is the kernel of the posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(88,124).$ Of course, the posterior mean is 0.415, but in many applications the posterior distribution is also used to get the 95% Bayesian posterior probability interval $(0.350, 0.482)$ for $\theta.$ Moreover, the posterior distribution can be used to argue that $\theta$ is very likely less than $1/2$ (probability above $0.99).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 88, 124) [1] 0.3497507 0.4819556 pbeta(.5, 88, 124) [1] 0.9934937
