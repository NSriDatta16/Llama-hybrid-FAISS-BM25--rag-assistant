How important are interpretations of probability to the practice of statistics?

I know that the frequentist interpretation of probability is associated with classical statistics and maximum likelihood estimation, and that a subjective interpretation of probability is considered integral to Bayesian statistics. But are these interpretations of probability essential to the statistical methods, or are they historical? Specifically, what is the connection between the frequentist interpretation of probability and maximum likelihood estimation? Also, is there any reason why someone who subscribes to the "propensity" interpretation of probability couldn't use either approach, or favor one over the other? From my understanding, it seems like the most important conceptual difference is between considering parameters fixed and unknown (classical), and modelling parameters with probability distributions (Bayesian). But is there some reason why a person who believed in a frequentist interpretation of probability couldn't say "even though the parameter is fixed, I will model the range of its plausible values with a probability distribution" and do Bayesian statistics to arrive at an estimate?
