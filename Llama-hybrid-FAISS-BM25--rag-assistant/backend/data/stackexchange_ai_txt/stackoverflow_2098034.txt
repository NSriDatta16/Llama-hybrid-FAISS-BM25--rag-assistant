Draggable content using jQuery

I would like to use jQuery and its drag-and-drop function, such as: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ In my case, I would like to enable drag-and-droping on content of an HTML table. For instance with a table of 20x20, in order to move a tag from a cell to an other cell. Is that hard to do? I don't see any example after searches. If you're got one or if you can show me how to process, I will be cool!
