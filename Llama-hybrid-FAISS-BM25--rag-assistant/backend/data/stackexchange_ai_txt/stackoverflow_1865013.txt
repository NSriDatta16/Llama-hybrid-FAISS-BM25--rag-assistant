I know this is not a direct answer to your question, but it seems to make more sense to logically organize your file structure to match your web structure. I would suggest: /home /public_html /classifieds /listings 404.php index.php From what I can tell in your post, there is absolutely no reason to be using mod_rewrite at all. But if you really want to know: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/classifieds/ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/listings/
