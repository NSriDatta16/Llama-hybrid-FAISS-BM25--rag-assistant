The concept between compression is basically statististical. If you've got a series of bytes, the chance of byte N being X in practice depends on the value distribution of the previous bytes 0..N-1. Without compression, you allocate 8 bits for each possible value X. With compression, the amounts of bytes allocated for each value X depends on the estimated chance p(N,X). For instance, given a sequence "aaaa", a compression algorithm can assign a high value to p(5,a) and lower values to p(5,b). When p(X) is high, the bitstring assigned to X will be short, when p(X) is low a long bitstring is used. In this way, if p(N,X) is a good estimate then the average bitstring will be shorter than 8 bits.
