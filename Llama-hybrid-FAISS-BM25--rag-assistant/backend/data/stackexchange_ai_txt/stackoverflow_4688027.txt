Reuse xaml sub-workflows - from toolbox drag and drop into new xaml workflow

I have a number of xaml sub-workflows that I would like to reuse in other xaml workflows. These sub-workflow use receive and send activities so writing them in code is a pain for us mortals. I would think this is a common scenario but I can't find a good reference that would list the steps to accomplish this. Here is what I am looking to do: 1- Desing a sub-workflow xaml. 2- Add an entry in the toolbox (both VS and hosted WF Designer) with drag and drop ability 3- Ability to use a custom UI of the dropped sub-workflow and not display all the contained activites 4- When the completed xaml workflow is saved, the sub-workflow would be saved as part of it as xaml. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciatd. Thanks, Kas
