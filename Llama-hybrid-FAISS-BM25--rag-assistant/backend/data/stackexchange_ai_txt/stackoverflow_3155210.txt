If you don't care about smooth streaming you could put it almost anywhere. For smooth streaming, you'd probably want a cdn that supports it like limelight http://www.limelightnetworks.com/2010/03/smooth-streaming/ .. Or use something like Amazon S3 or Azure Storage using this technique http://aldenml.com/blog/2009/12/11/how-to-smooth-streaming-and-windows-azure-storage/ . Some cheap hosters like Discountasp.net also support smooth streaming http://www.discountasp.net/sp_iis7manager.aspx I don't know of any free youtube like places to host the video. http://silverlight.live.com used to be free, but is shutdown now.
