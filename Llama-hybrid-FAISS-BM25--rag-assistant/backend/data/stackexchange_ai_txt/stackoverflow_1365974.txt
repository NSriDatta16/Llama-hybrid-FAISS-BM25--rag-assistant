Yes, the preferred way of doing TDD is to write the test first (as implied by the name Test-Driven Development ). When you start out with TDD it can be hard to know where to start writing the tests, so I would suggest to be pragmatic about it. After all, the most important part of our job is about delivering working code, not so much how the code was crafted. So you can start by writing tests for existing code. Once you get a hang of how the unit tests are structured, which ones that seem to do a good job and which ones that seem not so god, then you will find it easier to dive more into the test-first approach. I have found that I write tests first to a greater extent as time goes by. It simply becomes more natural with increased experience.
