Remember that a "round trip" for ping includes the times for host1->AP->host2->AP->host1, while "round trip" for traceroute includes host1->AP->host1. Those ping RTT times are actually pretty good. At my house, they average close to 250 ms and frequently reach over 300ms for my 3GS. Ping response times are impacted by the kernel's availability. If the CPU is busy when an ICMP request comes in, then it is buffered until the CPU can process it. There are plenty of opportunities for this blocking to occur on a resource-constrained device like the iPhone (or, say, an overburdened router). In addition, the iPhone OS will to some extent attempt to queue packets in order to transmit in bursts. This prevents the radio from continuously transmitting, thus saving power. Of course, this affects latency and would challenge any application that needs a low and/or steady latency (e.g. VoIP). There is currently no public standard for TCP/IP over USB per se (as opposed to 1394, for which there is). Since USB is a serial link layer, data can theoretically be passed over the dock connector using your own protocol, or a predefined one (e.g. PPP). Once an EASession is established, communication occurs over the normal NSInputStream/NSOutputStream.
