How can I write a native templated backing storage for a generic interface?

I have an interface, say; public interface ICustomCollection { void Add(T item); bool Remove(T item); bool Contains(T item); } I would like to create a class that access native C/C++ dll (which I'd also create) which provide the implementation. How can I go about writing the managed class and native code for this to work? I know interop basics but I don't know how to handle generic types in this context.
