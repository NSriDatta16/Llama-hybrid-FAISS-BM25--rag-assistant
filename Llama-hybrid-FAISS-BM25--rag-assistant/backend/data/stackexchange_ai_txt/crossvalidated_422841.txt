This is not really a missing data problem. Your data is not missing, you simply believe that the proportions in your training data do not accurately reflect the population that they were drawn from. You say It turns out my model performs very poorly on new data that contains incomes below 5k. In fact it almost never predicts a value below 5k (which makes sense since I'm using a random forest). Which I find a little confusing, if it is new data how do you know what the value for your target data is? Do you mean that on test data with values under 5k? I would suggest that if your belief that your training data has less records under 5k than truly exist in the population is correct, than oversampling could be a method to solve this. However I would oversample prior to splitting your data (as opposed to the conventional oversampling only the training data) since your test data won't accuractely reflect the population otherwise.
