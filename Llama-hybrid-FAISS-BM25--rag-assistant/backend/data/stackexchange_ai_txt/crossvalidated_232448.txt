Briefly; the number of fatalities in a given year (the variable fatal ) follows a poisson ditribution, which has a linear trend ( alpha + beta*(year-1970) ) with an extra hazard of the log of the size of the population. Incidentally, in winBUGS, anything assigned with is deterministic; everything assigned with ~ is probabilistic. The prior distribution for the linear parameters alpha and beta is a "vague" Normal distribution with variance 1000. Note that most distributions in winBUGS are parametrised differently to what you might be used to. The stuff after the closing brace are the initial values to start the MCMC runs at, and the data on which the model is to be fit. The fatal data influences mu via the likelihood. If looks like probpred (and hence pred ) was only created for tracking purposes, to see how often the actual # deaths was more or less than a random sample from the predictive distribution.
