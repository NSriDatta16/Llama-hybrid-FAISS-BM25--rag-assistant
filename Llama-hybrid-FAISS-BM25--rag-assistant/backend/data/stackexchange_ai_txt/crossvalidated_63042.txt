What is X (by the way, the dependent variable is usually called Y). How is it distributed? In what way are residuals from the model non-normal? If the DV is categorical, you probably want some form of logistic regression. If it is a count, you might want Poisson, negative binomial or some related model. If it is continuous, you probably want regular regression, but you might want to transform one or more of your variables. Or, you might need some form of robust regression.
