The tests shown by Stata for the individual coefficients are Wald tests whose test statistics have the form $$ W_j = \frac{\hat{\beta}_j}{\widehat{\operatorname{SE}}(\hat{\beta}_j)}\sim N(0,1) $$ Under the hypothesis than an individual coefficient is zero, these statistics will asymptotically follow the standard normal distribution. Hence, they are $z$ -values. The corresponding $p$ -values are calculated from the standard normal cdf $\Phi(x)$ . Specifically, for two-sided $p$ -values: $p=2\cdot\Phi(-|z|)$ . For example in Stata for the coefficient for mpg : di 2*normal(-abs(1.83)) .06724994 Reference Hosmer DW, Lemeshow S, Sturdivant RX (2013): Applied Logistic Regression. 3rd ed. Wiley.
