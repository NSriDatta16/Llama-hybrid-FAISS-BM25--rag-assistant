You could also be ridiculously hacky about it (if you didn't want to fuss with overriding init ) and provide a value for the first element that basically looks like this: My non-linked value I know, I know, not very pretty, but perhaps less anxiety about breaking something elsewhere since all we're doing is changing markup. Here's some sample code about how this works: class HitAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin): list_display = ('user_no_link','ip','user_agent','hitcount') def user_no_link(self, obj): return u' %s ' % obj user_no_link.allow_tags = True user_no_link.short_description = "user" Side Note: You could also improve the readability of the output (since you don't want it to be a link) by returning return u'%s' % obj.get_full_name() which might be kinda neat depending on your use case.
