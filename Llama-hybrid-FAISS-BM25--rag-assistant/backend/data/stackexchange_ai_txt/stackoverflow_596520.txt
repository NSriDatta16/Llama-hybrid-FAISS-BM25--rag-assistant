With Apache httpd, how do I configure no caching for a given UserAgent?

I have Apache HTTPD configured to add a cache header to requests for most static content: ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year" # Force JNLP and BSH files to expire immediately so updates are checked for # and seen (We need this so we see changes in the dynamic content in both) ExpiresByType application/x-java-jnlp-file "now" ExpiresByType application/x-bsh "now" How can I disable this caching for any request where the UserAgent contains the string JNLP? When the request comes from the User Agent JNLP (for example " User-Agent: JNLP/6.0 javaws/1.6.0_12 (b04) Java/1.6.0_12 ") I don't want any Cache-Control or other cache-related headers on the HTTP response. I can find configuration examples for several things based on user agent, but I cannot figure out how to configure caching depending on the user agent.
