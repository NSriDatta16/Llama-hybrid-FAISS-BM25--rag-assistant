Functional principal component analysis (FPCA): what is it all about?

Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is something I have stumbled upon and never got to understand. What is it all about? See "A survey of functional principal component analysis" by Shang, 2011 , and I'm citing: PCA runs into serious difficulties in analyzing functional data because of the “curse of dimensionality” (Bellman 1961). The “curse of dimensionality” originates from data sparsity in high-dimensional space. Even if the geometric properties of PCA remain valid, and even if numerical techniques deliver stable results, the sample covariance matrix is sometimes a poor estimate of the population covariance matrix. To overcome this difficulty, FPCA provides a much more informative way of examining the sample covariance structure than PCA [...] I just don't get it. What is the drawback this paper is describing? Isn't PCA supposed to be the ultimate method to handle situations like the “curse of dimensionality”?
