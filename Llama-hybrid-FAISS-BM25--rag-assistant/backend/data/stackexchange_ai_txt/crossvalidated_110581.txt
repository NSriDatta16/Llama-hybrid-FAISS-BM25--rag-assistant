Baseline predictors parametres

I've implemented baseline predictors model. It trains on data: " user_number item_number rating_ui " And then I need to predict raiting for " user_number item_number ". I use following formulas for biases: b_ui = average_rating + b_i + b_u; b_i = (sum_(by all items)(rating_ui-average_rating))/(lamda_2+items_count); b_u = (sum_(by all users)(rating_ui-average_rating-b_i))/(lambda_3+users_count); I tried to use Netflix constants lambda_2 = 25 and lambda_3 = 10. But it gives not enough accuracy. How can I optimize lambda_2 and lambda_3 using training data? There are to much data to use gradient descent.
