How to calculate how much variance a set of regressors explains on another data set using PCA transformation?

I am running a PCA on a dataset and I obtain a set of regressors. Now I would like to decompose another dataset onto the same basis of regressors and to know how much variance of the second dataset each of my regressors explains ?
