Had a similar problem in Tomcat/JSP, don't know about PHP. In Tomcat the rule was that the #anchor is only intended for the browser/user agent so you can't get it. My workaround was to use Javascript in the page instead to achieve the redirect. My tip would be that if you can't get it working in PHP soon then start trying a Javascript workaround.
