As Chad said , I use rel="external" to designate links I'd like to open in a new window (leveraging some jQuery to make it possible). I also use rel="nofollow" when I'd like to make the bots that follow rules (like Google bot) not index my link. It's useful on public websites to automatically add the nofollow, otherwise it could become enticing for spammers to make a link farm out of your blog comments, for example.
