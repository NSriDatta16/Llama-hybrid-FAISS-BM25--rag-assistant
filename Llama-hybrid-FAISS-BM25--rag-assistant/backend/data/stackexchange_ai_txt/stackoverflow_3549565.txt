You can use the AutoFit method on the columns containing your query result, for example Columns("A:G").EntireColumn.AutoFit ' hardcoded ... works but isn't nice If you have a range defined for your query result, use this code fragment: Dim QRslt As Range, QCol As Range '.... For Each QCol In QRslt.Columns QCol.AutoFit Next '.... If you want to limit the column width to a certain maximum size you may as an alternative set the .WrapText property of the cells to =True Hope that helps. Good luck - MikeD
