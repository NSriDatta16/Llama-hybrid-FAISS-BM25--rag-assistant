Reading "historical" I assume that you are talking about time series. In this case it's important that out of sample test subset is never located earlier in time than training subset. Dataset size is important and should be in proper relation with model's number of parameters. I'd also ask if chosen features include something "improper", like stock's absolute price or person's social insurance number (just an example).
