You are confused as to the nature of your output. These data say: If you are a male you are more likely to live longer than a female; Females have WORSE survival than males. This is reflected in the regression output as the effect for being MALE is to have a negative log hazard ratio, e.g. males have lower risk than females. At most event times (when the curves "step"), the male survival curve is greater than that of the females, the Cox model results and graph agree very well. The KM curves confirm this as do the regression model output. The "cross" is an inconsequential one. KM curves behave poorly in the tails, especially when they near 0% and/or taper off flatly. The Y-axis is the proportion surviving. With relatively few who survive long into the study, and few who die at that time, the reliability of the estimates is intuitively and graphically terrible. I note, for instance, there are visibly fewer females in your cohort than males and that after 2,800 days, there are less than 10 females remaining in the cohort, as evidenced by the steps in the survival curve and lack of censored events. As an interesting note, because survival analyses using KM curves, log rank tests, and Cox models use ranked survival time, the actual duration of survival is somewhat irrelevant. Your longest surviving female could, infact, have survived for another 100 years and it would have no impact on the analyses. This is because the baseline hazard function (not having observed any events for the past 13 years) would assume there was no risk of death for those next 87 years since nobody died then. If you want a robust HR to obtain correct 95% CIs and p-values for this, specify robust=TRUE in the Cox-PH to obtain sandwich standard errors. In that case, the HR is a time-averaged HR comparing males to females at all failure times.
