If the data they'd like to enter / edit is simple, non-formatted text, your best bet is offering them a simple interface to edit pages themselves. Failing that, some popular options are: Drupal Joomla Or for ecommerce, Magento . For other CMSes or to try demos online, check out OpenSourceCMS.com . I am in no way affiliated with any of these sites.
