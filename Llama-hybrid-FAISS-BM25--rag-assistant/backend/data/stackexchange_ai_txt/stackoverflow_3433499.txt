F# and Azure TableServiceContext

I'm just tinkering with F# and Azure and have come unstuck with the TableServiceContext. I was converting this post into an F# implementation which was going well until it gets to the point where you actually query the data. In C# the code is public IEnumerable Select() { var results = from c in _ServiceContext.ContactTable select c; var query = results.AsTableServiceQuery (); var queryResults = query.Execute(); return queryResults; } where results is an IQueryable and AsTableServiceQuery looks like it's an extension method. Does anyone know how to perform these types of queries against Azure storage using the TableServiceContext? I'd have thought something like seq { for c in _ServiceContext.ContactTable do yield c } or even with the powerpack query would be a good starting point but I've no idea where to go from here. I suppose the worst case scenario is to leave this as C# code and then call it from F# but would like to know of any alternatives. Cheers Dylan
