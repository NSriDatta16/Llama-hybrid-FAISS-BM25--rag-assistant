This is an interesting question, I have seen very little written about time-varying (cross-)correlations in time series. But your question would be helped by some more context, what are your different variables measuring? That would allow for some more useful answers! So for now (its Christmas!) a very short answer. I would start with some visualizations, in R there is a useful function coplot for conditioning plots, some examples in following posts: Investigate correlation conditional on a threshold , Can I analyze or model a conditional correlation? or What is the physical significance of cumulative correlation coefficient? . I don't know about formal tests ... maybe some others can churn in? The following google search gives some interesting hits. You could also search for "Garch dynamic correlation" for some ideas.
