As goals scored in soccer matches are typically rare events, you might want to consider your data as coming from Poisson distributions . If so, then the variance in terms of goals per match will be equal to the average number of goals per match. Any changes in strategies, player health, opponent strength, and so on that affect the average number of goals per match from month to month would then necessarily also affect the variance. If your variances are higher than corresponding means then a negative binomial distribution might be a better fit. But even then the variance will tend to increase with the mean values. So your observation of a high correlation between mean and variance in soccer scores has a solid mathematical basis.
