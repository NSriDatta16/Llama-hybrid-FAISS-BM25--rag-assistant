I was playing with the BeforeScenario and AfterScenario stuff myself just today for the first time. I tagged my scenario with @sometag and then with the attribute on my AfterScenario() method used the same tag (without the '@' or at sign) as an argument, e.g. Feature file: @sometag Feature: Some feature or other Here is my feature description ... Scenario: Some scenario ... Events file: [AfterScenario("sometag")] public void AfterScenario() { // stuff... } I don't know if tagging stuff like that is the key. Maybe without tags the AfterScenario() would always fire, I didn't try it. The other thing you can try is attaching VS to the nunit-agent.exe process, setting a breakpoint inside your AfterScenario() method and seeing when it is hit.
