Automatic form submission with PERL - debugging!

Our client has a simple setup. Page A has a form that submits to page B which displays the query results. Unfortunately, there is no other API or DB access to get the data. Since we need to do this query often, we decided to automate this submission with Perl. I've determined the form key value pairs of Page A with a sniffer and replicated the code. However, on running the program page B is throwing a HTTP 500 error with no additional meaningful explanation. Any pointers to debug this code? Code in itself is simple: use strict; use warnings; use LWP; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $url = "targeturl.asp" my $response = $browser->post( $url, [ "HisSort" => "1", "RTsort" => "", "chkHisRun" => "on", "chkRTRun" => "on", "optAdHoc" => "on", "optHist" => "", "optServer" => "servername", "optStatus" => "", "optWhat" => "H", "txtEnd" => "", "txtFields" => "1,0,10,17,11,18,24,19,21,25,1", "txtHEnd" => "11/3/2010", "txtHStart" => "11/1/2010", "txtServer" => "", "txtStart" => "", ] ); Note: I don't have access to the source of page A or page B
