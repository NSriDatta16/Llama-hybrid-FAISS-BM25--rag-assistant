Essentially, determining the seed is sufficient to determine the entire output of a pseudorandom generator. As a result, you want a seed that isn't predictable or determinable. Pseudorandom output is (under some circumstances as described two paragraphs ago) determinable or predictable. Beyond that, it is a trade-off. You've already decided to use pseudorandom numbers instead of real randomness, so it is probably an acceptable trade-off in your mind.
