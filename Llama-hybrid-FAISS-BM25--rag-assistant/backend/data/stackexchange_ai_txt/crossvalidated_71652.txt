Generalizing results from a sample

I have the following exercise question that I would like insight on: A legal case is being formulated by a union of secretaries who claim that they are being paid unfairly low wages by their employer. The 64 secretaries in the firm have an average annual salary of \$38300 with a SD of \$840. The average salary for all secretaries in the city in which the firm is located is \$42100. Can you support the claim of the secretaries by statistical arguments? If so, carefully state these arguments and the assumptions underlying them. So would it make sense to make a confidence interval and see if the average salary for all secretaries fall outside the range? Would that work even though this wasn't a random sample?
