ASP.NET Web Parts: Drag and Drop Support in Non-IE Browsers

I have been using web parts on my site since ASP.NET 2.0 came out. Dragging and dropping web parts works great in Internet Explorer, but it doesn't work at all in Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. I recently upgraded the site to ASP.NET 3.5 SP1, but I am still unable to drag and drop web parts in non-IE browsers. How can I enable drag and drop web parts in these other browsers? Update (2/9/2010): This mentions this problem, but offers no solution: http://forums.asp.net/t/1294857.aspx Update (2/19/2010): These posts offer a possible solution, but I have been unable to get it working yet on my site: http://forums.asp.net/p/1451292/3319836.aspx http://waitink.blogspot.com/2008/10/ajax-web-parts-part-3-dynamic-web-parts.html In short, these say the drag and drop problem was solved in "ASP.NET Futures (July 2007 release)" but for some crazy reason, was left out of ASP.NET 3.5 SP1. So to solve, you have to download the Futures release at: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A5189BCB-EF81-4C12-9733-E294D13A58E6&displaylang=en Then, you need to use the WebPartManager and WebPartZone from the Microsoft.Web.Preview.UI.Controls.WebParts namespace.
