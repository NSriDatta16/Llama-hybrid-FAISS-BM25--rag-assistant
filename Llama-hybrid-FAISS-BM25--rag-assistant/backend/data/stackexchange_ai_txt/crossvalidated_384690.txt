Some responses to this are incredibly arrogant. It is possible to focus on a different type of event than simply intraday stock prices. Imagine we try to plot a line between two time periods, along with their slopes and correlation coefficients, and count the number of times a stock would touch x rate of change and/or direction x periods forwards, we could theoretically use poisson distribution to calculate the probability an event could happen within a time period. This would be a reasonable heuristic. I am working on an application at the moment to do this, whether i use Poisson Distribution is uncertain but it doesn't have to be statistical in the classic sense to offer insight.
