The only solution I can think of is to use a search provider that adds the searchTerms to the fragment component of the URI. You can then use setInterval to parse window.location.hash for the terms. The downside to this is that your website has to be a "one page application" with a known URL because the search provider specification does not allow relative URLs in the template. I've created a small demo page and provider: Navigate to http://jsbin.com/evoqu Enter " http://jsbin.com/ovajo " into the text field and click the "Add Search Provider" button Use the newly added search provider and notice that the search terms are displayed on the page. You can view and edit the source for the demo page and provider here: http://jsbin.com/evoqu/edit http://jsbin.com/ovajo/edit
