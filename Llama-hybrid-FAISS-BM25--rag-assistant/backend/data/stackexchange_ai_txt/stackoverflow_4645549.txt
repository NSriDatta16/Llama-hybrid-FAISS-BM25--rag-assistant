The fast workarround would be to use a Distinct Root Entity Result Transformer. ... crit.setResultTransformer(CriteriaSpecification.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY); List unique = crit.List(); ... But this is only a workarround. I ques the problem belongs to your mapping. If there is any eager loaded 1:n relationship from ProcessInstance to something else (call it X), and there are several (n) X for one ProcessInstance, the you will get several ProcessInstance items (n) in the result list for a single ProcessInstance. -- If this is realy the cause, than the workarround is not just a workarround, then it would be the solution.
