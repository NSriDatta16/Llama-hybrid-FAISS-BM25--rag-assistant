Minimize Form by user control

I have a user control that has three buttons on top Close , Minimize and On Top. When we drag that user control on windows form application and run it we can perform all three functionalities. But when i made my own user control and added these options only close could be added by implementing Application.Exit(); but not topmost or minimize as they require form so how can we minimize the form by the usercontrol button
