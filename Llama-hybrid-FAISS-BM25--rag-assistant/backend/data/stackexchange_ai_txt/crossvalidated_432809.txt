Can we use as continuous vairables the mean of discrete variables?

For example basketball teams' scores are discrete variables, we are sure. However, if I want to use the mean (average) score of 100 basketball teams, can I say it is a continuous variable? Is the average number of points scored a continuous or discrete variable?
