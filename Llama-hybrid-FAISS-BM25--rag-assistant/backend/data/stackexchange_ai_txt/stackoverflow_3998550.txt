How to use BuffereImage for a Chess Game

I am trying to create a chess game for java using images my classmate and I are working on. We are using a created image to serve as the board and pieces to place about that the user can drag and place. Unfortunately we do not currently know how to import images from a file directory into the program itself. Not only that, but we are completely clueless as to why this would occur, as the Java API guide does not clearly explain this process.
