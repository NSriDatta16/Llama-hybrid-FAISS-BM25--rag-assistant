Should I transform my positively skewed predictor in hierarchical regression?

I'm doing a hierarchical regression trying to understand how intelligence (first predictor) and personality traits (second predictor) influence general knowledge (dependent variable). The problem is that the intelligence test is positively skewed since my sample consisted of above-average individuals. Shapiro-Wilk W is significant, the skewness value is 1.32 and the q-q plot differs from theoretical distribution. I'm not sure what to do about this, can I try and log-transform just the data for intelligence? I've never done transformations of non-normal data so I'm not sure of the procedure and does it come with some caveats. I'm still getting a positive correlation between intelligence and general knowledge (0.36) but I'm sure that it's bigger in reality, as my intelligence test was not discriminative enough and its variance should be larger. What would you suggest me to do? Edit: I'm adding a picture of the residuals plot for the whole model: and a picture of the residuals of the intelligence test:
