How to build a Mixed Effects Logistic regression Model?

I am new to data analysis and now working on a Mixed Effects Logistic Regression Model. Currently, I have the following data frame ( model_data ): Road Id Vehicle_id entry_time exit_time 1 1 2017-01-31 00:00:00 2017-01-31 00:00:00 last_veh_time vehicle_type status 300 4 wheel 0 Likewise, I have the information (nearly a million rows) of all the vehicles entering a place and exiting the same place. Status can be either $1$ or $0$ for all of these. last_veh_time is the last vehicle passed the same place before how much time. I want to know the probability of a getting status $0$ for a vehicle based on the entry_time and last_veh_time . To do this, I created the model: model = glmer(status ~last_veh_time + (1 |link ), data=model_data, REML=FALSE) Is this the right approach? Any help is appreciated.
