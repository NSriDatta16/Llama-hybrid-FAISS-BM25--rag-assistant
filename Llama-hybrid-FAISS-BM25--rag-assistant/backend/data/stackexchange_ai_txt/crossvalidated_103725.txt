One of many interesting aspects of the contrasts between the two approaches is that it is very difficult to have formal interpretation for many quantities we obtain in the frequentist domain. One example is the ever-increasing importance of penalization methods (shrinkage). When one obtains penalized maximum likelihood estimates, the biased point estimates and "confidence intervals" are very difficult to interpret. On the other hand, the Bayesian posterior distribution for parameters that are penalized towards zero using a prior distribution concentrated around zero have completely standard interpretations.
