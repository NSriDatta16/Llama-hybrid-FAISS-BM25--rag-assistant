You've probably already thought of this, but I'll put this in just in case. In Trac, I oftentimes organized tickets as sub-tasks, at least through convention by simply placing links to those tickets in the description of the master ticket. What's nice about this is that closed tickets are shown as crossed out , so you can get an idea of the status of the sub-tickets at a glance. OK, so it's not setting up a hierarchy, but it's a flexible system that also allows you to set up other relationships; for example you can also reference another ticket as a dependency or related issue.
