Actually - further digging revealed that stripes 1.5 has a annotation-mechanism for controlling HTTP cache headers: http://www.stripesframework.org/display/stripes/News // Client cache control. The new @HttpCache annotation can be applied to an ActionBean class and/or event handler method to control how the client caches the response. Annotations on methods override those on classes and the annotation is inherited from superclasses. This is especially useful for AJAX calls from IE. //
