As per the method described, you are duplicating the Class B to an extent such that it equals the volume of A. That means the model over learns about the occurrence of Class B and thinks whatever is present in the training set is the real truth. This obviously leads to over fitting, high variance and unstable models. If you are using SVM, please use the class_weight attribute to specify various ranges of the importance of classifying the class B correctly and use cv to identify a specific weight for B. This modifies the optimisation function to severely penalise any class B misclassifications.
