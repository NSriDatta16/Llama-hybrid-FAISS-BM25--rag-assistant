If you look at the SO URLs you'll notice that they do not actually store a string for the key, but the item (question) ID. The URL is the decorated with a human readable description, but that is totally irrelevant to the mapping. So opening the url Should I use strings as primary keys for a Web site that's big on SEO? is the same as opening Should I use strings as primary keys for a Web site that's big on SEO? which is the same as opening https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ 1258198 So you see, what happens in the http request and url mapping is not what is stored in the database. The database uses int IDs, for obvious performance and storage reasons that were already addressed in previous answers.
