Sometimes speedup can be substantial, like when you have to nest for-loops to get the average based on a grouping of more than one factor. Here you have two approaches that give you the exact same result : set.seed(1) #for reproducability of the results # The data X Both give exactly the same result, being a 5 x 10 matrix with the averages and named rows and columns. But : > system.time(forloop(X,Y,Z)) user system elapsed 0.94 0.02 0.95 > system.time(tapply(X,list(Y,Z),mean)) user system elapsed 0.06 0.00 0.06 There you go. What did I win? ;-)
