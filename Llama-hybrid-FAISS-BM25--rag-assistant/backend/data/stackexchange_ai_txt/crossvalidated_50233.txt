One way that you can assess predictor influence on forecasts is to estimate the gradient of the output with respect to the predictors. This can be done by estimating the partial derivatives of the non-linear prediction function with respect to each of the predictors by finite differences. Ideally you will do this on the actually observed test inputs. For example, you may average the absolute values of the estimated gradients at all the test inputs in the previous 2 days. The magnitude of this average gradient can be used to sort the predictors' importance. (You will need to careful with the gradient estimation to use appropriate units by z-scoring or some such method.) You can save these estimated gradients by season for comparative analysis. See " How to Explain Individual ClassiÔ¨Åcation Decisions ", by David Baehrens et. al. in JMLR for more on this idea. The paper deals with classification but easily generalizes to regression as well.
