I'm pretty sure Eli has it right. MOTODEV Studio shouldn't be doing anything with any of the Android classes in the SDK. If you right click on the error for each line, there is a possibility of a "Quick Fix" that determines the right import. Also, there is a menu item to "Organize Imports" that pulls them all in at once. These are features that are in the core Eclipse IDE and not unique to MOTODEV. But, if you think it's a problem with MOTODEV Studio, drop in to the forums at developer.motorola.com and we'll work with you to get it solved. Eric
