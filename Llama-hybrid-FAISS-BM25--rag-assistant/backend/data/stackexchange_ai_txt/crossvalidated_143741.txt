How can I test for changes in the distribution of categorical data over time?

Each week at my organization, we receive X number of type A messages, Y number of type B messages, Z number of type C messages...etc. I want to be able to test if the distribution of these message types for one week differs from the previous weeks (months, quarters...) message type distribution. Am I right in assuming I can't simply do a chi-square test of independence here because of autocorrelation? What method could I employ to test if the distribution of messages in one week differed from prior weeks?
