I would like to develop a UI that includes draggable windows, a task bar showing open windows etc. The main requirement beside the above is to have it in a contained area, a div or an iframe I've found two great candidates, but they both failed, is there anything answering the above? http://widget-env.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=demo Is nice, but simply not there yet http://desktop.sonspring.com/ seems amazing, but only seems to work in full screen I'm sure there are millions of free solutions, but I'm willing to consider a commercial one as well
