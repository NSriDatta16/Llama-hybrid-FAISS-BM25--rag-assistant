padding a fieldset, trouble with IE

What is going on with rendering the padding of a fieldset. It behaves as expected in FF and Chrome but fails in IE. This is the code im talking about: Hello world! Lorem ipsum And this is the css fieldset { border: 1px solid black; padding: 30px; } fieldset legend { background-color: silver; } fieldset div { border: 1px dotted silver; } Can also be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/nRAGM/6/ So my question is: how to get the above html to display as intended in IE?
