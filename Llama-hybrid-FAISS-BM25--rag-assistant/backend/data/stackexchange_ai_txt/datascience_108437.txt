Is there a need to store these Tensors back to the disk as part of the overall ML pipeline process? Or do people usually read back the 2-D data frames and then start all the way from there. Yes, but it's application dependent. You're right, if your 2d data is an image, its usually stored as an images. If your 3D data is video, it's usually stored as video. But there are lots of other kinds of high-dimensional data. My understanding is that there is no Tensor storage format. I guess it depends on what you mean by tensor. If you mean n-dimensional array data, there exist many formats / standards. Here are a few: hdf5 nrrd zarr n5 tensorstore tiledb I know many people / software applications that use hdf5. People in the python world recently like zarr. There is lots of interoperability though, e.g. the zarr / n5 / tensorstore implementations can read each others' data.
