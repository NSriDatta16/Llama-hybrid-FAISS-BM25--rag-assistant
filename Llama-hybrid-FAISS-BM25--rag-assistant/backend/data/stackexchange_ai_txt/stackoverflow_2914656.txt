Linq GroupBy - how to specify the grouping key at runtime?

is there a good way to do a Linq GroupBy where the grouping key is determined at runtime? e.g. I want the grouping key to be built from a user-selected list of fields - can you do this? I know I can do it easily if I convert everything to a table of strings, but I was wondering if there was an elegant or clever way to accomplish this otherwise. class Item { public int A, B; public DateTime D; public double X, Y, Z; } I have a List called data . I want to do things like retrieve the sum of X grouped by A , or the sums of X , Y , and Z , grouped by A and B . but what fields go into the grouping should be able to be specified at runtime in some way.
