How to know what file is opened by an application at any time?

I'm new here, so I don't have the time to contribute before I ask for u guys' help, so pardon me for that. I'm not sure if this can be done, but I would like to find out the opened file(s) of an application. Here I don't mean the "internal" opened files, but are those that are opened by the end-user (either by invoking the handling app thru file-assoc, or explicitely inside the app). Think *.cs or *.vb files in Visual Studio (yeah I'm an MS guy) or text files in Notepad. I've looked at "verbs" in the Win Shell MSDN doc, but it only mentions the invoking, and no way to inspect info of invoked verbs. I also looked at DDE, but it looks like a general purpose facility and does not fit into my case here. I have to say that my situation is difficult to be solved by Googling because of the lack of unique key words, so this would definitely needs human attention :) Thanks
