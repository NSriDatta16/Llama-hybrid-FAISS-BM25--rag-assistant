First - congratulations! You've come to realize what far too few project leaders realize - that usability is an extremely important aspect of software. If people don't want to use your software, or can't figure out how to use it, then all of its technical prowess means nothing. And if they don't love your software, they'll jump to the next best thing when it becomes available. In my organization, we fluctuate from having a dedicated usability guru, to being very proactive about usability among our engineers. Having a leader with a sense for usability helps, even if he's not officially a UI guy. I asked a similar question to yours, Easily digestable UI tips for developers . The answers there are probably what you're looking for.
