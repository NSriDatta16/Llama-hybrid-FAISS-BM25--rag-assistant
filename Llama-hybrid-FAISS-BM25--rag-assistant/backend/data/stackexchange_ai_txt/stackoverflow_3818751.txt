I think you might end up having to map strings to values up to the maximum range you expect and then parse the string in order and place values as such. Since there's very little regular naming convention across and within order of magnitude, I don't think there's an elegant or easy way to parse a word to get its numeric value. Luckily, depending on the format, you probably only have to map every order of magnitude. For example, if you only expect numbers 0-100 and they are inputted as "ninety-nine" then you only need to map 0-9, then 10-100 in steps of 10.
