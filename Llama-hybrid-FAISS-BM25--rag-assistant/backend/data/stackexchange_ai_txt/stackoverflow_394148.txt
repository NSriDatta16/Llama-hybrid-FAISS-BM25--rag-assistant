Lots of activity in the Java world. I talk to many customers deploying new projects in Java. I also see lots of activity in JRuby and other dynamic languages. Take a look at the Tiobe Index for a more : http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html As for Metro, on GlassFish, you can call Java libraries from dynamic languages (and vice-versa), so Project Metro with Java, JRuby, etc, is an option.
