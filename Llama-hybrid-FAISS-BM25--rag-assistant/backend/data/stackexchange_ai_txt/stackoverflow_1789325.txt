If you dragged the images from the Finder into the Resources folder in XCode the images should show up in IB as well. At least it does so in my setup. Maybe the images are 8-bit PNG images. I believe Cocoa requires them to be 24-bit because of the alpha transparency. PNG 8-bit doesn't support the alpha channel, as it's more like a GIF image. But from the error you posted It seems IB couldn't find the resource at all. Which is understandable if it doesn't load the resources from XCode in its library.
