Retrieving Oracle Cursor with JDBC

I have been experiencing some frustrations trying to make a simple Oracle cursor retrieval procedure work with JDBC. I keep on getting an error of "[Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-06553: PLS-306: wrong number or types of arguments in call to 'GETNAME'", but I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. Here is my code in Java: CallableStatement stmt = connection.prepareCall("call getName(?)"); stmt.registerOutParameter(1, OracleTypes.CURSOR); stmt.execute(); stmt.close(); con.close(); Here is my procedure in Oracle: CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE getName(cur out SYS_REFCURSOR) IS BEGIN OPEN cur FOR SELECT name FROM customer; END; The error occurs on stmt.execute() . Thanks in advance. By the way, I am working with Oracle 10.2.0.
