At first, you must reorganize your table : Months Replicate2 Species.1 Species.2 Species.3 Species.4 Jan-12 BranA 778 41 19 1 Jan-12 BranB 800 18 18 2 Jan-12 BranC 537 48 20 2 Feb-12 BranA 465 29 19 1 Feb-12 BranB 444 45 14 1 Feb-12 BranC 671 13 10 2 ... # reorganisation procedure # (need to be optimalized according to your full datatable!!!) # create vectors... my.data It should looks like this: my.reorg abundance sites months spec.no 1 778 BranA Jan-12 spec1 2 800 BranB Jan-12 spec1 3 537 BranC Jan-12 spec1 4 465 BranA Feb-12 spec1 5 444 BranB Feb-12 spec1 6 671 BranC Feb-12 spec1 ... Than try to fit the model: aov.out It looks like that sites are non-significantly different (in species composition) from each other during the "whole time". Is this what you need?
