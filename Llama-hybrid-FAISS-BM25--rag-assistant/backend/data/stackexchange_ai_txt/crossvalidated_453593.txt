It is a bit sad to see printed such carelessly written prose. Consider the phrase "For any prior density $g(\mu)$ , the posterior density $g(\mu\mid x)= g(\mu)f_{\mu}(x)/f(x)$ ....depends only on the data actually observed..." -while the mathematical formula in the above same sentence shows that the posterior density depends on the data and on the prior density (and let's not discuss how do we determine $f_{\mu}(x)$ and $f(x)$ ). Second, we have here a posterior out of sample information: we have discovered that the sample is censored. Bayesians have championed the formal and transparent inclusion of out-of-sample information in our estimation procedures, so this example should have been used to show how we could incorporate the discovered sample censoring into the estimation. On the contrary, the passage almost advises us to ignore this information, since it chooses to end by using the example of a flat prior. that, we learn, would yield posterior expectation $92$ ... But it would be a serious mistake to use it because, Bayesian, frequentist or whatever, it is always a serious mistake to ignore the facts. But the passage ends almost marveling at and celebrating , that we would get $92$ , irrespective of whether or not the glitch would have affected readings above 100. The correct answer is $42$ , by the way.
