Not enough information; I'd suggest compiling with a lot of warnings (e.g. -Wall if using gcc) and paying attention to them. For instance you could be redefining some type, e.g. a struct, with a different size and corrupting memory. Assuming by "fail w/o errors" you mean crashing. The warning will tell you that you are redefining something. Always pay attention to all compiler warnings.
