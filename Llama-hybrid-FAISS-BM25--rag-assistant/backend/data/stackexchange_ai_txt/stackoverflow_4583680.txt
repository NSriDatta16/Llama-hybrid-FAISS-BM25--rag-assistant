Graphic editor opensource project example on c++ underlying composite pattern

Can you tell me where I can see a some opensource project (only project on C++ language), which is simple graphic editor, сontaining following primitive (for example): an ellipse, a rectangle, a line. And desirable, that to be able to group this primitive in one primitive (for example, Word Grouping -> Group). Composite pattern use is desirable in this project. I want to see how to organize classes, but more serious for me is to see how organize grouping operation. I searched for it on codeproject.com codeproject.com, codeplex.com, but not found this. I have already some source http://pastebin.com/xe4JF5PW But in my opinion, this code is dirty and ugly. Therefore, I want to see some opensource project for example. Thanks!
