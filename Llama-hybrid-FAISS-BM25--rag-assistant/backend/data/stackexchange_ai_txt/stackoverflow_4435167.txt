Time to upgrade to ColdFusion 9. If that is not an option, I would encourage you to download ColdFusion 9 (or an open source CFML engine like Railo) and develop code using only the features and syntax allowed in CF7. There are many reasons to upgrade from ColdFusion 7 to ColdFusion 9. The improvements can help save many hours from development--and programmers/time usually costs more than the the upgrade fee. If money is a difficulty here, Railo is a good alternative--some would argue an equal one.
