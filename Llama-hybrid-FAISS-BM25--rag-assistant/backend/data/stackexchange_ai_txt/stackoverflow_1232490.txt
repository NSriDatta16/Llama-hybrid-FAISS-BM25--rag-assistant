Try using std::string as a key in map. The problem when you're using char* as a key, map compares address of char* and not their contents as you expect. If you want use char* as a key you need to instantiate map with compare predicate a a third argument to template. The difference between Debug and Release configuration here maybe explained how const string literals are stored - is same or separate storage is used used for the same string You're not alone link
