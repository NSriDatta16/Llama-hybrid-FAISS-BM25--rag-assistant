How to input time to a neural network?

I am working with a time-series, and believe that time in seconds since start is a useful feature. I am however not sure how to best input this to my recurrent neural network. I don't think the naive approach of just entering the naive value is the best way, and I also don't think that letting the RNN keep track of it on its own is good either. What has been done before, and what considerations should I keep in mind if I want to use time as an input variable? Clarification Let's say that at each time step, t (seconds as integers, ~0-1800), I have a feature vector x . I believe knowing the value of t is useful i.e. how much time has elapsed since the start of a process. How do I best input t to the network? I.e. is there something better than concat(x, t) ?
