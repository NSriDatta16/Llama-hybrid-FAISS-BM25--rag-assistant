Try setting '!important' behind it: color: green !important; Note that this only applies if there are other styles overriding your external css. You should test that your external CSS-file is read at all. You can do that by making a new paragraph for example. Give it an id (id="foo") and set this in your css color: green; If it doesn't turn green you should check your css include path.
