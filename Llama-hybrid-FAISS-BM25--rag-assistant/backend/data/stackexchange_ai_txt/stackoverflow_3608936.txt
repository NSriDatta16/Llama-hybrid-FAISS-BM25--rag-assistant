I checked this with my accounts and it seems that only the team agent can create the stuff needed for AppStore or AdHoc releases. IF you have the correct provisioning profile installed, and both your project settings and target setting for the "release" build are set to the correct provisioning profile. + that you have the correct certificates installed for that computer... you can build the release. I am unsure if only the Team Agent can upload these build, but otherwise you can package the release as a zip file (which you should anyways) and send it off the the team agent. The Team agent can then use the Application Loader to upload the application.
