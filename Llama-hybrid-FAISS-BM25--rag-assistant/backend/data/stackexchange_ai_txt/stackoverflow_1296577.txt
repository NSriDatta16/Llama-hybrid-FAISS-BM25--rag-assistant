Writing a Path Coverage Tool

Currently, one of our production systems is handled by over 3000 programs written between 1986 and now . The code base is written in a non-standard language, which unfortunately lacks modern testing tools. In a bid to improve our code quality moving forward I have been working to incorporate processes and build tools that will improve development and testing. I have just completely a line coverage tool so that we can help identify dead code + untested code during development. Now, I would like to start work on adding Path Coverage to the tool. How should I go about this? Given that: 1) The line coverage tool acts as a pre-processor that injects code 2) I already have the ability to gather stats I set in said code. What data should I be recording as the program executes, and how do I interpret it? How can I represent the results via HTML? I have already read the question How to get started “writing” a code coverage tool? , which was about Java, however it didn't help (including the paper "Branch Coverage for Arbitrary Languages Made Easy"). Thanks in advance for any guidance given!
