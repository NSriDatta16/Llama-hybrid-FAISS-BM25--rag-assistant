If it's nullable you need to use the Value property first, then call Date on that: p.CREATE_DT.Value.Date That said, using the Date property will return the date with a timestamp of midnight, so it will still have a time associated with it. That won't be helpful for what you're describing. You can use @AlbertEin's suggestion and check for the range.
