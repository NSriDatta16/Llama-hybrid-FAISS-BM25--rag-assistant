You can do it without path module in a very simple fashion: First of all, go to sites/default/settings.php and define the frontpage as multilingual variable: $conf['i18n_variables'] = array('site_frontpage'); After that, clear cache and go to admin > Site Information. You will see that below "Default front page" there will be: "This is a multilingual variable.": change the admin language (usually there is a block of language switcher in the sidebar) and change the path, The path will be different for each language. You can add more i18n_variables to change other things in site information according to language i.e site name, slogan, mission. more information at:
