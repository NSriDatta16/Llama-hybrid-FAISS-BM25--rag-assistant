If you are trying to do regression model you could always try to compute correlation between values. If r-Pearson correlation between input $x_i$ and output $y$ means that your output is similar to linear function of $x_i$ . For non-linear functions you can try computing $\rho$ -Spearman correlations. For categorical data $\tau$ -Kendall correlations sometimes do the trick. After picking inputs related to outputs you should check which inputs are irrevelant because they are just linear-combination of the other inputs. By computing correlation between selected inputs, you can check which input signals are not needed - other 'includes' them already. You can also try PCA - Principal Component Analysis which map you data into new space, where every signal is orthogonal to all others. Good idea would be checking if some inputs should be delayed. Not only can you check correlations between delayed inputs and outputs, but also you could use cross-correlation function to check what value of lag is optimal.
