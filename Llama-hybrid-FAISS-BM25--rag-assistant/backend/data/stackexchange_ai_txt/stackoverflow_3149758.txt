If I'm understanding you correctly, the issue is that you're getting a run-or-download dialog when you mean for the vCard to simply open from the web. Assuming that is actually what you're wanting, I believe you need only to set your response to one of the vCard MIME types ( text/x-vcard , text/directory;profile=vCard , or text/directory ). Response.ContentType = "text/x-vcard"; I hope that helps. - EDIT - Using the following code, I am properly prompted to Open or Save (and Open opens the file in Outlook) in Internet Exploder. Unfortunately, Chrome still does not support opening files it seems, and so there is a download box somewhat permanently it seems. Try the following code out in IE and you'll see what I mean; it works. Also, on a side note - I would have been able to replicate your code somewhat easier if properly formatted. Any chance you can edit your post, highlight the code, and hit the "101010" icon? Thanks much, and good luck! using System; using System.IO; using System.Web.UI; namespace WebApplication1 { public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page { private string nameLast = "May"; private string nameFirst = "Lance"; private string nameMiddle = "R."; private string nameTitle = "Mr."; private string company = "CoreLogic"; private string department = "Development"; private string uRL = "http://www.lancemay.com"; private string title = "Application Developer Senior"; private string profession = "Developer"; private string telephone = "(123) 555-1212"; private string fax = "(321) 555-1212"; private string mobile = "(555) 555-1212"; private string email = "lancemay@gmail.com"; private string office = "Louisville"; private string addressTitle = ""; private string streetName = "123 Easy St."; private string city = "Louisville"; private string region = "KY"; private string postCode = "40223"; private string country = "US"; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { StringWriter stringWrite = new StringWriter(); System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new HtmlTextWriter(stringWrite); //vCard Begin stringWrite.WriteLine("BEGIN:VCARD"); stringWrite.WriteLine("VERSION:2.1"); //Name stringWrite.WriteLine("N:" + nameLast + ";" + nameFirst + ";" + nameMiddle + ";" + nameTitle); //Full Name stringWrite.WriteLine("FN:" + nameFirst + " " + nameMiddle + " " + nameLast); //Organisation stringWrite.WriteLine("ORG:" + company + ";" + department); //URL stringWrite.WriteLine("URL;WORK:" + uRL); //Title stringWrite.WriteLine("TITLE:" + title); //Profession stringWrite.WriteLine("ROLE:" + profession); //Telephone stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;WORK;VOICE:" + telephone); //Fax stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;WORK;FAX:" + fax); //Mobile stringWrite.WriteLine("TEL;CELL;VOICE:" + mobile); //Email stringWrite.WriteLine("EMAIL;PREF;INTERNET:" + email); //Address stringWrite.WriteLine("ADR;WORK;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:" + ";" + office + ";" + addressTitle + "=0D" + streetName + ";" + city + ";" + region + ";" + postCode + ";" + country); stringWrite.WriteLine("END:VCARD"); Response.ContentType = "text/x-vcard"; Response.Write(stringWrite.ToString()); Response.AppendHeader("Hi", "PMTS"); Response.End(); } } }
