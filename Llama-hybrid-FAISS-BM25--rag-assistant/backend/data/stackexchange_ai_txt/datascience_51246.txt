How to implement this CNN architecture in Keras

I am trying to implement in Keras the CNN architecture used by Rajpurkar et al and illustrated below: I am particularly confused about that max pool that is shown in the right side. Is that a fork from the main sequential line? How do I implement that? Thanks.
