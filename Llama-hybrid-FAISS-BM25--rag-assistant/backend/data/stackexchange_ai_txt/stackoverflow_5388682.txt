Creating an ETL system (Data import and transformation)

I have been tasked to write a module for importing data into a client's system. I thought to break the process into 4 parts: 1. Connect to the data source (SQL, Excel, Access, CSV, ActiveDirectory, Sharepoint and Oracle) - DONE 2. Get the available tables/data groups from the source - DONE i. Get the available fields form the selected table/data group - DONE ii. Get all data from the selected fields - DONE 3. Transform data to the user's requirements 4. Write the transformed data the the MSSQL target I am trying to plan how to handle complex data transformations like: Get column A from Table tblA, inner joined to column FA from table tblB, and concatenate these two with a semicolon in between. OR Get column C from table tblC on source where column tblC.D is not in table tblG column G on target database. My worry is not the visual, but the representation in code of this operation. I am NOT asking for sample code, but rather for some creative ideas. The data transformation will not be with free text, but drag and drop objects that represent actions. I am a bit lost, and need some fresh input.
