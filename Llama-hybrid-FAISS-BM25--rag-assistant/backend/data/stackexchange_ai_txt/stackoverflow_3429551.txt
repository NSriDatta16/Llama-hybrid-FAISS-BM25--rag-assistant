Way to record changes to an object using F#

Is there a clever way to record changes made to an object in F#? I have been researching F# as a way to build an object model that replicates itself over the network. One task I need to solve is how to detect changes made to objects so I can send only changes to clients Note: I am looking for answers other than "implement INotifyPropertyChanged" or "do something that can easily be done in C#". If that is the only way to solve the problem in F# then F# is not the tool im looking for. Why F#? Because I am not satisfied with the ways this state observer pattern is implemented in C#. Hence I am investigating if there is some elegant way to implement it in a dynamic language, starting with F#.
