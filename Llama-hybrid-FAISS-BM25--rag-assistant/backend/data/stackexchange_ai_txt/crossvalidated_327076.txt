Since the question title is generic (and not specific to computer vision), I will give the NLP -related answer as well, in case it helps someone who stumbles upon looking for pretrained vector embeddings: The two most popular pre-trained vector embeddings can be found on these links: GloVe- https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ Tensorflow Embeddings - https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ There are also a couple of less popular and/or more recent ones: LexVec - https://github.com/alexandres/lexvec FastText - https://github.com/icoxfog417/fastTextJapaneseTutorial Meta-Embeddings - http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/meta-emb/
