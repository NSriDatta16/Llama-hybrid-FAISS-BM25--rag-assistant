In addition to the other excellent answers: To get more precise inference, you can model via logistic regression. That can always be done with a $2\times 2$ contingency table, and then use likelihood methods. I will show profile likelihood used to get more precise confidence intervals for the log-odds ratio, a confidence interval is also more informative than a p-value only. With R code: Smoker |z|) (Intercept) -6.9721 0.2237 -31.170 Exponentiating the confidence limits then gives a confidence interval for the odds ratio: exp(c(0.7032746, 2.0316117 )) [1] 2.020358 7.626368 which is a direct measure of effect size. Note that this confidence interval is based on likelihood profiling, which usually is more precise than the Wald confidence intervals, which we can get by confint.default(mod0, 2) 2.5 % 97.5 % SmokerYes 0.7173564 2.033688 which in this case is not very different, probably because the sample size is so large. If you instead want a more direct measure, like the difference in proportions, use the (similar) methods in Finding a confidence interval for difference of proportions There is also higher-order likelihood inference, in R with packages hoa , cond . We can try this to see if it makes much of a difference, but the conclusion is that, not. Again, probably because of the large sample size. But below some results: library(cond) mod0.cond The modified likelihood root interval is supposed to be the most accurate, but the different intervals given here are very similar.
