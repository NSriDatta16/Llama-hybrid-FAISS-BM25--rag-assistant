"Pooling" all of the predictions and calculating the error over the entrie dataset as opposed to calculating the error for each fold and averaging results in a biased estimate. The bias may be minimal most of the time and for metrics like RMSE but it can be quite significant for rank based performance measures as discussed here: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-8-326
