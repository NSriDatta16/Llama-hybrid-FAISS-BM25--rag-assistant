I feel your pain. I feel it so much, that I have recently abandoned GridBagLayout entirely, in favor of another tool - JGoodies Forms . Its layout code is more concise, reads at a higher level, and is in general much more satisfying to use than GridBagLayout. It defines a mini-language to define layouts. It's cryptic at first glance, but don't let that discourage you. If you are able to use it in your environment, I would highly recommend it.
