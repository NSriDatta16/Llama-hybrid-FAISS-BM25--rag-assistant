"SIGIR" - the conference "TREC" - the conference Baeza-Yates, Ribeiro-Neto, "Modern Information Retrieval" (1999) Witten, "Managing Gigabytes" (1999) van Rijsbergen, "Information Retrieval" (1979) are the obvious "bibles" (as mentioned above). BÃ¼ttcher, Clarke, Cormack, "Information Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Engines" (2010) is an interesting new textbook (student-level), full of biliographic references. It contains a good explanation of parallel retrieval algorithms (sample chapter). Croft, Metzler, Strohman, "Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice" (2009) has good reviews; I didn't like it too much (read the sample chapters on Croft's homepage). Voorhees, Harman, "Trec: Experiment and Evaluation in Information Retrieval" (2009) is a good introduction to the TREC approach in evaluating IR. Langville, Meyer, "Google's Pagerank and Beyond: The Science of Search Engine Rankings" (2006) explains how to efficently compute PageRank.
