In a regression problem and based on algorithm of your choice (such as multiple linear regression, or symbolic regression) you don't need to scale your data. As I examined in several problems, scaling hurts the model fit when data is scaled. However for SVM ans ANN you may need to scale your data There is another case that one needs to select right scaling method , which is a dataset with both categorical and numerical variables. If one uses min/max method, model may be confused to determine that 1 is for numerical or categorical feature (discrete/continuous); especially if one wants to do clustering ! So the right method may be standardizing (I am working on such a problem now)
