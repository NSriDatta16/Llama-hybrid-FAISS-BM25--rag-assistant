Meaning of Diebold-Mariano (DM) test for other accuracy measures (MDA, $R^2$...)

I am trying to compare the accuracies of two time series forecasts. I read about the Diebold-Mariano (DM) Test, which tests the null hypothesis of $E[d_t]=0$ , where $d_t=g(e_{it})-g(e_{jt})$ is the loss differential between the two forecast errors ( $e_t=y_t-\hat{y}_t$ , where $y_t$ is the actual and $\hat{y}_t$ is the forecast). One could set $g(e_{it})=e_{it}^2$ or $g(e_{it})=\vert{}e_{it}\vert$ to obtain a measure based on the differential of MSE or MAE respectively. However, I am wondering whether the result of this test also applies to other accuracy measures which are not based on the forecast error. For instance, consider Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA), defined as: where $F_t$ is the forecast and $X_t$ is the actual value at time $t$ . MDA is thus the proportion of directions correctly predicted by the forecasts. If a DM test fails to reject $H_0$ (i.e. two competing forecasts have the same precision on average) but the two forecasts have very different MDAs, does this mean that one of the forecasts is more precise ( in terms of MDA ) or do the conclusions of the DM test also apply to other measures different from MAE and MSE?
