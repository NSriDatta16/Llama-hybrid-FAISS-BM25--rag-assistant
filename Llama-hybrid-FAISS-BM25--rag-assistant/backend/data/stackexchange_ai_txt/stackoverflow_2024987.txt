What do they mean with application server? The link they provided: http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp An application server is a component-based middleware used in server centric N-tier architecture. It manages the life-cycle of components deployed on it, it provides services for state maintenance, data access (with pooling of resources), security, clustering and fail-over. AFAIK, one of the first application server (as just defined above) was ATG Dynamo. Other proprietary application servers include BroadVision, ColdFusion, etc. But none of them really survived to the advent of Java application servers (understand application servers based on the standards defined by Java EE and the Java language). I mean come on sun, all these names. (...) Wikipedia does a pretty good job at defining what Java SE is: Java Platform, Standard Edition or Java SE is a widely used platform for programming in the Java language. It is the Java Platform used to deploy portable applications for general use. In practical terms, Java SE consists of a virtual machine, which must be used to run Java programs, together with a set of libraries (or "packages") needed to allow the use of file systems, networks, graphical interfaces, and so on, from within those programs. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the virtual machine and the set of libraries i.e. everything you need to run Java software. The JDK (Java Development Kit) provides a JRE plus a compiler (javac) and some other tools i.e. everything you need to run and develop Java software. Java EE is a specification (more precisely, a set of specifications) built on top of the libraries provided by Java SE and is more server-side oriented. Implementations of this specification are provided by Java application servers: GlassFish is Sun's implementation, JBoss is RedHat's implementation, WebLogic is BEA Oracle's implementation, WebSphere is IBM's implementation, etc. Regarding the versions and nomenclature, yes, Sun is crazy . It was an horrible mistake to introduce this "Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition" naming when the version 1.2 came out. I can imagine how confusing this is. But, again, Wikipedia does a great job at clarifying this in the section Nomenclature, standards and specifications : Java SE was known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition or J2SE from version 1.2 until version 1.5. The "SE" is used to distinguish the base platform from Java EE and Java ME. The "2" was originally intended to emphasize the major changes introduced in version 1.2, but was removed in version 1.6. The naming convention has been changed several times over the Java version history . (...) This should make things more clear. (...) however, back to the question. so with application server they mean java ee server? Yes, this is what they mean or, more precisely, they mean Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server (previously named Sun Java System Application Server) . Source: http://developers.sun.com/appserver/ . I've got a mac and people say java is already installed. what is installed exactly? the j2ee or j2se? do i have do download j2ee? Java is just killing me... A JRE or a JDK (if javac available, it's a JDK), so only the Java SE part. And actually, if you are still following me, you don't download Java EE, you download something providing an implementation of it (i.e. an application server). (...) so that makes application server = ee server = servlet container? No. To simplify, a Java EE server = Servlet container + EJB Container. Some server are only Servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty), they don't provide the EJB container part and thus don't fully implement the Java EE specification and can't be considered as full Java EE servers. and jdk = j2se? so j2ee != jdk? I hope I covered this with my answer.
