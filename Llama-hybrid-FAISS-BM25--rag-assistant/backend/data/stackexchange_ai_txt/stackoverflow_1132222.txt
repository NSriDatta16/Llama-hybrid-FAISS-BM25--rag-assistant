First of all you should never override the paint method of a top level container (JApplet, JFrame, JDialog). Then to do custom painting on other Swing components you override the paintComponent() method of the component, NOT the paint() method. Read the Swing tutorial on Custom Painting . So first fix those problems. I'm not sure what the point of the Thread is but remove it from your code until you solve your other problems. If you are trying to do animation, then you should be using a Swing Timer , not a Thread. If you want to see some code for dragging components you can take a look at Moving Windows for some generic code.
