A class is not an object. In simpler C language , a class is like a struct type, but more complex. Using a C struct example as analogy: struct class_ { int attribute00; float attribute02; ... } struct class_ object_ = {0, 0.0, ...}; struct class_ is act like a class and object_ is act like an object . struct class_ has no physical storage in memory, object_ has physical storage in memory. In human language , a word 'house' (as class ) can defined in dictionary as place to stay, with doors, with windows, and rooms that you can only speak with your mouth to tell other people what is a house. A physical house (as object ) is a solid build house on a land that you can move in and stay with your family. A word 'house' take no physical occupation of land or space. A physical house occupy land and space.
