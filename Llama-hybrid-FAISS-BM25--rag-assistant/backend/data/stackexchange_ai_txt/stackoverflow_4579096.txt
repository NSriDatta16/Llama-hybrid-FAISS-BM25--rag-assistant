Maybe Adobe AIR is something to take a look at? Check out their sample applications . If you don't like using a "proprietary" technology, check out HTML5 technologies like Web Storage and Web SQL (not in the HTML5) spec.) These technologies are completely client side (but can be extended to work over a network), so no need to wait for a server. I've no clue how capable/easy to work with the Web SQL route is, but there are some decent AIR applications out there.
