Do you mean that characters is being called three times? If so, you just need to make your code handle that - the parser is perfectly at liberty to do this. You shouldn't assume that you'll get all character data in one call. From the documentation for DocumentHandler.characters() : SAX parsers may return all contiguous character data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event must come from the same external entity, so that the Locator provides useful information.
