You could scrape Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu for images and then do manual/semi-manual filtering of the data (semi with machine learning). Google gives approximately 700 images, Yandex gives 1500. You could probably get about 10000 from the search systems. Include search on Pinterest and Twitter. The feed of the last one was endless for me (probably more than 5000 photos, but you should check). You could also make a crawler for Instagram and Facebook. Most likely Instagram could cover all your needs. But you need to check their license agreement. And the crawler is not so easy to program.
