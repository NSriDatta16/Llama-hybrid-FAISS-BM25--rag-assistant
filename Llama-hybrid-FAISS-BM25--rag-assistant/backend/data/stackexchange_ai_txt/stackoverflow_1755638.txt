I had the same problem and I found a solution. It insÂ´t the most elegant, but it works. 1 - when you execute the process, you get the inputStream from the process 2 - Then you make a loop receiving the message shown in the prompt, if there was one 3 - When you see that you got from "prompt" the "press a key to continue", or whatever, you end the proccess // Creates the runtime and calls the command Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(Destino); // Get the proccess inputStream InputStream ips = proc.getInputStream(); String output = ""; int c = 0; // Read the output of the pro while ((c = ips.read()) != -1 && !output.contains("Press any key to continue")) { output = output + (char)c; } // Destroy the proccess when you get the desired message proc.destroy();
