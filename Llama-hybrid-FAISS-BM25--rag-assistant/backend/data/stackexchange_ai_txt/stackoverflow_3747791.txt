I want a function that reads in a file and returns the sum of ascii values

I want a function that reads in a file and returns the sum of ascii values. I have looked at this page: How to open a file and find the longest length of a line and then print it out and the answer to my question was probably starring me in the face, but I cant follow the code enough to make it work for me. Also if you could tell me how to look for the functions I want instead of having to ask on here that would be cool. Thank you. Or is this something I need to build? Current code: #include #include double get_number(int num); main () { double n1,n2,n3; double average; printf("\nCompute the ascii average of 3 files\n"); printf("--------------------------------\n"); n1 = get_number(1); n2 = get_number(2); n3 = get_number(3); average = (n1 + n2 + n3)/3; printf("The average is %0.2f\n",average); } double get_number(int num) { double value = 0; int c; printf("Please input entry %i: ", num); while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { value = value + (c); } return(value); }
