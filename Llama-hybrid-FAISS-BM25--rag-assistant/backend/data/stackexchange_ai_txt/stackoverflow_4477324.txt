I know you've accepted an answer already but your posted code has a problem with the following loop: for(int i=0;i The vector indexes are zero-based. If the vector size is 5 then the valid indexes are 0..4. Your code would try to access elements 0.. 5 which is an off-by-one error. I believe your "fix" of the stack size is merely masking other real problems. In addition, you should be passing the vector by reference, not by value. You are currently copying the vector when you call AUROC(vector v) . This is slow and an extravagant waste of memory. Change the function to AUROC(vector &v) .
