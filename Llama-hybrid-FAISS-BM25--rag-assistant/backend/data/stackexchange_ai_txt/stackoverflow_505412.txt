Some people here suggested using a dictionary and generating word sequences using a Markov Chain . That seems like a theoretically viable solution, especially if you use a high-order Markov Chain (not bi- or trigrams). But I think in practice it would work better if you could collect a database of existing haikus and selectively change single words in them (e.g., change a given word to another, semantically related word). The existing haikus give you some kind of structure and cohesion, and you just need to (ex-)change little parts in them in order to create a new haiku (a variation on the old one). Of course they won't be completely new haikus with this method, but at least they will be somewhat enjoyable for the readers.
