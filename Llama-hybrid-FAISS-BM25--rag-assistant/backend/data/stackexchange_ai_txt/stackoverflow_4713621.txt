Sending Email Via Google App Engine In my opinion the best idea is just to learn the basic of python and send your email using google app engine. Google App Engine allows you to send 1000 emails a day without charge and after that they have a real generous fee($0.0001 per recipient) if you ask me. To sent email you only need this code(genius if you ask me): from google.appengine.api import mail mail.send_mail(sender="Example.com Support ", to="Albert Johnson ", subject="Your account has been approved", body=""" Dear Albert: Your example.com account has been approved. You can now visit http://www.example.com/ and sign in using your Google Account to access new features. Please let us know if you have any questions. The example.com Team """) if you hook it up to a controller(webapp) you could sent emails for free(probably). I would advise you to watch this video: " Developing and deploying an application on Google App Engine ". It will only take you 10 minutes and will have learned to develop and deploy the code to Google App Engine. I would like to reiterate that it all can be done within 10 minutes :). Cron Job Like others have mentioned you could setup a cron(job) if your webhosting(shared?) does allow this or use one of the freely available webcrons which provide you a webhook which gets called. Some examples by quick googling are: Again off course Google App Engine's cron with almost no restrictions. http://www.setcronjob.com/ => Free Account: You can create unlimited cron jobs every hour for FREE. http://www.mywebcron.com/ => Could not find quota http://www.cronwatch.com/ => CronWatch.com offers free online cronjobs for up to 10 cronjobs http://www.cronjobs.org/ => up to every 5 min http://www.onlinecronjobs.com/ => gets 5 free cron jobs. And yet some list providing online Cron: http://blog.setcronjob.com/2009/06/list-of-free-cron-jobs.html http://www.onlinecronservices.com/ As you can see there are more then enough alternatives to batch up your emails and sent them out via cronjob.
