Here's an R model of "trending and reversing": #Plot a random time series x Notice that you'll always get trending and reversing, 100% of the time (run the code over and over). And, those so-called "trends" and "reversals" were generated from a random sequence . So, how can you tell the difference between "trending" and "reversing" that's just random, versus "trending" and "reversing" that is due to some trading situation? If you think about it for a while, you'll come to the conclusion that you can't. The whole concept is a waste of time (and it's not just trends/reversals that are a waste of time).
