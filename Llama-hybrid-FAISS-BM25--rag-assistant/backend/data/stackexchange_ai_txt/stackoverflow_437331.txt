Hrm. From tablesorter's method of reorganizing the table, I'm pretty sure that this isn't entirely possible. Tablesorter pulles each tr out of the DOM one by one and sorts them based on an indexed field, reinserting the entire tr without changing the tr's contents in any way. Your requested solution would then need to iterate back through the table after each sort and re-enumerate the first column. Tablesorter does have a plugin method, which is used by the zebrastripe and other extensions. Perhaps this could be used to hook the sort methods?
