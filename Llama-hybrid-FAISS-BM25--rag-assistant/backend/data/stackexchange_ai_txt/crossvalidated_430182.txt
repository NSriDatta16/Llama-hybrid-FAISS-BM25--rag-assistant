Statistical difference among groups

I have a sample of people answering a purchase intent question for 3 products. I tabulate the data and get this for definitely would buy: prod1 20% definitely would buy prod2 15% definitely would buy prod3 25% definitely would buy So the average across the 3 products is 16,7%. What I would like to know is, given the 16,7% average how can I test if for example prod1 is statistically higher than the average across the 3 products. My sample is 250 respondents. Calculations can be done manually but I prefer if done in R (95% confidence).
