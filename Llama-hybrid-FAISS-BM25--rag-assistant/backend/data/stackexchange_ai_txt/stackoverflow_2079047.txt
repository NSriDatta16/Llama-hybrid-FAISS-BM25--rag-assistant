If you just want to substitute your own error message, there is RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR ... When no_data_found then RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20000 , 'Insert Products: One of selects returned nothing'; , true); The third parameter returns the original error as well as your custom one. Oracle also gives us the option to define our exceptions. This can be useful if we want to pass the exception to a calling program... Declare no_product_found exception; Begin .... When no_data_found then raise no_product_found; This would be most effective if we defined the NO_PRODUCT_FOUND exception in a package specification where it could be referenced by external program units. In addition, Oracle provides the INIT_EXCEPTION pragma which allows us to associate Oracle error numbers with our custom exceptions. Unfortunately we cannot overload error numbers which Oracle has already defined (for instance, we cannot create our own exceptions for ORA-1403 which is already covered by the NO_DATA_FOUND exception).
