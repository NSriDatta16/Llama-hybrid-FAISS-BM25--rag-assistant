Never used Infragistics controls myself but Google suggests that you are right and suggests that atb is a private binary format. ComponentSource have a free help file for Infragistics UltraSuite including the ActiveToolBars Control - look in Igtbars3.hlp. It says ATB files are "Layout files are used to store information about the position of the Tools and ToolBars utilized by an ActiveToolBars control, and provide an efficient way for your application to maintain a user's Tool and ToolBar settings between sessions." There's sample code to save and load these files. For example SSActiveToolBars1.SaveLayout App.Path & "/RTFEdit.Atb" Also, have you tried opening the project in the VB6 IDE and then looking at the properties of the GUI toolbars? There might be a "custom" option in the property window, that will open a special dialogue box that lets you change the GUI toolbar appearance.
