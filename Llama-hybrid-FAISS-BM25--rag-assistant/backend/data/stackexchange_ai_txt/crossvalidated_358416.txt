Answering your question about non-identically distributed error terms: In logistic regression, the logit of the dependent variable is regressed on the predictors and the errors of this regression are, in fact, identically distributed and follow a logistic distribution. However, when back-transformed to the response scale, the error term can only take two values at each level of the linear predictor: $$e_i = 1-\pi_i \quad\vert Y_i = 1\\e_i = -\pi_i \quad\,\,\,\,\,\,\vert Y_i = 0$$ Because $e_i = Y_i - \pi_i$ (and $\pi_i$ is constant), the variance of this error term is equal to the variance of the binary variable $Y_i$. The variance of the binary variable $Y_i$ is given by $\sigma^2(Y_i) = \pi_i(1-\pi_i)$ and is non-constant because it is dependent on the mean $\pi_i$. Kutner et al. (2005).
