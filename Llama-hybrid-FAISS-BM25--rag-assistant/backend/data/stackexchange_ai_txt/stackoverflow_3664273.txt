Pre-generation of resource representation

The assumptions that I have are - Representations have a definition which have its last modified date. E.g., Script that generates a JSON representation of a resource has when the script has been last modified. Resource's persistent storage does not have any storage limitation Now the situation is that I have Resources for which their representations could be either pre-generated or generated on the fly; where pre-generated refers to text/html or application/atom+xml being generated when the resource is modified (could be done asynchronously) and generated on the fly refers to, e.g., a JSP/PHP script generating representation when requested. What I am confused about is how much performance increment would pre-generation be versus generated-on-fly + caching ? What are your experience/opinion?
