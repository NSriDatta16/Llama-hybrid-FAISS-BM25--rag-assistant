Hard to tell, really. The client seems to be decoding the question mark into "%3F" but not the ampersand. Suspicious, isn't it?. This looks like a buggy client IMO. Maybe nonportable javascript, maybe some URL-rewriting bug on the web server side, or a more esoteric cause ... a malfunctioning browser plugin. To rule out nonportable javascript, log the user-agent and compare results. To rule out url-rewriting bug, log referer. AFAIK, the URL decoder behavior is hardcoded. The string encoding can change if uri's get written in non-ascii or non-iso88591, but that's not what you're after. What encodes question marks but fail to encode ampersands escapes me.
