Having "___ in (select distinct ___ from #temp)" in Case statement

I'm trying to achieve this select case when Org_CD = '1111' or Org_CD in (select distinct New_Org_CD from #temp) then 'International' end as 'Organisation', count(*) from #AnotherTempTable group by case when Org_CD = '1111' or Org_CD in (select distinct New_Org_CD from #temp) then 'International' end I received this error: Column '#AnotherTempTable.Org_Cd' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause. Is it because I cannot use "in" keyword inside the case statements? If yes, any known workarounds would be more than helpful!
