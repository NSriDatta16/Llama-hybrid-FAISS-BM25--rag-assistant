Are some words searched more frequently or repeatedly than others? Perhaps you can cache frequently searched terms in a separate database or other store. Load it in a separate thread as a searchable store, while you are loading the main store. As for a data structure solution, you might look into a suffix trie to search for substrings in linear time. This will probably increase your storage requirements, though, which may affect your ability to implement this with an iPhone's limited memory and disk storage capabilities.
