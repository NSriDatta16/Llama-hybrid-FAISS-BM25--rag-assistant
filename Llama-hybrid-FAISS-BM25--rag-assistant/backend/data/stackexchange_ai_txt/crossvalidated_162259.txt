Softmax regression: Intuition about why distribution of $y$ is in terms of $e^{\theta^Tx}$ as opposed to just $\theta^Tx$

I'm going through Andrew Ng's lecture notes on Machine Learning and I just learnt about softmax regression there. We see that, for softmax regression, the conditional distribution of $y$ given $x$ is given as: This formula contains terms of form $e^{\theta^Tx}$. I was just wondering if there is an intuitive explanation for this? Or, why isn't the derived formula for probability simpler like: $$\frac{\theta^Tx}{\sum_j\theta_{j}^Tx}$$ And is there an intuitive explanation for what that would mean?
