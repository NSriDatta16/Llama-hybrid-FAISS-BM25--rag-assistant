You have to specify a length of index. Maximum length depends on storage engine, but usually it's not more than 1000 bytes, if charset is utf-8, you have to divide maximum lengh by 3. create index guid_index on table_name (myguid (1000) ); It's good enough for WHERE field LIKE 'prefix%' and WHERE field = 'text' conditions.
