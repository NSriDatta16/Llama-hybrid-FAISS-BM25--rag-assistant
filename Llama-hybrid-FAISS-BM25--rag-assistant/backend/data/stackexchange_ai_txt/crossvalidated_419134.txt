Hey hopefully I'm understanding your question correctly and this helps. It sounds like this is a general theory question about how to model a real-world event when we don't have access to the full population. This is the case most of the time, which is why we rely on probability distributions. The long answer: In your example, you want to predict either the number of childbirths on a given date or the probability of a certain number of childbirths on that date. The simplest way (that I can think of) to model this would be to assume that the number of childbirths a day follows a Binomial distribution: i.e. Let X be the random variable "the number of childbirths a day", following a Binomial distribution with unknown n and p parameters: X ~ Binomial(n, p) The question is how to estimate the values n (number of women who could give birth a day) and p (probability of giving birth that day). This is known as statistical inference and there are many available frequentist and Bayesian methods for performing this. The short answer: We cannot generalise a small sample to a population easily but we can make an assumption about which distribution the model may follow and then use statistical inference to estimate the shape of the distribution.
