For a very simple 'site-like' project, there's not much in it, and it will come down to your choice of declarative development (jQuery) or programmatic (Sencha Touch, my company). The latter is a little more mature. If you're looking to build a richer, self-contained app (say, with MVC, off-line storage etc), then Sencha Touch would be your only real single choice between the two. NB Sencha Touch comes with two licences (GPL & commercial) and both are free-of-charge. Interested to see that you are using a web app approach when your only target is a single platform (Android, because of the Flash dependency)... you might be interested to see what's possible with CSS3 these days and therefore what you could then use more happily across mobile OS platforms: http://dev.sencha.com/animator/demos/
