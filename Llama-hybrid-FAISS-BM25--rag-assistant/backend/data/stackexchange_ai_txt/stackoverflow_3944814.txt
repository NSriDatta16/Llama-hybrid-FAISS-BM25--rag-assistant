This really depends on what you're looking for. If you'd like to have all the data at hand but not necessarily on screen at once, a great solution would be to use jQuery's UI Tabs . You could throw each table in a separate div and easily toggle them with the tabs. You could display multiple at once a la a stock trading application. But from a UI standpoint that can get ugly in a hurry. How about dynamically building one gigantic table via HTML or JSON string then using jQuery's datatables to paginate, sort, filter, and show/hide columns? That probably would give you the best of all worlds while still making it readable to your users. You could also use Datatables and tabs together to get more than one at a time. Datatables is the easiest way I can think of to make a standard table more user friendly quickly.
