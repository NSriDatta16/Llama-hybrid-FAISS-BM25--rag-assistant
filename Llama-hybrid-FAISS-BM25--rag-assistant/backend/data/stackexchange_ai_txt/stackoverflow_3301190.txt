htmlentities displaying html safely

I have data that is coming in from a rss feed. I want to be safe and use htmlentities but then again if I use it if there is html code in there the page is full of code and content. I don't mind the formatting the rss offers and would be glad to use it as long as I can display it safely. I'm after the content of the feed but also want it to format decently too (if there is a break tag or paragraph or div) Anyone know a way?
