How can I dynamically access property of Java object in GWT?

Using GWT I have a Java class: public class Pojo { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } } The above class is shared between the client and server side code. From the client code I would like to dynamically access the property. That is, I would like to write a method with the following signature: public String getProperty(Object o, String propertyName) Such that the following code would work: Pojo pojo = new Pojo(); pojo.setName("Joe"); getProperty(pojo, "name"); // this should return "Joe" Java reflection is obviously out. And I have tried the following JSNI method: public static native String getProperty(Object o, String name) /*-{ return o[name]; }-*/; But that does not work. The special syntax for accessing Java objects from JavaScript can't be used either as I want this to be dynamic. Any ideas on how I can do this? For completeness, I will also want to be able to set a property dynamically as well. EDIT: blwy10's answer was a great tip to get me searching using "gwt reflection" instead of with terms like "dynamic property access". This lead me to gwt-ent , which has an very elegant reflection solution. I am going to try this one, as it does not require a separate code generation step.
