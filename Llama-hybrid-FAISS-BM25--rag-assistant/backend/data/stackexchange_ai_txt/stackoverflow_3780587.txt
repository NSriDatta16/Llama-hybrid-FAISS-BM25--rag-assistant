Android Client connecting to the Server over SSL

I am trying to create an SSL connection from android client to the server over SSL. In the very beginning I was always getting javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: no cipher suites in common on the server when connection was attempted. After some investigation I realized that Android uses Bouncy Castle SSL implementation and the cipher suites there are different from those SUN provides. So I've added Bouncy Castle provider to the server. The original problem went away, but I now get Exception in thread "main" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: NO SERVER CERTIFICATE FOUND I am not sure why I get this. I have generated the certificate. Granted I am using JKS to store it, but why would it matter? It's just a format of storage, the certificate should be exactly the same. If anyone has done non HTTP client server programming on Android using SSL I would really appreciate any pointers on what I need to do.
