I think the question behind your question is "what makes information?". It is a good question. Grammar technicality: Does PCA always lose information? Nope. Does it sometimes lose information? Youbetcha. You can reconstruct the original data from components. If it always lost information then this would not be possible. It is useful because it often does not lose important information when you use it to reduce dimension of your data. When you lose data it is often the higher frequency data and often that is less important. The large-scale, general trends, are captured in the components associated with the larger eigenvalues.
