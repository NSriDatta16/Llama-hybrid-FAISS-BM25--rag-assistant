Yes, it is. You could just use an OS API and/or sound library, which would be kind of pointless, so I'll assume you want to learn about how sound is encoded and realised by computer hardware. Basically a sound card requires a stream of values (something like 48000 per second, it varies with sound quality) which represent the target position of the speaker diaphragm at that time. WAV files simply store these numbers in a file. This takes up lots of space. MP3, OGG, etc. apply mathematical transforms to the data in order to reduce the amount of space required, by: decreasing the precision of frequencies which human hearing is less sensitive to compress repetitive audio To really "achieve" the whole music playing thing, you'd need to decode the audio file, and configure the sound hardware and write the stream of data to it. Can be done :)
