How to estimate the $\mu$ in the Bayesian regression model?

For a simple linear regression model without intercept, that is $$y_i=ax_i+\varepsilon_i$$ where $\varepsilon_i\sim_{iid} N(0, \tau^2), i=1,2,\dots, n$ and $x_i$ is a fixed covariate. Assume that $a|\tau \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)$ . and $\tau$ is fixed. By the least squares estimator of $a$ , we know that the minimum of $$\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{a}x_i)^2$$ obtained at the estimator of $a$ $$\hat{a}=\frac{\sum_{i}x_iy_i}{\sum_i x_i^2}$$ But I do not know how to use this estimator to estimate the $\mu$ ?
