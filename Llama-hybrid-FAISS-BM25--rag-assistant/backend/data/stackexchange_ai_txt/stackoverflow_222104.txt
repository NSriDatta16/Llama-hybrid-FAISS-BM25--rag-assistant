Yes, I have had an opportunity to use paid support from Microsoft. I was working for a dot-com and we were having intermittent crashes on our main site which used ASP. I had been asked to run this utility to generate a crash dump when the error popped up on the site and had sent a few in to be analyzed. The analysis suggested that the number of string concatenations being done in the code was a potential issue as this was causing the memory to fragment and that led to the issue as the code had hundreds of concatenations, sometimes where the code didn't even need to do it, e.g. in a line there would be " blah blah blah " & " more more more" where the & is unnecessary and causing part of the issue, as well as suggesting that a string array may be better for handling taking string after string to build part of the response for some pages.
