The terms "structured data" or "unstructured data" are not defined in such a way that a given dataset is always either one or the other. There are gray areas and I think this is one example. Since you cannot rely on the structure in your data, I would categorize this as unstructured. To understand if it's a good idea to store the whole HTML in the DB (and same question for the PNGs), you need to weigh the pro's and con's. Pro storing everything in the DB is the simplicity: You don't have separate places where data is stored, so if you take a snapshot from the DB at some point in time and restore it, you restore the entire state as it was at that time. You do not need to worry about your disk storage separately, to restore that to a given state. Against storing everything in the DB is the amount of data. Can the DB handle it, or does performance suffer too much? Think about retrieving the data, searching/querying it, storing data, making back-ups. This will depend on your choice of database. The same question for ELK and MySQL: What are the pros and cons of each? MySQL is simpler to install, that's always good. MySQL gives you a relational datamodel (tables can be related using foreign keys). Is that an advantage? MySQL gives you transactions. Is that helpful? ELK mainly gives you scalability, meaning that probably it would allow everything to be stored in the DB and still meet your performance needs. If you can't store everything in MySQL (HTML and PNGs), then before choosing to store part of the data somewhere else, my first option would be to change DB technology to something that can store everything, rather than to start storing things in different places. So in that case ELK might be a good option, but store the PNGs there, too.
