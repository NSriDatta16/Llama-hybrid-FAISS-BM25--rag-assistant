Height and Width in an embed tag are required attributes. Have a gander at swfobject or Adobe on the tag definition as well as required and optional attributes . Are you asking why they're required or why your page will break if you don't have them (hint, the first answer is the second question)? EDIT: You should modify the width and height attribute of the EMBED and OBJECT tags to be exactly to the size of the swf. You can set your application width and height in the .mxml If you set the scaleMode to "noScale" you won't see any scaling in your swf. stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE; stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT; If you're in Actionscript 3 (which you should be), you can set the meta-data in your main class. i.e. [SWF(width="640", height="480")] public class MyClass extends Sprite { public function MyClass() { stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE; stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT; } }
