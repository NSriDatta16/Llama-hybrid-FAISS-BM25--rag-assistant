+1 for Michael Chernick, yet I'll add few words from a ML point of view. Survival problem is specific -- it seems like a pure regression, but it adds a serious constrains (monotonicity between individual "sick/resistance factors" and output, autocorrelation of decision over time, asymmetry of error in case of censored data, etc.) -- and constrains mean information we can get for "free" instead of squeezing it from the data. Thus, it is just beneficial to use survival-aware model for survival data -- Cox model may overtake plain SVMs and CARTs just because they would lose their accuracy advantage on recreating survival constrains. However, there actually are survival-aware ML methods -- survival CARTS in party , random survival forests , Cox model boosters... You can find some inspiration on CRAN Survival Task View .
