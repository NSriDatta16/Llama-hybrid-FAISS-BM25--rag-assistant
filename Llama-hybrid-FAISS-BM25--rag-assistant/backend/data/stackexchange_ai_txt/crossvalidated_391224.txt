Answer to the edited version of the question: We must assume here that $Y_1$ is the original data and $Z_1, ..., Z_n$ are the PCA-variables. Then by the simple rule $$\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\text{Var}(X) + b^2\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$ (Exercise: prove this rule ;-)) we have $$\text{Var}(Y_1) = e_{11}^2\text{Var}(Z_1) + ... + e_{1p}^2\text{Var}(Z_p) + 2\sum_{i \neq j} e_{1i} e_{1j} \underbrace{\text{Cov}(Z_i, Z_j)}_{=0}$$ So all in all $$\text{Var}(Y_1) = e_{11}^2\lambda_1 + ... + e_{1p}^2\lambda_p$$ i.e. the variance of the original data component is built up from the entries in the transformation matrix and all the eigenvalues... Does that go into the right direction?
