Check/Uncheck all checkboxes

I've seen many check/uncheck all checkboxes scripts. But far most does not respect that if I toggled all checkboxes using the "checked all"-checkbox and then uncheck a single one in the list, the "checked all" checkbox is still checked. Is there an elegant way of handling this case?
