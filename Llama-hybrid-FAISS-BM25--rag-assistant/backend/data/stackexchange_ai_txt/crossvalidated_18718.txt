What is a normal distribution with 'common variance'?

Data Augmentation Approach in Bayesian Modelling of Presence-only Data (Divino et al. ) states that the data ware sampled from a normal distribution with mean 2.0 and a common variance (section 3). Does anyone know the value of a 'common variance'? Thanks.
