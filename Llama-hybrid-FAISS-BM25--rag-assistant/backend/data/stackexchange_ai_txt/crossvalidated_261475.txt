Explaining Stochastic Gradient Descent In Simple Terms

This year I am doing a science fair project that involves deep learning and neural networks. When I write my report and present my project, I want to do so in very simple terms so that my teachers or classmates, who know absolutely nothing about neural networks, can understand. How can I explain Stochastic Gradient Descent and parameter updates in a way anyone could understand?
