You have basically three options change the input string (can't be a string literal) copy data to output strings (input can be a literal) transform sequences of characters to numbers Changing the input string implies transforming "123:45" to "123\0" "45" with an embedded null. Copying data implies managing storage for the copy. Transforming sequences of characters implies using, for example, strtol .
