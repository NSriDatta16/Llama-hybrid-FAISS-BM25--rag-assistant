A few years ago I used the excellent open source Scintilla editor as a base to derive a custom C# control from. Worked great. Nowadays it's even easier if you leverage the ScintellaNET project (CodePlex) which has already done the wrapper work for you. Of course, if you don't mind paying, you can't go wrong with Actipro's SyntaxEditor.
