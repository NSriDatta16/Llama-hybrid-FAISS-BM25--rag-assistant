nu parameter in one-class SVM with linear kernel

I have made a one-class SVM model using the Linear kernel. I trained my model with 100000 positive examples, each one having a vector of 59 dimensions. The examples come from a public dataset, which I consider it to be high quality for my purpose. I chose to set the value of nu parameter to 0.01 and the prediction results I am getting are not that bad. I was thinking whether my nu value is set correctly or not, so I started looking for advice on setting the nu parameter for one-class svm with linear kernel, but couldn't find any resources specific to that. I am aware that: The parameter nu is an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors relative to the total number of training examples however, I am not sure how should I apply the above definition for one-class linear kernel SVM Any advice/resources on that would be really helpful. Thanks in advance.
