Interpret case control study statistic result

In unmatched case control study, calculating odds ratios, CI and chi-squared values and found out the statistically significant variables. In next step performing multiple logistic regression some of the non significant variables were significant (possibly due to confounding?). How do I have to interpret the result? Serum sampling for disease on farm OR 0.25 adjusted OR 18.1 CI 1.8- 177.2 b 2.9 S.E. 1.16
