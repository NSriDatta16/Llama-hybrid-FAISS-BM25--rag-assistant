How do vector databases work (for the lay-coder)?

A vector database is a type of database that stores and manages unstructured data, such as text, images, or audio, in vector embeddings (high-dimensional vectors) to make it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly. How do you make that more tangible, to a software engineer? Some parts to answering this question: What is meant by "high dimensional" vectors? Does that just mean the array of numbers is a big array? Why is that important / highlighted? How is text, for example, converted to a vector of numbers (at a high level)? Why do they call them vector "embeddings"? I don't need to learn the theory of vectors, how can I understand vector databases practical function and use (as someone who wants to build an AI assistant), without learning about the theory of vectors exactly? I am an experienced software developer with experience with relational databases like PostgreSQL, and other databases like MongoDB (a doc database) or Neo4j (a graph database). So how does a vector database work exactly, at a high level? I just would like to have a practical sense of how it works, so I know what I'm saving to when saving to pinecone, and what I'm querying and maybe how a query roughly works. Relational databases are easy to understand. You just look at a spreadsheet, and the columns have names. Graphs are also easy to understand, you have your named models/types, and they have links between them. But vector databases? Is it literally a hashmap of key = something and value = array of numbers? Or what is it, how to get a practical sense like these other database types?
