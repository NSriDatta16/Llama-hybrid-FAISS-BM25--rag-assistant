Index for a VARCHAR field with a 384 length in a MySQL database

I have a varchar(384) to store emails in a MyISAM table and I want check when the email exists but the index length limit is 333 bytes (because I'm using utf8 (1000 bytes/3 bytes)). Then what's the best way to search if a specified email exists, using a FULLTEXT index or creating another field with the email md5-hash in a BINARY(16) (with collisions check)? [EDIT] Tests using 1M records. Fulltext index: ~300 ms 333 length index: ~15 ms binary(16) md5-hash: ~15 ms So I think that the best option is the second field in performance, but... second field = bigger table, and that's not good for performance or storage. So in a real scenary where emails aren't bigger than 150 characters, a 150 length index in a VARCHAR(384) will be enough.
