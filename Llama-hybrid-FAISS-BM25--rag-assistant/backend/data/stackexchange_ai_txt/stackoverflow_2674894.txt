Annoying IE7 problem

I am styling a Wordpress theme but has run into problem with IE7. The first word("it") inside the paragraph/strong tag ends up to the left of the img tag when I want it BELOW the image. My problem is that the only element I can change CSS properties here is the div, since the code inside is posted with a WYSIWYG by an blog author. Is there anyway i can fix this problem? I have tried lots of different settings and every other browser FF safari IE8 renders the text below the image. It is hard getting it right in IE7!
