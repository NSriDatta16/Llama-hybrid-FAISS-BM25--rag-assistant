Is density estimation the same as parameter estimation?

I was studying parameter estimation from Sheldon Ross' probability and statistics book . Here the task of parameter estimation is described as follows: Is this task the same of density estimation in machine learning contexts? Mathematics for Machine Learning book describes density estimation as follows: My question arises from the fact that a probability density function is fully described by its parameters (e.g. a Gaussian or normal distribution is a density function which is fully described by its mean $\mu$ and its variance $\sigma^2$ ).
