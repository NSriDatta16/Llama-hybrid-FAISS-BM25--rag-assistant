Dress-up game programming problems

I had been made a dress-up game...I arranged the set of dress images into to be the different frames of movieclips with the next button. When i drag the dress images from frame1 movieclip and put on to the stage(avatar),the images from frame1 movieclip will be dissapeared when i clicked on the next button going to the frame2.How do i need to do to make the dress images from frame1 remain on stage even when i clicked the next button to frame2 ?Which coding should i use to make the image stay on stage?....
