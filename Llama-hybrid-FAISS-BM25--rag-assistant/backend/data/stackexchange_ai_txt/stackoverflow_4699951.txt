How do i make an XML-RPC call using AJAX?

Basically i am trying to use OpenSubtitles API with an Adobe AIR project i am working on. So i want to make an XML RPC call to their server using AJAX. How do i do it ? Yesterday i tried the same on Python and it was pretty simple. x1 = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://api.opensubtitles.org/xml-rpc") response = x1.LogIn("", "", "en", "OS Test User Agent") Now how do i achieve the same in AJAX ?
