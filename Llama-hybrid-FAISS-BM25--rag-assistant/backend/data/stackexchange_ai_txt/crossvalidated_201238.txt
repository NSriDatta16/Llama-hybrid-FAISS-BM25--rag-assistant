If you're new to machine learning and familiar with R I might suggest reading up on random forest and gbm. I am very much still learning but have found these to both be relatively simple to apply and found they produce good models even with a great many x variable. Variable selection will help with managing computer resources and is often important part of an optimisation strategy, but from the size of your data set I would consider these two to be an excellent start.
