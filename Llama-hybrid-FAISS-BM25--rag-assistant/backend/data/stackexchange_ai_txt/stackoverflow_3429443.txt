Consider this example of training a feed-forward ANN of one hidden layer (with 3 nodes). Since your data seems to have more output points than input, I'm using a demo dataset, but the idea is the same: %# load sample data laod simpleclass_dataset input = simpleclassInputs; %# 2x1000, 2-dimensional points output = simpleclassTargets; %# 4x1000, 4 classes %# split data into training/testing sets trainInd = 1:500; testInd = 501:1000; %# create ANN and initialize network weights net = newpr(input, output, 3); net = init(net); net.trainParam.epochs = 25; %# max number of iterations %# learn net weights from training data net = train(net, input(:,trainInd), output(:,trainInd)); %# predict output of net on testing data pred = sim(net, input(:,testInd)); %# classification confusion matrix [err,cm] = confusion(output(:,testInd), pred); The output is: err = 0.075075 cm = 81 0 0 0 0 82 0 0 9 0 52 16 0 0 0 93 Obviously you will need access to the Neural Network Toolbox.
