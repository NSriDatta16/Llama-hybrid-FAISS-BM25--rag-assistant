Given that you know all the probabilities that govern your system, I don't think you need to apply anything "Bayesian" for this. You can simply calculate the probability of heads as $$P(H) = P(H | X1) P(X1) + P(H | X2) P(X2)$$ You can use a similar calculation to calculate the probability of tails. Now that you have these probabilities, you can compute the expected earnings if you guess heads and if you guess tails, and base your decision rule on this calculation. Please let me know if any of this is unclear. Edit: When you know $P(H)$ and $P(T)$ you can compute the expected earnings as $$ E(\mathrm{earnings}) = P(H)*[\mathrm{earnings\ in\ case\ of\ }H] + P(T) *[\mathrm{earnings\ in\ case\ of\ }T]$$ Now the earnings in case of heads and tails depend on your decision rule, so you should compute the expected earnings for every possible decision you can make and then make the decision with the highest expected earnings.
