As you are in a Java project you could use Sonar which is an very cool open source project which not only shows statistics of lines of code but some other useful stats as method complexity, tests covering, compliance with code rules among many others. It has a demo instance called Nemo using Apache projects for you to browse its features. Here a screenshot of the Time machine report: Sonar time machine screenshot http://nemo.sonarsource.org/charts/trends/60175?sids=1024412,1025601,1026859,1073764,1348107,2255284&metrics=complexity,mandatory_violations_density,lines,coverage&format=png&ts=1244661473034 I'm pretty sure you'll find many useful info using this software! Foot note: You're in the right track by using SCM since school, well done!
