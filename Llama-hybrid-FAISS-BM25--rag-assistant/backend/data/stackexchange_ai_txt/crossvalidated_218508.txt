Z-score transformation for joint cluster analyses

I am dealing with a situation where I need to use a joint matrix of approximately gaussian distributed data (limits - Inf to + Inf) and beta-distributed data (both produced using different experimental methods for the same samples) to generate clusters. So far I have tried clustering a Random Forest proximity matrix , and the thing that works best is an unconventional approach where I do not model the proximity matrix explicitly as a dissimilarity. I am looking for advice on whether transforming everything to approximately Gaussian using either Z-scores or a logit transform of the beta-distributed variables is a good way of creating a matrix suitable for direct clustering.
