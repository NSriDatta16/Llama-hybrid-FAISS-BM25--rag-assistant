order of execution in run loop

I am using [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithInterval:selector:@selector(loop):repeats:YES] to create a neverending loop with -loop() being called every interval. My viewcontroller also has a -touchesBegan to process UITouch's. Suppose the screen is touched and a UIEvent is fired, does the code in -touchesBegan execute first in the run loop or the code in the -loop called by NSTimer execute first?
