WMSVC works, Web Deploy Agent throws 401

I'm trying to get msdeploy working from the command line, and can successfully test against the WMSVC directly (using HTTPS, port 8172) with both a local admin account and using an IIS Manager user account. Here's the command line: > msdeploy -verb:dump -source:appHostConfig=MyWebsite,wmsvc=myserver,username=iisuser,password=password -allowuntrusted So, wmsvc= directs msdeploy to use https://myserver:8172/msdeploy.axd . However, because the target host firewall doesn't allow port 8172, I'd really like to use the Web Deployment Agent Service over port 80. But, it responds with a 401 when I change wmsvc to computerName: > msdeploy -verb:dump -source:appHostConfig=MyWebsite,computername=myserver,username=myserver\localadmin,password=password where computername= directs msdeploy to use http://myserver/MSDEPLOYAGENTSERVICE . In a browser, that URL prompts for username/password, and returns a blank page (if authenticated), so it seems to be listening and authenticating properly. Also, I've added full rights to the site root for NETWORK SERVICE. What's the difference in using the Web Deployment Agent Service over the standard WMSVC? Thanks in advance!
