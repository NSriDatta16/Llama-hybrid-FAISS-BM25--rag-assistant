In my opinion, changepoint detection has received it's most thorough treatment in the context of sequential models. The "bible" for sequential analysis is probably last year's (2014) book Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection by Alexander Tartakovsky. It is magisterial and seemingly exhaustive in its coverage of the topic. http://www.amazon.com/Sequential-Analysis-Hypothesis-Changepoint-Probability-ebook/dp/B00MMOIWTS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445511005&sr=8-1&keywords=sequential+analysis+tartakovsky In addition, last June Columbia sponsored The Fifth International Workshop in Sequential Methodologies which brought together some of the most prominent and prolific practitioners in the field. Tartakovsky was on the organizing committee. https://sites.google.com/site/iwsm2015/home See the "Detailed Program" link on the conference website for abstracts and papers. A number of automated machine learning, time series solutions are presented and discussed.
