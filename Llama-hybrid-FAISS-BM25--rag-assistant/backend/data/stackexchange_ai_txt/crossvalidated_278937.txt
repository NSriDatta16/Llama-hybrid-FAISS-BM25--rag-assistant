Regularizing the weights sounds like a good idea. Alternatively, you could take a look at simply averaging your two component forecasts, i.e., $w_{S1}=w_{S2}=0.5$. You may be interested in a recent paper: "The forecast combination puzzle: A simple theoretical explanation" (Claeskens et al., 2016, IJF ) . The "puzzle" they refer to is the fact that a straight average of component forecasts surprisingly often outperforms averaging with optimized weights. Their explanation essentially boils down to the bias-variance tradeoff in the optimization of the weights. They don't explicitly mention regularization as a possible remedy, but it is certainly not far-fetched . (Just a note: you fit your model using MAE - I assume you are also assessing forecast quality using the same KPI, right? If you optimize the MAE but then assess using MSE, your optimization may not target the actual quality measure you are interested in. This is mainly relevant if the future distributions are asymmetric, of course.)
