Why do we treat a value at each location as a random variable?

Apology if my question is very simple to you (I am very new to geostatistic). Suppose that X is a random variable (e.g., the concentration of the Zinc at a specific area). Now, we measure the concentration of the Zinc at several locations (say 10 ). As I understand the spatial random filed is defined when we assume that the value of the X at each location is treated as a random variable! This confuses me. Why? because at each location we measure the concentration of the Zinc once. So, how it can be a random variable. If I have only one realization for each location, how can I find the mean and variance? What I understand is that X is a random variable with 10 values (as we have 10 locations). But not the value of X at each location can be treated as a random variable. Am I missing something? any clarification, please? Here is the link (second paragraph)
