About comparing machine learning algorithms

I'm working on comparing 2 algorithms with an experimental protocol that produce 100 folds for each one. As a result, I found that my algorithm got (49.29 $\pm$ 1.69) and the baseline got (50.40 $\pm$ 2.16). I applied ANOVA and other tests and I always got a p-value of 0.60. Method: Deep learning. Goal: comparing 2 algorithms (mine and another) Field: computer-vision Hypothesis ( $\alpha=0.05$ ): H0: the mean of the results are equal. Ha: the mean of the results are unequal. (advantage go to the adversary) Results: Population : 2 ( Method 1 and method 2) sample size = 100 $P=0.6$ and $\alpha = 0.05$ $P > 0.05 $ $=>$ no significant difference Can a reviewer reject the conclusion? (Quality) If you need more information, please ask them in a comment.
