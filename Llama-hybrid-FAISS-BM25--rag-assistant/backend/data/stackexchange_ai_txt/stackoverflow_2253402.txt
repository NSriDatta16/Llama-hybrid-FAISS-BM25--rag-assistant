Here are just 4 examples: CSS Conventions / Code Layout Models Are there any CSS standards that I should follow while writing my first stylesheet? What is the best method for tidying CSS? Best Practices - CSS Stylesheet Formatting On all 4 my answer has included the advice to download and read Natalie Downe's PDF CSS Systems . (The PDF includes tons of notes not in the slides, so read the PDF!). Take note of her suggestions for organization. EDIT (2014/02/05) four years later, I'd say: Use a CSS pre-processor and manage your files as partials (I personally prefer Sass with Compass, but Less is quite good as well and there are others) Read up on concepts like OOCSS , SMACSS , and BEM or getbem . Take a look at how popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation are structured. And don't discount less popular frameworks - Inuit is an interesting one but there are plenty others. Combine/minify your files with a build step on a continuous integration server and/or a task runner like Grunt or Gulp.
