Marginal Likelihood and Its Intractability

In case of VAE, it is said that the posterior distribution is intractable because the marginal likelihood is intractable. My understanding as to why marginal likelihood is intractable: z can have infinitely many possible values, which means the integration will have infinite standard operations. Hence, it will not be a closed form solution and thus is intractable. Is my understanding correct? If not, could anyone please correct me on this? Another question : can latent variable z be discrete? Since integration is only applied for continuous variables, if z is discrete, I think p(x) will be as follows: p(x) = âˆ‘ (|)() Here, z will have fixed number of discrete values and p(x) will hence be tractable. With this, I am basically trying to understand whether or not the latent variables can be discrete in nature and marginal likelihood be tractable due to it in case of Variational Inference. One more confusion that I had is: since z is latent (hidden), how can the values of z be known to be used in integration / summation?
