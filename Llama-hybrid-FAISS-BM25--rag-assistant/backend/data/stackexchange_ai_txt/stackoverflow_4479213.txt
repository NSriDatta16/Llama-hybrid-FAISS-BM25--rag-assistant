How can I create a new object in cron in rails by referencing controller and passing variables?

Currently, I have a manual form-submission way of creating an object which fires off stuff in the create action. I access this form this way: http://localhost:3000/contact_faxes/new?contact=1&fax=7&status=done This takes me to a form, and executes stuff in the create action. As you can see, I take parameters and change them, and pass them as if it were a form submission. But I now want to enable this same process through a cron job. One way I did it was to type all the code back into the cron job, not using the methods new/create at all, which didn't seem like the way to go. How would I be able to leverage the existing methods using the cron job? Here are the new and create methods: https://gist.github.com/746686
