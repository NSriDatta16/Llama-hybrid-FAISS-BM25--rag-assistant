If you can record a video of the light and easily visually decode it upon watching, then there's a fair chance you may be able to do so programmatically with enough work. The first challenge would be finding the light in the background, especially if its small and/or there's any movement of the camera or source. You might actually be able to leverage some kinds of video compression technology to help filter out the movement. The second question is if the phone has enough horsepower and your algorithm enough efficiency to decode it in real time. For a slow enough signaling rate, the answer would be yes. Finally there might be things you could do to make it easier. For example, if you could get the source to flash at exactly half the camera frame rate when it is on instead of being steady on, it might be easier to identify since it would be in every other frame. You can't synchronize that exactly (unless both devices make good use of GPS time), but might get close enough to be of help.
