App-client accesses EJBs via Remote interfaces Since GlassFish v3, Remote interfaces has to be packed inside a Java Class Library, so interfaces are distributable. App-client has to be inside an enterprise application EAR (but not strictly the same EAR with EJB and WAR). The tutorial under http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/entappclient.html explains how to create an app-client , however it doesn't work for me; there is also a question for that matter: Unable to run app-client that is accessing an EJB on GlassFish v3 .
