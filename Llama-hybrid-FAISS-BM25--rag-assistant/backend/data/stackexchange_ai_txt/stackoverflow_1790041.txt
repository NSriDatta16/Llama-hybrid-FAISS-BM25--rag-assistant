After some research, I've decided that the best way is to use the Self organizing maps (SOM) approach. The idea is to self train the SOM network initially with the available/valid images, and then when a new image is inserted, find the nearest images and if matches found under a threshold, report the same. AForge is an excellent library with SOM support ( http://code.google.com/p/aforge/ ) Information on basic SOM here A good read on SOM here
