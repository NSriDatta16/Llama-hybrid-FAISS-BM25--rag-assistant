How to map custom collection in JPA?

I have problems in mapping custom collection with JPA (Hiberante provider). For example when I am using object with attribute List matches; with in my ORM file, it is allright; But if I replace "List matches;" by private Matches matches; ,where "Matches" is defined like: public class Matches extends ArrayList { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; } It produces following error: Caused by: org.hibernate.AnnotationException: Illegal attempt to map a non collection as a @OneToMany, @ManyToMany or @CollectionOfElements: by.sokol.labs.jpa.MatchBox.matches Thanks for your attention!
