If your observations are proportions $p_1, \ldots, p_T$ you can use Beta regression (GLM type) to model $$ p_t \sim Beta(\mu_t, \phi_t),$$ where $\mu_t = g^{-1}(X_t \beta)$ is the conditional mean of the Beta distribution, and $g$ is the link function (typically, g = logit). The $\phi$ parameter is the precision and can be either set as a constant, or also modeled with covariates. In your case a simple trend regression would already do the trick. If you want to look into time series models, I can recommend this very recent AoAS paper on Beta regression, ARMA models, and Google Flu data . Very intuitive and nicely illustrated. References Ferrari and Cibrari-Neto (2004): original paper on Beta regression (see here too) vignette of the betareg R package : this nicely works together with the strucchange package, so you can actually answer also questions about some of the other replies re structural shifts in the data around 2010. Guolo and Varin (2014) and their ARMA models for Beta regression (and here the officially published version)
