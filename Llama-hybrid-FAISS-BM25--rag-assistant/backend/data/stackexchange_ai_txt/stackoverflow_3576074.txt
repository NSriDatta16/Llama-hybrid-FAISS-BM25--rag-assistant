"Linked lists" are rarely used in Python -- normally, one uses just list , the Python built-in list, which is actually more of a "dynamic vector". So, it's peculiar to see a linked list specified as part of the exercise's constraints. But the main point is, the code you're showing is already creating a linked list -- the head is at forste , and, for each node, the next-node pointer at .neste , the payload at .vekt . So, presumably, that's not what you're asking about, no matter the text of your question. The simple way to loop through your linked list once you have fully constructed it (i.e., at the end of the current code for spor ) is current = forste while current is not None: ...process current.vekt... current = current.neste In your case, the logic for the "process" part is of course, as your Q's text already says: if current.vekt > themax: themax = current.vekt The only subtlety is, you need to initially set themax , before this while loop to "the lowest possible number"; in recent versions of Python, "minus infinity" is reliably recorded and compared (though only as a float, it still compares correctly to ints), so themax = float('-inf') would work. More elegant might be to initially set the maximum to the first payload, avoiding messing with infinity.
