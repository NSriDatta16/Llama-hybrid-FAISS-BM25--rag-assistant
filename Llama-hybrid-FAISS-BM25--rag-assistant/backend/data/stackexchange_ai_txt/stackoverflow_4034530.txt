Reading hexadecimal values in English

I've been reading hexadecimal on a digit by digit basis for many years and am now fed up with translating hex values for numbers requiring more than 16 bits into English. Does a more elegant form of translating hexadecimal to English exist? In English, a simple system exists for converting decimal values to English. Decimal 10 is English "ten", decimal 57 is english "fifty-seven", decimal 32767 is "thirty-two thousand seven hundred sixty-seven", etc. As far as I know, there exists no system for elegantly representing hexadecimal in English. Hexadecimal 10 is English "one zero" or "one oh", hexadecimal F0ED is "eff oh eee dee", hexadecimal 30F538B9310 is English "three oh eff five three eight bee nine three one oh". Values requiring more bits become increasingly painful to translate. Sometimes converting it to the decimal equivalent to get an elegant English translation, so hexadecimal 10 becomes "sixteen". Thanks for any help.
