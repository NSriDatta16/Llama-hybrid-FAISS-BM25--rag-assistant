Troubleshoot Windows freezes and slowdowns

I'm a (happy?) user of Windows, but recently have problems that I don't know how to track. I have a WinXP plus home and work Win2k3 systems. Some of them are freezing itermittently for a short amount of time (from less than a second to a few seconds). There is no CPU usage spike and not much HDD activity. Neither Process Explorer nor Windows Task Manager show any suspicious processes. The services also look ok. On one of computers, dragging and droping (within Explorer windows or windows and apps) freezes the machine for 10-20 sec. After this period I can continue to use drag & drop for some (long) time with no delays. Don't think it is virus – it would probably infect all machines easily. How can I know what is going on with my systems? Update: Thank you for your suggestions. I solved the problem on one of the machines – it was a nasty rootkit . I needed to use 3rd party tools to detect and remove it. How can I diagnose it without this tool?
