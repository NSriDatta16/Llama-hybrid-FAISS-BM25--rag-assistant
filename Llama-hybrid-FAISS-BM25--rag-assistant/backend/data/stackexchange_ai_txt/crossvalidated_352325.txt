General case of non-trival recursive probablility estimation

Consider a domain registrar that can send email to clients if they have a domain expiring in the next 60 days. Clients that have a single domain should see 305 days of no mail in their inbox: 365 - 60 = 305 On average, how many no-mail days would a user with N domains enjoy? The case for 2 domains is rather involved though I think that I got it: Case 1: No-mail periods do not overlap: 365 - 60 - 60 = 245 Case 2: No-mail periods overlap: 245 + (average period between dates) = 245 + (60/2) = 275 Total: (365-60)/365 ( 245 ) + 60/365 * ( 275 ) ~ 249 To generalize this any further, I would reach for Python and do something recursive and ugly. How would a statician write this? How would a statician solve it for N=6 ? This is not homework, rather something that I challenged myself with after looking in my inbox this morning.
