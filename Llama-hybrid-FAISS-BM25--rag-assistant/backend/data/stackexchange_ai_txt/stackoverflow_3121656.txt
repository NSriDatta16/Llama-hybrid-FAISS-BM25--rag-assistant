Those are not "C++ features", they are non-standard "extensions", non-standard functions, and " compiler features" provided by compiler developer. short and incomplete list of microsoft-specific features that will cause trouble during porting: pragma once. (and pretty much every pragma) Will be ignored by another compiler, which will result in multiple header inclusions. Can cause trouble. __int32 and similar types (microsoft specific) Everything that comes from windows.h - DWORD/WORD/HANDLE/TCHAR. Also os-specific API and system calls. This includes WinMain(). every builtin type, macros and keyword that starts with two underscores (____FUNCTION____, __int32, __declspec, etc). Certain versionf of *printf functions - swprintf, vswprintf, etc. Some format (%S) specifications behave differently on different compilers. *_s functions (strcpy_s, etc).
