logistic regression, comparing coifficients between (very similar) models

I have a dependent variable $Y$ (binary) and independent variables $X1$ and $X2$ (both binary). Variables $X1$ and $X2$ are both inherently correlated by the design of the experiment because $X2$ has been calculated from $X1$ ($X2$ is just a tweaked version of $X1$). I am interested in testing whether $X2$ has a greater effect on the probability of our outcome being true compared in $X1$ my first thought was to set up a logistic regression as follows and compare the size of the $β1$ and $β2$ coifficients: $logit(Y)= β0+ β1X1+ β2X2$ however, this is not desirable (or even compuateable in R's glm()) due to the collinearity of $X1$ and $X2$. Instead I have calculated individually: $Model1 = logit(Y)= β0+ β1X1$ $Model2 = logit(Y)= β0+ β1X2$ We observe that $exp(β1)$ in model2 is greater than $exp(β1)$ in model1. But what would be a reasonable approach to test for the significance of these differences in coefficients between Model1 and Model2? Is it even reasonable to do so? Thanks!
