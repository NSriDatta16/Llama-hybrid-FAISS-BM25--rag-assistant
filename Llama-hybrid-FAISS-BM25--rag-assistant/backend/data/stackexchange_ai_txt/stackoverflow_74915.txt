Such projects are often done in c++/cli because C# isn't really an elegant option for the task. e.g. if you have to interface with some native C++ libraries, or do very high performance stuff in low level C. So just make sure whoever chose c++/cli didn't have a good reason to do it before doing the switch. Having said that, I'm highly skeptical there's something that does what you ask, for the simple reason that not all C++/cli code is translatable to C# (and probably vice versa too).
