That is a very unusual way of normalizing a probability density function. I assume you want to normalize such that the area under the curve is 1. In that case, this is what you should do. [c,x]=hist(average,15); normalized=c/trapz(x,c); bar(x,normalized) Either way, to answer your question, you can use randn to generate a normal distribution. You're now generating a 50x50 uniform distribution matrix and summing along one dimension to approximate a normal Gaussian. This is unnecessary. To generate a normal distribution of 1000 points, use randn(1000,1) or if you want a row vector, transpose it or flip the numbers. To generate a Gaussian distribution of mean mu and variance sigma2 , and plot its pdf, you can do (an example) mu=2; sigma2=3; dist=sqrt(sigma2)*randn(1000,1)+mu; [c,x]=hist(dist,50); bar(x,c/trapz(x,c)) Although these can be done with dedicated functions from the statistics toolbox, this is equally straightforward, simple and requires no additional toolboxes. EDIT I missed the part where you wanted to know how to generate a uniform distribution. rand , by default gives you a random variable from a uniform distribution on [0,1] . To get a r.v. from a uniform distribution between [a, b] , use a+(b-a)*rand
