Don't!! If iDesign Steve learns to design directly in the browser, Innovation will suffer: Steve doesn't care the limitations of CSS/HTML/whatnot. He is free to dish out the most impressive site humanity has yet to see. It's average programmer Joe's duty to stretch the limits of CSS/HTML/whatnot to cram that approved deisgn in time, and see it torn to bits by some stupid browser, which happens to have a good size of market share, just before the deadline. Face it, writing CSS feels like writing assembly code. Accomplishing even the most basic things (fluid multi column layout anyone?) is ridiculously hard and it makes you high for a while. Steve's coolness factor will diminish: Not a single developer that I know uses a WYSIWYG tool to generate HTML/CSS or considers this acceptable. When all you need is a text editor, you don't look as cool. When a customer throws a look at Steve's monitor, and sees a bunch of text instead of several windows, a hundred little funny icons, and a half finished colorful draft, he may as well think "My 7 year old grandson can type stuff too...". Joe has still more constraints than Steve has: Site should be accessible, layout should be fluid enough to accommodate all kinds of output, play nice with javascript... If CSS/HTML will be rewritten anyway, there is no point struggling. Be a good teammate and fire up Photoshop now. Joe needs his job to pay his bills.
