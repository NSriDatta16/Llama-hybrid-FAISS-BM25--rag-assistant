When it comes to dealing with "forbidden" characters I'd rather be overcautious and ban/replace all "special" characters that may cause a problem on any filesystem. Even if technically allowed, sometimes those characters can cause weirdness. For example, we had an issue where the PDF files were being written (successfully) to a SAN, but when served up via a web server from that location some of the characters would cause issues when we were embedding the PDF in an HTML page that was being rendered in Firefox. It was fine if the PDF was accessed directly and it was fine in other browser. Some weird error with how Firefox and Adobe Reader interact. Summary: "Special" characters in file names -> weird errors waiting to happen Ultimately, the only way to be sure is to use a white-list.
