I think it depends on what you are using as a classifier. It would be straight forward to incorporate these directly in a Bayesian model (and there is a rich literature on incorporating expert opinion as informative priors), but if you're using something more black-boxy (e.g. random forest) it will be less straight forward. This post ( http://andrewgelman.com/2017/09/20/using-black-box-machine-learning-predictions-inputs-bayesian-analysis/ ) from Andrew Gelman comes to mind as a possible starting point.
