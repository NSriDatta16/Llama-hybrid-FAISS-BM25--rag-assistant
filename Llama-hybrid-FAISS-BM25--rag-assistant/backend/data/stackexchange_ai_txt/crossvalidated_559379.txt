Trying to understand how to conduct a power analysis of logistic regressions

I am have conducted some logistic regressions in R comparing an estimate of ancestry with some other variables. My advisor has asked me to do power analyses on these. I do not have the greatest background in statistics, and I need some help. Each regression is fairly simple, it is just a logistic regression testing association with one variable in a subset of my data. I have come across some calculators such as this https://rdrr.io/cran/WebPower/man/wp.logistic.html or https://webpower.psychstat.org/models/reg02/ and this https://www.dartmouth.edu/~eugened/power-samplesize.php but I am very lost. How exactly do I calculate p0 and p1 or a minimum detectable odds ratio? My ancestry values make up my x-axis (and range from 0 to 1), but none of my ancestry data points are 0 or 1. Are p0 and p1 based on the regression equation calculated by R, or my actual data? I cannot seem to find a good tutorial for how to conduct these power analyses, so I am coming here for help. CLARIFICATION My x-axis variable is a float measure of ancestry ranging from 0 and 1. I am testing whether various binary variables (absence or presence of traits, 0 or 1) are associated with ancestry. Our sample sizes are small, so we want to do a power analysis to determine how likely we could actually detect a true positive.
