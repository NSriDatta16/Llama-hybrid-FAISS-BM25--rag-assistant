This is not really a solution, but just a thought on the issue. I consider this type of question very domain-dependent. If you were doing the clustering by hand, how would you decide when to stop? When there are ten clusters? When the clusters have an average size of 72? When the distances you are crossing to make a cluster get up to 17? What I'm saying is there's no right or wrong answer here other than picking a stopping condition that makes sense given your data. I could give a suggestion as to how to accomplish a certain stop condition, but you need to specify what you want your stop condition to be based on.
