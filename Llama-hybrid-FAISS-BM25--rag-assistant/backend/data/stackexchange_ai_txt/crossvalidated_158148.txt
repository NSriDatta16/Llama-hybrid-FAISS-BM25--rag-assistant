Yes, repeated measures ANOVA seems like the best analysis for the data. Each subject is given multiple treatments sequentially. Your screen shot is too small to read, but the repeated measures approach helps when some subjects (in this example) take longer for all tasks and others take less time for all tasks, so you want to look at the difference from task to task in each subject, rather than just compare the average time for each task. ANOVA is based on Gaussian distributions. Is time-to-complete-task likely to be close to Gaussian? OR perhaps speed, which is proportional to the reciprocal of time is closer to Gaussian?
