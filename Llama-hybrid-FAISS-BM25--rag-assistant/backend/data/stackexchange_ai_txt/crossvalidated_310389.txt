Yes, you can. It's not hard to implement. if you decide to use caret , look up train_model_list in caret ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/caret.pdf ) P164 - A List of Available Models in train, this section describes methods you can use such as Distance Weighted Discrimination with Polynomial Kernel (method = 'dwdPoly') and Distance Weighted Discrimination with Radial Basis Function Kernel (method = 'dwdRadial'). I also came across msvm-rfe package, http://www.colbyimaging.com/wiki/statistics/msvm-rfe , the example showed using RBF kernel doing RFE.
