There are very few tools that can parse and transform C and C++ code. As a first step, parsing of these languages is considered hard all by itself. Another key problem is the preprocessor, which is used pretty abusively (e.g., not in a structured way) in C programs and makes it difficult for a parser to see the program structure, and consequently difficult for an analyzer (needed to decide when refactorings are legal) to do its analysis correctly. Modulo these glitches, our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit can be configured to carry out refactorings on C and C++ code. DMS has industrial strength parsers for C and C++ and uniquely can capture most preprocessor uses as part of the internal code structures (typically people trying to parse C/C++ expand the preprocessor directives away, and that isn't an option for refactoring). We've used it to carry out massive code reorganizations on C++ code (where preprocessor abuse is minimal because C++ has a variety of other ways to configure code). We also done some automated reengineering of C systems, but with somewhat more effort to handle the abusive preprocessor uses. What it is not is interactive . You have to plan the refactoring transformations and specify them with a pattern matching language. But it is reliable.
