As for me, you're incorrectly configured c3p0. Properties like c3p0.preferredTestQuery must be located at c3p0.properties file from your classpath (e.g. WEB-INF/classes). Below is my example of c3p0.properties file that work nice for Oracle: c3p0.preferredTestQuery=SELECT 1 from dual c3p0.maxConnectionAge=3600 c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckout=true c3p0.acquireRetryDelay=1000 c3p0.acquireRetryAttempts=30 c3p0.breakAfterAcquireFailure=false See also official doc for c3p0 here . And please pay your attention to version of c3p0 that you're using. They had an issue connection restoring in early releases of c3p0 0.9.
