Installing CXF with Eclipse 3.5

As per http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.jst.ws.cxf.doc.user/reference/preferences.html The CXF 2.x preferences can be accessed via Window > Preferences... > Web Services > CXF 2.x Preferences from the top level menu. but I dont see the option CXF 2.x Preferences under Web Services, though I have chosen JavaEE perspective. any ideas how to enable this? Sorry for such a simple question. I also cannot do not see CXF as a Project Facet as per http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxws.doc.user/gettingstarted/requirements.html I know this is something to do with getting Eclipse aware of CXF libraries, but cant find the tutorial for this.
