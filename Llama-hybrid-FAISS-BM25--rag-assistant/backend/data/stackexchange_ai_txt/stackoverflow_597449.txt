My experience with commercial ESB is it's an overblown and expensive technology that creates as many problems as it solves. The ESB will link new systems and legacy, messages will fly over the bus and everything will be able to talk to everything else seamlessly. Throw in some resilience, orchestration and you have a very powerful piece of enterprise application software. The problem comes when you try to use them for real, the overhead of writing for the bus, creating the message structures and so on, can outweight the benefits. As a high cost item, the ESB is seen as the panacea for all tech issues which it isn't, too much time is spent on the bus and not on the applications/data being connected. It's often the case that multiple competing standards will fight for supremacy in the same organisation leading to the classic tech dominated silos that these systems should actually be fixing. IMHO it is far better to use create a small number of specific interfaces, typically using web services between only those system that need it.
