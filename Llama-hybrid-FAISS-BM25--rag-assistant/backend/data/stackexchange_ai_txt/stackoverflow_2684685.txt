Project structure in TFS 2010

We have just gotten TFS 2010 up and running. We will be migrating our source into TFS but I have a question on how to organize the code. TFS 2010 has a new concept of project collections so I have decided that different groups within our organization will get their own group. My team develops many different web applications and we have several shared components. We also use a few third party components (such as telerik). Clearly each web application is it's own project but where do I put the shared components? Should each component be in it's own project with separate builds and work items? Is there a best practice or recommended way to do this specific to TFS 2010?
