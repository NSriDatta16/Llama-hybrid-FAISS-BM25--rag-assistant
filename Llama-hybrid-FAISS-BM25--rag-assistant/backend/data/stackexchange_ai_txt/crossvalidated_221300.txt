Is there a database for non time series data sets?

I am searching for some data sets that would be suitable for regression analysis that my teacher wants for Statistical Learning lesson's homework. But as I search I only encounter with time series data. Q: Does anybody familiar with such websites that I can download Non-time series data with enough dimensions to do regression analysis? Any help with be appreciated.
