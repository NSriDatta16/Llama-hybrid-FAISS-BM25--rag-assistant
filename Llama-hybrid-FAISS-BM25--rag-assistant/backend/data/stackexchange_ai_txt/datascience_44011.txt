Machine learning PhD Interview technical questions

I'm Software Engineer who applied to grad school for Machine Learning/Computer Vision PhD and currently waiting for interview calls. I'm brushing up Linear algebra/ ML topics. What kind of technical questions do professors generally ask in Ph.D interviews ? Thanks in advance.
