This is an old thread, but I had a similar problem and found a solution that is not listed here. I was receiving the page fine in the browser, but got a 404 when I tried to access it via the HttpURLConnection. The URL I was trying to access contained a port number. When I tried it without the port number I successfully got a dummy page through the HttpURLConnection. So it seemed the non-standard port was the problem. I started thinking the access was restricted, and in a sense it was. My solution was that I needed to tell the server the User-Agent and I also specify the file types I expect. I am trying to read a .json file, so I thought the file type might be a necessary specification as well. I added these lines and it finally worked: httpConnection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent","Mozilla/5.0 ( compatible ) "); httpConnection.setRequestProperty("Accept","*/*");
