Have you tried Zend_Registry from Zend Framework? The registry is a container for storing objects and values in the application space. By storing the value in the registry, the same object is always available throughout your application. This mechanism is an alternative to using global storage. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.registry.html
