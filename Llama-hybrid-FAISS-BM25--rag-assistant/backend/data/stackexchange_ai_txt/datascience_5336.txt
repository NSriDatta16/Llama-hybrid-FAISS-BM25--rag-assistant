Time series change rate calculations for displaying trend line chart

I'm struggling to find a solution to produce a line chart which shows a trend from a Time Series metric. I try to make my line chart look similar to the following: Basically, I want to make use of relative change rates, but I struggle to find a calculation which makes a visualization as seen above possible. The graph should always be relative to a specific time window, meaning that I can query my data dynamically with a start and end timestamp. My (incomplete) sample data set is the following: timestamp,value,change_rate,change_rate_absolute_sum,change_rate_delta,change_rate_sum 1426587900000,778;0.00129,0.00129;0.00129,0.00129 1426588200000,778;0,0.00129;-0.00129,0 1426588500000,1189;0.52828,0.52957;0.52828,0.52828 1426588800000,1195;0.00505,0.53462;-0.52323,0.00505 1426589100000,1195;0,0.53462;-0.00505,0 1426589400000,1196;0.00084,0.53546;0.00084,0.00084 1426589700000,1286;0.07525,0.61071;0.07441,0.07525 1426590000000,1290;0.00311,0.61382;-0.07214,0.00311 1426590300000,1294;0.0031,0.61692;-0.00001,0.0031 1426590600000,1296;0.00155,0.61847;-0.00155,0.00155 1426590900000,1356;0.0463,0.66477;0.04475,0.0463 1426591200000,1358;0.00147,0.66624;-0.04483,0.00147 1426591500000,1358;0,0.66624;-0.00147,0 1426591800000,1360;0.00147,0.66771;0.00147,0.00147 1426592100000,1408;0.03529,0.703;0.03382,0.03529 1426592400000,1390;-0.01278,0.69022;-0.04807,-0.01278 1426592700000,1391;0.00072,0.69094;0.0135,0.00072 1426593000000,1410;0.01366,0.7046;0.01294,0.01366 1426593300000,1414;0.00284,0.70744;-0.01082,0.00284 1426593600000,1410;-0.00283,0.70461;-0.00567,-0.00283 1426593900000,1414;0.00284,0.70745;0.00567,0.00284 1426594200000,1420;0.00424,0.71169;0.0014,0.00424 1426594500000,1417;-0.00211,0.70958;-0.00635,-0.00211 Any ideas warmly appreciated.
