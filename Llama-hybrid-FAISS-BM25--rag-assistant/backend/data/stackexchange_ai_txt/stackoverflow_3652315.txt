It is working, you just have a typo: var $standardPic = $actice.attr('src'); ^ should be var $standardPic = $active.attr('src'); Notes: Your code can be rewritten in a much more elegant way, you can use another logic instead of the switch statement, especially with the help of jquery selectors. Use firebug , it helps with javascript debugging and web development in general, and it has a console that shows errors.
