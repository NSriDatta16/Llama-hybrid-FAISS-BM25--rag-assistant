Can I calculate the average of these numbers?

I was wondering if it's possible to calculate the average of some numbers if I have this: int currentCount = 12; float currentScore = 6.1123 (this is a range of 1 10). Now, if I receive another score (let's say 4.5), can I recalculate the average so it would be something like: int currentCount now equals 13 float currentScore now equals ????? or is this impossible and I still need to remember the list of scores?
