Setting NSScrollView Contents to Top Left Instead of Bottom Left When Document Swapping

I had one of my colleagues come to me today with a problem of how can he load or view-swap a documentView of an NSScrollView so that the loaded view appears to fix to the top-left corner instead of the bottom-let corner. He had spent a while searching the web and floundering and didn't have a solution despite reading the documentation at Apple, on StackOverflow and various other places. Here's the issue piece-by-piece: In Interface Builder drag an NSScrollView into the project. Also in Interface Builder drag two custom views into the project and add some textfields, buttons etc. Create a controller class (e.g. myController) with the following IBOutlet s: IBOutlet NSScrollView * myScrollView IBOutlet NSView * myCustomView1 IBOutlet NSView * myCustomView2 Connect the outlets to the controls in Interface Builder. Create an NSView subclass to flip the documentView : @implementation myFlippedView -(id)initWithFrame:(NSRect)frame { self = [super initWithFrame:frame]; if (self) { // Initialization code here. } return self; } -(void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect { // Drawing code here. } -(BOOL)isFlipped { return YES; } Select the documentView of the NSScrollView in Interface Builder and make it a subclass of myFlippedView . In Interface Builder you would select the NSScrollView and then click in it again to get to the documentView , or change the IB Library to show a tree view and select the child custom view of the NSScrollView . In the myController class swap the views with the following methods: -(void)awakeFromNib { [myScrollView setDocumentView:myCustomView1]; } -(IBAction)swapViews:(id)sender { if ([myScrollView documentView] == myCustomView1) { [myScrollView setDocumentView:myCustomView2]; } else { [myScrollView setDocumentView:myCustomView1]; } } Finally hook up a button in your project to the action swapViews , build and run. The problem is that the coordinates were not being resolved as was expected with the isFlipped.
