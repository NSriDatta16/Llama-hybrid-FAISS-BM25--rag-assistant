How can I combine objects in the Raphael javascript library?

Sorry for a long question but here goes. I am trying to modify the drag shapes around demo here: http://raphaeljs.com/graffle.html The demo works fine. What I want to do is put words inside the shapes and move the shape and text around as a composite single object. Here is the code for creating the objects: window.onload = function () { var dragger = function () { this.ox = this.type == "rect" ? this.attr("x") : this.attr("cx"); this.oy = this.type == "rect" ? this.attr("y") : this.attr("cy"); this.animate({"fill-opacity": .2}, 500); }, move = function (dx, dy) { var att = this.type == "rect" ? {x: this.ox + dx, y: this.oy + dy} : {cx: this.ox + dx, cy: this.oy + dy}; this.attr(att); for (var i = connections.length; i--;) { r.connection(connections[i]); } r.safari(); }, up = function () { this.animate({"fill-opacity": 0}, 500); }, r = Raphael("holder", 640, 480), connections = [], shapes = [ r.ellipse(190, 100, 30, 20), r.rect(290, 80, 60, 40, 10), r.rect(290, 180, 60, 40, 2), r.ellipse(450, 100, 20, 20) ]; for (var i = 0, ii = shapes.length; i I tried something like this: myWords = [ r.text(190, 100, "Hello"), r.text(480,100, "Good Bye") ]; and made adjustments elsewhere so that it would work, but then it just moves text and shapes but the shape and text are never seen as a whole. I can move the text separate from the shape and vice versa. I need them to be one object. so they move together. How can I do that? Thank you for any help. EDIT: I tried this: st.push(r.text (190, 100, "node1"), r.ellipse(190, 100, 30, 20)), st.push(r.text (290, 80, "Center"), r.rect(290, 80, 60, 40, 10)), st.push(r.text (290, 180, "node2"), r.rect(290, 180, 60, 40, 2)), st.push(r.text (450, 100, "node3"), r.ellipse(450, 100, 20, 20)) But the text and shape did not stay together when I moved the shape. The text just stayed still. EDIT: I cannot get the stock demo at http://raphaeljs.com/graffle.html to work with Chrome. IE it works.
