Why is my query not returning what I expect?

The code below is what I am trying to use in order to get the count of one column and the averages of two other columns from multiple tables and then put the results into another table. I thought this would work, but the count that is being put into the new table is incorrect as are the averages. A lot of times the averages are outside the range of the numbers that are being averaged. The numbers that are being averaged are all negative and most of them contain decimals. The data type for the columns is set to Number and the field size for the numbers being averaged (the source and the destination) is set to Double . Code: For i = 1000 To 1783 strQuery1 = "Insert Into MIUsInGridAvgs (NumberofMIUs, ProjRSSI, RealRSSI) " & _ "Select Count(MIUID), Avg(ProjRSSI), Avg(RealRSSI) " & _ "From MIUsInGrid" & i & " " DoCmd.SetWarnings False DoCmd.RunSQL strQuery1 DoCmd.SetWarnings True Next The table names I am querying from all end with numbers between 1000 and 1783 inclusive. Example Data: MIUsInGrid1000 MIUID Latitude Longitude ProjRSSI RealRSSI 110108098 32.593021 -85.367073 -97.4625 -108 MIUsInGrid1001 MIUID Latitude Longitude ProjRSSI RealRSSI 110112556 32.592461 -85.337067 -101 -95 110106208 32.592766 -85.337059 -101 -100 110115010 32.59288 -85.337189 -101 -98 MIUsInGrid1002 MIUID Latitude Longitude ProjRSSI RealRSSI 110172260 32.593349 -85.366318 -104.408333333333 -99 110106870 32.593464 -85.365822 -104.408333333333 -106 Results: NumberofMIUs ProjRSSI RealRSSI 1 -97.4625 -108 'MIUsInGrid1000 1 -100.883333333333 -109 'MIUsInGrid1001 1 -109.521428571429 -99 'MIUsInGrid1002 What am I doing wrong?
