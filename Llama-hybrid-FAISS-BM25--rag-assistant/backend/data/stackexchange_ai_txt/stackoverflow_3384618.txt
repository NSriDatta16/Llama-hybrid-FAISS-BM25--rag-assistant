Reflection itself cannot alter code. Java Agents should allow you to rewrite the class as it is loaded. You can use reflection to alter serialPersistentFields if it exists (unlikely), before the serialisation mechanism caches the class data. You could use reflection in a highly version specific way to alter the data inside the serialisation mechanism.
