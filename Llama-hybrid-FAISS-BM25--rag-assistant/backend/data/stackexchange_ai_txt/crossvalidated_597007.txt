Zero-inflated logistic regressions do exist. The most "famous" example is that of a species occupancy model where the probability of presence of a species follows a logistic model dependent on various predictors AND the probability of detection on a single visit is less than 1. If only a single visit is observed, then as @MartinModrak has mentioned only the product of the occupancy probability and the detection probability can be estimated. However, if multiple independent observations are taken on the same site under the same conditions (with the true but unknown presence status constant), then the two probabilities can be separated. The R package unmarked deals with such models (logistic regressions for both the probability of occupancy and the probability of detection). A reference for this is MacKenzie, D. I., J. D. Nichols, G. B. Lachman, S. Droege, J. Andrew Royle, and C. A. Langtimm. 2002. Estimating Site Occupancy Rates When Detection Probabilities Are Less Than One. Ecology 83: 2248-2255. For your problem with a rare disease such models might be appropriate if the test for having the rare disease does not always detect the disease when the patient does have the disease. You would need to have patients tested multiple times (with an appropriate model describing the probability of detection). These methods are certainly data hungry and having a "rare" disease (i.e., a small probability of having the disease) raises the need for lots of patients. But my main point is that there are models that deal with excess zeros in a logistic regression but a secondary model (and subject matter rationale) that describes the generation of excess zeros is required.
