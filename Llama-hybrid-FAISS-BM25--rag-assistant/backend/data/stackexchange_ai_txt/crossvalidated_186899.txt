Airlines wait times, in the US, are about 30 - 45 minutes in major hubs. However, time to time major delays or increased travelers can create extremely large outliers, skewing the average wait time up. If you're interested to know more, day-to-day average wait time and tallies on wait time brackets in the US can be downloaded here . Nothing beats checking the facts ourselves. It does not include, as far as I know, the security check time, but I believe they are likely quite correlated.
