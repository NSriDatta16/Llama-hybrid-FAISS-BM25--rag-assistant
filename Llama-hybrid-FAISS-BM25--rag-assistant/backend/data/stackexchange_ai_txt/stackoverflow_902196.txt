You need to use a postbuild command in the application project to create the lib directory and copy the library file into it. If you decide to do this (which I wouldn't recommend unless you have lots of dlls and feel an overwhelming urge to organise them) you also need to add a probing path element to your app.config file that will tell it where to look for the libraries. See here .
