Some of the more language-independent skills that I'm currently learning/working towards to improve my coding as a whole. Writing clean, readable and maintainable code Refactoring Proper object design for OOP languages Using a proper source control system correctly. Sourcesafe doesn't count :D Unit-testing & test-driven development Applying design patterns correctly. Learning them is one thing, learning when and where to apply them is much trickier. Some links to book recommnendation questions @ SO: What are the best design patterns books you have read? Help me pick a book on design patterns, refactoring, and/or testing Books that will cover TDD, DDD and Design Patterns in .NET Best books about TDD Best design patterns book for a beginer? C# Design Patterns Book Good C# Unit testing book And of course, the Pragmatic Programmer books as mentioned in the earlier comment.
