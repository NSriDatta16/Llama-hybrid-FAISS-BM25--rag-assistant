Regression: calculate mean weight, when you know R =0.5, mean lenght, mean weight and both SD

For a small quiz I am unsure about this question. Please help me out :) : We perform a regression for the relationship between heigh and weight. What is given: R = 0.5, mean height is 176 centimeters, and SD is 7 centimeters. The mean weight is 74 kilograms with a SD of 5 kilograms. The question: What is the average height of a person who weighs 86kg?
