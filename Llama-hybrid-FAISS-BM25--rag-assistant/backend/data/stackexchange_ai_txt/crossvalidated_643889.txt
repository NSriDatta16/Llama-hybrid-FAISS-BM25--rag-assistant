How to determine one-class SVM's $r$ parameter after obtaining $\alpha$ from QP programming solver?

I'm reading about one-class SVM in wiki here: One-class SVM . One-class SVM attempts to learn $r$ and $c$ to fit a hypersphere to the dataset. The formula for assigning labels is: $$sign(r^2 - ||\phi(x) - c||_{2}^2)$$ , where $\phi$ is transform training set $x$ to higher-dimensional space But I am not really sure about how one could obtain the $r$ parameter from $\alpha$ . This is the optimization problem to solve for $\alpha$ : $$max(\sum_{n=1}^{n} \alpha_{i}k(x_i, x_i) - \sum_{n=1}^{n} \alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}k(x_i, x_j))$$ , subject to: $$\sum_{n=1}^{n}\alpha_{i} = 1, 0\leq\alpha_{i} \leq \frac{1}{vn}$$ And $c$ is obtained from: $$c = \sum_{n=1}^{n}\alpha_i\phi(x_i)$$ .How about $r$ ? How are we supposed to calculate?
