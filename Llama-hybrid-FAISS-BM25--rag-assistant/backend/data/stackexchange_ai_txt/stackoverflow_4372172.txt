I was going to create a Page for PagesController, but I don't know how to access models in PagesController. With the built-in PagesController, you can't. You'll have to create your own PagesController, which would look something like this pastebin . Another way to create such a portal page would be to create a Page for display via the built-in PagesController, the view for which would comprise a variety of view elements, each using requestAction to retrieve their respective data. This can be a tricky approach if you don't or can't employ caching, because requestAction is not very performant, as it begins a new dispatch cycle every time it's called. However, in conjunction with good, aggressive caching, this is a very modular approach, and very Cake-y, since it encapsulates each element of your dashboard's functionality in its own MVC element. Edit : just to be extra-clear, if you cannot cache the dashboard's elements well, you want to avoid the requestAction route. It's just horrifically slow, and it's better to use an approach such as that in balcer's link, though it is perhaps not as elegant.
