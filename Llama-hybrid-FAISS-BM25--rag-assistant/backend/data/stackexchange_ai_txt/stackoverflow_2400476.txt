Grails multiple databases

how can we write queries on 2 databases . I installed datasources plugin and domain classes are : class Organization { long id long company_id String name static mapping = { version false table 'organization_' id column : 'organizationId' company_id column : 'companyId' name column : 'name' } } class Assoc { Integer id Integer association_id Integer organization_id static mapping = { version false table 'assoc' id column : 'ASSOC_ID' association_id column : 'ASSOCIATION_ID' organization_id column : 'ORGANIZATION_ID' } } this is working : def org = Organization.list() def assoc = Assoc.list() and this is not working : def query = Organization.executeQuery("SELECT o.name as name, o.id FROM Organization o WHERE o.id IN (SELECT a.organization_id FROM Assoc a )") error : org.hibernate.hql.ast.QuerySyntaxException: Assoc is not mapped [SELECT o.name as name, o.id FROM org.com.domain.Organization o WHERE o.id IN (SELECT a.organization_id FROM AssocOrg a )] How can we connect with 2 databases using single query ? thanks in advance .
