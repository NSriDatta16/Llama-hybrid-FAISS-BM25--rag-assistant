Analyzing standardized / fractional count data

In my experiment I want to figure out how the size of different planting containers, i.e. their volume, affects the number of regenerated plant shoots from root fragments (terminology here is root suckering). So in other words, how many shoots are regenerated from the initial root material given the container they grow in. After some time, I counted the number of shoots per planting container and scaled the count up to 100 ml to make it easier to compare across container types. I have the following example dataset: df The data looks as follows: #require(ggplot2) #ggplot(df, aes(x = Container, y = StandCount)) + geom_boxplot() Now I fitted two models ( m1 and m2 ). The first one is a generalized least squares model using the gls() function including the varIdent() function to account for the observed heteroskedasticity. The second one is a generalized linear model using the Gamma distribution since Poisson requires integer data. require(nlme) m1 Here are the estimated marginal means and standard errors. As it can be seen those SEs differ slightly resulting in different significant differences in the Tukey adjusted multiple mean comparison (cf. A-D for example): require(emmeans) emmeans(m1, pairwise~ Container) $emmeans Container emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL A 2.36 0.2488832 28 1.850186 2.869814 B 6.36 0.8055525 28 4.709901 8.010099 C 18.25 2.8014653 28 12.511459 23.988541 D 4.65 0.9053412 28 2.795493 6.504507 Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value A - B -4.00 0.8431238 28 -4.744 0.0003 A - C -15.89 2.8124990 28 -5.650 emmeans(m2, pairwise~ Container, type="response") $emmeans Container response SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL A 2.36 0.3513056 NA 1.826969 3.332189 B 6.36 0.9467387 NA 4.923527 8.979967 C 18.25 2.7166633 NA 14.128046 25.767986 D 4.65 0.6921885 NA 3.599752 6.565532 Confidence level used: 0.95 Intervals are back-transformed from the inverse scale $contrasts contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value A - B 0.26649611 0.06727806 NA 3.961 0.0004 A - C 0.36893429 0.06360075 NA 5.801 My question now is what is the correct approach to analyze those data? I think the gamma model is most appropriate also given the fact that there won't be any negative values, however there might be zeros though. In this case, which analysis would be most appropriate?
