It is still work in progress, but it's mature enough for language implementors and library developers. Caveat: some subsystems are getting reworked (garbage collection, embedding), so there might be some bumps on the road ahead. Each language needs a compiler that generates code Parrot understands. These compilers are released separately. (see http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages ) Most languages targeting Parrot are in an early incomplete state, so interoperability isn't a big issue right now. Parrot isn't a Perl 6 interpreter, but Rakudo Perl 6 happens to be one of the most heavily developed compiler that targets Parrot.
