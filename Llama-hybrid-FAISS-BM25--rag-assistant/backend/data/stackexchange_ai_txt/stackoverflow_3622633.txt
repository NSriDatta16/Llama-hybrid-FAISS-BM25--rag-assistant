SharePoint Wiki Page - Hide Columns From Appearing on Wiki Page

I created a new SharePoint wiki library and I added additional columns to the wiki library to use as metadata to organize the pages into different views. The issue is now when I create a new wiki page, the added columns appear on the bottom of the page. Anyone know how to hide these columns from appearing on the wiki pages? Thanks
