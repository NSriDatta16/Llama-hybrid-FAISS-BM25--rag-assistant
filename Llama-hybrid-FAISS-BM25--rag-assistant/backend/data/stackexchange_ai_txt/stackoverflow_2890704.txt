mysql first record retrieval

While very easy to do in Perl or PHP, I cannot figure how to use mysql only to extract the first unique occurence of a record. For example, given the following table: Name Date Time Sale John 2010-09-12 10:22:22 500 Bill 2010-08-12 09:22:37 2000 John 2010-09-13 10:22:22 500 Sue 2010-09-01 09:07:21 1000 Bill 2010-07-25 11:23:23 2000 Sue 2010-06-24 13:23:45 1000 I would like to extract the first record for each individual in asc time order. After sorting the table is ascending time order, I need to extract the first unique record by name. So the output would be : Name Date Time Sale John 2010-09-12 10:22:22 500 Bill 2010-07-25 11:23:23 2000 Sue 2010-06-24 13:23:45 1000 Is this doable in an easy fashion with mySQL?
