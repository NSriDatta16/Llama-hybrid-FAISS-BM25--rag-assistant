In PCA, what is the difference between computing the eigenvectors for $X^T X$ and for the covariance matrix?

Why do we calculate eigenvectors based on $X^TX$ and other times based on the covariance matrix? (What's the difference?) I have found resources online some of which computes the (eigenvector,eigenvalue) pairs based on $X^TX$ , others based on the covariancematrix. Example of $X^TX$ : (From my lectures) Example of covariancematrix: https://youtu.be/g-Hb26agBFg?t=1505
