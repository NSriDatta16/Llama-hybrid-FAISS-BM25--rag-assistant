AFAIK, Most RDBMS do not support this, what I usually see is either: A) The DB query API encrypts the data with a key that only the local server knows before it is sent to the remote db and decrypts when it's received. or B) The remote database stores everything encrypted with a key that it knows (probably at run time, given physically by an admin, or it's given the key with the query). A will let you use the database without letting the owners know what's being stored, but you wont be able to do queries on the actual encrypted data other than maybe equality. B only protects against physical server theft (server has to be off though or they can get the key from memory...). What I assume you want is called Private Information Retrieval . It's a fairly young field, I don't think you're going to find a decent implementation at the moment.
