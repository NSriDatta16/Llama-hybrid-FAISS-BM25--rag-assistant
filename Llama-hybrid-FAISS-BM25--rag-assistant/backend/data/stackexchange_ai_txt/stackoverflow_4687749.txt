How should I organize the controller(s) for a model with differing views for the same action(s)?

I have a User model that, in my mind, has two show actions: A 'show' performed on a user's own record (to view their private profile) A 'show' performed other user records (to view their public profile) I've thought of several different ways I could organize and implement this functionality, but I'm curious what the 'Rails Way' is to do it. The URLs should be distinct (domain.com/account vs. domain.com/profile/someuser), which naturally leads me to the desire to have multiple views to represent the different viewpoints of this action. Option one would be to create two controllers with a different show action and view to serve the requests. Option two would be to place both actions in one controller with action names that are essentially duplicates (or forced non-duplicates, such as 'show' vs. 'show_public'). Option three would be to use one controller and one action that processes each request conditionally based on some unique bit of data: the route from which it was called, whether or params[:id] is populated, etc. What's the 'Rails Way' to do this?
