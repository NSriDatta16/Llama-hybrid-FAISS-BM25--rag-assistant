Why are support vector machines good at classifying images?

I'm trying to figure out if I can identify styles of art using support vector machines and I don't quite understand what makes them good. Perhaps I can make the question more accurate. Support vector machines are basically a way of doing classification with a linear model. You find $\vec{\beta}$ and $\alpha$ such that $sgn(\beta \cdot x + \alpha)$ determines what the class is. So I believe that in order to do image classification, you need logic. It does not suffice to find the average color of an image and decide whether it is greater or smaller than a number to decide which number an image represent. You need logic. I believe you need intermediate logic, like comparing one part of the image to another part of an image. Kind of like a multilayered support vector machine, which now looks like a neural net. Is this intuition correct? Sincerely, Still figuring it out.
