Agile development is not a methodology in itself, it's an umbrella term that describes several agile methodologies (that all belong to the Iterative and Incremental Development - IID - family). alt text http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/6374/dd997578teamprojagileum.png At the signing of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 , the following methodologies were represented: eXtreme Programming (XP), Scrum, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Crystal, Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Pragmatic Programming. Each of them share the core values of the Agile Manifesto but implement them with a slightly different approach. In contrast, pair programming is an engineering practice (it is one of the practices of XP which captures many practices as an indivisible set but you can use it outside of XP). And, while I value practices very much, just keep in mind that practices are not an end, they are just a mean as I wrote previously . Agile is not about doing pair programming, stand up meetings, etc. Agile is about maximizing the customer value while minimizing waste to provide the most optimal ROI. Agile is business oriented, practices are just a way to achieve this goal in a given context. Scrum and XP (used together) are the most commonly used nowadays.
