What is a good setting for noCompressionUserAgents in Tomcat?

Googling for "noCompressionUserAgents" ends up with the same boilerplate config that seems to have been copied around and yet is not very useful (and even is here on stackoverflow:) stackoverflow.com/questions/550024/tomcat-compression-does-not-add-a-content-encoding-gzip-in-the-header noCompressionUserAgents="gozilla, traviata" But this doesn't take into account skipping NS4 or IE6 or whatever else. The closest I've found is from a Zimbra config sample, which at least is for skipping IE6 it looks like: http://www.zimbra.com/forums/installation/7654-problems-zimbra-installation-os-x-server-ldap-tomcat.html noCompressionUserAgents=". MSIE 6. " Does anybody have a REAL setting for noCompressionUserAgents?
