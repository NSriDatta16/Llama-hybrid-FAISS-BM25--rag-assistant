The expected value can be thought of as the long-run average . If you roll your die many, many times, and look at the average of the rolls, you will end up close to 3.5. This is not the value that you expect to see most often. This would be the mode of the distribution (in the discrete case - for a continuous distribution, any particular value has the same probability of zero). After all, you will never see a roll of 3.5 with your standard six-sided die.
