Application of ideas from graph theory in machine learning

I work with neural networks (ConvNNs, DeepNNs, RNNs/LSTMs) for image segmentation and recognition and Genetic Algorithms for some optimization problems. Recently I started to learn some deep graph theory ideas (random graphs, chromatic numbers, graph coloring). I'm familiar with combinatorics at undergrad level. Are there any existing interesting applications and areas of research of graph theory and combinatorics in ML?
