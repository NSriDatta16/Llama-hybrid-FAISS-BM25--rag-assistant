Two transactions seem to block each other but none of them is waiting

I have two transactions running in a mysql database, neither of which seems to make any progress. Both hold some locks but as far as I understand they don't conflict. Both transactions are in state "ACTIVE" (I would have expected that one of them be in a waiting state if it were blocked by the other). I've attached the "TRANSACTIONS" and "ROW OPERATIONS" part of the innodb status output (including lock monitor info) below. Can anyone give me a hint as to why these transactions are influencing each other? I don't have an easy way to reproduce this because the queries are issued by an EJB application, so I'm now trying to generally understand what this kind of problem typically arises from. ===================================== 100823 16:04:53 INNODB MONITOR OUTPUT ===================================== Per second averages calculated from the last 1 seconds ---------- SEMAPHORES ---------- OS WAIT ARRAY INFO: reservation count 25808, signal count 25608 Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 108338, OS waits 1400 RW-shared spins 18372, OS waits 17512; RW-excl spins 7055, OS waits 6782 ------------ TRANSACTIONS ------------ Trx id counter 0 39456296 Purge done for trx's n:o = 0 39456205, sees = 0 39454739, sees
