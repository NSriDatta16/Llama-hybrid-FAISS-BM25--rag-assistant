You can put the tests in the same package as the original classes, even if the source code is under its own directory root: PROJECT_ROOT +--- src/ +----test/ You can declare a class com.foo.MyClass under src and its test com.foo.MyClassTest under test . As for access to private members, you can use reflection to invoke the methods (altering their accessibility via Class.getDeclaredMethod.setAccessible ), or you could use something like testng/junit5 to put some annotation-driven tests on the source code itself (I personally think this is a bad idea). Why not check out some projects on java.net to see how they've organized things, for example swinglabs (the SVN repository is pretty slow I'm afraid)?
