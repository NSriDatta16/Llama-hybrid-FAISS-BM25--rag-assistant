I believe the answer is in the preceding paragraph: The SMP VM with only one scheduler is slightly slower (10%) than the non SMP VM. This is because the SMP VM need to use locks for all shared datastructures. But as long as there are no lock-conflicts the overhead caused by locking is not that high (it is the lock conflicts that takes time). Scheduler's reliance on locks for shared data structures can impose an overhead on a given system. It seems to follow that having multiple schedulers on one SMP VM imposes a collectively greater overhead.
