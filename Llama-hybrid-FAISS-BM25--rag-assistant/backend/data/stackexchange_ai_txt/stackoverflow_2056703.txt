Enabling design surface on Winforms custom UserControl

I tried to create a custom user control in C# that handles other controls that are added to it. The custom control consists of two panels. What I'm trying to achieve is, that if another control is dragged to my user control in design mode (or added programmatically at runtime) I want that control to be placed on one of the panels. I tried to handle the OnControlAdded event but that didn't do the trick...
