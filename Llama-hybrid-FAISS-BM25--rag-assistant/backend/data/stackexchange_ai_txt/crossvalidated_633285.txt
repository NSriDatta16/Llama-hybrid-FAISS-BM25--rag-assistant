As pointed out by @Robert Long and @mdewey a comparison in means would not be valid for a poisson distributed proportion. Hence I moved to the twosamplefreq method which is the calculation for a chi-square test. @whuber: Since I did not receive any expected outcome for the treatment group I simulated five scenarios. proc power; twosamplefreq groupproportions = 0.05 | 0.01 to 0.03 by 0.005 sides=L alpha=0.025 power=. NTotal=50 to 1000; run;
