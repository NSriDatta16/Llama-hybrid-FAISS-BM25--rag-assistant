While I absolutely LOVE jQuery, I'm not a huge fan of 'plugins' in general (some of them are awesome though). Mostly because they are often "one solution fits all" types of things that adds a lot of filesize to the overall download and complexity to the code I write. Case in point, I recently looked at some of the Drag-and-drop libraries for jQuery and found that they were all nicely done, but were huge. In some cases > 300K minified. I ended up writing what I needed myself in less than 200 lines (commented) of JS that I simply included into my existing code base. Will it work for everyone's drag-and-drop needs? Probably not, but I don't need to weigh down this clients' customers with code that I'm not using. jQuery is important to me because it levels the playing field (browser inconsistencies, etc.). This is important to me and my clients AND speeds up general development, so its easy to justify. Some other plugins just aren't always justifiable in the same way.
