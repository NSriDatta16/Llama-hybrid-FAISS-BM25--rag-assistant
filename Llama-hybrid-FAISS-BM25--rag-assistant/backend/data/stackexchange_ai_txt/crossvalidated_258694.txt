Would it be valid to compare two slightly different questions using frequency?

I administered a questionnaire, and one of the questions asked: Indicate all of the activities you did while on your most recent trip (please select all that apply). There are 20 or so options to choose from. I copied this question from a questionnaire asked by a government organization however I excluded some of the activities the government listed and combined other activities to keep my question fairly short. Also, my participant sample is much smaller than that of the government questionnaire. So, now I am wondering if I can compare my answers with those of the governmental organization. My research is exploratory and qualitative in nature, therefore I am not trying to verify anything, I just want to see if patterns might exist.
