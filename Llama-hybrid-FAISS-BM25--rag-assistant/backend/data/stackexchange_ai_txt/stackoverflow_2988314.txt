Enable GPS without forwarding the user to "settings"?

I know this question has been asked in similar forms before, but I found no real answer about the following issue: On my Nexus One there's a widget to toggle on/off several things on my phone like wlan, bluetooth, gps,.. Why does this widget has access to the GPS, without forwarding me to the settings screen? And how can I use this functionality in my own apps? On many sites it is mentioned, this is done because of security reasons...but in a strage way, this widget may do this? why? and the better question is: how? Does someone have a clue?
