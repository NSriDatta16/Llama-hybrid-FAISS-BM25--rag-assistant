For now I've done it via JavaScript, still open to better solutions. I made the div in the html empty Then created a javascript function that is called from the body's onLoad function FillSlogan() { var text = ''; for(var i=0; i The FillSlogan function is in an include file and will be denied in robots.txt for good measure. This way it is able to use the justification and wrapping abilities, but keeps the repeated text away from the bots.
