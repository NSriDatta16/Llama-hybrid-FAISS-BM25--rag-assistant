I think you're doing it backwards... downcasts will fail, you should design it with upcasts. Implementation of IEnumerable is the most common example of this pattern. The most derived type needs to be responsible for creating the most derived result, then virtual methods in the base type can be overridden to return the most derived result via an upcast (which might be implicit).
