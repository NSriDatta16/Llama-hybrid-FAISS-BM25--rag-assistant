A laser tag type gun that you would mount the iPhone on, the wireless mode, GPS, compass and gun could combine into a pretty cool game. A heart rate monitor for use while riding my bike, for accumulating ride statistics (Might already be available via bluetooth). A KEYBOARD. One of those where you can plug the iPhone in the top--folds up, etc. You know, it would be nice if there was a case that you put "around" the ipod (like the existing hard plastic cases) that contained extra rechargeable batteries and a memory expansion pack to hold extra music (let's say a 64-128gb card). Update: Although I understand a blood glucose monitor is actually in the works, I'm not sure how it would be extra helpful. The presentation I was watching claimed it could track info and send it instantly to your doctor. I could easily see it monitoring car performance. I'd build a iPhone-style mount into the dash and just slide it in when I got into the car. It could control and monitor fuel efficiency, engine performance, timing, emissions, etc. It could give graphics and other displays that would update as performance changed. On high-performance cars it could even shift for you (Newer manual shifts can be controlled electronically, I believe) This is probably being done as well. A friend and I were discussing doing it with a DS. The CC reader is also being done. I'm not sure if it's hardware or photo or manual entry though. They discussed it in the same keynote speech in which they discussed the glucose monitor. I could see this being amazingly useful. A couple weeks ago I went to a movie in a "Livingroom" style theater. Each row had unlimited leg room with ottomans set up in front. They served meals from a full-service restaurant. When taking orders, the waiters carried around these big things that seemed kind of like the things UPS drivers use to get your signature. After the meal they took your card away to process it. Both tasks could have been done at the same time (and much more elegantly) with an iPhone. (On the bummer side, my wife and I paid over $70 to see "The Hangover"--a good show but a bit pricey at that)
