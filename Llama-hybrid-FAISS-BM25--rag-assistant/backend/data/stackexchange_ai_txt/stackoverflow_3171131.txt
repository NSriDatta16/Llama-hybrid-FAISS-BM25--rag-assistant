Google maps: Can't click marker which is on top of another

I have a map with about hundred location points (markers). Which are grouped with ClusterMarker http://googlemapsapi.martinpearman.co.uk/clustermarker And then there's one "main" marker, which is draggable. If main marker location is overlapping with other marker then it becomes undraggable. Or in another words: clicking takes action on marker which is behind the main marker. Weird, because I'm setting zIndexProcess when creating the main marker, which brings it to the front of others (by default it's not like that). So.. I don't know what's the problem and how to ask but I would try like this: How to get clickable area to the front if I have brought to the front main marker icon already? (at least it is visible on top of others) P.S. I have GPolygon drawn on the base of main marker (radius, a circle) and this circle is drawn behind all markers. Don't know if this is relevant. Oh, and I can't bring this polygon to the front (seems like zIndexProcess does not work on this)
