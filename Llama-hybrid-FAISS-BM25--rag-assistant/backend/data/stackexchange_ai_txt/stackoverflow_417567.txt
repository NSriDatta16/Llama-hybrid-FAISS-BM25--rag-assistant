If you were in charge, I would imagine you'd do it the "correct" way with a good design, even if it takes longer. The problem though is your manager is in charge. So, this sounds like a conversation you should be having with your manager. Remind him (subtly) of the times his approach resulted in a mess and suggest that a bit more attention be made to the project. Suggest it may be a good marketing decision to put a little more effort into this project because the relationship with this client may be crucial. Don't get into an argument, just make yourself heard. At least it may get him to stop and think again about his decision - maybe he can have another conversation with the client about how much they're willing to pay. In the end, respect his decision but make sure he does realize it was his decision and you're simply following orders. That way if a problem does develop in the future, it doesn't end up being your problem. If he's not the approachable type, I think you're stuck doing it the quick-and-dirty way. I would document the situation though to minimize future ass-biting potential.
