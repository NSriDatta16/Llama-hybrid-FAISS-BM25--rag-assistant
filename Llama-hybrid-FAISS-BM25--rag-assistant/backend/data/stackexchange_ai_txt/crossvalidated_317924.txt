The bayes/frequentist debate is based on numerous grounds. If you are talking about mathematical basis, I don't think there is much. They both need to apply various approximate methods for complex problems. Two examples are "bootstrap" for frequentist and "mcmc" for bayesian. They both come with rituals/procedures for how to use them. A frequentist example is "propose an estimator of something and evaluate its properties under repeated sampling" while a bayesian example is "calculate probability distributions for what you don't know conditional on what you do know". There is no mathematical basis for using probabilities in this way. The debate is more about application, interpretation, and ability to solve real world problems. In fact, this is often used by people debating "their side" where they will use a specific "ritual/procedure" used by the "other side" to argue that the whole theory should be thrown away for theirs. Some examples include... using stupid priors (and not checking them) using stupid CIs (and not checking them) confusing a computational technique with the theory (bayes is not mcmc!! Same goes for equating cross validation with machine learning) talking about a problem with a specific application with one theory and not how the other theory would solve the specific problem "better"
