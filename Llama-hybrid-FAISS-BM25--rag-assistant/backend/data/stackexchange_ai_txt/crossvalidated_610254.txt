Appropriate regression model when variables were measured on different subjects?

Imagine the following study design: We have propagated $N$ plants. Each plant produces many seeds. From each plant, $M$ of the seeds are used to measure community composition of bacteria living within the seed in a destructive process. An additional $M$ seeds from each plant are allowed to germinate and the root length of the resulting seedling is measured. So now we have $N \times M$ measurements of bacterial composition and $N \times M$ measurements of root length. We want to fit a regression model to estimate the effect of bacterial composition on root length. But because it is impossible to measure bacterial composition and root length from the same seed, we do not have $N \times M$ pairs of values. It does not seem ideal to average the measurements from each of the $N$ plants and fit the model because this would ignore the nestedness of the variation. And it does not seem possible to fit a simple multilevel model because we do not have paired measurements within plant. My initial idea was to do a bootstrapping kind of method where we would randomly sample one of each of the $M$ replicates for each of the $N$ individuals and fit the regression model. Then repeat that many times to get a bootstrap distribution for each of the regression parameters. That should incorporate the variation among seeds within a parent plant into the uncertainty distribution. I would like to know if there is a standard or canonical approach to use in this case or if the bootstrap technique is acceptable. Are there any relevant literature references or textbooks that address this issue?
