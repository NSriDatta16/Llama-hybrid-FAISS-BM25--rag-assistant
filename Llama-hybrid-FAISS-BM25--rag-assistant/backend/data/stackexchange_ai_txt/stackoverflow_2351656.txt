What are the values of start_index and end_index , and hence of i , when the crash occurs? If i is under control, the code should not crash - so that is the first thing I would check. The show code fragment leaks file streams abominably because it overwrites fin on each iteration. I assume that is an artefact of reducing the test code to a minimum rather than the actual behaviour of the (as yet not) working program.
