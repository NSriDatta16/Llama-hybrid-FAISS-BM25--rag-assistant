Logistic regression sub-group size parameters

Someone in my lab has a sample of 500 older kids and he wants to investigate what factors are related to the probability that they will bully. Groups: bullied not bully 22 28 don't 200 250 They created an interaction variable using age*not bullied/bullied and added 14 other "predictors" to the mode. Interaction of age and bullying is sig but the prototypical plot looks weird, the group who were bullied have a 0 slope by age and the line starts and ends at 0. My guess is the the bullied/bullying group is way too small for all the info in the model. IF so, what are the group size parameters or ratio to total group parameters for logistic regression? Thank you very much!
