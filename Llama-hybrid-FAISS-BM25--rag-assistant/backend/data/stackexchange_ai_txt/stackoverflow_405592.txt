Suppose you have limited storage, and data constantly accumulates. In many real life cases, you don't mind getting rid of old data, but you don't want to move data. You can use a cyclic vector; implemented using a vector v of size N with two special indices: begin and end, which initiate on 0. Insertion of "new" data now goes like this: v[end] = a; end = (end+1) % N; if (begin == end) begin = (begin+1) % N; You can insert "old" data and erase "old" or "new" data in a similar way. Scanning the vector goes like this for (i=begin; i != end; i = (i+1) % N) { // do stuff }
