How to deal with time series of multi-source energy in order of classifcation?

I would like to do classification of multi-source energy (wind/solar/teg) repersented in a time series data. My questions are : 1- What are the most relevent feature that I should chose to do the classification (statistical ones (kurtoisis/means/ variance...) on each sliding window (for experimental purpose) or spectral ones (DWT/FFT)) and which feature selection/extraction method is the best in this case. 2-What is the best classification method should I chose? Thank you
