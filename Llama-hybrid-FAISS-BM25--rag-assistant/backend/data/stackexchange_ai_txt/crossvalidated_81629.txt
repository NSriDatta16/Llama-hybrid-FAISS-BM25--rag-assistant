A simple extension would be as follows: Laplace estimator: $\hat p = \frac{s+1}{n+2}$. Note that this is simply the sum n Bernoulli(p) r.v.s plus 1 divided by n + 2 total trials. To extend this, we need to make sure it holds in its limits (No ratings, infinite number of ratings). We can get this agreement using the following score (S) formula for item $i$, given a vector of rankings, $r_i$ and the number of ranks given $n_i$: $S_i(\mathbb{r}_i,n_i)=\frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}r_{ij}\space +\space 10}{n_i + 2}$ This way, if you have no observations, you get 5 as your estimated ranking. The more ratings an items gets, the closer its rank approaches the arithmetic average of its ranks. If two items (A,B) have the same average ranking (say 6), but $n_A>n_B$, then $S_A>S_B$.
