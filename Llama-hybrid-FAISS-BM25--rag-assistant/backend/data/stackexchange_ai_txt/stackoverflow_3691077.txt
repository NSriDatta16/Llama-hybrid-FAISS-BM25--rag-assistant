Should re-include stuff thats already in the project scope precompiled header?

I have a precompiled header stdafx.h which is used in all source files in my project. Thus all headers in the stdafx.h are available in all code files in the project. What I'm unsure about is whether or not to re-include stuff thats already in the precompiled header. What do you guys think? e.g. stdafx.h #pragma once #include my_class.h #pragma once #include // Re-include or not that's the question. Best practice? struct my_class { }; typedef std::shared_ptr my_class_ptr; main.cpp #include "stdafx.h" #include "my_class.h" int main() { }
