Managing Multiple Observation at the same time stamp timeseries forecasting deep learning

I have a dataset timeseries forecasting that includes the categorical columns and numeric as well. here is a sample of it Date | categorical _fature_1 |categorical _fature_2| Feature_1_numeric | feature_2_numeric | price 1-1-2020 | USA | A | 5.5 | 7.6 | 100 1-1-2020 | USA | B | 8.3 | 1.7| 20 1-1-2020 | USA | C | 3.6 | 2.1 | 17 1-2-2020 | USA | D | 5.5 | 7.6 | 40 1-2-2020 | USA | E | 77.5 | 35 | 22 1-2-2020 | USA | F | 69.5 | 2 | 22 as you can see in the sample in the date lets pick up the 1-1-2020 we have multiple observations at the same date . i want to predict the Price column as a Y_label and taking the categorical _fature_1 , categorical _fature_2 , Feature_1_numeric , and Feature_2_numeric as the X_features so from my understanding as im using multiple features for time series Forecasting predicting the Price column this is called Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting My Question is 1-how can i manage the multiple observations at the same time from the different features as we saw for example in 1-1-2020 we have three different observations 2-i believe if we have multiple observations at the same time/date then we have a new kind of Time-series forecasting what is it Multi-timestep Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting or what ??? thanks
