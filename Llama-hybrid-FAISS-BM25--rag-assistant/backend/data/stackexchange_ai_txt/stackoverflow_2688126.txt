My Advice to You: There are several Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) branches out there: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node2.html I have only tried genetic programming, but in the "learning from experience" branch you will find neural nets. GP/GA and neural nets seem to be the most commonly explored methodologies for the purpose of stock market predictions, but if you do some data mining on Predict Wall Street , you might be able to utilize a Naive Bayes classifier to do what you're interested in doing. Spend some time learning about the various ML/AI techniques, get a small data set and try to implement some of those algorithms. Each one will have its strengths and weaknesses, so I would recommend that you try to combine them using Naive Bays classifier (or something similar). My Experience: I'm working on the problem for my Masters Thesis so I'll pitch my results using Genetic Programming. I started live trading with real money in 09/09/09.. yes, it was a magical day! I post the GP's predictions before the market opens (i.e. the timestamps on twitter) and I also place the orders before the market opens. The profit for this period has been around 25%, we've consistently beat the Buy & Hold strategy and we're also outperforming the S&P 500 with stocks that are under-performing it. Some Resources: Here are some resources that you might want to look into: Max Dama's blog: http://www.maxdama.com/search/label/Artificial%20Intelligence My blog: http://mlai-lirik.blogspot.com/ AI Stock Market Forum: http://www.ai-stockmarketforum.com/ Weka is a data mining tool with a collection of ML/AI algorithms: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ The Chatter: The general consensus amongst "financial people" is that Artificial Intelligence is a voodoo science, you can't make a computer predict stock prices and you're sure to loose your money if you try doing it. None-the-less, the same people will tell you that just about the only way to make money on the stock market is to build and improve on your own trading strategy and follow it closely. The idea of AI algorithms is not to build Chip and let him trade for you, but to automate the process of creating strategies. Fun Facts: RE: monkeys can pick better than most experts Apparently rats are pretty good too !
