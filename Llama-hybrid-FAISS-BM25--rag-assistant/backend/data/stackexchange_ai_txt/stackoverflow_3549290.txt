Use ASIHTTPRequest. It's a third party HTTP client library that makes network interaction MUCH simpler, and has very nice caching functions. UPDATE: Just got a downvote on this answer, which is a good reminder to come back and update. Lot has changed since August '10. Most notably: ASIHTTPRequest is now deprecated, and its author is encouraging people to use something else. AFNetworking seems a popular choice.
