Combining two time series with normalization

I have two sets of time series data with different distributions. Basically, one is count of likes for a post and the other one is the likes on the corresponding comments. It looks like this Now, I need to put them into a single time series with proper scaling to make them comparable. I tried to scale the mean of the comments like distribution to the mean of the like distribution of the posts, but this approach scales up the min values of comments to way more than those of the posts. I need to neutralize the effect of two things here: The users who interact with these posts and comments has increased substantially over time. I assume that comments tend to get fewer likes than posts What should be a standard approach to normalizing these distributions to represent them in a single time series? EDIT Since I have timestamps of both posts and comments, I can form a single time series by putting the data points at appropriate time intervals. When I directly normalize the values, the comment like score becomes negligible. The scaling mean method makes the comment like values way higher than a typical like value.
