Entity Framework with lots (50K+) tables

I would like to use the Entity Framework against a database with well over 50,000 tables. I only want to create entities on a small portion of these tables (less than 10). When I go to add tables using the wizard or server explorer, Visual Studio seems to not be able to handle that large amount of tables. It appears as if the tree view limits out with that many items. I'm willing to create the mapping manually if that is the only option. Is there a way to "Filter" the tables to find only the ones I need so I can drag-n-drop? How do I create an Entity manually and then map it to a physical table? Note: If LinqToSql would somehow work better for this, I'm open to that as well for this project. I would prefer Entity Framework however.
