C# - Insert a variable number of spaces into a string? (Formatting an output file)

I'm taking data from a list that I populate a DataGridView with and am exporting it to a text file. I've already done the function to export it to a CSV, and would like to do a plain text version as well. Because the Titles and other elements are variable in length, when the file is saved and then opened in Notepad it looks like a mess because nothing lines up. I'd like to have the output look like this: Sample Title One Element One Whatever Else Sample Title 2 Element 2 Whatever Else S. T. 3 E3 Whatever Else I figure that I can loop through each of the elements in order to get the length of the longest one so I can calculate how many spaces to add to each of the remaining element. My main question is: Is there an elegant way to add a variable number of chars into a string? It'd be nice to have something like: myString.insert(index, charToInsert, howManyToInsert); Of course, I can obviously just write a function to do this via a loop, but I wanted to see if there was a better way of doing it.
