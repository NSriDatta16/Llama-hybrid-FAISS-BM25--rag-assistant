It is perfectly acceptable if it is acceptable in your working group. A lot of the answers here operate on the arrogant assumption that everybody programs in English. Non-English programmers are by no means rare these days and they're getting less rare at an accelerating rate. Why should they restrict themselves to English versions when they have a perfectly good language at their disposal? Anglophone arrogance aside, there are other legitimate reasons for using non-English identifiers. If you're writing mathematics packages, for example, using Greek is fine if your target is fellow mathematicians. Why should people type out "delta" in your workgroup when everybody can understand "Î”" and likely type it more quickly? Almost any problem domain will have its own jargon and sometimes that jargon is expressed in something other than the Latin alphabet. Why on Earth would you want to try and jam everything into ASCII?
