Library for simulating HTTP transactions like a browser with cookie and session support

I wonder if there is a .NET library that mimics a browser in terms of HTTP transactions. In other words I am going to make multiple GET/POST requests and I want the cookies to be persisted to a storage, so that consecutive request will be identified by the remote host. AFAIK cURL has support for this functionality.
