Customize The Context Menu's I personally customize the context menu's to remove the ones I don't want and minimize my scroll time. It can also speed up the time taken for the menu's to appear. To do this go to Tools/Customize and Check the "Context Menus" item. The menu's appear on the top of the main design area. To modify them select the context menu you want and drag and drop items around. I usually remove items like "Get Version" in Team Foundation Server as I rarely if ever use it and I can use it from Team Explorer if I need to.
