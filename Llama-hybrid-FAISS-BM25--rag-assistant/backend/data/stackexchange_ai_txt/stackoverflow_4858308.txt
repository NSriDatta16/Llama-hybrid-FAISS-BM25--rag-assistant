jQuery draggable/droppable miss event

I want to handle an event when my draggable item was dropped but not inside my droppable item. So far I could get only this far: $('#myDraggable').draggable({ stop: function (event, ui) { if (event.srcElement.id != 'myDroppable'){ // Missed } } }); But the problem is that I'm chaning #myDroppable element when something is added to it. So next time I drop something to it event.srcElement.id may not be myDroppable , but any id of its new children. I could add an overlay on top, but when there is a scrollbar it gets more complicated. Is there another way to handle this event?
