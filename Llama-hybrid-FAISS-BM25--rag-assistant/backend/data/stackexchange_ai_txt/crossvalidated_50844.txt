Estimating the covariance posterior distribution of a multivariate gaussian

I need to "learn" the distribution of a bivariate gaussian with few samples, but a good hypothesis on the prior distribution, so I would like to use the bayesian approach. I defined my prior: $$ \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{\mu}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu_0},\mathbf{\Sigma_0}) $$ $$ \mathbf{\mu_0} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \ \ \ \mathbf{\Sigma_0} = \begin{bmatrix} 16 & 0 \\ 0 & 27 \end{bmatrix} $$ And my distribution given the hypothesis $$ \mathbf{P}(x|\mathbf{\mu},\mathbf{\Sigma}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu},\mathbf{\Sigma}) $$ $$ \mathbf{\mu} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \ \ \ \mathbf{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} 18 & 0 \\ 0 & 18 \end{bmatrix} $$ Now I know thanks to here that to estimate the mean given the data $$ \mathbf{P} (\mathbf{\mu} | \mathbf{x_1}, \dots , \mathbf{x_n}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\hat{\mu}_n}, \mathbf{\hat{\Sigma}_n})$$ I can compute: $$ \mathbf{\hat{\mu}_n} = \mathbf{\Sigma_0} \left( \mathbf{\Sigma_0} + {1 \over n} \mathbf{\Sigma} \right) ^ {-1} \left( {1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{x_i} \right) + {1 \over n} \mathbf{\Sigma} \left( \mathbf{\Sigma_0} + {1 \over n} \mathbf{\Sigma} \right) ^{-1} \mathbf{\mu_0} $$ $$ \mathbf {\hat{\Sigma}_n} = {1 \over n} \mathbf{\Sigma_0} \left( \mathbf{\Sigma_0} + {1 \over n} \mathbf{\Sigma} \right) ^{-1} \mathbf{\Sigma} $$ Now comes the question, maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that $ \mathbf{\Sigma_n} $ is just the covariance matrix for the estimated parameter $\mathbf{\mu_n} $, and not the estimated covariance of my data. What I would like would be to compute also $$ \mathbf{P} (\mathbf{\Sigma_{n_1}} | \mathbf{x_1}, \dots , \mathbf{x_n}) $$ in order to have a fully specified distribution learned from my data. Is this possible? Is it already solved by computing $\mathbf{\Sigma_n}$ and it's just expressed in the wrong way the formula above (or I am simply misentrepreting it)? References would be appreciated. Thanks a lot. EDIT From the comments, it appeared that my approach was "wrong", in the sense that I was assuming a constant covariance, defined by $ \mathbf{\Sigma} $. What I need would be to put a prior also on it, $ \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{\Sigma}) $, but I don't know what distribution I should use, and subsequently what is the procedure to update it.
