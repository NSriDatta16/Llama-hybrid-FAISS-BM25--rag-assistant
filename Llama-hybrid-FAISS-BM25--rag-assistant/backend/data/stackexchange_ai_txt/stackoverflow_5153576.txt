Problem with max() and min() function

I created following table create table Interiors( no integer, name varchar, type varchar, dateofstock datetime, price decimal(6,3), discount numeric(6,2)) i want to solve these two queries. Display the type, sum of price and average of discount by grouping type as 'baby cot'. Display the type, maximum and minimum of price by grouping type as 'baby cot'. I wrote following stmts for each resp. select type, sum(price), avg(discount) from Interiors group by 'baby cot'. select type, max(price), min(price) from Interiors group by 'baby cot'. I got following error same for both like that 'type is not an aggregate fun. or it dont have GROUP BY' clause. What should I do for solving that queries.
