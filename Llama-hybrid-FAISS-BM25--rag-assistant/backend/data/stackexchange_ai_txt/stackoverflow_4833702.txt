From my experience (which isn't that much). You can create 2 UIViews for the 2 paddles, touching in one view will move one paddle, while touching in the other will move the other paddle. I hope this helps. If you don't know how to split the views, you can simply make it identify 2 touches - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch1 = [[event touchesForView:zone1] anyObject]; UITouch *touch2 = [[event touchesForView:zone2] anyObject]; if (touch1) touchOffset1 = paddle1.center.x - [touch1 locationInView:touch1.view].x; if (touch2) touchOffset2 = paddle2.center.x - [touch2 locationInView:touch2.view].x; } This you can use, it probably isn't the most productive, but it does work if you can't figure out how to split the touches.
