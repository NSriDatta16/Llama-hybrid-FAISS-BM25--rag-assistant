Evaluation of IR approach without test collections

I am trying to evaluate an information retrieval approach. More specifically, it's a query expansion algorithm, based on topic distribution in retrieved documents. I want to evaluate my approach using the world wide web. Since most (all?) evaluation approaches use a test collection, where the whole corpus is known, I am having a hard time to find an evaluation approach which works only on retrieved documents. So, I am looking for information on this topic. Maybe a paper or a keyword?
