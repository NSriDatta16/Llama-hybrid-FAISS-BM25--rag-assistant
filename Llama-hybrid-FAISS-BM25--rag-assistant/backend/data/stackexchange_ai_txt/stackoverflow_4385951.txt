What could be causing my application to be unable to allocate more memory when there is clearly available RAM? Heap fragmentation . Allocation doesn't simply ask for memory. It asks for a contiguous piece of memory. Of course, given the sparse data you provided ( how much are you trying to re-alloc when that happens? is this a 32bit or a 64bit app?), there could be other problems as well.
