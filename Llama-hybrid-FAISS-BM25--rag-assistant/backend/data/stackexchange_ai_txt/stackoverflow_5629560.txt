creating a database class using the multimap class in c++

I'm working with C++ for a project. I need to store a pair (string,integer) and access them based on the string. The multimap class seems perfect for that. I am trying to make my own class, database, which will include methods to find the average and count of all the integers associated with a particular string. However, I am a bit confused on the initial constructor. My database should be created when database data(); is called, but it comes up with a huge error. Here is an implementation of the constructor in database.cpp database::database() { data = new multimap ; // allocates new space for the database *data["asdf"]= 0; // adds a point. not needed...? } Also, the database.h file looks like so. private: multimap *data; The error is rather dense, and I can't decipher it, but when I run g++ database.cpp test.cpp this comes out. $ g++ database.cpp test.cpp database.cpp: In constructor ‘database::database()’: database.cpp:11: error: cannot convert ‘std::multimap , std::allocator >, int, std::less , std::allocator > >, std::allocator , std::allocator >, int> > >*’ to ‘std::multimap , std::allocator >, double, std::less , std::allocator > >, std::allocator , std::allocator >, double> > >*’ in assignment database.cpp:12: error: invalid types ‘std::multimap , std::allocator >, double, std::less , std::allocator > >, std::allocator , std::allocator >, double> > >*[const char [5]]’ for array subscript Edit: I forgot to add, thanks for the help!
