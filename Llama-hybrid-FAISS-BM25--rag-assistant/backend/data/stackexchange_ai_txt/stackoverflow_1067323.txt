ORDER BY date while also using LIMIT in a MySQL query - PHP

HI, I can't quite figure this out, I'm trying to pull records from MySQL, order them reverse-chronologically and limit the results to four per page (and using pagination to organize the pages). It is currently returning this error: Fatal error: SQL in /Users/allan/Sites/4is_site/casestudylist.php on line 126 $limit = 'LIMIT ' .($pageno - 1) * $rows_per_page .',' .$rows_per_page; $query = "SELECT * FROM studies ORDER BY date desc WHERE niche = '{$_GET['niche']}' $limit"; The pagination has been working fine, just now that I've tried to add the ORDER BY that I'm getting problems.
