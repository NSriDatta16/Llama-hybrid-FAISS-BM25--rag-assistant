If you are happy to assume your binomial responses are coming from a spatially correlated gaussian random field via a logit link, and your non-spatial covariates have the usual log-linear form, then stuff it all into geoRglm : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoRglm/vignettes/geoRglmintro.pdf and once you've got your MCMC all tuned, out pops the parameter estimates.
