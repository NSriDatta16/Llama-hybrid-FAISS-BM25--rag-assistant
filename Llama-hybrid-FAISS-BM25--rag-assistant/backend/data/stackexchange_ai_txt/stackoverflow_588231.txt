Custom image while dragging an CWnd-derived object

I want to display a custom image while dragging an object in a drag&drop operation. I have created a CWnd-derived control (a chart) and I display 4 of them in the same dialog. I've implemented drag&drop using COleDataSource so that the user can change its position by dragging and dropping the control. Now I would like to display a small version of the same chart is been dragging instead of the typical cursor. Is there an "easy" way to do it?
