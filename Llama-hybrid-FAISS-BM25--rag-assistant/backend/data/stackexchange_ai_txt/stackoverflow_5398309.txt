Check the MAAttachedWindow sample project: http://mattgemmell.com/source/ Great start for creating custom tooltips. NSView has specific handlers for mouse events. Simply change the NSView (tooltip) based on these events. I added some snippets to get you started. - (void)mouseMove:(NSEvent *)theEvent { NSPoint mousePositionInWindow = [theEvent locationInWindow]; } - (void)mouseDown:(NSEvent *)theEvent { } - (void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent { } - (void)mouseUp:(NSEvent *)theEvent { } Response to comment: Once I struggled with exactly the same problem: One view with continuous tooltip updates showing the cursor position and some additional information. I got it never working with the native tooltips. Finally i came up with the solution above, which is easy to implement and made it even look better. Instead of using the separate window, you can also draw the custom tooltip inside the NSView itself, in relation to the cursor position. You can also put an extra NSView on top of the existing NSView to show the custom tooltips. I don't like the native tooltip behavior. Apparently they have build-in time-delays which cannot be changed, for example: The cursor has to be on one position for some time to show the tooltip for the first time. Once the first tooltip showed up, the next will show with much less delay, but it's still quite annoying. Of cours, you can always show the info in a label located near the view, which is really easy to implement. But that is no real answer to your question :)
