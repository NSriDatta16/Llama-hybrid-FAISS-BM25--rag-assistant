This outlines how to do it fairly elegantly, though it may be more effort than it's worth: http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.9/jpl/docs/Tutorial.pod Overview: Well-supported by JPL, but it is a complicated process: The JPL preprocessor parses the .jpl file and generates C code wrappers for Perl methods. It also generates Java and Perl source files. The C compiler compiles the wrapper and links it to the libPerlInterpreter.so shared library, producing a shared library for the wrapper. The Java compiler compiles the Java source file, which uses native methods to load the wrapper. The wrapper connects the Java code to the Perl code in the Perl source file. Fortunately, a generic Makefile.PL simplifies the process. This is a Perl script that generates a Makefile for you.
