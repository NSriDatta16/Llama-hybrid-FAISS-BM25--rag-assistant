Repeating my own answer to a similar question, There's no accepted definition of functional programming language. If you define functional language as the language that supports first class functions and lambdas, then yes, JavaScript *is* a functional language. If you also consider the factors like support for immutability, algebraic data types, pattern matching, partial application etc then no, JavaScript *is not* a functional language. I'd encourage you to read the following related blog posts (and also the comments below them): Scala is not a functional language Erlang is not functional Reddit discussion on "Erlang is not functional"
