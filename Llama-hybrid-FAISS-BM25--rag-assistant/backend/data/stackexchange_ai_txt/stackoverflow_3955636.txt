Options for ASP.NET page with matching client-side and server-side markup?

Suppose I'm building a StackOverflow clone using webforms ASP.NET and jQuery. The Question page has a question, several answers, and comments under each. Requirements: Users can post new answers and comments, and edit existing ones, without postbacks. No UpdatePanels; the AJAX calls retrieve just the JSON they need, not HTML fragments. The page loads with all existing answers and comments in place (no javascript needs to run to read the page). What I'm trying to figure out is how to do this without having to maintain two sets of markup (one that's bound on the client using some form of jQuery templating, and one that's bound on the server using traditional WebForms). What are my options?
