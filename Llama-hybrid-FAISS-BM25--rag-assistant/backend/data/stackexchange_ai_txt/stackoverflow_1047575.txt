Yes, this is dangerous. For example, a malicious user can just request something like this: GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com Connection: close User-Agent: And compromise your view page with malicious JavaScript.

With the malicious JavaScript, the attacker can steal your session cookie and take over your session, complete with all the things you can do while logged in. So, in conclusion, you should definitely escape access log pages, unless you like having your administrative accounts compromised.
