Since I use a single-access-point style system that bootstraps the application and includes the correct file (it's basically a controller system) I can use: Then when I want to throw an error I just: throw new Exception('An error occurred.'); Can someone suggest a best practice or something you are doing to be able to properly manage a large list of error and success messages through out an application. This is how I manage errors by bulk, but not how I could manage a list. I could grep for error messages I find, it's not really very organised though.
