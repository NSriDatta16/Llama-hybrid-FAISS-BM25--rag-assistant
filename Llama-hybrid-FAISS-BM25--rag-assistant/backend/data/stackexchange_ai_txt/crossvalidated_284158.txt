Gamma CDF in Python

I'm working through the Coursera course Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by the University of California, Santa Cruz and there is a worksheet that requires me to use R or Excel to find the answer to this: Let $Y âˆ¼ Gamma(2, 1/3)$. Find $P(0.5 I would like to calculate this using Python. I have tried from scipy import stats stats.gamma.cdf(1.5,1/3,scale=2) - stats.gamma.cdf(0.5,1/3,scale=2) which returns 0.197 . I've also tried switching the 2 and the 1/3 . Note I am using Python 3.5.3 |Anaconda 2.5.0 (64-bit)| (default, May 15 2017, 10:43:23) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 What am I doing wrong?
