django admin: how to make a readonly url field clickable in change_form.html?

I want to make a readonly URL field clickable in the admin on a change_form page. I tried a widget, but soon realized widgets are for form fields only. So, before I try to solve this problem with jQuery (find and replace or something), I would like to know if there is a more elegant solution for this in python. Any ideas?
