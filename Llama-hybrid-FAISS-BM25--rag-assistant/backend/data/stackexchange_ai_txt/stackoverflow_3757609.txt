Objects that implement the Traversable interface (through Iterator or IteratorAggregate ) support the foreach construct, if that's what you mean by "acting as an array." Eg: class theClass implements Iterator { // implement iterator here } // now you can do $obj = new theClass; foreach ($obj as $value) { // do something }
