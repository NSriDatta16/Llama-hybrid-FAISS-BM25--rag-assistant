The index is there to speed retrieval of data, so the question should be "What data do I need to access quickly?". Without the index, some queries will do a full table scan (go through every row in the table) in order to find the data that you want. With a significant amount of records this will be a slow and expensive operation. If it is for a report that you run once a month then maybe thats okay; if it is for frequently accessed data then you will need the index to give your users a better experience. If you find the speed of the insert operations are slow because of the index then this is a problem you can solve at the hardware level by throwing more CPUs, RAM and better hard drive technology at the problem.
