How to determine the "tipping point" especially when programming regex's?

G'day, Edit: While this question covers a situation that can arise in programming a lot, i have always noticed that there is a point when working with regex's, esp. in Perl and with shell-programming, where trying to capture those last few edge cases: requires much, much more time to expand your regex, which can mean excessive complexity in the regex, which leads to future maintenance headaches due to complex nature of regex, especially where it's not in Perl so that there's no nice /x option to allow you to document the regex fragments easily. I was answering this question " Is there a fairly simple way for a script to tell (from context) whether “her” is a possessive pronoun? " and part of my answer was that you get to a point where chasing the last few percent of edge cases is not worth the extra effort and time to extend your regex, shell script, etc. It becomes easier to just flag the edge cases and go through them manually. It got me wondering do people have a simple way of realising that they're hitting this type of tipping point? Or is it something that only comes with experience? BTW While this other question is also about "tipping points" , it concerns when to decide to start automating file manipulations and not when "enough is enough".
