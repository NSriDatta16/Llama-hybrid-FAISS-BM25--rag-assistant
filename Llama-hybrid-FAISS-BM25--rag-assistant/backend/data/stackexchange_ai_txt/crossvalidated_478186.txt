Root Mean Square error or Standard Deviation to focus for Machine Learning model selection?

I have used Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine regressor model to predict the dependent variable. In Linear regression prediction the Root Mean Square error is more but standard deviation is less compare to Support vector regression result. The Root Mean Square Error on predicted value Vs actual value in training data set is 12.83 ( Linear regression) The Standard Deviation of the Linear regression evalation is 1.16 In Support Vector regression result the Root Mean Square error is less but standard deviation is more compare to Linear regression result. The Root Mean Square Error on predicted value Vs actual value in training data set is 10.83 ( Support Vector regression) The Standard Deviation of the Linear regression evalation is 1.90 Can you please suggest which parameter to focus more on selecting the model?
