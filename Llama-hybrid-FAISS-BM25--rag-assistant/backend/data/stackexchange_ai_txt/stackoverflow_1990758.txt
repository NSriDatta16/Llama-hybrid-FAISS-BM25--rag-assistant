If you are just getting your feet wet, MYSQL is a great one to start with. Easy install on any platform, great community support and lots of free tools to work with (SQLYog is a favorite of mine). I agree that theory is very important. Depending on how you learn best, digging in and tinkering may be the thing to do before you try to absorb 40 years of thought on relational systems. Codd and Date are legends in the field and can help you understand the broader points of relational theory, but are hard to absorb before you have context for the topic. If you are looking for more pragmatic/immediate guidance, I'd suggest a book like "Databases for Mere Mortals" and anything written by Joe Celko. Once you get comfortable with the basics, there are lots of other platforms to explore as well. As mentioned above, SQLLite and PostGres are two other great choices for the Mac OS.
