OpenAI recently published a paper and blog post that may answer your question. Basically they trained a Char-RNN on 82 million unlabelled Amazon reviews, and using the LSTM units as vector representations of the text, they added a linear (logistic regression) classifier that's trained on only 11 labeled datapoints and achieved pretty good results. Note: I haven't tested this method myself.
