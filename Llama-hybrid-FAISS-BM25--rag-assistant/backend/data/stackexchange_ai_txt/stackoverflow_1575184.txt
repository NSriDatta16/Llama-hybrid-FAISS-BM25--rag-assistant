This is impossible to get perfectly right. Most open source cmsses/blogs that have some sort of theming don't support it on all extensions, simply because the extensions are not within the control of the author of the cms (and not within the control of the theme-creator either). So the theme will look good on the basic cms, and maybe on some common extensions, but after that it's just fingers crossed. No matter how many items/types/classes you define upfront for the theme-makers to decide on, there will always be something that has not been thought of in the themes setup. The only way out of this is very rigid design-guidelines, and even that will never get you to 100% coverage, just closer than you would be without. Example: a bar chart will be shown by some plugin. Your first attempt within the theming has been to always require a theme to list 10 colors to be used in a chart, of course this chart needs 11 :-) Now your next iteration of the theming engine requires theme authors to come up with a scheme for generating an endless amount of colors for usage in graphs (you've just made the job of a themer quite a bit harder...) Now of course the graph that needs to be shown needs 3 sets of each 2 related-looking colors ... you'll never win that race. I'd say your best option is to make sure that theme creators have a good set of core css classes to define (along with a big series of reference pages from your base cms so they can test their designs). Now you should encourage your extension makers to use the standard-styles as often as possible, and stimulate them to do so by making it easy to check their extensions with numerous themes. As a last but much needed option you should make it possible for people who are setting up a site to easily override/correct the styling of an extension within a certain theme -- that should make issues with the theming system just a burden instead of a deal-breaker.
