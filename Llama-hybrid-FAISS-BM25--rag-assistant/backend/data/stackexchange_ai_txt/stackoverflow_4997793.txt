review board, post-review and a deleted file

Googling and reading Review Board's documentation (and bugging coworkers) hasn't solved this problem so far. I'm using Review Board (1.5) for code review. When doing a command line post-review, Review Board doesn't like it when I've deleted a file (svn del, that is). In other words, r1 for example, had foo.js but r3 has had foo.js svn deleted during a reorganization and cleanup of files no longer used. When doing the post-review, the error message is: server$ post-review --revision-range=r1:r3 --submit-as="jody" Failed to execute command: ['svn', 'info', 'js/app.conf.js'] ['js/foo.js: (Not a versioned resource)\n', '\n', 'svn: A problem occurred; see other errors for details\n'] How can one svn del an unneeded file but move forward with the post-review without the error?
