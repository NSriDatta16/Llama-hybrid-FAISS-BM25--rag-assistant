Asking for opinion for my MenuTree structure. Which is better, array or delimiter approach?

Which is the better API? I think the latter approach is better because strings are interned. But I'm pining for succintness. Which do you think is better? [Task("Assortment", Author = "好先生", MenuTree = "The>Quick>Brown>Megan")] public partial class Form1 : MycForm, ITaskPlugin { } or this(strings can be interned): [Task("Assortment", Author = "好先生", MenuTree = new string[] { "The", "Quick", "Brown", "Megan"} )] public partial class Form1 : MycForm, ITaskPlugin { }
