Computing AUC or, generally, doing prediction with the Zelig package in R?

I'm using the model ReLogit from the package Zelig in R. ReLogit is a logistic regression for rare events data. After having estimated the model on the training set, I want to calculate the AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) of this model in the test set. How can I do this with this package?
