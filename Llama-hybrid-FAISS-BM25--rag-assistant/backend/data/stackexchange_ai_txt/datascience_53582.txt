Predicting future automobile sales

I am new to Machine Learning. Recently I am trying to build a model to predict the sales of a particular automobile make and model of a dealership and to which location. The data given to me has information about the dealer name, state, zip code, owner state, zip code, vehicle make, model, year, vehicle segment, body type, odometer reading, new/used indicator. How do I build a model to do predictive analysis?
