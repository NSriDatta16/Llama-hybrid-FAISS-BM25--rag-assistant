I think it's some kind of a bug in Safari - for example if you do .focus() nof for the DIV but for another input element like a textfield, then after clicking the selectbox both would have the focus (or actually, the focus would stay in the selectbox and the textbox would only seem to have the focus by having thicker border than usual). Anyhow quick and dirty methot to achieve the goal would be removing the selectbox from the page (display: none) and then bringing it back (display:inline). replace the this.blur() with the following command this.style.cssText='display:none';var select = this; window.setTimeout(function(){select.style.cssText='display:inline';},1); If you don't use a delay then it doesn't work - the removal and retrieval of the element need to be in different scopes.
