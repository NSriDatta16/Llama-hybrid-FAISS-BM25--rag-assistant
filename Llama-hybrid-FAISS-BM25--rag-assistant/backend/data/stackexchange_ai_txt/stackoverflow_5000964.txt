Quicksort- how pivot-choosing strategies affect the overall Big-oh behavior of quicksort?

I have came up with several strategies, but I am not entirely sure how they affect the overall behavior. I know the average case is O(NlogN), so I would assume that would be in the answer somewhere. I want to just put NlogN+1 for if I just select the 1st item in the array as the the pivot for the quicksort, but I don't know whether that is either correct nor acceptable? If anyone could enlighten me on this subject that would be great. Thanks! Possible Strategies: a) Array is random: pick the first item since that is the most cost effective choice. b) Array is mostly sorted: pick middle item so we are likely to compliment the binary recursion of splitting in half each time. c) Array is relatively large: pick first, middle and last indexes in array and compare them, picking the smallest to ensure we avoid worst case. d) Perform 'c' with randomly generated indexes to make selection less deterministic.
