You're on the right track. What you need is a history or revision id, and a document id. The history id would be the primary key, but you would also have a key on the document id for query purposes. With history tracking, you add a bit more complexity to your application. You have to be careful that the main view of the document is showing the current history revision (ie. largest history id for a given document id). As well, if you are storing large documents, every edit is essentially going to add another copy of the document to your database, and the table will quickly grow very large. You might want to consider implementing some kind of "diff" storage, where you store only the changes to the document and not the full thing, or keeping history edits in a separate table for history-searching only.
