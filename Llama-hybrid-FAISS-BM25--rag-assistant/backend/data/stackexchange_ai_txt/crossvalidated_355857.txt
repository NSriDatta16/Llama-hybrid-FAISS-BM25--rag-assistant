ARIMA model gives inaccurate predictions?

I am trying fit an ARIMA model for time series. The blue plot is the training set, orange is the test set, and red and green are 2 different ARIMA models. My prediction plots always look very compressed. Anyone know what might have caused this? This is the code I used to make the prediction: import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA X = series.values size = int(len(X) * 0.50) train, test = X[0:size], X[size:len(X)] history = [x for x in train] predictions = list() for t in range(len(test)): model = ARIMA(history, order=(5,1,0)) model_fit = model.fit(disp=0) output = model_fit.forecast() yhat = output[0] predictions.append(yhat) history.append(test[t]) Thanks in advance!
