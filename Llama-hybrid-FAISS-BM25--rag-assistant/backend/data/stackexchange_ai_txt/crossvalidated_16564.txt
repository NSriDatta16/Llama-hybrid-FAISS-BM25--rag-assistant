Hidden Markov model (forward algorithm) in R

I have studied some of these resources and I know that there is an R package called HMM . Could anybody explain the usefulness of the 'forward algorithm' with a simple example in R? Finally, I find a good book which is Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R (Chapman & Hall CRC Monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability) Walter Zucchini, Iain L. MacDonald
