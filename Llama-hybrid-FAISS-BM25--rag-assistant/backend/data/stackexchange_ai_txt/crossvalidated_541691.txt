What statistical test should I use to look for a significant change across a series of growth rings?

I am looking to identify when a significant change occurs across a series of growth rings (annuli) of fish pectoral fins. I am trying to identify when the annuli width decreases (state of maturity). I will have the widths of each growth ring (um) across the structure. After I determine state of maturity I want to compare the trace elemental compositions before and after. I have ablated a line to quantify 13 trace elemts across the fin ray from the core to the outer edge, ensuring a consistent and distinguishable signature corresponding with each growth band. I am considering using an interupted time series regression to compare before and after maturity. Does this sound like a good way to go? Third image shows
