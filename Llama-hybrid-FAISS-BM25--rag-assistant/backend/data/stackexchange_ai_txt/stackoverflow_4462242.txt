Preventing page lifecycle for one control

I'm using a file manager-type WebControl that does lots of postbacks. It's placed inside a Page that is relatively complex. I would like to prevent the WebControl from causing the whole Page to go through the lifecycle. An UpdatePanel helps a little, but not enough. Is there any way to isolate the WebControl from the rest of the Page ? The only way I can think of is sticking the WebControl in a separate Page and creating an iframe in the original Page . Unfortunately that also means my WebControl properties/settings are no longer in the original Page . If I want two instances of the WebControl with different settings, then I have to create a Page for each setting and reference the correct one in my iframes . Not quite as "drag & drop" as I would like. Any other suggestions?
