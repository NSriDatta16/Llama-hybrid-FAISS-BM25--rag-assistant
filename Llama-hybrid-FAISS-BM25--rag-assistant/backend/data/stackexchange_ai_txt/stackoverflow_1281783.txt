You said initially it will use FTP and move to other transfer methods later. I wouldn't get "elegant" until you actually need to add the second or third technology. That second transfer method may never be required. :-) If you want to do it as a "science project" then great. I am tired of seeing OO design patterns complicating solutions to problems that never arrive. Wrap the first transfer method in an uploadFile method. Add an if then else for the second method. Get elegant and refactor on the third method. By then you will have enough examples that your solution will probably be pretty generic. Of course, my main point is that the second and third methods may never be required.
