What are the possible ways to use binary data of different length as input for Neural Network?

I have a huge list of binary strings: [010101, 011111111, 0101111100011....]. The length of each string is different: from 1 to 10000 characters. The output of the Neural Network is simple: yes/no. Can you please suggest how to use these strings as input? Most examples use fixed-size input. Is there a way to use 1d Convolutional NN?
