Estimation of mean of ratio of empirical distributions

I am trying to estimate the mean of the ratio of two empirical count distributions $f(x)$ and $b(x)$ defined on the limited range $[-1, 1]$ $$ \left $$ $f(x)$ and $b(x)$ are measured in a counting experiment by filling unweighted histograms which then have Poisson uncertainties in each bin. To naively calculate the mean I can choose a binning for the histograms which is coarse enough that bins have enough counts to estimate the ratio and its uncertainty (e.g. more than zero counts in $b$) and calculate the ratio in each bin in $x$ and then average over the full $x$ range in the resulting ratio histogram. At the same time using a coarser binning means that I lose resolution when extracting the mean. Are there other possible ways to estimate this mean which allow me to avoid rebinning just to keep $b$ from ever being 0? Computing power isn't an issue so iterative approaches are perfectly fine.
