My favorite article on this topic is here: http://getsatisfaction.com/typekit/topics/typekit_fonts_rendering_horribly_on_windows_based_systems There is a lot of good discussion including TypeKit developers on the reasoning behind that, and it has a link to an interesting article about using JavaScript to detect whether font smoothing is in use (you definitely can't do it with CSS alone). http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2009/11/29/how-to-detect-font-smoothing-using-javascript/ Good luck.
