You're loading the .val() of a element ( $(this) , inside your handler for a TD). You need to get the id of the tag. If you really can't find the ID (or codeigniter doesn't set it.. impossible to tell from your example since form_dropdown() is creating it), then instead of $(this).val() you could try $('select',this).val() which will find the value of the first tag within the TD. Also in your debugging, {stat: $(this).val()} is an object, so of course that's what alert() shows you. Try using firebug, and then change alert() to console.log() -- the firebug console will show you the full object. You could also simply do alert($(this).val()) -- though realize of course that it will be wrong due to the first paragraph above.
