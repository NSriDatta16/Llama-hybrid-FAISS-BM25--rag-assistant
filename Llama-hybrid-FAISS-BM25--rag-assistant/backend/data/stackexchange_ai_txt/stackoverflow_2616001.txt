Storing Data from both POST variables and GET parameters

I want my python script to simultaneously accept POST variables and query string variables from the web address. The script has code : form = cgi.FieldStorage() print form However, this only captures the post variables and no query variables from the web address. Is there a way to do this? Thanks, Ali
