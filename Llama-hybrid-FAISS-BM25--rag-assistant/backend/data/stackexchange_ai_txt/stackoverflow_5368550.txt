There's a pretty good article here talking about the use of inheritance vs. composition in Java, including examples of when and why to use one over the other. There's also an interview here which discussed the subject (referencing the Gang of Four edict to "favor composition over inheritance"). It's a very broad and, at least for me, very interesting subject actually. A lot of beginner programmers get some inheritance going and start down a bad design path, not always learning how polymorphism works and what design patterns and techniques they can take advantage of to write better software. If you're an object-oriented programmer, you can never learn too much about polymorphism, interfaces, inheritance, composition, abstractions, etc.
