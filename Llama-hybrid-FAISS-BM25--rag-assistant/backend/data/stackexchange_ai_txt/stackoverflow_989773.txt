There's a few commercial packages that do this. I work for Quest Software, makers of one of the packages, but I'm going to list three because I've worked with all of 'em before I came to work for Quest: Microsoft Visual Studio Test Edition - it has load testing tools added on. It lets you design tests inside Visual Studio like simulating browsers hitting your web app. Recording the initial macros is kind of a pain, but when you've done it, it's easy to replay. It also has agents that you can deploy across multiple desktops to drive more load. For example, we installed it on several developers' desktops, and when we needed to do load testing after hours, we could throw a ton of computing power at the servers. The downside is that the setup and ongoing maintenance is kinda painful. HP Quality Center (used to be Mercury Test Director and some other software) - also has load testing tools, but it's designed from the ground up for testers. If your testers don't have Visual Studio experience, this is an easier choice. Quest Benchmark Factory - this tool focuses exclusively on the database server, not the web and app servers. It captures load on your production server and then can replay it on your dev/test servers, or it can generate synthetic transactions too. There's a freeware version you can use to get started. If you know and love Visual Studio, and if you want to test your web servers and app servers, then go with Visual Studio Test Edition. If you just want to focus on the database, then go with Benchmark Factory.
