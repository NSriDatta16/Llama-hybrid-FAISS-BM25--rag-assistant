As far as your SQL goes, don't use a string-munging function like mysql_real_escape_string that can still allow injections attacks to occur under some circumstances. Use parameterised queries, thus ensuring that the database treats all user-supplied string as data, under ALL circumstances, and not possibly as SQL code fragments. The MySQLi and PDO libraries in PHP both supports parameterised queries.
