where Xcode organizer stores devices list

Can any body tell me where xcode organizer saves the list of devices attached with it??? I need that urgently. I am unable to add device from provisioning portal and need to add device from xcode organizer but that needs the device. i currently don't have the device just have the UDID. I think i could add the device UDID in the xcode organizer list then i can add the device from the xcode organier to the program portal. Regards Abdul Samad
