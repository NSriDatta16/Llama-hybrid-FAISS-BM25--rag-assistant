When you say bootstrap Monte Carlo I assume you really meant bootstrap. Monte Carlo simulation is for when you know the true underlying (population) model. You did not state what types of model uncertainties pertain. You wrote more about parameter estimate uncertainty and didn't mention entertaining any other distributions, transformations, or predictors. Assuming you only need to deal with parameter (regression coefficient) uncertainty, all the mechanisms of standard regression modeling apply and your solution is easy with a little study of statistics. Get the prediction interval and a confidence interval (e.g. 0.95 confidence interval) for the prediction. Note this is a much wider interval for the usual one which is for estimating long-term averages ($E(Y|X)$). Confidence limits for individual $Y$ are dominated by the estimated residual variance of $Y|X$ but also contain a variance component describing the difficulty of estimating the regression parameters. It is only this component to converges to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Your comment about imputing missings is very hard to understand.
