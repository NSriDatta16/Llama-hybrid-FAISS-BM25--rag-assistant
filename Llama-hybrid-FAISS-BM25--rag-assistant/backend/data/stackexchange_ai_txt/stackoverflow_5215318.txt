It's a tough task because general beat-tracking (follow tempo changes) hasn't yet been figured out. There's at least one tool that does work though for matching an audio file to a midi file, assuming the audio file is almost identical to the midi file in terms of the score. But I can't remember it's named, never have used it. The place is to ask is the Music Information Retrieval community of scientists: http://listes.ircam.fr/wws/info/music-ir For manual mathcing, you can use modern DAW's like Logic, Pro Tools, etc, to help you with this by providing reasonably nice tools to build a detailed tempo-map of the audio file, and then the MIDI file would line right up with it, but it's a tedious task. You'll likely need tempo changes more often than every measure to get a nice alignment - it will be style-dependent.
