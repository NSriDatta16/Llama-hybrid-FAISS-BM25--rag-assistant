Is it possible for two independent variables to be correlated, by chance?

I'm reading Introduction to Probability, 2nd Edition by Tsitsiklis and Bertsekas. On page 218, they write "Thus, if X and Y are independent, they are also uncorrelated." Is it possible that there could be two variables where the value of one tends to increase as the value of the other increases, even if they come from totally unrelated and disconnected processes?
