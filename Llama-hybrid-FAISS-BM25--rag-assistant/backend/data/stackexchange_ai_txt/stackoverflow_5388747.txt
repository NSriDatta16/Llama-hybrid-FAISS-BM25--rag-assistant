At the end i solved in this way: I created a navigator viewer, which extend o.e.ui.navigator.viewer, and i provide a popupMenu specifying "allowPlatformContributions = false". Then i created as many insertionPoint as i need for my context menu. The actions i want eclipse to provide in the context menu are contained in group.new, group.edit, group.reorganize. The resulting xml is: ..... ... the other two group names, group.xvr.launch and group.xvr.management, are custom placeholder for my actions. then i extended o.e.ui.navigator.navigatorContent creating my custom content which i bind to the viewer. I added to the navigator content as many actionProvider as i need. In each one of them i override the method fillContextMenu to provide custom action to the context menu. @Override public void fillContextMenu(IMenuManager menu) { menu.appendToGroup("group.xvr.launch", new CommandContributionItem(new CommandContributionItemParameter(...))); menu.appendToGroup("group.xvr.launch", new CommandContributionItem(new CommandContributionItemParameter(...))); }
