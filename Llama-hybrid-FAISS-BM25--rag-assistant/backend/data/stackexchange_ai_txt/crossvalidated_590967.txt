RMSE loss tends to output the same prediction

When using MSE (or RMSE) loss for regression tasks in deep learning my models usually output the same result for each record. My guess is that the models are "playing safe" and they output a value towards the mean instead of learning anything. Does anyone have encountered this problem or knows how to solve it?
