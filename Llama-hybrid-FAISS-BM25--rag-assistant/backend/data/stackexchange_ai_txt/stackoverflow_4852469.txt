There's really no easy way (if any at all) to find that out, unfortunately. As SQL Server MVP Aaron Bertrand puts it in his excellent blog post When was my database / table last accessed? : A frequently asked question that surfaced again today is, "how do I see when my data has been accessed last?" SQL Server does not track this information for you . SELECT triggers still do not exist. Third party tools are expensive and can incur unexpected overhead. And people continue to be reluctant or unable to constrain table access via stored procedures, which could otherwise perform simple logging. Even in cases where all table access is via stored procedures, it can be quite cumbersome to modify all the stored procedures to perform logging. However, with the help of the sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats DMV (dynamic management views) function and some clever T-SQL programming by Aaron, you can find out a few of those answers - check out his very enlightening blog post for details ! However: since this information is based on a DMV and the "D" in DMV stands for dynamic , those values are only valid since the last server reboot and will be wiped out and not preserved when you next have to restart your SQL Server process / reboot your server machine.
