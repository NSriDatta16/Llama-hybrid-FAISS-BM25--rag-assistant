Interpretation is always part speculation, but I think the implied meaning is that often you can get the result you want without estimating the standard deviation explicitly. In other words, I think the author is referring to situations where you would use no estimate of the standard deviation, rather than a biased estimate. For instance, if you can construct an estimate of the whole distribution of a statistic, you can compute confidence intervals without using the standard deviation. In fact, for many (non-normal) distributions the standard deviation itself (and the mean) is not sufficient to compute an estimate of the confidence interval. In other cases, such as a sign test , you do not need an estimate for the standard deviation either. (Of course, it is non-trivial to construct an unbiased estimate of a full distribution, and in Bayesian statistics it is actually quite common to introduce bias explicitly through the prior.)
