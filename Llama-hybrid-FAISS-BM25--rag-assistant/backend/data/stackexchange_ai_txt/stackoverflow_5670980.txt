Batch upload of Blobs to Google App Engine

I'm currently migrating a site to Google App Engine. Previously, all the images and static resources (100s of MBs of the stuff) was just part of the deployment. Now, it's clear, I should use Blob Storage for this in GAE (otherwise updating the app will be mega-painful!). I need to batch upload these images from my disk to GAE and suspect I need some kind of script to do this. Any ideas or suggestions of the best approach?
