The only way you can allocate large objects on the stack is to have an old-style array involved at some point. For example: void f() { char a[1000000]; // big object on the stack } struct A { char c[1000000]; }; void g() { A a; // another big object on the stack } If you don't use arrays (and you shouldn't) then most things will be allocated for you on the heap: void h() { std::string s( 100000 ); } the above allocates a few bytes on the stack for pointers, size info etc. and then allocates the actual storage on the heap. So stop worrying! You are probably doing things right!
