How can I track mouse click and drag events in VB.NET?

First, I want to know if the mouse is in some area. Then, I want to check if the mouse holds the left click. I want to check as long as the left button is down, and I want to track the mouse's position. And finally, check when the left button is released. So, in short, where should I start for tracking mouse events in my form?
