I believe logging application activity and error/exception details is the most useful strategy to communicate technical details about problems on the customer side. You can add a feature to automatically mail you logs or let the customer do it manually. The question is, what exactly do you mean to test? Are you only interested in error-free operation or are you also concerned how the software is accepted at the customer side (usability)? For technical errors, write a log and manually test in different scenarios in different OS installations. If you could add unit tests, it could also help. But I suppose the issue is that it works on your machine but doesn't work somewhere else. You could also debug remotely by using IDE features like "Attach to remote process" etc. I'm not sure how to do it if you're not in the same office, likely you need to build a VPN. If it's about usability, organize workshops. New people will be working with your application, and you will be video and audio recording them. Then analyze the problems they encountered in a team "after-flight" sessions. Talk to users, ask what they didn't like and act on it. Theoretically, you could also built this activity logging into the application. You'll need to have a clear idea though what to log and how to interpret the data.
