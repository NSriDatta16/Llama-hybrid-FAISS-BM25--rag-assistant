I would argue that there is a flaw in the database design if you have two very different types of values (a year and version number) stored in the same column and the logic by which something should and should not appear in a given column is a little hazy, however, there is a means to get the result you want in a single row presuming that the odd storage is consistent. Select NK , Min( Case When DC = 10 Then GEV End ) As [10] , Min( Case When DC = 11 Then GEV End ) As [11] , Min( Case When DC = 12 Then GEV End ) As [12] , Min( Case When DC = 18 And Version = 2006 Then GEV End ) As [2006] , Min( Case When DC = 18 And Version = 2007 Then GEV End ) As [2007] , Min( Case When DC = 18 And Version = 2008 Then GEV End ) As [2008] , Min( Case When DC = 18 And Version = 2009 Then GEV End ) As [2009] From Multipivot Group By NK
