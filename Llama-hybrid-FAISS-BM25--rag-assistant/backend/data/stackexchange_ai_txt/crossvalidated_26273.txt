I would probably opt for McNemar's test if you only train the classifiers once. David Barber also suggests a rather neat Bayesian test that seems rather elegant to me, but isn't widely used (it is also mentioned in his book ). Just to add, as Peter Flom says, the answer is almost certainly "yes" just by looking at the difference in performance and the size of the sample (I take the figures quoted are test set performance rather than training set performance). Incidentally Japkowicz and Shah have a recent book out on "Evaluating Learning Algorithms: A Classification Perspective" , I haven't read it, but it looks like a useful reference for these sorts of issues.
