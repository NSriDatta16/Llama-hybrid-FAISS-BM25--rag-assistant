Can we build a Naive Bayes model in the presence of multicollinearity?

There exists multi-collinearity in the model. As a result(may be) the accuracy of Naive Bayes model is less than logistic regression model(model is built with the help of PCA). So, is there any method to build Naive Bayes model in the presence of multi-collinearity?
