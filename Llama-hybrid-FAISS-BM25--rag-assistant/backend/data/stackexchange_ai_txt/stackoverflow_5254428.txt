WP7 - Measuring performance improvements

I'd like to try and improve the performance of my app for certain tasks. There are a few ideas I'd like to try out but I'm not sure how I can quantitatively measure 'before' and 'after' performance. What is the best way to do this on WP7? It would be nice if I could do this both on the emulator and a device. Thanks for your help, Ashish EDIT: I am mainly concerned with page load times. The app reads an XML file from isolated storage and populates a ListBox . Currently I'm using XDocument and LINQ to read the entire file before populating the ListBox . I'd like to switch to using XmlReader and adding items as they are read. Ideally, the reading would happen in a separate thread, and I'd add the items one at a time (or maybe a handful at a time if that has better performance) to the ObservableCollection that the ListBox is bound to. Thanks for the answers so far, I'll look into both the profiler and high resolution counter to time the operations.
