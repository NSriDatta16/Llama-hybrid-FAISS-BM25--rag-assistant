I wrote a function for Mixed Logistic Random Forest for Binary Data . The usage is demonstrated with an example within the link. The prediction function is also available. Following Hajjem's generalized mixed effects regression trees (GMERT), I used an EM-like algorithm and penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation. The random forest part uses cforest() in the party package since it allows case weights. The linearized mixed models are estimated with the lme4 package. So there are many possible options.
