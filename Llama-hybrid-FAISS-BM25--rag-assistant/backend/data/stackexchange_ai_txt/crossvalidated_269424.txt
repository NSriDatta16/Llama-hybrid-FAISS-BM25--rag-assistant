qqnorm looks at the standardized residuals for a linear model. The unconditional $Y$ can have a highly non-normal distribution depending on how your $X$ is distributed, but still meet all the assumptions for exact finite sample inference. As a note you cannot call qqnorm directly on a lm object, there is no method implemented for it. However, if you use the plot method on a fit object, one of the graphics you get is this QQ_normal plot. Specifically the help file says: The ‘S-L’, the Q-Q, and the Residual-Leverage plot, use standardized residuals which have identical variance (under the hypothesis). They are given as R[i] / (s * sqrt(1 - h.ii)) where h.ii are the diagonal entries of the hat matrix, influence()$hat (see also hat), and where the Residual-Leverage plot uses standardized Pearson residuals (residuals.glm(type = "pearson")) for R[i].
