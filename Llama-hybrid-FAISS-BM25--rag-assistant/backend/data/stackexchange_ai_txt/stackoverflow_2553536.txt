How to escape the character entities in XML?

I want to pass XML as a string in an XML attribute. Here the "evt" attribute is the XML string, so escaping all the less-than, greater-than, etc characters by the appropriate character entities works fine. The problem is I want a fragment to be interpreted as is - the character entities themselves should be treated as simple strings. When the "evt" attribute is read and an XML is generated from it, it should look like &lt;polyline penWidth=&quot;2&quot; points=&quot;256,435 257,432 &quot;/&gt; Essentially, I want to escape the character entities. How is this possible?
