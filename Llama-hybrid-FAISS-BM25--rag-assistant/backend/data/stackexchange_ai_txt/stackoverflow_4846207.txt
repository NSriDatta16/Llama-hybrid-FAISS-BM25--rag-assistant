JNLP generated from PHP fails

I have a very odd problem. I have a JNLP file that works just fine when a property is hand-edited: But when the same property is generated from php with a real value like this: It shows up as empty at runtime. I've examined the jnlp file in Xcode to look for control characters but Xcode show none. Any help is appreciated.
