Regression vs. classification and generative vs. discriminative

I recently touch the idea of Generative adversarial networks , which is a competition between a generative network and a discriminative network. This idea makes me think of replacing the word " network " into a general machine learning model or algorithm. One thing comes to my mind is the difference between regression and classification , which seems to me that it is comparable to the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model. I know there are many clarification questions asked on this site such as: Why not approach classification through regression? So this question is merely asking for confirmation or clarification of the idea: Is it legitimate to say that regression is a data generative task and classification is a data discriminative task ?
