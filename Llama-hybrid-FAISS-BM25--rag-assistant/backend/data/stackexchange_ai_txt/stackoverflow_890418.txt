I suspect its a problem with Flash. If I go to your example page ( http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/demos/sifr-encode/ ), right-click on the Flash movie, and copy to the clipboard, this is the output: This is an embedding test: ÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþÿ Did it work? Which to me indicates that the characters are ending up just fine in the Flash movie, but they're not being rendered. Can Flash render these characters if you use static publishing for some other Flash movie?
