Fast page retrieval in MySQL, index usage?

I would like to speed a MySQL query that basically retrieve a page of data following the pattern below select my_field_A, my_field_B where time_id >= UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1901-01-01 00:00:00') AND time_id The field time_id is an MySQL index, yet, the query behaves as if the entire database was read at each query (retrieving a couple of lines being already quite slow). I not an expert in MySQL. Can someone guess what I am doing wrong?
