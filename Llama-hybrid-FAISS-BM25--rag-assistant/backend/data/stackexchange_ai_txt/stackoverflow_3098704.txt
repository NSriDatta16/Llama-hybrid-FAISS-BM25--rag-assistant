How can I create a floating toolbar for an iPhone/iPad app?

I'm working on a bitmap editor app for the iPad/iPhone and I'd like to have a floating toolbar that the user can move around the drawing canvas so it doesn't get in the way of the drawing surface. I'd use a standard UIToolbar, but I'd like the toolbar to have a zoom navigation view, which wouldn't fit elegantly in a standard UIToolbar. At a high level, how could I build a floating toolbar? Is there a standard iPhone UI control for creating a floating toolbar? I didn't see anything in the UI Guidelines, but is this kind of custom control frowned upon by the App store? Thanks so much in advance for your help!
