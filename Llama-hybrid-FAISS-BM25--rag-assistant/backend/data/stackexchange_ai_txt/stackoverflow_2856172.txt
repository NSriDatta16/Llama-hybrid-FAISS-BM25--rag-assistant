IE can't handle draggable div with png's?

I'm creating a draggable/resizable menu with all the neccesary links to control the website, a CMS-bar kind of. I'm using some png's to create the background, set with some transparency. It works great in FF, but in IE my png's get transformed after I drag my menu around: Screenshots: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v739/Alienna/falcon/drag.png Also, that big empty space? That's a log-out button(div with background-image and a-element), of wich only the :hover status seems to work, and only before dragging ... Any fixes for this? I thought IE's png problems were gone after IE6(tested this ie IE7/8) ...
