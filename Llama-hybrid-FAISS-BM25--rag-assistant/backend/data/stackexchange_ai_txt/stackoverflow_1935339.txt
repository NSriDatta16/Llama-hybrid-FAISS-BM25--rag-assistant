If you have unit tests but you're not happy that they cover the areas you're going to be refactoring, you can find out using code coverage analysis tools. If you find gaps, you can create and double-check tests to fill the gaps, then proceed with your refactoring fairly happy that your (updated) unit tests cover the ground thoroughly -- which is good for the project in the long term as well.
