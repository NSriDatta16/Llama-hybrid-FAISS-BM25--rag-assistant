As Mehrdad stated, you cannot downcast an object. Upcasting is implicit, therefore you cannot overwrite it. As for the implicit operator, you can still create a constructor in the derived class which receives a parameter of type baseclass. If you need to cast freely, define the variable as baseclass, but instantiate derived classes.
