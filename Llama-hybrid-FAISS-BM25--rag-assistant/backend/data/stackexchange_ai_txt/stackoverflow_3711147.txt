magento checkout: change shipping price

Scenario: Change shipping price using variable parsed by design during checkout. I need to change the final shipping price using some variables sent by phtml checkout. Eg. Shipping method 1: cost 33$ Shipping method 2: cost 23$ Shipping method 3: cost 10$ special packaging checkbox (y/n) + 10$ (set it as yes for this example) assicuration: I've inserted manually this checkbox, just in design but I need to increment final price and add a simple label that include this on shipment total should be shipment total 20$
