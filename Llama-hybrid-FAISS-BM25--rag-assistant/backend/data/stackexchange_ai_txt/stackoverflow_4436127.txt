You could update the response buffer with a progress, flushing your response buffer periodically from the server. But you may have trouble reading a request before it's complete via xhttpr . You might be able to make your request via an iframe, and have that load in progress via 'http streaming'. But even that can be sketchy. HTTP is not the meant to transfer things piecemeal/fragmented. Like others point out, it would be best to make a separate subsequent calls to get the status of the operation.
