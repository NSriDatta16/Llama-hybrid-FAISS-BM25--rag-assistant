interpreting string of commands

say you have to interpret a sting of command arguments like AABBCDEEFF... and the idea is that each character represents a command for which you have to take some actions on the class, the ugly solution is to write a big switch-case but i dont want to use that , can anybody suggest a more elegant solution ??
