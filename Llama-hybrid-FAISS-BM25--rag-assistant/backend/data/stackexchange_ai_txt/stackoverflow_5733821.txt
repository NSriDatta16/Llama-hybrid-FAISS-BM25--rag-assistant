Yes use an assemblies folder off of the trunk. I like the name lib better then assemblies. Yes the path is already relative. When you branch your projects will get the correct assemblies folder. Depending on how many third party assemblies you are using you make also want to organize your assemblies folder so it is not one big mess of dlls.
