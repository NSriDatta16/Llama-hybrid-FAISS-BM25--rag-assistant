abusing ragel, possibly need new approach / tool

I'm trying to use Ragel to implement a simple yes/no fsm. Unfortunately the language specification consists of the union of about a thousand regular expressions, with * operators appearing once or more in the majority of them. So, the number of possible states explodes and it seems it will be impossible to use Ragel to generate an fsm for my language. Is there a tool out there that can do what I need, or should I swap approaches? I need something better than checking input strings against each regular expression in turn. I could chop up the thousand regular expressions into chunks of ~50 and generate an fsm for each, and run every input string against all the machines, but if there's a tool that can handle this kind of job without such a hack I'd be pleased to hear of it. Thanks!
