This perhaps should be a function for maths SE (I've voted to close it as belonging there in fact), but if you assume the functions are defined by the values you have and some interpolation between them, so for instance $$f_1(x) = \begin{cases} f_1(x_1) + \frac{(x - x_1)\left(f_1(x_2) - f_1(x_1)\right)}{x_2 - x_1} &x\in [x_1,x_2)\\ \cdots\\ f_1(x_{n-1}) + \frac{(x - x_{n-1})\left(f_1(x_n) - f_1(x_{n-1})\right)}{x_n - x_{n-1}} & x\in [x_{n-1},x_n] \end{cases} $$ & so on. (Note $f_i(x)$ defined like this is not everywhere differentiable, but that's fine: wer're not going to differentiate it.) Then you can treat them as vectors in a function space with inner product $$\langle f_i, f_j\rangle = \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_n} \overline{f_i(x)} f_j(x)\,dx$$ This gives you a distance measure between $f_i$ & $f_j$ as $\langle f_i - f_j, f_i - f_j\rangle$. Look up functional analysis, Hilbert spaces and specifically $L^p$ spaces (I think the space you care about is $L^2$ -- the space of square-integrable functions.
