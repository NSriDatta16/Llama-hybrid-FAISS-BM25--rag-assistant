I'm experiencing the same problem but hadn't tried manually copying over the files and hacking the registry although I've heard from other as well that they have also had success doing so. In order to get a more real solution for this I've created a feature request on the Connect.Microsoft.com site to implement some type of minimal install of Visual Studio in order to provide for an easier way to set up a Build Server with the necessary development files. Please vote and/or comment on the feature request to help bring attention to this issue.
