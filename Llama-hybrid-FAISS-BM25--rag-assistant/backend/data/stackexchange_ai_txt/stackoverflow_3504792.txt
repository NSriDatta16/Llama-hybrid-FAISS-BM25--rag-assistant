Need help with .Net SOLID design

I'm trying to stick fast to Robert Martin's SOLID design principles for the first time, and I am not good at it. In essence, I need a hierarchy of "Node" objects. Some nodes are NodeHosts, some are NodeChildren and some are Both. Everybody's done this one before, but I can't figure out how to do it SOLID without over-complicating the design or doing something like this in the node subtypes: INodeHostType node; public INodeType NodeType { .... set { node = (INodeHostType)value; } } This violates Liskov Substitution Principle right? What's a better way? Here's what I have now.
