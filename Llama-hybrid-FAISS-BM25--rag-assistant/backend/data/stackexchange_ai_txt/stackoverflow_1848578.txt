First of all, use appropriate caching headers for generated CSS and also use ETag header to re-validate CSS source when client asks for it. You must implement some fast ETag calculation algorithm, for example increment version field each time users changes some setting and return its value as ETag. In this scenario you may choose not to "generate the css as they make changes and just store it" but "regenerate it for each page view", because actually CSS will be stored in user agent cache and even when user presses F5 ETag will be used to ensure that CSS on client side is still valid. Of course, CSS must be returned by some http handler (usercss.ashx or something like this). When including link to this CSS into HTML page, make sure to add some parameter to work around cached content issues, for example ` From my own experience I'd recommend you to use handler to serve user CSS as separate resource and do not embed it into HTML page each time it is generated, because in last case you must either recalculate CSS every time page is generated or somehow cache it on the server, both cases are rather bad ideas. Besides, this CSS may be rather large, there is no reason to download it on every request.
