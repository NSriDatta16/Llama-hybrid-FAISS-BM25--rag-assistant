As long as you download the data in chunks of some smaller size then the actual volume of the total file won't matter and it won't really matter what you use to do the downloading. For example, for a file of that size I would just use the WebClient class and download chucks of maybe 1 or 2 Mb at a time to a temporary storage file on disk. You'll have to keep track of how much you've got downloaded and where you need to start the next chuck from, but that isn't overly difficult a problem. You can use sockets but then you have to communicate with the web server yourself to get access to the file in the first place. When a client connects to download the next chunk, that is where you would enforce your business logic concerning the number of concurrent users. There might be a library you can use to do all this but to be honest it's not a complex problem.
