Is it possible to get fitted values 0 or 1 in logistic regression when the fitting algorithm converges?

We have comprehensive coverage on the topic of perfect separation in logistic regression. When it happens in R we usually see two warnings: Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred Is it possible that the algorithm did converge and fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred nonetheless?
