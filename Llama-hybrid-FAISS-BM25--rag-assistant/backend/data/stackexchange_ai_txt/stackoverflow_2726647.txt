A very elegant way (since Python 2.5) is to use defaultdict from the "collections" module: >>> from collections import defaultdict >>> h = defaultdict(list) >>> h['a'].append('b') >>> h defaultdict( , {'a': ['b']}) defaultdict is like a dict, but provides a default value using whichever constructor you passed to it when you created it (in this example, a list). I particularly like this over the setdefault dict method, because 1) you define the variable as a defaultdict, and generally no other changes are required on the code (except perhaps to remove previous kludges for default values); and 2) setdefault is a terrible name :P
