3 and 4 is correct for the reasons you mentioned. However, your interpretation of the p-value is not correct. It is very loosely linked to the probability of H0. See the wikipedia article on p-value. In statistical hypothesis testing the p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. And from Hubbard, R.; Lindsay, R. M. (article in citations on the wiki): Using a Bayesian significance test for a normal mean, James Berger and Thomas Sellke (1987, pp. 112â€“113) showed that for p values of .05, .01, and .001, respectively, the posterior probabilities of the null, Pr(H0 | x), for n = 50 are .52, .22, and .034. For n = 100 the corresponding figures are .60, .27, and .045. Clearly these discrepancies between p and Pr(H0 | x) are pronounced, and cast serious doubt on the use of p values as reasonable measures of evidence. In fact, Berger and Sellke (1987) demonstrated that data yielding a p value of .05 in testing a normal mean nevertheless resulted in a posterior probability of the null hypothesis of at least .30 for any objective (symmetric priors with equal prior weight given to H0 and HA ) prior distribution.
