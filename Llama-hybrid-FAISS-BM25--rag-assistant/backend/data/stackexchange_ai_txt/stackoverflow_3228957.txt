Want to embed a font but cannot convert from Font Suitcase or PostScript Type 1 files

I am using FontSquirrel font generator to try to generate the embedded font files so that I can use the @font-face in css to embed for a Website. However, the font files I have (on Mac) are as follows and are greyed out and it is not possible to select them to convert on FontSquirrel or other converters (i.e. they don't seem to be a raw file type I can use to embed): PostScript Type 1 Outline Font Font Suitcase Can I somehow convert these to .otf or .ttf or does anyone know of another embedding method. Thanks!
