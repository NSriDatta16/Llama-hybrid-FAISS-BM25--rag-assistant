Step 1 is to select only unique times: SELECT DISTINCT _TimeStamp FROM table WHERE _TimeStamp >= '20091220 11:59:56.1' AND _TimeStamp Then, if you want to, say, compare all times with each other (not sure how you want to select times), you could do something crazy like: SELECT t1._TimeStamp, t2._TimeStamp, DATEDIFF(ms,t1._TimeStamp,t2._TimeStamp) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT _TimeStamp FROM table WHERE _TimeStamp >= '20091220 11:59:56.1' AND _TimeStamp = '20091220 11:59:56.1' AND _TimeStamp My syntax might be off, because I'm coming from MySQL, but something similar should work. If you want the average, you could try taking the average of the above results: SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(ms,t1._TimeStamp,t2._TimeStamp)) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT _TimeStamp FROM table WHERE _TimeStamp >= '20091220 11:59:56.1' AND _TimeStamp = '20091220 11:59:56.1' AND _TimeStamp Still untested, but in theory, I think it should work.
