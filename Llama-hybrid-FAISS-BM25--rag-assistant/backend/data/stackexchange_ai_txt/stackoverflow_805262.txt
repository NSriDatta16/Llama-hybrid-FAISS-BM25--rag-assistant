MySQL and PHP are very scalable if that is what you're asking. But whether a server can support 2000 concurrent users or not largely depends on the hardware. Additionally, a poorly written application in any language can significantly increase the load on the server.

Unless you have severe hardware restrictions and absolutely need to squeeze every ounce of performance out of your server, it doesn't really make sense to choose one over the other for this reason. All of the major RDBMS and scripting languages have reasonable performance and scale quite well. You'll find all of them being used in organizations, and on applications, of all sizes.
