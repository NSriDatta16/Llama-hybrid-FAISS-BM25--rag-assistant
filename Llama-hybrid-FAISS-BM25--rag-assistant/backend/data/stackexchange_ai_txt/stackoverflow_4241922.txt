The font used to print PDFs probably doesn't support the characters you want. Take a look in the following two files: Mage/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/Abstract.php Mage/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/Items/Abstract.php Try extending those classes and replacing any references to /lib/LinLibertineFont/LinLibertineC_Re-2.8.0.ttf with a font that supports your full character set. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
