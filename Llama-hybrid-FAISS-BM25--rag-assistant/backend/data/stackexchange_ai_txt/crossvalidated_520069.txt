Probably a chi-squared test of homogeneity, using the following table: In R, it might have been as shown. x1 = c(29, 2, 72); x2 = c(110, 4, 92) TBL= rbind(x1, x2); TBL [,1] [,2] [,3] x1 29 2 72 x2 110 4 92 chisq.test(TBL) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL X-squared = 17.971, df = 2, p-value = 0.0001252 Warning message: In chisq.test(TBL) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect The warning message calls attention to the very small counts in the second column, which may mean that the 'chi-squared' statistic does not have an approximate chi-squared distribution, possibly making the P-value unreliable. Addendum, per Comment: Showing table of expected counts for this chi-squared test. Chi-squared statistic (sum of six 'contributions') is $\sum_i\sum_j\frac{(X_{ij}- E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}},$ where $X_{ij}$ are in data TBL and $E_{ij}$ are displayed using $ -notation as below: chisq.test(TBL)$exp [,1] [,2] [,3] x1 46.33333 2 54.66667 x2 92.66667 4 109.33333 Warning message: # as above In R, it is possible to obtain a more reliable P-value by simulation, as demonstrated below: chisq.test(TBL, sim=T) Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 2000 replicates) data: TBL X-squared = 17.971, df = NA, p-value = 0.0004998 Another possible path, given the error message, would be to use Fisher's exact test, as extended to a $2\times 3$ table. [The original Fisher test was only for $2\times 2$ tables.] fisher.test(TBL) Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: TBL p-value = 4.758e-05 alternative hypothesis: two.sided By any reasonable test, it seems clear that the the two researchers are using different instruments or methods.
