I hope someone comes up with something more elegant that this, but this is what I have so far. It is not 100% XAML, but it is at least generic. This example shows a window with two buttons and two text boxes. The down arrow cycles the focus between them. I hope this helps. Tester Tester2 The event handler (no error handling at all): private void CommandBinding_Executed(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e) { UIElement senderElement = sender as UIElement; UIElement focusedElement = FocusManager.GetFocusedElement(senderElement) as UIElement; bool result = focusedElement.MoveFocus(new TraversalRequest(FocusNavigationDirection.Next)); Debug.WriteLine(result); }
