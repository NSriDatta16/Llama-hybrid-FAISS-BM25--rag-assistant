Your problem is most likely overfitting - it is typical when you use small datasets with large number of dimensions. In case of LDA what usually happens that the covariance matrix is biased because of the small sample. In order to avoid it you may try to use regularization. One useful technique is to sphere covariance matrix by adding small terms to the diagonal (also called shrinkage). In this case there is no need to use PCA. You can read about the technique in this paper on single trial EEG analysis .
