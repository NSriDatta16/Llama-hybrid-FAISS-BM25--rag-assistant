As a commercial alternative, see the ready-to-use ShellAppBar component for WPF which supports all cases and secnarios such as taskbar docked to left,right,top,bottom edge, support for multiple monitors, drag-docking, autohide , etc etc. It may save you time and money over trying to handle all these cases yourself. DISCLAIMER : I work for LogicNP Software, the developer of ShellAppBar.
