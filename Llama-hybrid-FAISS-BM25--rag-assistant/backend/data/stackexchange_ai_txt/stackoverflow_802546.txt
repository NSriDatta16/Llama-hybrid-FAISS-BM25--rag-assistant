I think each class should be organized by what it does, and not what variables it will use. I would recommend making each class have a single purpose (single responsibility principle). Instead of breaking things up based on their usage of variables separate classes based on their responsibility or purpose. In my opinion writing clean code is not only how good the code looks, but how easily it is to read. Code should be grouped logically and have consistent style. Keep in mind some classes are not going to use all variables. In java you have mutator and accessor methods. These methods are used to get or set a single variable. Example: public class Rectangle { private int lenght = 0; private int width = 0; public Rectangle (int length, width) { this.length = length; this.width = width; } public int getLength(int length) { return length; } public int getWidth(int width) { return wdith; } public void setLength(int length) { this.length = length; } public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; } } I would not break this class into a RectangleLength and RectangleWidth class. These methods serve a single responsibility and that is to represent a rectangle. If this class contained mathmatical functions you might want to break that out into a RectangleGeometry class.
