Something you might want to consider is this. When sorting strings, assuming good optimized algorithms, you don't have to analyze the entire string to find out which string comes first. Consider the two strings F3294r02343232423 B3920490234324234 You only have to analyze the first character of each before you know that the second string should come first. I'm not sure how much this comes into play with your specific data set, but it's something you should think about. As a test, you may want to create a copy of your table with the exact same data and indexes, but truncate the field you are sorting on to 20 characters, and see if there is any noticeable increase in speed due to the smaller amount of data. If there is a significant performance increase, you may want to go with what Robert wrote, and create a second column with the data already truncated so you don't have to use the substring function.
