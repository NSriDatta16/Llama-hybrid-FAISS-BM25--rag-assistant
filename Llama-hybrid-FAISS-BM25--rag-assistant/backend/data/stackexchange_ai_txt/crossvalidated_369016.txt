Random forest for tensors

Say we have have input tensor $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N \times P}$ and output tensor $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N \times K}$ , and we aim to build a Random Forests model $Y = f(X)+ \epsilon$ . Fixing $T=1$ gives the multivariate Random forests, which is already implemented in sklearn's version of Random Forests. But $T>1$ is more complicated. I guess you could run a multivariate Random Forests on for each $t \in 1,\ldots,T$ . However, I have neither seen any theory nor codes for tensor Random Forests. Therefore, is it currently possible to run Random Forests on Tensors/Multidimensional arrays? Would appreciate some article references if it is possible.
