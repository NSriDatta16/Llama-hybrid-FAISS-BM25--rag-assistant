Silverlight avoid lose focus on datagrid

How could I keep the focus on a combobox of a cell inside a datagrid in edit mode; even when I drag a textbox inside a scroll viewer to drag & drop. This is the behaviour I need: The user start to edit a cell by double clicking, and a combobox is showed, then the user could drag and drop some text (one of the texboxes inside the scroll viewer) to the combobox I mentioned. The issue is: when I click on one those textboxes to drag & drop, I lose the focus of the datagrid, and I can't drop it to the cell (the combobox), because I lose the edit mode (it's not a combobox anymore, the datagrid is on query mode). How can I achieve the behaviour I need? Please help. Thanks.
