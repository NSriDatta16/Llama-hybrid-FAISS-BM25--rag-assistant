Is there any difference between estimating $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma$ in a simulation study?

In a simulation study, is there any difference between $\bullet$ estimating the variance $\sigma^2$, $1000$ times and taking its average, and $\bullet$ estimating the standard deviation $\sigma$, $1000$ times and taking its average? Can I do anyone of these? Is there any preference of doing a particular one?
