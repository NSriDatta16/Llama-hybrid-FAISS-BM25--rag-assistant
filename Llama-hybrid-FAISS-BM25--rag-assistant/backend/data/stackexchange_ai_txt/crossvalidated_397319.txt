Is it legitimate to use PCA on scale totals (rather than individual questions) to uncover latent variables (Social Science/Psychology)?

I believe a latent self-control variable may be at the root of plenty of the variation I see in my dependent variable. However, I am using a secondary dataset and do not have access to individual questionnaire scores - all I have is a number of related total scale scores. Can I carry out PCA on these? The total scale scores are for each of the big five personality traits, the scales within the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, among some other standardised psychological questionnaires. I want to include about 15 of these in the factor analysis. Each participant has completed all of the questionnaires.
