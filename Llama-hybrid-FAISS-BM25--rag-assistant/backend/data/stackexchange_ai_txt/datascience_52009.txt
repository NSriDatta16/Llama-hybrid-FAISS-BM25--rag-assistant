There is something called the 80/20 rule in data science. It comes from surveys that have shown that data scientist usually spend 80% on gather and cleaning data and only 20% on actually using it to build models and the rest. No one can tell you how long each step is going to take since it depends on your case. But I can tell you that 1 week / 2.5 months differs a lot from 80/20 and I think you should consider re-calibrating those two, but only you know the facts. You can read more in this survey: CrowdFlower Data Science Report 2016 - check the section called "How a Data Scientist Spends Their Day"
