sampling from an unknown bivariate distribution

I want to generate samples from a bivariate distribution whose joint PDF doesn't resemble any known distribution. I have two events A and B where B depends on A. I have empirical observations of the marginals and the joint distributions. I know the sample correlation matrix and the covariance matrix. Say A looks roughly Poisson and B looks roughly bimodal (some Beta distribution). What's the best approach? 1) Generate random samples from a Poisson and a Beta then use a copula to transform these so that original sample covariance is maintained 2) Use MCMC to find the MLE parameters of a the Beta given the values of the observed values of the Poisson, then randomly sample from the Poisson and find the maximum likely value of the Beta given its optimal parameters.
