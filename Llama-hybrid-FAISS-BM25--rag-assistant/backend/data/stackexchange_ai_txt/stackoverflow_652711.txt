Well, lots of them. Consider, eg, σ. Square root of the variance, which is computed from the average and the data point, repeatedly. At point X i , you have an estimated variance for all the points up to this one; then add (x-μ)² to that for the next estimate. There's a nice section on that in wikipedia . What you're looking for, in general, is called "on line methods for calculation".
