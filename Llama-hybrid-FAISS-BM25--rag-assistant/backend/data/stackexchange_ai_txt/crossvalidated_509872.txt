This is too coarse. A classification algorithm maps an input to a discrete category prediction, or a predicted probability distribution over discrete categories. I can think of at least three other common uses of deep learning models: Regression models map inputs to continuous predictions, like stock prices or temperature. Generative models define a probability density over potential inputs, and can be used to generate e.g. simulated images. Examples include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders(VAEs). Embedding models map inputs to vectors so that inputs for similar vectors are near to each other. Examples include BERT with fine-tuning, where BERT is pre-trained on a huge corpus of natural language and then "frozen" so it can be used to provide vector representations for subsequent language tasks. Also, I question the framing of Deep Learning vs Machine Learning, since Deep Learning methods are a subset of Machine Learning methods.
