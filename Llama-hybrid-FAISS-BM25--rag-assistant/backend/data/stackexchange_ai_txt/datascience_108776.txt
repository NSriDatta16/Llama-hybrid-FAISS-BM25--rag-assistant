Anomaly detection for varying dictionary

I want to detect the anomaly in the processes taking up the most CPU percent. I receive the data as a time series of dictionary values like so: time process_most_cpu cpu% 0 2022-02-22 21:04:57.021740 {'chromium-browse': 38.70,'python': 32.00,'mutter': 2.90,'python3': 1.60} 26.10 1 2022-02-22 21:05:32.836466 {'chromium-browse': 25.70,'mutter': 2.90,'python3': 1.60} 34.50 2 2022-02-22 21:05:55.558390 {'chromium-browse': 21.70,'python': 5.80,'mutter': 2.90,'python3': 1.50} 5.70 3 2022-02-22 21:07:01.069036 {'pip': 37.90,'chromium-browse': 19.30,'mutter': 2.90,'python3': 1.50} 11.70 I'm not sure how to detect the anomaly here as the processes keep on changing. Feature extraction methods such as one-hot encoding don't seem to work in this particular case due to the varying dictionary keys. Any advice would be very much appreciated!
