As a generalisation, word is pretty awful for technical documents. Because it works very poorly for large, structured documents it encourages a proliferation of small documents with no cross-referencing between documents. Scale this up to any significant size and you will have trouble finding which documents pertain to an issue you are trying to investigate. As time goes on you will find people wasting more and more time hunting through a jumble of word documents, spreadsheets, visio diagrams and even powerpoint presentaions to find information that may or may not be recorded. Putting them into sharepoint just forces you to route your searching through a browser. Any technical documentation tool must support cross-referencing between documents to avoid losing those references. A wiki achieves this far better than word ever will. Also, it is much easier to incorported generated content such as data dictionaries or API docs into a wiki, and you can make the XRef targets stable.
