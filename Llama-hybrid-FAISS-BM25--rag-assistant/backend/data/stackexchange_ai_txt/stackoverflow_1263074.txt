How do I reduce the vertical space between list items in an unordered list?

I've got a very simple html unordered list: First Second The problem is that the default styling for such a list in firefox leaves a lot of space between each list item - about the same as between paragraphs in a tag. My google-fu is proving uncharacteristically useless today - how do I reduce that vertical space? I assume there's a css element I can apply to the tag, but I can't seem to find anything. (This is going in the side navigation element of a page so it needs to be as compact as possible.)
