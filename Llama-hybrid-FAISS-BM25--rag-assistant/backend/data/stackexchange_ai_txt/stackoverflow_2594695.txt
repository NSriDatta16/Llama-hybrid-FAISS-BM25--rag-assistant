how to use control-cache headers?

I downloaded Google speed tracer for Google chrome to see how my site does performance wise and it tells me I need to enable caching for certain files like my style.css, images, etc. I've read that the below php code should tell browsers to cache html content. I wrote a quick php page with a couple of images on it and stuck the below code at the top (before the headers are sent) to test to see how it worked. Header("Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate"); When I go back to speed tracer's analysis it says... Summary From Cache: false Request Headers Pragma: no cache Cache-Control: max-age=0 but under Response Headers ... Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate (exactly what I specified) I'm a little confused, what's going on...? When it says from cache: false does that mean from the server cache and not the client's cache?
