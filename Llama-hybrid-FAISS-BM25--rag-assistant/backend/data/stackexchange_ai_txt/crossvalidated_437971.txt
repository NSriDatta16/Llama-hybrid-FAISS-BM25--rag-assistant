Chart indicates homoscedasticity but Breusch-Pagan test p<.001

I am writing my master's thesis and doing multiple regression analysis for hypotheses testing. I transformed the data using ln and use a sample with N = 15,000. As a result of the assumption test, I got the following scatterplot. The scatter plot with standardized residual against studentized value is typical for homoscedasticity of residuals which is a triangular shape. However, a Breusch-Pagan test shows a significance of 0.000 and thus rejects the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. According to the test, it is heteroscedastic. Should I still assume homoscedasticity and therefore interpret the results using robust standard errors and the HC3 method? I am using SPSS.
