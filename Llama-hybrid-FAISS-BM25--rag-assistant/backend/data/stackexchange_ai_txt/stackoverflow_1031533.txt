The quick and dirty way is to change the checkout.xml layout file. open frontend/default/default/layout/checkout.xml find the line that says ............................ and change reference name to left,top,root,content etc... This determines the position of the cart in the layout ............................ You may have to clear your cache or delete /var/cache to see your changes. The proper way to this would be to override the checkout Module , look at the magento wiki to learn more about overriding modules.
