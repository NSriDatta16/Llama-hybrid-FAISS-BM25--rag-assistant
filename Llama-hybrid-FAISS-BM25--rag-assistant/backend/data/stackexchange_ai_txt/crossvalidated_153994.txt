if you have quantitative data, Spearman will treat it like ordinal data. Well, sort of. Certainly it's the case that any monotonic increasing transformation of the observations won't alter the correlation, and only the rank ordering of the observations matters. That's not quite the same thing as the original data having ordinal categories (which would usually tend to induce ties in the data, for example). How about averaging Pearson's and Spearman's rho? Is that legit? It depends on what you mean by "legit". If there is a correlation just caused by outliers, the average should be less sensitive. Consider that instead of having a population value for the 'contaminated' correlation, $\rho^*$ that you don't think is useful (because it's 'just caused by outliers'), you'd prefer a value close to $\frac12\rho^*$... is that really more meaningful? In most situations, possibly not. Or thinking in terms of estimating the uncontaminated correlation, consider this case, where a strong positive correlation is rendered even stronger negative: The "averaged" correlation is still negative. Is that more useful than just taking Spearman? Not in this case. And quantitative information is not completely ignored. I don't think that quantitative information is "completely ignored" by Spearman's correlation, since the rank ordering is determined by it; it's only the additional possible information in what exists above what the rank ordering contains that could be added. For many distributions, that doesn't actually make any useful contribution, and even at the normal distribution, it only adds a few percent more information. The significance of both Pearson's and Spearman's rho can be computed as $t=\rho\sqrt{\frac{\text{df}}{1-\rho^2}}$. Can I apply the same to get the t-statistic and the p-value of this averaged rho value? Possibly (I doubt it, but one would have to check). The big question is whether it means much to do it. You could only improve the efficiency at the normal by the very tiniest amount, but you will lose most of the value that is brought by the more robust measure.
