For me, PCA scores are just re-arrangements of the data in a form that allows me to explain the data set with less variables. The scores represent how much each item relates to the component. You can name them as per factor analysis, but its important to remember that they are not latent variables, as PCA analyses all variance in the data set, not just the elements held in common (as factor analysis does).
