It is actually $\pi_{0}(\lambda)=1$ (i.e. a function of $\lambda$ which controls the fraction of p-values used for the null-distribution). Recall that when the null-hypothesis is true, p-values will have a uniform distribution. In other words, $\pi_{0}(0)=1$ " ...is usually going to be much too conservative in genomewide data sets, where a sizable proportion of features are expected to be truly alternative. However, as we set $\lambda$ closer to 1, the variance of $\pi_{0}$ increases... "[1] I suggest you re-run your qvalue() estimation with a fixed lambda of 0.5 to indeed be confident your analysis.
