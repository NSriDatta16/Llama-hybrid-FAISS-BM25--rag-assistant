What are the differences between Linear Regression in Machine Learning and Linear Regression in Statistics?

I am wondering what the differences are for linear regression in a machine learning context versus a statistical context. Are there any conditions that are assumed and need to be checked in statistics and not assumed in machine learning? As dar as I know, in statistics, the errors are assumed to be distributed normal with the mean of zero and the cariance of 1. I don't know why it is assumed like that and I don't know what else is assumed. Does Machine Learning also assume the same thing to build a linear regression?
