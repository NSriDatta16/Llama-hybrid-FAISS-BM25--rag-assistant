Visualization figures for the grid search optimization steps?

I am using grid search in order to find the best values for the SVM parameters (namely C and gamma ). The search is performed in two steps: coarse grid search and finer grid search, as prescribed in this " A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification " article. What is not clear to me is figure 2 and figure 3 in the aforementioned article: What are the name/type of these figures and how should they prepared? One thing that I am not entirely sure about is, as shown in figure 2 , there are many possible pairs of ( C , gamma ) values that produce the same cross-validation rate (i.e. 77.5). So, based on what the best ( C , gamma ) in this coarse search step was determined? Is the 77.5, as I think, just a rounded number? Also, are there other (better?) figure types that can be used to visualize the grid search steps?
