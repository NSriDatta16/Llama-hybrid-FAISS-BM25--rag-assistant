100 csv files to be analyse with MATLAB

I have used MATLAB before but used it to analyses data from *.txt file. Can someone help me out how can I program the MATLAB to read all the 100 csv file. Each csv file have 14 columns, and about 10,000 rows. These csv files only contain numbers, no text. All I want is to read columns F,G and H. And from the to calculate the average value for column F, G and H, Then again average the value for the whole 100 csv files for column F, G and H.
