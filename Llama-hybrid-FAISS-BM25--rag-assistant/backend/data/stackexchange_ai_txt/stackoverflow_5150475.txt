You simply have to create log4j fragment bundle with the log4j.properties file inside . UPDATE: Some things to look for: Header name should be: Fragment-Host: log4j . log4j.properties should be in the src folder. All the bundles which use log4j should have org.apache.log4j in their Import-Package attribute
