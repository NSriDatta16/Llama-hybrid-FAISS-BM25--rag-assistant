Machine Learning Forecasting using multiple time series

I have multiple time series (ca.7000 with each 40 weekly forecasts) and would like to forecast using a machine learning algorithm. As I understand it, I could use one time series for forecasts; however, since I then only have 40 data points, I want to use all time series with similar demand pattern to forecasts one product. Is this possible with Linear Regression or Random Forest or Support Vector Regression? As I know, ARIMA is not possible, I have to Use Varma. is this also true for Exponential Smoothing
