You cannot determine if two measures are significantly different (in a statistical sense). Statistic significance can only be determined for sets of measures (in this case sets of measures). This question in Cross-Validated How to statistically compare the performance of machine learning classifiers? is a good start on how to collect a set of measures and which test to use to compare classifiers. But notice that the literature posted in the accepted answer deals with accuracy not AUC . I don't know if using AUC as quality measure changes the tests.
