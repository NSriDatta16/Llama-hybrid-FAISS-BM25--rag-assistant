What adavantages does HQL have over SQL for Group By queries

I am concentrating this question on 'reporting-type' queries (count, avg etc. i.e. ones that don't return the domain model itself) and I was just wondering if there is any inherent performance benefit in using HQL, as it may be able to leverage the second level cache. Or perhaps even better - cache the entire query. The obvious implied benefit is that NHibernate knows what the column names are as it already knows about the model mapping. Any other benefits I should be aware of? [I am using NHibernate but I assume that in this instance what applies to Hibernate will be equally applicable to NHibernate]
