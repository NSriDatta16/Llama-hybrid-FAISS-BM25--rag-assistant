Two projects come pretty close to what you wanted. First, the Synthetic Population Viewer from the RTI thinktank uses 2007-2011 ACS data and makes a "synthetic" household so that they sum up to the 2010 census tract estimates. You can find a methods explanation here: Wheaton, W.D., J.C. Cajka, B.M. Chasteen, D.K. Wagener, P.C. Cooley, L. Ganapathi, D.J. Roberts, and J.L. Allpress. 2009. Synthesized population databases: A U.S. geospatial database for agent-based models. RTI Press paper available here . Second, as Andy W mentioned, this is similar to dasymetric mapping where ancillary information is combined with survey data to come up with small-area estimates. A good example of this method is the work by Nagle and colleagues: Nagle, Nicholas N. et al. “Dasymetric Modeling and Uncertainty.” Annals of the Association of American Geographers. Association of American Geographers 104.1 (2014): 80–95. Leyk S, Buttenfield BP, Nagle NN. Transactions in Geographic Information Science. 2013. Modeling ambiguity in census microdata allocations to improve demographic small area estimates. However, proper caution is still needed when using the output of either of these two methods, but I think you could use either of these approaches as a baseline for "cold-deck imputation" at the census tract level. Keeping in mind that cold-deck imputation should only be used under heroic assumptions of missing completely at random data.
