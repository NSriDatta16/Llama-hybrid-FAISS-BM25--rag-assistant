How to change the flatfile connection manager "file name" value in SSIS package?

I have an ssis package...which read data from fixed-column-width text file into DB table. And I am modifying an existing ssis package. I have a flat file source...and flat file cnnection. When I try to edit the flat file connection...using "flat file connection manager editor"..., under "general" part...even if I select different filename..it's not getting reflected. OR...select the properties window of "Flat File Connection" - once I change connection string and click "save" of visual studio...it rollback Help me please.
