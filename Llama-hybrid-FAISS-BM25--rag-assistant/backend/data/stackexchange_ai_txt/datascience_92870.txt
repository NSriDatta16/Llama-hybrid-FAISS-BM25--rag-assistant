Coordinates of cereals in figure

I'm trying to automatize cereal counting from an image. The problem is that I have only a few pictures and I don't know how to train a CNN to do the job. Should I create mini images with single cereals and use those to train the network? I would like to extract the coordinates, not only count them.
