I've used IM at the last three places I have worked. Currently the building that I am in is so large that it takes a couple of minutes just to walk to my managers office. Then there are the days that we work from home (1-2 days a week). Email for some purposes just doesn't cut it and the phone can be too disruptive and all encompassing for some tasks. When I was doing consulting work I would give my IM contact information to my clients. About 25% of them would use it to contact me and I am still in contact with them to this day which opens up the possibility for future work! The clients that used IM felt that they had a better connection with me because they could see when I was online and available to talk. I'm still in contact with old work colleagues through IM and this allows me quick access to their knowledge base as well. My suggestions for using IM in the workplace are: Use a client that supports multiple protocols (MSN, Yahoo, AIM, Jaber, etc) Setup and use personal accounts for each of the networks you are on (i.e. don't use accounts tied directly to your work) Make sure your IM client records a history of all of your conversations Always be available but minimize personal conversations Provide your IM information freely to friends, clients, and colleagues Add appropriate groups (i.e. friends, family, work) and filters to reduce undesired interruptions while still being available if needed Don't feel that you have to respond to every chat request. Let it set until you are ready to deal with it One other trick I use is to use text to speech software so that when a chat message comes in it is read allowed. When I am at home (or preoccupied away from the computer in the office) the message is automatically read allowed (I liken it to a ringing phone call) in order to get my attention. But, I don't have to stop what I am doing in order to know what the message is.
