Parsing XML string using XSLT

I have an XML document that has a TextBlock that contains HTML code. This is a header. This is a paragraph. In the actual XML, however, it is coded like this: &lt;h1&gt;This is a header.&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; So when I use it displays all of the coding on the page. Is there a way using XSLT to convert &lt; to within the TextBlock element?
