Why is multicollinearity not checked in modern statistics/machine learning

In traditional statistics, while building a model, we check for multicollinearity using methods such as estimates of the variance inflation factor (VIF), but in machine learning, we instead use regularization for feature selection and don't seem to check whether features are correlated at all. Why do we do that?
