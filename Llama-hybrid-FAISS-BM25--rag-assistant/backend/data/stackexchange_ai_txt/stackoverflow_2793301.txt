Web browsers usually don't support xslt 2.0. Xpath sum() expects a node-set. What you are passing it is a "result tree fragment". The result tree fragment data-type has been removed in XSLT 1.1. So what you are experiencing is: Opera doesn't tell you by an error message that it doesn't support xslt 2.0 ( Opera specification ) Opera does not conform fully to 1.0 specification You can try to specify version="1.1" and see if it helps. Otherwise, you may try if the browsers support exsl:node-set() .
