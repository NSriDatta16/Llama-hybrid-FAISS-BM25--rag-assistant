The D parameter governs the number of seasonal differences, where "seasonal" is understood to be as per the underlying time series frequency. What you are implicitly doing is considering your time series as having a frequency not of 12 (monthly data with yearly seasonality), but of 6 (monthly data with half-yearly seasonality). So the best solution would be to recode your time series with a new frequency=6 attribute, then feed it into auto.arima() (with or without a hard setting for the D parameter ): > library(forecast) > auto.arima(ts(AirPassengers,frequency=6)) Series: ts(AirPassengers, frequency = 6) ARIMA(4,1,2) with drift Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 ar4 ma1 ma2 drift 0.2243 0.3689 -0.2567 -0.2391 -0.0971 -0.8519 2.6809 s.e. 0.1047 0.1147 0.0985 0.0919 0.0866 0.0877 0.1711 sigma^2 = 706.3: log likelihood = -670.07 AIC=1356.15 AICc=1357.22 BIC=1379.85 (Removed erroneous images)
