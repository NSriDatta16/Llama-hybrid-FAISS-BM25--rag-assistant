XGBoost model has features whose feature importance equal zero

I ran into this problem: A XGBoost model(.pickle file , constrcuted under V0.7.post3) with 100 features in it ; But I found 55 features in model (model.feature_importances_) show 0 feature importance (like matrix below); Additionally, when I transformed the pickle file to PMML(to launch online), only 45 features in PMML file (those ones with importance>0 apparently); So, my question is: --why features with importance equal to 0 ending up in a XGB model ? And why they remain in the model, if they don't actually contribute to/participate in split? ## Feature importance maxtrix from model for demo array([0.06586827, 0.04191617, 0.08383234, 0.05988024, 0.07784431, 0.04790419, ... 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. ]
