You have to remember firstly that JavaScript is not an alternative to PHP. PHP is a server-side language, JavaScript is purely client-side. One cannot replace the other. You can convert that sample into usable JS. But, it will differ from a server-side implementation in that its behavior will be completely dependent upon the user agent and its capability to execute JavaScript. Make a new PHP script that returns the adverts in XML format, and you can use the XMLHttpRequest object to obtain them through Javascript. I can write a sample of that in a sec if you like.
