Visual Studio 2008 custom class item template, $safeprojectname$ not reconciling

Just setting up some quick class and object item templates and all is working great so far, but one thing I'm stuck on is the $safeprojectname$ template parameter. I've added this as part of the namespace portion and the $registeredorganization$ is working fine namespace $registeredorganization$.$safeprojectname$ { public class $safeitemname$ { public $safeitemname$() { //default constructor } } } And I've gone into the .vstemplate file and made sure ReplaceParameters="true" so the only thing I guessed at this point is the period between the company and project name, so I tested this out and just for laughs removed the period, still no go. Anyone have any insight as to why this isn't working? EDIT : I'll accept Jared's answer as it answers my core question "why isn't it working?" but I am adding this follow up to show how I got my desired result. Instead of using the $safeprojectname$ or $projectname$ I found that using $rootnamespace$ namespace $registeredorganization$.$rootnamespace$ or depending on how your project is named: namespace $rootnamespace$ works as I had wanted, just added this for anyone else who may come across this issue.
