Inference, Prediction, & Model Fit?

I have a background in statistics (for social science), but I am confused about the ways in which Data Science textbooks (in particular, An Introduction to Statistical Learning and Practical Statistics for Data Scientists ) describe the relationship between inference, prediction, & model fit. How does whether you want your model to (1) predict an outcome or (2) infer relationships between X and Y effect how you go about fitting the model ? Is it simply a matter of whether you use validation and holdout sets (for prediction) instead of fitting a model to all data (for inference)? Based on my reading of the texts, it is more complicated than that. For example: Do we need to minimize a different statistic when fitting an inferential model vs a predictive model? Do we typically include a different number of predictors in an inferential vs predictive model? Etc.
