You can listen for the WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE event, which should only fire when the move is started. While the user is dragging you may receive WM_MOVING and WM_MOVE events. The latter depends on the their system settings (e.g. the window moves as they drag, versus just dragging an outline). Finally, WM_EXITSIZEMOVE would indicate when they are done.
