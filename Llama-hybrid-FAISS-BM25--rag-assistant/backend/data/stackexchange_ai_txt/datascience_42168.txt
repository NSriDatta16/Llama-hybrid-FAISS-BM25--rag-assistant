Enable to reproduce the loss of training while predicting

i use CNN model for a regression problem with a custom loss def loss_M2(y_true,y_pred): y_true_f=K.flatten(y_true) y_pred_f=K.flatten(y_pred) M2=K.max(K.abs(K.cumsum((y_pred_f-y_true_f),axis=0))) return M2 ISSUE : when i call y_train_predict = model.predict(X_train, verbose=0) and evalaute the loss i get "926" instead of something close to 200 that we see on the image above , here is the numpy function that compute the same custom loss def score_M2(reel,pred): return max(abs(np.cumsum(reel-pred))) PS : i checked that the loss_M2 and score_M2 give the same results for the same inputs. Please tell me what is happening here.
