Leave one out cross validation for LSTM

I have a multivariate time series data set having 6 variables. I have to predict the sixth variable at the next time step given the expected values of other five at the next time step. I am using LSTM for prediction. The data set is small (170*6), have 170 observations. Splitting the data set into three i.e. train/test/split doesn't seem a probable option in this case. As far as I know, input sequences (of fixed length) over which the LSTM learns are assumed independent. So my question was, can one sequence be left out for validation just like in the case of a cross sectional data problem.
