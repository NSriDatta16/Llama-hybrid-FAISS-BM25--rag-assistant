Not really a security issue (an attacker can craft any GET/POST request he wants anyway, and even send it from a legitimate user's browser via CSRF), but a maintenance problem, because accidentally a cookie value can overwrite a request parameter. Also you can get into trouble if you accept GET requests for e.g. deleting stuff - GET requests are assumed to be safe and user agents can be liberal with sending them. You should accept only POST for requests which change data or internal state and GET for everything else.
