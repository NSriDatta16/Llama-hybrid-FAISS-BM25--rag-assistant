With the help of Seth, and using my early morning brain (yes, I'm middle-aged and I am smarter in the morning). The link to here , which I was studying, and Seth referred to, is the key. I used the code from the js file on the blog entry and morphed the code away from an oo javascript concept to a script running inline. this is my solution: var lat1 = center.lat(); var lon1 = center.lng(); var lat2 = latitude; var lon2 = longitude; lat1 = lat1 * Math.PI / 180; lat2 = lat2 * Math.PI / 180; var dLon = (lon2-lon1) * Math.PI / 180; var y = Math.sin(dLon) * Math.cos(lat2); var x = Math.cos(lat1)*Math.sin(lat2) - Math.sin(lat1)*Math.cos(lat2)*Math.cos(dLon); var bearing = Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI; if (bearing I am running the demo google map here . Thanks for the help and now I can move onto logic code that will recommend the correct product for my client's customer at this url . stackoverflow ROCKS.... Robert
