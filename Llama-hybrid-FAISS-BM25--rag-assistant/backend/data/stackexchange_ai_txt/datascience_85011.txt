How to use helper files in PyCharm

I am trying to follow along with a project written by Mike Smales - "Sound Classification using Deep Learning" . In there, the author wrote a helper file called wavfilehelper.py: wavehelper.py Code import struct class WavFileHelper(): def read_file_properties(self, filename): wave_file = open(filename,"rb") riff = wave_file.read(12) fmt = wave_file.read(36) num_channels_string = fmt[10:12] num_channels = struct.unpack(' In his main program he calls the helper file like this: from helpers.wavfilehelper import WavFileHelper wavfilehelper = WavFileHelper() However, when I run this block of code in PyCharm, it complains "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'helpers.wavfilehelper'"...how can I get this helper file to work in the PyCharm environment? Do I have to put the wavehelper.py file in a special folder to be called? Any help will be greatly appreciated!
