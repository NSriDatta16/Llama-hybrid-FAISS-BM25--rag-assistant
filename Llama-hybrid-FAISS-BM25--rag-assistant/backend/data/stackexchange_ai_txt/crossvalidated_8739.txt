Have a look in a Multivariate text for MANOVA--multivariate ANOVA. Here is a website... http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/manova.htm Though, that's a lot of dependent variables and it could be hard to interpret. It might be simpler to do some sort of data reduction first, like PCA among your set of fatty acids. I suppose it depends on how much overlap there is and how many PCs you'd need to extract to account for the 30 vars.
