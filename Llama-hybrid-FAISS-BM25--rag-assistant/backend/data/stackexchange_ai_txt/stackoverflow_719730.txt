For production you should only use self hosting if you are professional sys admin. Can you answer yes to following questions (a bit linux oriented, but you should get an idea): Can you react to system failure in minutes (I mean you need sleep at least. Do you have somebody to look after system while you are asleep?) Can you spot a system break? Can you remove exploits from your system? Can you recompile kernel. If you can't remove exploits? Can you configure the system for optimal performance? Are you willing to pay for UPS, backup storage and alternative internet provider? If you can answer yes to these questions benefits are very atractive and I would go with it. On the other hand hosting development environment can be managed by administrator of any level especially when there are such easy to use servers like Ubuntu.
