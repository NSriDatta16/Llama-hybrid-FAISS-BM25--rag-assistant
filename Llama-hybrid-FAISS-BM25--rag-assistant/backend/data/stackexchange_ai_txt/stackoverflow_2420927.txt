Java coding style - calling a method inside a class

I want to call a validation method inside a shared gwt class that i have created to store the validation logic (for user entered text fields) suggestBox.addKeyUpHandler( new KeyUpHandler() { public void onKeyUp(KeyUpEvent event) { if (event.getNativeKeyCode() == KeyCodes.KEY_ENTER) { String boxText = suggestBox.getText(); if (new FieldVerifier().validUserName(boxText)) { //inner class used to instanciate the FieldVerifier class where validUserName(String ..) lives now i could do this with a properly instanciated FieldVerifier class (rather than a inner class as above) - or indeed, perhaps make it abstract. but i have the suspicion i am missing something (ie. must be an elegant way of doing it). looked on google code search, but didnt come across anything particularly helpful..
