Consider getting hold of the book " Debugging " by David J Agans. The subtitle is "The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems". His list of debugging rules â€” available in a poster form at the web site (and there's a link for the book, too) is: Understand the system Make it fail Quit thinking and look Divide and conquer Change one thing at a time Keep an audit trail Check the plug Get a fresh view If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed The last point is particularly relevant in the software industry.
