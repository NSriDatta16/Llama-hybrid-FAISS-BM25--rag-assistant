The SDK is fairly flexible; there are actually quite a number of ways to go about this: Subclass UIImageView, as tomute has already mentioned. You would then respond to your UIImageView's touches in each object's touchesBegan, touchesMoved & touchesEnded methods. If your UIImageViews don't handle the touch events then they'll be passed to the super view where you could check in the superview by asking if ([[touch view] isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]] then perhaps switch ([[touch view] tag]) case (1) { … break; } case (2) { … break; } The event will continue getting passed 'up' until something in the chain handles the touch. Review Event Handling and the responder chain.
