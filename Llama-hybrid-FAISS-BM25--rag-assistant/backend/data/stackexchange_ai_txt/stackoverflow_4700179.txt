The solution that I ended up settling on was to create a reusable singleton loading class which manages the loading and storage of data on-demand. It manages "jobs" which can be LOCAL or REMOTE which store references and the loaded data itself which is mapped in the manager class once it has fully loaded. While I really like back2dos's suggestion, managing the (re-)creation of SWF's everytime an asset changes isn't optimal for my purposes.
