The frequentist approach to non-inferiority assessment is quite indirect. The Bayesian approach to this is completely straightforward, i.e., compute the posterior probability of non-inferiority, and the sample size can be computed to have a certain high probability that this posterior probability will be definitive (e.g., $\geq 0.95$).
