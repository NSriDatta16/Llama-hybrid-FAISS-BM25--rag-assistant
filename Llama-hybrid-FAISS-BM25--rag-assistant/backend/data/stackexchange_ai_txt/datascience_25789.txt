Why does PCA assume Gaussian Distribution?

From Jon Shlens's A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis - version 1 , page 7, section 4.5, II: The formalism of sufficient statistics captures the notion that the mean and the variance entirely describe a probability distribution. The only zero-mean probability distribution that is fully described by the variance is the Gaussian distribution. In order for this assumption to hold, the probability distribution of $x_i$ must be Gaussian. ($x_i$ denotes a random variable - the value of the $i^\text{th}$ original feature. i.e. the quote seems to claim that for the assumption to hold, each of the original features must be normally distributed.) Why the Gaussian assumption and why might PCA fail if the data are not Gaussian distributed? Edit: to give more info, in the tutorial , page 12, the author gave an example of non-Gaussian distributed data that causes PCA to fail.
