Discrete choice model with exclusionary choices

Suppose we have many agents $j\in \{1,..,J\}$ choosing over options $i$ to maximize their outcome of the form $$ max_i ~~Y_{ij} = \beta x_i + u_{ij} $$ where $u_{ij}$ is an error term. The options, however, are exclusionary (each one can only be taken by one agent). Is there a way to think about this problem, particularly to estimate (a) the probability that option $i$ is taken, and (b) the probability that option $i$ is taken by agent $j$? We can assume there is independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and errors terms can take any shape that is roughly reasonable.
