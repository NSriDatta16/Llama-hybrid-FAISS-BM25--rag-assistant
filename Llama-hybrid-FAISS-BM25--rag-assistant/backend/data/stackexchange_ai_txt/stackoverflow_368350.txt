Associate arbitrary data with ejb call context

I've got a bunch of stateless ejb 3.0 beans calling each other in chain. Consider, BeanA.do(message) -> BeanB.do() -> BeanC.do() -> BeanD.do(). Now i'd like to access message data from BeanD.do(). Obvious solution is to pass message as a parameter to all that do() calls (actually that's how it works now), but i want some nicer solution. Is there some kind of call context? And can i associate arbitrary data with it? What i'd like to do, is simply put message in BeanA.do(message) to some local storage associated with bean function call and retrieve it in BeanD.do(). Any ideas?
