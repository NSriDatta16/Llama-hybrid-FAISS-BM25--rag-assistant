The documentation says that the pan gesture starts when the fingers have "moved enough to be considered a pan." This movement is to distinguish a press from a drag, since the user's finger could move around a bit while they are trying to press without dragging. I think this is the difference you're seeing between the first touch point and the first point considered part of the drag.
