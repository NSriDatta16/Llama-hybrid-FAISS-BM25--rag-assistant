Populate a TTreeView With Directory Tree And Filtering

On a Lazarus 0.9.28.2 project I have a TTreeView , with the name DirTree on my Form( frmConvert ), but I want to populate it with all the directory tree, since C:\ . Like this: C:\ Directory Tree http://i.imagehost.org/0185/cdirtree.png And when the user select the directory, in the second TTreeView , with the name FileTree , appear all the files in that directory, but filtered to show only PDFs. Also I want help to put these icons, because is very nice to be more organized and friendly for the end-user. Questions How can I populate the first TTreeView( DirTree ) with all the directorys, like in the image? How can I populate the second TTreeview( FileTree ) with the files on the directory selected on DirTree ? How can I set a icon for each folder(only folders) on DirTree ?
