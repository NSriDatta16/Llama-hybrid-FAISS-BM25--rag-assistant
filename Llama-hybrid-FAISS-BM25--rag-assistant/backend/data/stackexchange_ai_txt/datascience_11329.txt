Is there some model-based variation of the Q-Learning algorithm which learns on a 3D SxAxS' table instead of a 2D SxA table?

Q-learning works with a 2D SxA table of Q values, where S is the current state and A is the action taken. Is there some model-based variant of Q-learning (or SARSA) that uses a 3D SxAxS' table to store Q values, where S' is the resulting state? A similar table may be used to learn models in discrete environments, but in this case you don't store Q values, but counts. I couldn't find anything like this, either because I don't know the correct terms to search for, or because it does not exist. It doesn't matter to me if it is useful or not, I just need to know if it exists, and if it exists, how is it called.
