Diagnostics for logistic regression?

For linear regression, we can check the diagnostic plots (residuals plots, Normal QQ plots, etc) to check if the assumptions of linear regression are violated. For logistic regression, I am having trouble finding resources that explain how to diagnose the logistic regression model fit. Digging up some course notes for GLM, it simply states that checking the residuals is not helpful for performing diagnosis for a logistic regression fit. Looking around the internet, there also seems to be various "diagnosis" procedures, such as checking the model deviance and performing chi-squared tests, but other sources state that this is inappropriate, and that you should perform a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test. Then I find other sources that state that this test may be highly dependent on the actual groupings and cut-off values (may not be reliable). So how should one diagnose the logistic regression fit?
