As others have already pointed out, it's probably not worth much concern in this case -- as long as 'field' is indexed, both select's will be extremely fast. If you have (for whatever reason) a situation where that's not enough, you could create a memory-based temporary table (i.e. a temporary table backed by the memory storage engine), and select your records into that temporary table. Then you could do selects from the temporary table and be quite well assured they'll be fast. This can use a lot of memory though (i.e. it forces that data to all stay in memory for the duration), so it's pretty unfriendly unless you're sure that: The amount of data is really small; You have so much memory it doesn't matter; or The machine will be nearly idle otherwise anyway. The main time this comes in handy is if you have a really complex select that can't avoid scanning all of a large table (or more than one) but yields only a tiny amount of data.
