You don't say anything about the actual weights you are dealing with. So I'll choose some hypothetical values for illustration. Suppose women have average weights about 230 (pounds) with standard deviation 45, and men averaging about 245 with SD 55. Then respective sample sizes 150 and 50 may not be enough to detect the 15 lbs difference in gender weights. Then according to the following simulation in R, a little over half of the experiments according to these parameters would show a significant difference. (The power is the probability of detecting such a difference). set.seed(2021) pv = replicate(10^4, wilcox.test(rnorm(150, 230, 45), rnorm(50, 245, 55), alt="l")$p.val) mean(pv However, with the same weight distributions and sample sizes 550 and 350, you would almost certainly detect the difference in gender weights. set.seed(321) pv = replicate(10^4, wilcox.test(rnorm(550, 230, 45), rnorm(350, 245, 55), alt="l")$p.val) mean(pv Note: There are procedures in most statistical software (and online) for the power of t tests (requiring normal data) where both samples are the same size. If sample sizes are different, then one can use formulas involving noncentral t distributions to compute power. However, I know of no such procedures for Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Thus, I have used simulation for this example.
