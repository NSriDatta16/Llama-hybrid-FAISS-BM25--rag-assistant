To me these designs are equivalent. In each case CDoor is owned by CGarage . I prefer 1. since the shared_ptr in the second does not seem to add anything but complexity - who is CGarage sharing it with? Your cons for 1. are not compelling to me. Why not use scoped_ptr in 2. unless you are providing a getter for the CDoor object?
