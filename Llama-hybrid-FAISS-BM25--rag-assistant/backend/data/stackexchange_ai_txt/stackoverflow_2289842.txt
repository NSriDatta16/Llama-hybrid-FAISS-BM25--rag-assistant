If the devices support zeroconf , then you should be able to use " net view " to get a list of local servers. You can then use the Windows dns implementation to resolve an IP address from the host name. The Ping.exe command would be a shortcut if you wanted to do all of this from a script, since it will take a hostname and display the IP address it is pinging. There's probably a more elegant way using the zeroconf protocol directly, but the above should work fine too.
