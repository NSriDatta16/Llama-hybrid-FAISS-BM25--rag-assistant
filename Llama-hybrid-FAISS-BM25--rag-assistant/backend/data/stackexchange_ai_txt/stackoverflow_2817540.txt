Is it possible to make a visually appealing GUI with JavaFX & Swing?

I would like to do a visually appealing / user-friendly GUI in java. Swing is a limited in terms of "skin" customization. I'm thinking about JavaFX, but I don't get it yet, what can I achieve with this technology ? how hard is it ? do you have examples of real-life examples of Swing/JavaFX integration ? I would like to do something in this spirit of this, which is built on the .NET framework: original link: http://www.patrickpayet.com/net/?p=329 edit : is their any getting started overview sample code that I can read to get a general feeling of the work needed to be done to achieve something in the spirit of the screenshot? maybe something like the miglayout's swing demo http://www.migcalendar.com/miglayout/swingdemoapp.jnlp edit2 : I found http://download.java.net/general/openjfx/demos/tutorial.jnlp it's really basic though, linked from http://www.deitel.com/ResourceCenters/Programming/JavaFX/JavaFXTutorialsandDemos/tabid/2187/Default.aspx
