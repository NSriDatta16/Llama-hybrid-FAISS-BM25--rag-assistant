What are the advantages and disadvantages of including a baseline measurement variable in longitudinal data analysis?

What are the advantages and disadvantages of considering a baseline measurement variable in longitudinal data analysis? (A baseline variable could be the number of seizures each patient had per measured day before the study began.) In a randomized-control trial, does the baseline variable have to be before the treatment began, or could it be on day one of when the start of treatments began? This sounds a lot like feature selection.
