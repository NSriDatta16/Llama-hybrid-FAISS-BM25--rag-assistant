Since we're dealing with discrete numbers, I immediately thought of using a Categorical Distribution as the conditional distribution of each target key. So, if we take your example of a user's intent to press 5, and let $K$ be the key actually pressed, then we get: $$P(K=k|5) = p_{k,5}\;\;\mathrm{ where }\;\; p_{k,5} \geq 0 \;\mathrm{ and}\; \sum_{k=0}^9 p_{k,5} = 1$$ We can define such a distribution for each key. This is the empirical part. Now, let's say that the number actually pressed is $k$, we want to infer the intended key $I$. This is naturally expressed as a Bayesian Inference problem: $$P(I=i|k) = \frac{P(I=i)P(k|I=i)}{\sum_{i=0}^9 P(I=i)P(k|I=i)}$$ This equation tells you the probability that the user intended to press $i$ given they pressed $k$. However, you will notice that this depends on $P(I=i)$, which is the prior probability that someone would ever intend to press $i$. I would imagine that this would be conditional on the actual phone number being pressed (of course) but since you will not know this, you will need some way to adjust this prior context . The bottom-line is that there is no single fat-finger distribution, unless we are talking about the distribution conditional on an intended number. If your error-correcting method is to be useful, it will have to guess the intended number using these conditional distributions. However, this will require some useful prior-context, otherwise I'd expect the inferred key to alwasy be the key actually pressed...not overly useful.
