One possibility: You can divide both numerator and denominator by $n$, so the numerator become an average, suggesting we consider the CLT. So you might try to apply CLT to that scaled numerator (i.e. the covariance), which application requires some additional manipulation. If you can apply the CLT to the numerator and invoke Slutsky's theorem, you should be able to show* that asymptotically the sample correlation is normal. *(if the necessary conditions for both those theorems hold)
