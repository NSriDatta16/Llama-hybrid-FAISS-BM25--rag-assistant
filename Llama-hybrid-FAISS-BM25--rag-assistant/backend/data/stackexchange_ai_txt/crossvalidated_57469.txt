After doing the PCA then you may select the first two components and plot.. You can see the variation of the components using a scree plot in R. Also using summary function with loadings=T you can fins the variation of features with the components. You can also look at this http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/factor.html and http://statmath.wu.ac.at/~hornik/QFS1/principal_component-vignette.pdf Try to think what you want. You can interpret lots of things from PCA analysis. Best Abhik
