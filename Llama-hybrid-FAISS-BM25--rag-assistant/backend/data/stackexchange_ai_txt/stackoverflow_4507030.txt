Set left margin for a paragraph in html

i want to start a paragraph after putting 5 spaces and all the lines beneath the first line should come in a straight line, imean all the lines in the paragraph should have 5 spaces before it starts. I am getting this paragraph from databse. I want a Html tag that will define left margin for a complete paragraph.
