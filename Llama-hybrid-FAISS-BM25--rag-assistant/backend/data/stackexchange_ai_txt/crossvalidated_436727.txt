I would like to add an interesting case where the Cauchy distribution can arise in Biology. Imagine you are a shark roaming around a space $A \subset \mathbb R^3$ in search of food, which is represented mathematically by the neighborhoods $N_\epsilon(x_i)$ of several food sources $x_i$ . Brownian motion refers to the random walk process of swimming to a new location where the change in each dimension is a normally distributed random variable. If the normal distributions have mean zero, the shark is guaranteed to find a food source eventually . When food sources are scarce, the shark may abandon Brownian motion in favor of a Levy flight , in which the random walk distribution is a Cauchy distribution (or some other heavy tailed distribution). In Levy flight, the shark explores the space in a "greedy" way, sacrificing depth of the search in order to explore the space more quickly. This is referred to as the Levy flight foraging hypothesis . The movement of sharks, swordfish, ants, albatross, humans and other species have been shown to be well-modeled by levy flight (compared to traditional Brownian motion) in a wide variety of scenarios (although the evidence is somewhat mixed). In many mathematical settings, Levy flight is demonstrably faster at blindly searching a space and is often used in robotics competitions.
