Please don't forget about testing and maintaining the code. I can't image if you're able to write unit-tests to a project which is just in single file. Futher more, it's much harded to predict which functionality can be broken by changes you've just made. In case of modular architecture if you change some module then you can only break this module and modules which depends on it. Even a small changes can be fatal to single file projects (you can forget to close quote which will break all pages at once). I think you must retest all the functionality after even small changes we've made. And this can be a pain for testers ecpecialy you're not able to use unit-tests. Also if all code i stored in a single file then you'll more likely have a bad code. Such code will tend you to use global variables. In this case it's hard to reuse such code in other project. Of cause you can copy it, but remember when you copy something you copy all its bugs. Just imagane the project where you can use set of well-tested (tell thanks to unit-tests) libraries. When new bug appear then it's just fixed in a single place. One more thing, when you're working in a team using a single file will be pain. Even if there is only 2 developers they waste much time to merge changes. Any way, if your project is not big at all you can use single file appoch.
