You should not release the connection & associated storage until your delegate receives either a connectionDidFinishLoading: or a connectionDidFailWithError: message. Delegates are not normally retained by the object they're acting as delegate for . However in this case it is, so the delegate should not become invalid while the NSURLConnection is still referring to it, unless you're over-releasing it somehow.
