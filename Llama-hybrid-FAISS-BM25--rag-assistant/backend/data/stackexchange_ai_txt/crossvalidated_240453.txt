Statistical Significance of multiple classifiers by using p-value

I had a classification problem. I had 675 samples, and used with 7 machine learning algorithms with 10 cross-validation for prediction. Lets say the following table is the accuracy result of each algorithm. My supervisor asked me to perform a p-value test of the results, I have searched and read some, but I am not confident if such a test is appropriate. So, I wonder, is it possible (and makes sense) to get the p-value test of these data to claim result are statistically significant? Or it is a irrelevant test for such a context? If the answer is yes p-value is appropriate, then how can I do it, is it possible with python or excel etc... Many thanks
