Magento connect is used to download and install free , community modules. If your module fits the bill, please continue. First, you need to make sure that your widget is setup as an extension. That means that your code should be in a folder in app/code/local (though template files and such will clearly be in other places). Once you've done that, take a look here for some detailed instructions on how to package your extension. Basically, you're going to select all the files that go with that extension and bundle them into a big blob. Then, on the Magento website, you'll upload that file bundle to be placed on Magento Connect, where your clients can download and install it like any other community module. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
