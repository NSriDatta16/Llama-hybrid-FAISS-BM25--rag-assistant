My recommendation would be to start simply and try to build something like a logistic regression model to classify fraud/no-fraud for your dataset. This may help you quickly gain some insight into how to engineer the best features to separate the two populations. Logistic Regression in sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html An alternate approach would be to explore the data more at this point using something like UMAP to visualize what structure may exist in the data and could be used for feature engineering.
