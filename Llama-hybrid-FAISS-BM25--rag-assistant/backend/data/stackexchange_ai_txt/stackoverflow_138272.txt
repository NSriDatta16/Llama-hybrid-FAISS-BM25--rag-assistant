To keep your memory usage within acceptable limits, you'll have to use your 'divide and conquer' strategy. It's not a hack, if implemented right it's actually a very elegant way of dealing with bitmaps of unlimited size. If you design it right, you can combine the 'only render/show part of the image', 'render the whole image at low resolution for on-screen display' and 'render the whole thing to an on-disk bitmap' approaches in one engine and shield users of your code (most likely yourself in two weeks ;) ) from the internals. I work on a product with the same issues: rendering (potentially large) maps either to the screen or to .bmp files.
