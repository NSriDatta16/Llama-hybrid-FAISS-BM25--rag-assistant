Is there any trivial way to 'delete by date' using ´rm'- in bash?

I noticed today (after ~8 years of happily hacking away at bash) that there is no trivial way to 'delete by date' using ´rm'. The solution is therefore to pipe stuff around a combination of commands like rm, ls, find, awk and sed. Say for example I wanted to delete every file in the working directory from 2009, what would be the typical approach? I came up with the following, which is butt-ugly and should only be run if 'rm' is set to skip over directories (otherwise you will delete the parent directory): ls -la | awk '{if (substr($6,0,5)==2009) print $8}' | xargs rm Points for both the most elegant and the most outrageously over-engineered solutions.
