Bootstrapping in Bayesian Statistics

I am reading the book Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial. The book mentions it would be wrong to bootstrap a single data element and use the posterior pdf as the prior. I understand it would be wrong to do this but can you show me either mathematically or intuitively why this bootstrap idea is folly.
