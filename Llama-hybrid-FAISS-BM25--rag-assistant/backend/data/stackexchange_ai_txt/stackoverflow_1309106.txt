Its not taking up that much memory ... the column you need to pay attention to is the one marked "private". If you add them all up (and it does at the bottom) you'll see that passenger and its related processes are only taking up 86MB of memory. Most of it is being taken up by the size of your application too (76MB). You might need to let us know what else you're running on the server ... install htop and sort by memory to get an idea.
