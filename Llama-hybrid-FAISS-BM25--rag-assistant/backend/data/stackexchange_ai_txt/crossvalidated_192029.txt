How to assess seasonality effect influence on time series

Suppose I collected a time-series data (e.g. drug prescription on every month for 12 years). I have no reason to believe that my data is influenced by a seasonal factor (e.g. drug consumption is not influenced by month; in other words there is no reason to believe that a certain drug is more often prescripted on January than on July). By the way, I need a method to assess if my hypothesis is true. Consider this question an explanatory analysis. Here is the data I collected (number of drug prescriptions on 12 Months x 12 Years): mydata.ts1 Simply by plotting my data, I can see that a certain kind of "seasonality" is present in my data (against my initial hypothesis). stl plotting show a decreasing trend on drug prescriptions over years, with some effect of the variable "month". plot(stl(mydata.ts1, s.window=12)) The summary of stl function is quite ambiguous to me, since it gives to me no information about how much my data is influenced by the seasonal component : summary(stl(mydata.ts1, s.window=12)) Call: stl(x = mydata.ts1, s.window = 12) Time.series components: seasonal trend remainder Min. :-6818.566 Min. :45844.41 Min. :-6419.665 1st Qu.:-1833.162 1st Qu.:49439.62 1st Qu.:-1084.186 Median : 804.645 Median :59426.75 Median : 350.938 Mean : 7.947 Mean :60599.00 Mean : 49.549 3rd Qu.: 2071.084 3rd Qu.:69002.22 3rd Qu.: 1553.892 Max. : 5778.352 Max. :83116.20 Max. : 6619.956 IQR: STL.seasonal STL.trend STL.remainder data 3904 19563 2638 18531 % 21.1 105.6 14.2 100.0 Weights: all == 1 Other components: List of 5 $ win : Named num [1:3] 12 21 13 $ deg : Named int [1:3] 0 1 1 $ jump : Named num [1:3] 2 3 2 $ inner: int 2 $ outer: int 0 Finally, tslm function gives information to me that a clearly seasonal effect is present in my data: library(forecast) summary(tslm(mydata.ts1 ~ trend + season)) Call: lm(formula = formula, data = "mydata.ts1", na.action = na.exclude) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -11254.6 -2329.6 -249.4 1767.3 11613.6 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

How much is my data influenced by the seasonal effect?
