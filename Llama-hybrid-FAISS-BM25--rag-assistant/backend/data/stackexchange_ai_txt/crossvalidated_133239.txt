This phenomenon doesn't sound obviously suited for survival analysis methods, in my opinion. If you were looking how long a child lives after birth with this condition, then it would be one thing. In your case the date of surgery seems to be defined by preparedness of the hospital, or something like that, because once a child is born you know it needs a surgery (given it has this condition). You seem to imply that if you have a good prenatal diagnosis, this may tell the hospital to prepare for a surgery before birth, and hence shorten the time to surgery. In this case I'd start with the simplest ANOVA. Get two samples: one with pre-natal diag, and the other without it. Look at average surgery times. You have an issue with missing data. Try to identify whether the data is missing at random . You can start with ignoring if it's missing at random. Look at the prelim results, this may give you more ideas. Next, think of how to deal with missing data.
