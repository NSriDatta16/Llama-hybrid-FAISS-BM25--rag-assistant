I like Srikant's explanation, and I think the Bayesian idea is probably the best way to approach a problem like this. But here is another way to see it without Bayes: (in R) dbinom(10, size = 20, prob = 0.5)/dbinom(10000, 20000, 0.5) which is about 31.2 on my system. In other words, it is over 30 times more likely to see 10 out of 20 than it is to see 10,000 out of 20,000, even with a fair coin in both cases. This ratio increases without bound as the sample size increases. This is a sort of likelihood ratio approach, but again, in my gut this feels like a Bayesian judgement call more than anything else.
