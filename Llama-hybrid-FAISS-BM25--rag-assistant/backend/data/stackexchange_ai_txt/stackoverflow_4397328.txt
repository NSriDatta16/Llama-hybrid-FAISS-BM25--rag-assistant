Why Integer.getInteger does not work?

I have the following code: game.log.fine("HERE" + bestMove.get("score")); Integer bestScore = Integer.getInteger(bestMove.get("score")); game.log.fine("THERE" + bestScore); As an output I have: FINE: HERE50 Dec 9, 2010 11:34:17 AM game.Agent getCloud FINE: THEREnull Dec 9, 2010 11:34:17 AM game.Agent getCloud Probably I had to add that bestMove is HashMap . The problem is that bestMove.get("score") gives a string value (equal to "50"). But if try to transform to integer, I get null . Does anybody know what is the problem here?
