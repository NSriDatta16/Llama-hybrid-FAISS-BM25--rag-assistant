Assuming you have a globally convex likelihood and a regular parameter space, then the optimizer may have not converged when it reaches a boundary of the parameter space. This yeilds parameter estimates which explode and information matrices which are singular. Usually any graphical method is good at diagnosing that. Some estimation problems have unique solutions which are on the boundary of the parameter space, though, such as separation of outcomes in univariate logistic regression, giving odds ratios which are $\infty$ or 0.
