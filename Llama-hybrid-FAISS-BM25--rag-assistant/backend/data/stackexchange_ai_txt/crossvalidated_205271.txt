This is a dynamically developing field, so multiple software packages are available and are being developed. You can check arm package that accompanies Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models book by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill, it has bayesglm function for calculating GLM models using EM algorithm. Recently, two new packages for regression models in R were published: brms and rstanarm . Both of the packages just provide R interface and use Stan as workhorse. There is also recent rethinking package that accompanies Statistical Rethinking book by Richard McElreath. Generally, if you are looking for R packages for Bayesian estimation check CRAN "Bayesian" task view . Those packages are good for start, but it is good idea to look at software dedicated to Bayesian estimation: Stan and JAGS . You would need to put a little bit more effort into learning them, but they are much more flexible than the out-of-the-box solutions. Moreover, Stan has over 500 pages long detailed user manual that provides very good introduction to both Bayesian methods and the software itself. When learning JAGS you can check The BUGS Book by David Lunn, Christopher Jackson, Nicky Best, Andrew Thomas and David Spiegelhalter that is a very nice introduction to Bayesian modelling and the software.
