Image alignment in text?

Using iTextSharp i'm trying to align an image so that it gets embedded in a paragraph. I can do it like this: iTextSharp.text.Image image; image.Alignment = Image.ALIGN_RIGHT | Image.TEXTWRAP; document.Add(image); document.Add(new Paragraph("Large string of text goes here")); But the image comes out on the top right with the text surrounding it (kind of like an L) What I want is the text to be a few paragraphs then the image with text below it (kind of like a C). Does anyone know how I would do this VIA iTextSharp? Edit: I also tried iTextSharp.text.Image image; image.Alignment = Image.ALIGN_RIGHT | Image.TEXTWRAP | Image.ALIGN_MIDDLE; document.Add(image); document.Add(new Paragraph("Large string of text goes here")); But it was displayed with the image at the top and the text below it. There was no textwrap in effect.
