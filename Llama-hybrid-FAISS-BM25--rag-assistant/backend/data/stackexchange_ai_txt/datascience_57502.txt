Measure degree of heteroscedasticity

I analyzed my time series using Breusch Pagan test and observed the presence of heteroscedasticity in it. After box-cox transformation, I again tested the time series using Breusch Pagan test. The time series still shows heteroscedasticity. However, I do not know how to test if the heteroscedasticity has been rectified even partially or not. Can anyone please guide on how to measure the degree of heteroscedasticity because the test I am using in R, gives Pvalue and I am only able to figure out if heteroscedasticity is present or not.
