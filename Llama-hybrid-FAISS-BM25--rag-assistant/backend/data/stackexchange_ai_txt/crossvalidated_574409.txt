GANs - why does the generator want to minimize the loss (intuition)

I am a little bit puzzled about the following. In a generative adversarial network, we consider a binary classification problem with a binary cross-entropy loss. Now, the generator wants to minimize this loss and the discriminator wants to maximize this loss. I understand why the Bayes-optimal classifier is the optimal discriminator in this case, and why (algebraically), for this optimal discriminator, minimizing the loss corresponds to minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence (which is of course what we want). What I do not understand on an intuitive level is why the generator does not want to maximize and the discriminator to minimize the loss. Wouldn't that correspond to the generator making the classification task as difficult as possible for the best-possible discriminator? Would very much appreciate if someone has an intuitive argument for why the minmax makes sense.
