Best regression model for time series data

Suppose I have a Count time series data for the number of tasks that a server gets during a unit of time. Collecting data over a few months, I will get a dataset which will have 2 parameters. First one will be the number of tasks which will be the dependent variable, and the next one will be the time (adjusted to 0), which will be the independent variable. Now, as I understand it, the linear regression model cannot be used, as the relation between the number of tasks and time might not be linear. Can someone point out to the proper model for this kind of data?
