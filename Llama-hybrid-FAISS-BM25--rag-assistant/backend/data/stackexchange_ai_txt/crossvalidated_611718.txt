I don't really like this approach to determining the model family, I think it should be set a priori instead of using this machine learning method that this package uses with no citations to methodological papers. But that isn't the question. You could use the function heavy::heavyLm() with a t-distribution family and manually set the degrees of freedom to 1. (Note that this package is not on CRAN: https://github.com/faosorios/heavy ) Update: apparently the package also has a built-in Cauchy family for heavyLm() , so you could use that also. They should work out the same (to a meaningful level of precision anyways).
