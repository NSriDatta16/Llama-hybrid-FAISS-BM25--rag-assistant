is not supposed to bring you to the top of the page . It targets the empty fragment and basically neuters the default behavior of the link most of the time. I suspect your solution is relying on an artifact of your browsers, because an anchor named # should be called ## (or more probably #%23 ) in the href attribute of the link. Since you have to create an anchor anyway, it might be best to give it a meaningful name like TOP and target it using back to top .
