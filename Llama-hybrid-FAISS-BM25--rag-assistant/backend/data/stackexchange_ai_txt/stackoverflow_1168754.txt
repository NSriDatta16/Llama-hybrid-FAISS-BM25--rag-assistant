AS3 StartDrag() Not working in OSX

I wrote some very simple code to replace the mouse Cursor in a flash application I am writing in AS3/FlexSDK. The code: var cursor:MovieClip = new Cursor_addElement(); canvas.addChild(cursor); cursor.startDrag(true); It works perfectly fine on XP and 2x Vista machines, but on OSX the cursor does not follow along with the mouse - it just sits there at 0,0 on the screen. Has anyone encountered this?
