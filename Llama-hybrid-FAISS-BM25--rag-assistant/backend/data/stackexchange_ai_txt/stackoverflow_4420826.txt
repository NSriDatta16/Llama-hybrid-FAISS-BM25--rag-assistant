I'll venture to say that this code certainly doesn't do what you want it to: $newVerse = simplexml_load_string($strippedresponse); $oldVerse = $xmlDoc->xpath("//div[@number='".$div1."']/div[@number='".$div2."']"); $oldVerse = $newVerse; Changing the value of a PHP variable has no side-effects. In other word, nothing happens when you do $a = $b; except in some specific cases, and it's not one of them. I don't know what you really want to achieve with this code. If you want to replace the (X)HTML inside a specific you will need to use DOM and create a DOMDocumentFragment , use appendXML() to populate it then substitute it to your old . Either that or create a new DOMDocument , loadXML() then importNode() to your old document and replaceChild() your old div.
