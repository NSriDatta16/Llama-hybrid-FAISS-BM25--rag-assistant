In Java you should use Junit4, either by itself or (I think better) with an IDE. We have used three environments : Eclipse, NetBeans and Maven (with and without IDE). There can be some slight incompatibilities between these if not deployed systematically. Generally all tests are in the same project but under a different directory/folder. Thus a class: org.foo.Bar.java would have a test org.foo.BarTest.java These are in the same package (org.foo) but would be organized in directories: src/main/java/org/foo/Bar.java and src/test/java/org/foo/BarTest.java These directories are universally recognised by Eclipse, NetBeans and Maven. Maven is the pickiest, whereas Eclipse does not always enforce strictness. You should probably avoid calling other classes TestPlugh or XyzzyTest as some (old) tools will pick these up as containing tests even if they don't. Even if you only have one test for your method (and most test authorities would expect more to exercise edge cases) you should arrange this type of structure. EDIT Note that Maven is able to create distributions without tests even if they are in the same package. By default Maven also requires all tests to pass before the project can be deployed.
