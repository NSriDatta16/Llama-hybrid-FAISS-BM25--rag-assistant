Since you have already derived the analytic form for each individual posterior (they are each beta distributions), what you are essentially asking is how you can calculate the distribution of the mean of a set of independent beta random variables (with different parameters). Analytically, this requires you to take convolutions of beta distributions, which does not have a nice closed form solution. For large numbers of different coins, you can appeal to the CLT to get the normal distribution as an approximate distribution of the mean bias. However, I am presuming you want results for smaller numbers of coins. So that leaves you with simulation. Since you already know the posterior distribution, there is no reason to use a simulation method that inputs a prior and likelihood. You might as well just simulate directly from the known posteriors and average the simulations across the chains. That will give you a direct simulation of the mean bias across multiple coins.
