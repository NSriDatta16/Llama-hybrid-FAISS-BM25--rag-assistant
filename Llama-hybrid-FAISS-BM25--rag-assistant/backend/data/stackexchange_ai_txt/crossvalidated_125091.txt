Why doesn't it make sense to preprocess data with PCA before classification?

For some classification algorithms, assuming independence of data helps reduce the number of parameters to estimate. Why then not just to apply a method like PCA (or ICA) to the original features to get a set of independent features, apply these easy classification algorithms and project back the results on the original feature space?
