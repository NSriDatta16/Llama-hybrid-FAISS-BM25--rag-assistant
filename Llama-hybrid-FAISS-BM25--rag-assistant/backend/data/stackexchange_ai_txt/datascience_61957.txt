Why does removal of some features improve the performance of random forests on some occasions?

I completed feature importance of a random forest model. I removed the bottom 4 features out of 17 features. The model performance actually improved. Shouldn't the performance degrade after removal of some features, given that some data has been lost? What are some reasons to explain the performance improvement?
