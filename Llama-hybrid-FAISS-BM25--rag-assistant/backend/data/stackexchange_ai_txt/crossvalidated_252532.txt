The best and standard reference will be Aronszajn, Nachman. "Theory of reproducing kernels." Transactions of the American mathematical society 68.3 (1950): 337-404. I am not sure how deep you know about functional analysis, different levels of functional analysis has great difference. So I will say another standard is: Smola, Alex J., and Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. Learning with kernels. GMD-Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik, 1998. I am also not sure about your general math background, more or less you may be interested in: Lafferty, John, and Guy Lebanon. "Diffusion kernels on statistical manifolds." Journal of Machine Learning Research 6.Jan (2005): 129-163.
