I would gues your boss wants something like the following: public class ServiceContext : TableServiceContext { public ServiceContext(string baseAddress, StorageCredentials credentials) : base(baseAddress, credentials) { } public IQueryable Table { get { return this.CreateQuery (typeof(T).Name); } } } You should ask him/her to be sure though, you'd use this class as follows: ServiceContext serviceContext = new ServiceContext (); IQueryable query = serviceContext.Table;
