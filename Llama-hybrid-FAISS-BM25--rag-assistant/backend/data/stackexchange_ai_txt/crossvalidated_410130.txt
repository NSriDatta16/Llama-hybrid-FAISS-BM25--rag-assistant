Something whose log would be close to uniform is somewhat skew, but not particularly difficult to deal with; sample means of size 24 will be very close to normally distributed. If it were actually log-uniform we could work out a suitable interval fairly readily but I wouldn't actually use the fact that the sample looks like its log is uniform; with only 24 observations that judgement may be rather suspect and you certainly don't want to be doing such model selection/identification on the very sample you're using for inference, since you don't have a good way of accounting for the effect of that (e.g. it will tend to make intervals narrower than they should be but quantifying how much is rather tricky). If they were actually log-uniform those narrower intervals would be "honestly" narrow, but there's no good basis to say so. Simulation at n=24 suggests that a 95% two-tailed t-interval on the untransformed data should perform reasonably well (i.e. give coverage very close to 95%) for data something similar to this, even though this is not actually normal and the distribution of sample means is slightly skew. If you want to go far into the tails it may be more of an issue, but a 95% two-sided interval should be fine.
