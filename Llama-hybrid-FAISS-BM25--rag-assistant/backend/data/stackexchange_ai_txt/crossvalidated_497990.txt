poisson posterior = gamma function x uniform prior?

I was reading the section 3.2 of this paper . Above equation (3.2), the authors say "The posterior on the background estimate is then conservatively taken to be the Poisson posterior using a uniform prior for a sideband ... " Then they show the equation \begin{equation} P(\mu_{BG}) = \Gamma(7N_{pass}/100+1.1/7) \end{equation} How could one possibly connect the Poisson posterior to a gamma function? The authors said that they used a uniform prior, and the posterior function is a Poisson distribution. Then is there a reason why the posterior equals to a Gamma function? I tried to explain this for an hour but couldn't. In the equation $\mu_{BG}$ is the number of expected background events. ${N}_{pass}$ is defined in the paragraph above the equation 3.2. But I think the meaning of $N_{pass}$ is not important, since the point of my question is about the functional form.
