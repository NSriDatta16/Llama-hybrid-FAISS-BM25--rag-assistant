It won't be possible to remove "history" without destroying the SHA1 integrity of the complete repository timeline. This is one of Git strongest feature: Each commit id is a hash built from its complete historical timeline. But as far as I know binary objects are stored in some sort of diff so it won't waste too much storage - if that is your concern. Otherwise try to work with submodules if you just want to get the big binary data out of the way and host that elsewhere.
