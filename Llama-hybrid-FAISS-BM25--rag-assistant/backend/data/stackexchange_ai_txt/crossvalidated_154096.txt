Ignoring pairing that exists in the data will generally give you conservative results (p-value to large, confidence intervals too wide). However, if there is a negative correlation within pairs (unusual, but not impossible) then the errors can be in the other direction. To account for the pairing in the data, I would suggest using a generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) or a Bayesian approach. Neither is simple and need a fair amount of sophistication to carry out properly (so if you are not already familiar with these approaches, you should take another course or 2 (or 3) or consult with a statistician who is familiar with these techniques).
