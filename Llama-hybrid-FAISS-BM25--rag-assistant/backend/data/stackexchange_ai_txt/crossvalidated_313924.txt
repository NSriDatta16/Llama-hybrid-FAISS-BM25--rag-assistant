The answer is actually trickier than it appears at first. Generally, the translational invariance means that you would recognize the object regerdless of where it appears on the frame. In the next picture in frame A and B you would recognize the word "stressed" if your vision supports translation invariance of words . I highlighted the term words because if your invariance is only supported on letters, then the frame C will also be equal to frames A and B: it has exactly the same letters. In practical terms, if you trained your CNN on letters, then things like MAX POOL will help to achieve the translation invariance on letters, but may not necessarily lead to translation invariance on words. Pooling pulls out the feature (that's extracted by a corresponding layer) without relation to the location of other features, so it'll lose the knowledge of relative position of letters D and T and words STRESSED and DESSERTS will look the same. The term itself is probably from physics, where t ranslational symmetry means that the equations stay the same regardless of translation in space.
