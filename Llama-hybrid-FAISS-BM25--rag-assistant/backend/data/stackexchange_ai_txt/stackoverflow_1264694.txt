Make sure it is valid UTF-8 and Unicode? Yes Make sure it does not include certain characters, such as control codes? Probably not necessary You should be aware that even though you are using UTF-8 in your form, you may not get valid UTF-8 from all user-agents when they send form data to you, and you will have to filter it as necessary. Invalid UTF-8 can take many forms, some of them being Overlong encodings (which can lead to security issues) Other invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, which may indicate that the user-agent ignored the character encoding and has submitted something like Windows-1252 or ISO-8859-1 encoding instead. Code points that lie in reserved surrogate space in Unicode All the above need to be filtered out during input, otherwise you are not storing valid Unicode. If you want to serve valid HTML or XHTML, which use a subset of Unicode, you will need also need to filter out (either at input or output): C0 control codes 0x00 to 0x19 (apart from tab, space, new line, carraige return) 0x7F C1 control codes 0x80 to 0xBF (probably) any code point above 0x10FFFF
