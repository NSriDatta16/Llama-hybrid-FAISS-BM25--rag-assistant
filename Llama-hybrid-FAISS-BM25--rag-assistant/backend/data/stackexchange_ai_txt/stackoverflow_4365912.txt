iphone touchesbegan

I am using touchesBegan: . I touch an object and drag-and-drop it to some other place, but I also want to make a copy of it on its original. That is, after touching and dragging, there should be a copy of it at its original position. Below is my code: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch=[[event allTouches]anyObject]; CGPoint location=[touch locationInView:touch.view]; image1.center=location; } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
