Yes there is, it's called LESS and it really adresses most CSS's code readability problems. You can both compile it on the server or on-the-fly client-side with less.js . For production, I recommend setting up a build script that compiles it (in NodeJS this is piece of cake with Grunt and grunt-contrib-less ). Edit: There are also other options worth mentioning, even if I'm using and recommending LESS. SASS : Ruby folks love this one. It is not a super-set of CSS like LESS, but instead uses its own syntax. To cope up for this, they developed SCSS, which is a CSS super-set and is similar to LESS. Stylus : like LESS, it is coded in javascript, but this is commonly used from Node.js. I can't vouch for it, since I didn't try it out yet, but it is very mature so if it has a feature you want, definitely go for it. Turbine : This one was coded in PHP. Not much traction. Switch CSS : Maybe Python hackers will want to look into this. Even less traction. If you're feeling even more alternative, there's also CSS Cacheer , CSScaffold , DtCSS , CSSPP and even something by porneL . Other stuff you might want to check out: Compass : A full-on CSS authoring framework for the Ruby guys. WinLESS : A drag&drop LESS compiler for Windows, it's super cool and you really should check it out. LESS Elements , Preboot , LESSHat and even.less : Libraries of mixins and constants for LESS. Bootstrap : A framework developed by Twitter. Also related: HTML5 Boilerplate . Normalize.css : an alternative to CSS resets . There are many resets, however, as the developer of one, I have to say: most are crap. If you're not going to make your own, then just use this one. Update : Since 1.4 , LESS has @extend too. Be sure to use 1.4+ if possible! This completes the reasons to choose LESS over SASS I think.
