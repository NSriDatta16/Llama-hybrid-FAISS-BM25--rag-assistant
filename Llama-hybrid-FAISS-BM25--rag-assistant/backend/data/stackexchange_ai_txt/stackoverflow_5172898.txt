We (Nokia OVI maps) are also migrating from SVN to HG. The reason to choose HG over git is that HG is more userfriendly, the commands make much more sense compared to the sometimes obscure git commands. Also for windows users mercurial works much better, and tortoiseHG is quite mature. When I was testing git on windows, I observed serious performance problems at some simple operations like checking for modifications... I really like also that you can use features that you want via extensions. So the learning curve is smoother than with git, consider the cache area for example. For people coming from SVN I think HG is good option. They should be more careful with the history for example, we are encouraging to do hg pull --rebase in order to have history as linear as possible and merge only branches.
