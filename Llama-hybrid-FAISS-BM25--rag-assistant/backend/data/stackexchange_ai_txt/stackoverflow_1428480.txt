Use some JPA 2 implementation: it adds a @ElementCollection annotation, similar to the Hibernate one, that does exactly what you need. There's one example here . Edit As mentioned in the comments below, the correct JPA 2 implementation is javax.persistence.ElementCollection @ElementCollection Map collection; See: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/ElementCollection.html
