This is not multinomial data, however, since a given individual from a site may have more than 1 possible adverse event or none at all. That's problematic since AEs are often very highly correlated such as "aedema" and "injection site reaction". A multinomial model for outcomes is not appropriate here. Secondly, clinical trials are extremely averse to using Bayesian modeling. My experience has been so, anyway. I don't understand why averaging frequencies across sites does not provide a sufficient summary of AE rates in your sample.
