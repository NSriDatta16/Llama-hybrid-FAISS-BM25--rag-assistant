Keeping a header always in view

I am designing my website and I'm trying to find a way to keep a header always in the screen. For an example, take a look at this extra long page on Wikia.com. Notice that when you scroll the page, the little toolbar down the bottom stays in one place. However, scroll to the bottom of the page and you will realize that the toolbar stays in a fixed position until it gets out of view. This is what I would like to do, but in reverse. Have a header that stays in a fixed position on the web-page, but when it was not in view have it at the top. I tried looking at an example on DynamicDrive.com (search for Dock Content Script, because I can't post another link), but I found that it was too jittery for me. Can someone please help me do this? Thanks in advance. ~DragonXDoom P.S. Now that I notice, the How to Format box on the right of the submit question page has this effect.
