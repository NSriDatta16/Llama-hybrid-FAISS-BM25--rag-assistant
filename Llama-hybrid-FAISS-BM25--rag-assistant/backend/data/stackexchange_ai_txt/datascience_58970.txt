Binary classification is needed when requirement is to capture data into two classes. if you can't capture data in two classes where you need only one you go for One-class. you can check this link for better explanation http://rvlasveld.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/introduction-to-one-class-support-vector-machines/ If you take binary classification, svm tries to find best possible space between A and B. If there is only one class A model tries to create a boundary around it and classify. Take for example patient disease classification: For +ve some symptoms t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 for -ve he has t1, t2, t7. in the above case it is difficult to classify using one class because model classifies patient having t1, t2 as +ve because of proximity to +ve class. The second label gives you more info for better classification.
