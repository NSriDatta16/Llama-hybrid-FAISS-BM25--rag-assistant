In theory, it should be possible for the neural network to learn the function. This is what Cybenkoâ€™s Theorem tells us. Basically, if you have 5 input numbers and 1 output number determined deterministically , you have something similar to: Input: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 Output: 5 And your NN is trying to figure out the formula to get 5 from the five ones. If we, as humans, can figure out that summing the five ones gives us the output, that means that a NN can also achieve this. Of course, this is just in theory and differential equations are much more complex than a simple sum, but still it should be possible.
