PCA for questionnaire reduction

I'd like to have some opinion regarding if I'm in the right way with my questionnaire reduction. I have a questionnaire with 275 questions and 34 issues (so a couple of questions are related to each issue) and about 700 respondents. All the answers were transformed in dummies (1 or 0). In order to know which question is more relevant to build the issues in according to the response pattern, I'm applying PCA method with Stata. Here are the steps I'm following (separately for each "issue"): Checking the quality of the data (in some cases we have very few answers comparing to the group, so I'm dropping these ones out the analysis) Performing a KMO test (factortest), in order to check if the data are suitable to PCA (just using the ones that have KMO > 0.5) Performing a tetrachoric matrix (because I have dichotomous variables) Using matrix = r(Rho) in order to get the PCA from this matrix and not the Pearson's one. Decide the number of components I should retain. And then, in order to decide which question I'm gonna take out of the questionnaire, I'm checking the loadings of the components I kept. The lower is the loading, the most likely this question will be excluded. In general I'm using just the component which explains better all the issue (i.g Financial Planning). Does it make sense? Am I in the right way?
