A simpler approach might be to use the fact that if $x \sim \text{Pareto}(\theta,a)$ , then conditioning upon $x \geq b$ results in $x \sim \text{Pareto}(b,a)$ . Consequently, $x | x_{(1)} \sim \text{Pareto}(x_{(1)}, a)$ , except for the single observation corresponding to $x_{(1)}$ . When we then take the ratio $x/x_{(1)}$ , we are rescaling $x$ by its minimum value, and the resulting variate has a $\text{Pareto}(1, a)$ distribution, independent of $x_{(1)}$ . Therefore, if we don't pay attention to the rank of the $x_i$ in the sample, the ratios $x_i/x_{(1)} \sim \text{Pareto}(1,a)$ and are independent (except for the observation corresponding to $x_{(1)}$ , which is equal to 1.) This, combined with the fact that the log of a $\text{Pareto}(1,a)$ variate is distributed $\text{Exponential}(a)$ , and the sum of $n-1$ i.i.d. variates $\sim \text{Exponential}(a)$ is $\sim \text{Gamma}(n-1,a)$ , leads directly to the result that the sum $$\sum_{j=1}^n \ln\left(\frac{X_{(j)}}{X_{(1)}}\right) \sim \text{Gamma}(n-1,a)$$ where the $n-1$ comes from the fact that exactly one of the ratios will have value $1$ , hence $\log(\cdot) = 0$ , leaving $n-1$ nonzero terms in the sum.
