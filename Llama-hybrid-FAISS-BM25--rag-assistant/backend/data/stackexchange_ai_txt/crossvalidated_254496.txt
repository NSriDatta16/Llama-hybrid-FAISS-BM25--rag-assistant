Time series modelling is an iterative process much like peeling an onion. Often time monthly data exhibit quarterly effects and in this case a potential 6 month effect. I took your data into one of my favorite toys AUTOBOX ( which I helped to develop ) and specified a frequency of 12 since it was monthly data. The analysis suggested a very basic model with two anomalies . The cleansed data is here supporting the possible isolation/cleansing. The actual/fit/forecast plot is here . Standard procedure is to examine the residual plot and the ACF of the residuals which suggests omitted structure as a 6 month pattern is present. This phenomena suggested a seasonality/cycle/repetitive pattern of 6 as being potentially more applicable. Re-identification led to this model with two seasonal pulses and one anomaly. The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here with a more acceptable ACF of residuals here .
