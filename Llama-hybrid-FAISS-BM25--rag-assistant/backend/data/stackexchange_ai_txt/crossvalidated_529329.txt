Why do we require aperiodicity in MCMC?

According to the Ergodic Theorem by Birkhoff, for any measure-preserving dynamical system $(X, \cal{A},\mu ,\bf{T})$ and any $\mu$ -integrable integrable function $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ , the ergodic average $\frac{1}{N+1} \sum_{k=0}^{N}{f({\bf{T}}^{(k)}(x)}) \to \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[f]$ for $\mu$ -almost every $x$ . A Markov Measure on a finite state space is ergodic iff the associated chain is irreducible. However, almost every MCMC algorithm I come across additionally specifies the requirement of aperiodicity, which is necessary for convergence of the distribution to the the steady state. Why is this done? Are there any additional advantages to requiring aperiodicity?
