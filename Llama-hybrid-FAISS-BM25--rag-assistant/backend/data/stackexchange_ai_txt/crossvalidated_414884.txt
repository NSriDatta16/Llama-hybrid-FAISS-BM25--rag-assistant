If you are considering linear models, and are concerned with overfitting, you can consider using linear regression with regularization ie. ridge regression or lasso or a combination("elastic net"). If you want to try out non-linear as well as interaction terms, you can try SVM regression with a polynomial kernel or an RBF kernel. This will still require you to divide the data into train-tune-test pieces, but, you can use k-fold cross-validation for "train-tune" part (to trade-off lack of data for additional computation). You can keep 25% for test. It difficult to avoid a test sample if you are concerned about overfitting - this is because unless you test the fit model on an unseen sample, you can't get an unbiased estimate of model's performance.
