You first perform the calculation as you would for a linear regression, but before using the treshold to predict either 0 or 1 you first have to pass the result (i.e. the y value from your formula) through the sigmoid function to make sure all values are between 0 and 1. In reality, the formula for logistic regression (before thresholding) would therefore be as follows: \begin{equation} y = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2)}} \end{equation}
