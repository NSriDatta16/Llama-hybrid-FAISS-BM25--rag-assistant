Using Word Embeddings in Clustering and Topic Modelling

I am new to the field of NLP and would appreciate any guidance please. I am trying to understand how word embeddings can be used in clustering and topic modelling. If I create word embeddings for every word in a corpus, with e.g. 4 dimensions per embedding, the number of features becomes 4X more than a bag of words model and also I am unsure as to how you could feed a series of word embeddings into a model as the structure of the dataset would be different to a 'one feature per column' format. Thanks in advance
