Can any class of ML algorithms efficiently learn the modulo function (x mod y)?

The modulo operator is a non-smooth, non-linear function which has a kind of regularity that is easy to learn by human learners. Z = X % Y However, naive NN approaches to learn the function often encounter problems efficiently learning it. Train a Neural Network to distinguish between even and odd numbers Keras: Making a neural network to find a number's modulus Are there any classes of algorithms that are able to efficiently learn the modulo operator and other functions with similar regularity?
