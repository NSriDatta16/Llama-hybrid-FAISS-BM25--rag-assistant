Coding multiclass categorical variables as numeric rarely serves any useful purpose in my experience. For one thing, when you code a categorical variable as numeric the software will estimate a simple slope that that variable. If it was categorical to begin with, then this usually would be a nonsense. If you are looking to predict a categorical variable then you can look into random forests and k-nearest neighbours. If you are interested in inference for a multiclass categorical variable then multinomial logistic regression would be a good option - and you could also use this for prediction, though in my experience random forests do a better job.
