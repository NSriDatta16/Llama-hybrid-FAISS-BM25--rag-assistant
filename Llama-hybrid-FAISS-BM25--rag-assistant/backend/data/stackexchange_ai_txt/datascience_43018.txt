Tagging Unix/Non-Unix logs using NLP

I have a set of unstructured data consisting command output logs for different operating systems like Unix, Windows, etc. For example: Releasing version 0.0.1 for Stackoverflow, on 01/01/2019. The coverage is 99% and build is passed. (This is just an example, and not related to actual use case). This output is different for different operating systems. I want to perform tagging on this data For the case above, the output should be: Releasing version VERSION_NUMBER for PRODUCT_NAME, on releaseDate. The TEST_TYPE is TEST_VALUE and TEST_TYPE is TEST_VALUE Here, some words are replaced with their corresponding sample tags. I have studied techniques like POS tagging, NER, LSTM, but I don't know which one is suitable for this particular problem. How can I gather data from raw output and how to apply those techniques here. Thanks to everyone who is willing to help me with this.
