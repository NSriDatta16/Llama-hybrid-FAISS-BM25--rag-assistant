Is this an Autoregression or OLS?

Say I have a time series $y_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_t^{(i)}$. For example, $y_t$ can be the returns of the S&P 500 index at time $t$ and the $x^{(i)}_t$ is return of the $i^{th}$ company in the S&P 500 at time $t$ (notice this means $n = 500$). Now suppose instead of imposing a simple autoregressive structure on $y_t$, such as $$y_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} \dots + e_t$$ for white noise process $e_t$, we instead have the following $$y_t = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^{(i)}_1 x^{(i)}_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^{(i)}_2 x^{(i)}_{t-2} \dots + e_t$$ meaning each component series $x^{(i)}_t$ is allowed its own own parameter. My intuition tells me that, since the process $y_t$ is endogenous (in fact fully parametrized by) the $x^{(i)}_t$, this can't be considered a regression on exogenous regressors. So is this an autoregression? If it is an autoregression, what are the constraints that the $\phi$ parameters must satisfy for the model to be invertible? Also, a follow up question: Suppose that $y_t = f\left(x_t^{(1)}, x_t^{(2)},\dots, x_t^{(n)}\right)$ where $f$ is not necessarily linear, but is invertible (meaning all the $x^{(i)}_t$ play a role in explaining $y_t$). Does the answer change?
