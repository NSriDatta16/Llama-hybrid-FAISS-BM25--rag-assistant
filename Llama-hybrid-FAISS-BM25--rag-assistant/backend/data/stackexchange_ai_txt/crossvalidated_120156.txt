This tag applies to questions that ask to clarify situations when the same statistical model is being referred to under different names in different strands of literature, or when, worse, the same name is being applied to different models. Some examples of the first situation are: Longitudinal models of biostatstics are known as panel data models to econometricians. Mixed models of biostatistics are known as multilevel models to quantitative psychologists. Some examples of the second situation are: Hierarchical linear models mean multilevel/mixed models as described above to frequentists, and regression models with hyperpriors to Bayesians. Worse yet, the name has also been applied to systems of regression equations (aka simultaneous equations in econometrics, and directed acyclic graphs in causal inference). Fixed effect estimation means the fixed part $x'\beta$ of regression or ANOVA to statisticians, and the within-panel estimator for econometricians.
