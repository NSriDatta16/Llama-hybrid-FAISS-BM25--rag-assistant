How to derive a regression formula

In this paper: http://www.nber.org/papers/w19774.pdf , (ungated version here ) the author spells out the following regression ( equation 1 in the paper): $s_{ij} = \alpha + \beta \bar{s_j} + \epsilon_{ij},$ where $i$ is individual, $j$ is school, $s_{ij}$ is outcome for individual $i$ in school $j$, and $\bar{s_j}$ is the average outcome for individuals at school $j$. Note that $i$ is included in the average for his/her school, $\bar{s_j}$. How does the author come up with the left-hand side expression for $\hat{\beta}$ (reproduced below)? Also, what does $n_j$ mean? And why does this equal 1 ? I feel like more steps would help me grasp this better. $\frac{\sum_j \sum_i s_{ij} (\bar{s_j} - \bar{s})}{\sum_j n_j (\bar{s_j} - \bar{s})^2} = \frac{\sum_j (\bar{s_j} - \bar{s})(n_j \bar{s_j})}{\sum_j n_j( \bar{s_j} - \bar{s})^2} = 1 $ Note that page 195 of Mostly Harmless Econometrics has something very similar.
