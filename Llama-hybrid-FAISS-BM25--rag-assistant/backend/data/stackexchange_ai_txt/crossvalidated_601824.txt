How can Mass Spectrometry have high sensitivity but average reproducibility?

I am reading up on mass spec from this link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/metabolomics-introduction/designing-a-metabolomics-study/comparison-of-nmr-and-ms/ They state: The two most common techniques used in data acquisition are nuclear magnetic resonance and >mass spectrometry. Table 1 shows some of the key differences between the two techniques. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Mass spectrometry (MS) Sensitivity Low High Reproducibility Very high Average I suppose I can understand how a test can have low sensitivity, but high reproducibility - it gets the same positive samples correct/incorrect each time, with most being incorrect. But how can a test have high sensitivity but average reproducibility? Does this mean if I run the test once, it gets most positive samples correct, but if I run the test again it gets different samples correct - it does not seem possible to do both in my estimation but I would like to hear an explanation from someone with a better understanding.
