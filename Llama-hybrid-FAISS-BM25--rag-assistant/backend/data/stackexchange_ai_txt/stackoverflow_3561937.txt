Javascript/C#: Appearing Textarea OnClick

I have an html list. Within this list are a series of images, some information and a button. When the user clicks the button, I want a textarea and a button to appear below the associated image within the list. The user then fills out the textarea with some machine learning feedback and clicks the button to send a postback to the server. How do I write Javascript that will appear on a button press, but is still at the same time associated with the parent image? I would like an answer in straight Javascript, not jQuery, as I'm still learning Javascript. I'm using C# 4.0 and ASP.net. I have several possible implementation ideas: Create a Javascript function that writes html using Response.Write that contains the textarea and button. I couldn't use an asp:button so I don't really know how I would accomplish a postback. Have a single hidden asp:button and asp:textbox that get populated when the magic appearing button is pressed. The magic button would pass an id to the asp:button and activate a click. I might need a hidden label to store the value of the id. I think #2 is the best and probably easiest method, but I don't know the best way to make an appearing panel in Javascript.
