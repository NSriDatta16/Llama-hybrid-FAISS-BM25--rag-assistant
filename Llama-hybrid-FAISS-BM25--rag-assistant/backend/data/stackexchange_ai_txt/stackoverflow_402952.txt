I would recommend TRichView due to its world class support, and deep feature set. While it is not a true "HTML" editor, it does support the ability to export to HTML, even generating the appropriate CSS styles if necessary. I use it for handling the email portion of our main product and it works very well. Internally the storage is either RTF (extended to support images better), or as a proprietary format. There are plenty of examples of a simple editors which would easily suit your needs.
