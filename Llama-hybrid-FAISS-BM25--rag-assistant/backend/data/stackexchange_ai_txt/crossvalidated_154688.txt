I understand this question as involving both feature construction and dealing with the wealth of features you already have + will construct, relative to your observations ( N ). Feature Construction Expanding upon @yasin.yazici's comment, some possible ways to augment the data would be: PCA Auto-encoding Transform's such as log, powers, etc. Binning continuous variables into discrete categories (i.e., continuous variable is 1 SD above mean, 1 below mean, etc.) Composite variables (for example, see here ) I'm sure there are many more I'm missing. Feature Selection / Dimensionality reduction You may reduce dimensionality with techniques such as PCA (although perhaps not after augmenting your data with PCA variables). Alternatively, you may use algorithms that perform feature selection for you, such as lasso, random forest, etc.
