Is it possible to drag and drop an element from a different page to a Droppable?

I am trying to get the following requirement to work. I have a test page that has a Droppable area. "function(element) { alert(element) }", :url => { :action => "create" } )%> What I want to achieve, is to be able to drop any links from another browser tab/window onto the Droppable and record that link. Bear in mind that these links will be arbitrary and out of my control so I can't decorate them as Draggable. Is this achievable or am I barking up the wrong tree? TIA
