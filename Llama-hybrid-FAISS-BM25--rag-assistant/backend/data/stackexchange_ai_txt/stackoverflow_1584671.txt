I own a MacBook (intel core 2 duo processor) myself and would strongly discourage you to get an older model than that if you want to get reasonably up-to-date java support. (Java 1.6 does not work on older models as far as I know) I really like my macbook and it is a great development machine for me, but I have strong doubts on the java support (See for example http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2007/10/28/os-x-java-definitive-timeline/ ).
