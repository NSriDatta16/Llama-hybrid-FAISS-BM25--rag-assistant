"Does anyone knows how it is possible?" "It is possible" to have 679 times as much test code because a single feature can be used in many different ways. Consider just a single function that takes two parameters. I can generate alot of test code for that one function that tests boundary conditions and many other combinations of conditions. When you consider setup/teardown of the tests, there is additional code there. Depending on their testing framework this overhead may significantly add to the amount of code in testing. What it really boils down to is the fact the a piece of software can be used in so many different ways, which means that you have many different scenarios to test for. This is the beauty of elegant software, in that a simple program can be applied to numerous scenarios, but that is the same thing that makes verifying and testing software so challenging.
