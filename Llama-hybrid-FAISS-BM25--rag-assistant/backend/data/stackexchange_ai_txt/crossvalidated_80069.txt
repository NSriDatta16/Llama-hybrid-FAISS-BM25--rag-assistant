How did you calculate the UMVUE? Looks pretty intense... A few tips: Here is how the delta method goes: If you have some random variable $Y$ such that it is asymptotically normal e.g. $$\sqrt{n}(Y-\theta) \overset{D}{\longrightarrow} Z, \quad Z\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$ then $$\sqrt{n}(g(Y)-g(\theta)) \overset{D}{\longrightarrow} g'(\theta)Z, \quad Z\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$ Things to note: You can typically find a $Y$ by using the central limit theorem which often gives an asymptotically normal result about an average (e.g. $\bar{Y}$). Note that it is $g'(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is what you have to subtract from $Y$ so that it is asymptotically $N(0,\sigma^2)$. So for the geometric you might want to start off by noting that by the CLT $$ \sqrt{n}(\bar{Y} - 1/\theta) \overset{D}{\longrightarrow} Z, \quad Z\sim N\left(0,\dfrac{1-\theta}{\theta^2}\right)$$ Now note that if you wanted to get this to be a statement about your estimator $\tilde{\theta}$ your $g$ function will have to change $\bar{Y}$ to $\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. Also note that you will plug $1/\theta$ into $g$. I hope this helps.
