Convert Int List Into Integer

This is a bit of an odd case I must admit, but I'm trying to find a succinct and elegant way of converting a List into an actual int . For example, if my list contained entries 1, 2, and 3, then the final integer would be 123. The only other way I thought of doing it was converting the array to a string and then parsing the string. Any hints?
