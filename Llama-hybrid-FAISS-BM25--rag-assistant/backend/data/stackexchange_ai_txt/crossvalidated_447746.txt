Remember that a p-value does not tell you how different the truth is from what the null hypothesis asserts. What you’re looking for is called effect size. You’re allowed to get a statistically significant result and say, “Okay, but it isn’t interesting enough for me to care,” and this does not make you a lazy scientist or negligent statistician. So you’re allowed to say that your gigantic data set gave a very small p-value, one that convinces you that the null hypothesis is wrong, but that the effect is so small that you don’t care.
