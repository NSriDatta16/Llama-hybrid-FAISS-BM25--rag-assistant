currently the memory consumed by the program is unacceptable What is the meaning of unacceptable? Have you mesure it? What are the facts (number of objets, size of objects, used memory)? Have you check with FastMM if your programm has a memory leak? If not this is the first think you should do. If your lists often growing then perhaps you have a problem with memory fragmentation. Use the capacity property of the list (if possible). In this situation a linked list can help but a linked list needs more memory than TList (if capacity is used sensible). See How to monitor or visualize memory fragmentation of a delphi application for more Information how to check it. For Delphi At least, like Rob, I don't think that a change to records solve your problems.
