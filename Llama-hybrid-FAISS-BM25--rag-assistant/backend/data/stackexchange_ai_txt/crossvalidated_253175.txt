This process is known as "normalization" or "transformation" and is part of your feature engineering. Your problem applies to all machine learning algorithms, not just neural networks. We usually prefer [0,1], because they are easier to deal with. There's no rule on what and how to normalize, but you should think: Are my variables on a comparable scale? Does my machine learning require normalization? Is my variable discrete, should I transform it to continuous? You certainly shouldn't just divide your variables randomly to make it smaller. In your image classification, dividing by 255 is good because the whole range is in [0,1]. You can't have anything less than 0 and greater than 1.
