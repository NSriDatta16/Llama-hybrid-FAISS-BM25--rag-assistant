Optical character recognition is a well-studied problem with many possible solutions ( ressources ). CNNs have proven to work extremely well even for hand-written character recognition. Take a look at this two papers: Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten zip code Comparaison of Classifier Methods: A Case Study in Handwritten Digit Recognition Here is a beginner tutorial to do just that with Tensorflow. If you need extra data to train your model, take a look at the MNIST dataset .
