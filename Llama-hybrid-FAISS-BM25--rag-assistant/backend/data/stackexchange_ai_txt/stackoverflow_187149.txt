I would store the structure of the document using XML, and always apply some XSLT transformation before showing it in the web browser. That way the information can be adapted to different browsers, or other usages like displaying in a normal UI or exporting to some plain text document. The structure would have to be something meaningful, not only formatting information. Ideally it would be a representation of some domain-specific data model. Of course nothing stops you, if the meaningful information is the document structure, to define something like: SomeTitle Some Long paragraph text Another advantage of using XML in this context is that if your database supports it (like Oracle), you could query the contents of the text. We are assuming that the text is something that doesn't need to be queried often, or that the content is really for display purposes only. Otherwise it might be better normalize the database.
