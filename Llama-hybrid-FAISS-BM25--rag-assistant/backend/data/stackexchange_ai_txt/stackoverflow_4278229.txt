TreeViewDragDropTarget moves but not copy

I have a TreeView controll with it's ItemsSource bound to an ObservableCollection of my ViewModel. I have the TreeView wrapped by a TreeViewDragDropTarget, so that users can move nodes of the tree around, ala Windows Explorer. I have the TreeViewDragDropTarget AllowedSourceEffects set to Copy, Move. Howerver regardless of the user executing a copy action (drag with CTRL press) the action remains a Move. The ObservableCollection CollectionChanged events fire, first with a Remove and then an Add. What I would have hoped for is just the Add. Here's the Xmal. What am I missing?
