We are commonly using 3 main types of Data Sets when we train the Neural Network Model. Train , Dev and Test Set. Train Set is used to train the model . Dev Set ( Hold-out cross validation ) is used to evaluate trained model and tuning the Hyperparameters during the development process. Test Set is just used measure final performance of the final system as production level. FYI, difference between Dev and Test sets is the Dev Sets is used on the training the model , instead where the Test Sets only used to measure model's performance before deployment on real project. Train / Dev / Test Sets Distributions Train, Dev and Test sets should from same distribution and must be taken randomly from all the data. Choose Dev and Test set to reflect data you except to get in the future and consider important to do well. Size of Train, Dev and Test sets Setup the size of Test sets to give high confidence in the overall performance of the system. Dev sets has to be big enough to evaluate different ideas. If your dataset is small one, you can separate whole data into 60 / 20 / 20 or 70 / 15 / 15 would be good. If your dataset is enough to big such as millions or hundred of millions, then you can separate whole data into 98 / 1 / 1 or 99 / 0.5 / 0.5 . These theory is comes from one of the best Deep Learning course - DLS(Deep Learning Specialization) on Coursera. Hope this give you intuition how to use Train / Dev / Test sets to train your system as well. Best Regards.
