Dealing with over 1000 categorical values (which are also a unique identifiers)

I am preparing my dataset for a logistic regression and need to check how best to handle a column with categorical values. As the dataset is for sales transactions, the column in question is the unique product identifier - of which there are over 1000 unique values. To complicate matters, all but 5 of these values are 7-8 digit integers (the remainder are strings). Examples below *77789876* *2213_usd_99* Should I assign a unique integer 1 to 1374 to each of the original product codes, and then normalise the new int in order to get this to work? I did consider putting the product code in the index, however I am not sure that will work as ultimately, I am trying to predict the probability that it will be sold on a given date, so will need to pass it in as a variable later on. Any help or advice would be welcomed. UPDATE I tried a min max scaler an that ended up assigning the same values to multiple items i.e. 0.998
