Sequential Guid and fragmentation

I'm trying to understand how sequential guid performs better than a regular guid. Is it because with regular guid, the index use the last byte of the guid to sort? Since it's random it will cause alot of fragmentation and page splits since it will often move data to another page to insert new data? Sequential guid sine it is sequential it will cause alot less page splits and fragmentation? Is my understanding correct? If anyone can shed more lights on the subject, I'll appreciated very much. Thank you EDIT: Sequential guid = NEWSEQUENTIALID(), Regular guid = NEWID()
