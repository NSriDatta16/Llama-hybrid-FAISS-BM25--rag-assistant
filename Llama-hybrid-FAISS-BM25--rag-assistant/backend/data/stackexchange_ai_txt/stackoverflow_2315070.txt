You want deferred thread cancellation, which basically means that the threads terminate themselves as opposed to a thread manager cancelling threads asynchronously, which is much more ill-defined and dangerous. I you wanted to handle thread cancellation more elegantly than immediate termination, you can use signal handlers that are triggered by events outside the thread - by your thread manager perhaps.
