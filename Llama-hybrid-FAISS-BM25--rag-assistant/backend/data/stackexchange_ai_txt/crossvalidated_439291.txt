Can adf test and kpss test contradict?

I have a time series data for 18 months. To check for stationary I conducted adf test, to which my p value is 0.8. And kpss test has a p value of 0.1 , so at 95% confidence level I fail to reject null in both cases. That means my adf test confirm that data is non stationary whereas kpss test confirms my data as stationary. Why is that happening?
