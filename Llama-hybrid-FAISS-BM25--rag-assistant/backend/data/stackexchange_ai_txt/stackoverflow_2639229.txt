I also got it to work: datatype is the correct spelling -- it's shown that way in the example but it is inconsistent with everything else in the library so it was easy to get wrong I'm getting very tired chasing this sparse documentation around and I really feel like JSON, which is right and proper to be using in JavaScript, has really been given short coverage in favor of XML. Python and JavaScript together, through JSON, is a really strong combination, but it's a constant struggle with this particular library. Anyone with an alternative that: 1> Properly supports jQuery UI themes (including rounded corners!) ( http://datatables.net has much nicer support for themes) 2> Allows resizing of columns ( http://datatables.net doesn't support this out of the box) 3> Allows sub-grids ( http://datatables.net lets you do whatever you want here, through an event) please let me know. I'm spending more time on this one part of my interface than on the whole rest of it combined and it's all the time spent searching for working examples and "trying things" which is just getting annoying.
