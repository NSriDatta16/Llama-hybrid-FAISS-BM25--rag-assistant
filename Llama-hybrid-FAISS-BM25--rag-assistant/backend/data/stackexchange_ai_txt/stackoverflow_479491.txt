It's unclear whether you want the average to be aggregated over days or not. If you want a different average for midnight on the 26th vs midnight on the 27th, then modify Mabwi's query thus: SELECT AVG( value ) , thetime FROM hourly_averages GROUP BY DATE( thetime ), HOUR( thetime ) Note the additional DATE() in the GROUP BY clause. Without this, the query would average together all of the data from 00:00 to 00:59 without regard to the date on which it happened.
