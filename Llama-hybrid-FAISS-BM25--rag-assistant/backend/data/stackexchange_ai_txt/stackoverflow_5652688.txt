Well after some more research it seems that it isn't easily possible to use one 9-patch drawable for all screen densities. The link below states you need different drawables for each density: Custom Color Buttons for Android 3.1. Create images 9-patch images for the different colors that you need and put them into drawable-hdpi and drawable-mdpi (yes, you will need two versions if you want your buttons to look good on different devices). If anyone knows any different though, your help would be much appreciated.
