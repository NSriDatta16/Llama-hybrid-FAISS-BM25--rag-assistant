I make a wide berth around Windows, but you'll likely find the powerful scripting capabilities you're looking for in Windows PowerShell (see also Microsoft's documentation ). PowerShell takes an object-oriented approach to entities in the file system and elsewhere. It should be easy to whip up a script to do what you need, but you'd need to learn PowerShell first, of course. EDIT: Microsoft is offering a download for PowerShell for Windows XP and a few others, but I don't see one for Windows 7. Ah... Wikipedia says it's already integrated in Windows 7. So that should cover your requirements, and it's already on-board with the newest versions of Windows.
