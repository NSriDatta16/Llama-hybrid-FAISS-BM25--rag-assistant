It would be a lot nicer if javascript had namespaces built in, but I find that organizing things like Dustin Diaz describes here helps me a lot. var DED = (function() { var private_var; function private_method() { // do stuff here } return { method_1 : function() { // do stuff here }, method_2 : function() { // do stuff here } }; })(); I put different "namespaces" and sometimes individual classes in separate files. Usually I start with one file and as a class or namespace gets big enough to warrant it, I separate it out into its own file. Using a tool to combine all you files for production is an excellent idea as well.
