If you want to get the exact Euclidean difference then you're going to have to use all principal components. Of course, the main advantage of using PCA is that you don't lose much in the approximation if you drop off the components with the low eigenvalues. So if you were to drop the components with low eigenvalues you'd still get an approximation to the exact Euclidean distance, and if the eigenvalues on those components were low it should be quite a good approximation.
