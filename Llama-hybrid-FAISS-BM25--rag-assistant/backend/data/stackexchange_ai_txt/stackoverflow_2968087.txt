What is the most efficient way to keep track of all user traffic inside a database

Currently I am using mysql to log all traffic from all users coming into a website that I manage. The database has grown to almost 11m rows in a month, and queries are getting quite slow. Is there a more efficient way to log user information? All we are storing is their request, useragent, and their ip, and associating it with a certain website.
