Methods & CRAN packages to predict probability using neural networks or others machine learning algorithms

I have a medical database containing 7 input variables (4 are binary) and a binary outcome variable (Survival: yes/no). My objective is to train and test an algorithm that predict probability of survival (not a binary output). I used nnet package. But it returned for me a binary output (using "raw" and "class" type). Which method can i use? Is there any R CRAN Packages to predict probability of survival using neural networks or others machine learning algorithms? Thank you very much
