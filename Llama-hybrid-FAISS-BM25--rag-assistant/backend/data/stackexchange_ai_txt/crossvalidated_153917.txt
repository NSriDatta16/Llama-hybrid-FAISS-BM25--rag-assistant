Multinomial logistic regression, weighted logistic regression?

I have a binary predictor with many response variables. The binary predictor was originally continuous but was converted to binary ... if the response was $>1000$ then 1, else 0. I would like to have a model in which responses of greater magnitude are more likely be to 1 vs responses of lesser magnitude. I have also thought of splitting the response to more categories ... anyone have any ideas?
