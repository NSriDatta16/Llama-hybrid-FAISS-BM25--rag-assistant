you're trying to get 2 items of information out of the collection, when you only store 1 item of information in there. The easiest way to extend your current implementation is to store a struct instead of an int. So instead of: storage[temp] = count you'd do: storage[temp].linenumber = count; storage[temp].wordcount++; where the map is defined: struct worddata { int linenumber; int wordcount; }; std::map storage; print the results using: out first second.linenumber second.wordcount edit: use a typedef for the definitions, eg: typedef MYMAP std::map ; MYMAP storage; then MYMAP::iterator iter;
