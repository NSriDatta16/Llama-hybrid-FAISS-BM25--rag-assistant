How to compute derivative of activation function involving division

I am implementing a neural network a bit different from the standard architectures. Nevertheless, the implementation should be efficient and vectorized. Consider that a layer has an activation function ln(X) . Thus, backpropagation would compute the derivative 1/X . Now, that is the problem: how do I compute the division? I know I could multiply by the inverse of X , but this shouldn't work, since I can't guarantee that X is a square matrix. Any thoughts on this? Thank you!
