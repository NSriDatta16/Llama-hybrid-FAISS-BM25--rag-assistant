Nick D's Answer is better use islice . It doesn't make a copy of the list and essentially embeds your second (elegant but verbose) solution in a C module. import itertools head = data[0] result = head in itertools.islice(data, 1, None) for a demo: >>> a = [1, 2, 3, 1] >>> head = a[0] >>> tail = itertools.islice(a, 1, None) >>> head in tail True Note that you can only traverse it once but if all you want to do is check that the head is or is not in the tail and you're worried about memory, then I think that this is the best bet.
