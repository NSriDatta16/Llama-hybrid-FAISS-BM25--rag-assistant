LDA is used to carve up multidimensional space. PCA is used to collapse multidimensional space. PCA allows the collapsing of hundreds of spatial dimensions into a handful of lower spatial dimensions while usually preserving 70% - 90% of the important information. PCA: 3D objects cast 2D shadows. We can see the shape of an object from it's shadow. But we can't know everything about the shape from a single shadow. By having a small collection of shadows from different (globally optimal) angles, then we can know most things about the shape and size of an object. PCA helps reduce the ' Curse of Dimensionality ' when modelling. LDA is for classification, it almost always outperforms Logistic Regression when modelling small data with well separated clusters. It's also good at handling multi-class data and class imbalances.
