If you are managing the variables separately, why not go the route of an embeddable interpreter. I have used tcl in the past, but you might try lua which is designed for embedding. Ruby and Python are two other embeddable interpreters that are easy to embed, but aren't quite as lightweight. The strategy is to instantiate an interpreter (a context), add variables to it, then evaluate strings within that context. An interpreter will properly handle malformed input that could lead to security or stability problems for your application.
