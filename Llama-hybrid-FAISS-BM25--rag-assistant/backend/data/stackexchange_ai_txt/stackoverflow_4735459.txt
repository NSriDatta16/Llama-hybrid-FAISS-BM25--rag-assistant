In general, no - and this has little to do with Windows Phone 7 (although I don't know whether IsolatedStorageFileStream on WP7 even supports seeking). I don't know of any mainstream filesystems with high level abstractions (such as those used by Java and C#) which allow you to delete or insert data in the middle of a file. I suppose theoretically if you were happy to pad with whitespace, or never change the length of the data you're using, you could just overwrite the relevant bytes - but I don't think it would be a good idea at all. Very brittle and hard to work with. Just go for overwriting the whole file.
