Proper use of Beans in Java MVC

I'm trying to make a deliberate effort to write code that follows proper convention, even when it might add complexity, and so far I've succeeded but I'm noticing a trend in my programs. My project is small, a javaee webapp with only a handful of servlets, follows MVC design, and makes use of beans as the model. My problem is that my beans are more often just 'a place to stick something so I can get a decent view coded'. I got the impression that beans were of course just containers for data, but also meant to have some portability and usefulness beyond a single servlet. Is my problem just the result of relatively simple code or am I likely misusing the concept of a bean ?
