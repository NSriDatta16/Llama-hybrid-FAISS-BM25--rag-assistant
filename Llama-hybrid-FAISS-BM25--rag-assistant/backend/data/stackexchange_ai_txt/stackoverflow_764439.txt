Why binary and not ternary computing?

Isn't a three state object immedately capable of holding more information and handling larger values? I know that processors currently use massive nets of XOR gates and that would need to be reworked. Since we are at 64 bit (we can represent 2^63 possible states) computing the equivalent ternary generation could support number with 30 more tens places log(3^63-2^63). I imagine it is as easy to detect the potential difference between +1 and 0 as it is between -1 and 0. Would some compexity of the hardware, power consumption, or chip density offset any gains in storage and computing power?
