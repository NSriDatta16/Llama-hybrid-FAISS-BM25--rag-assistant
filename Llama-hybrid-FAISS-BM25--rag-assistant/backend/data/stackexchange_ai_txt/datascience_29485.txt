GAN discriminator converging to one output

I am running a GAN on the MNIST dataset. As the GAN continues to train, the quality of the generator seems to get worse, and it even seems as if it is starting to converge to just one value. Epoch 7: Epoch 21: Why is this happening? I am running the code from this repo here: https://github.com/bstriner/keras-adversarial/blob/master/examples/example_gan.py
