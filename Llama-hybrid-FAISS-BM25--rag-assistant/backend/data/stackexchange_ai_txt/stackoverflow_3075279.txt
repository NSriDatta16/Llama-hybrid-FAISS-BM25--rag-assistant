About to release code into the wild

I have a program I wrote and I have been encouraged by folks to release it into public. What would be the best way to go about it? Just dump it on a public site and hope for the best? How much criticism will come (on the standards, decisions made etc...) and how best to prepare for that. I have been the sole developer for this app for about two years. And how much difference does the license (GPL, MIT etc...) practically make? Any experiences?
