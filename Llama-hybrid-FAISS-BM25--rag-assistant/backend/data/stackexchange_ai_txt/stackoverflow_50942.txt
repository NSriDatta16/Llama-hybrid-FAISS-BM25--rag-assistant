We want to keep our package configs in a database table, we know it gets backuped with our other data and we know where to find it. Just a preference. I have found that to get this to work I can use an environment variable configuration to set the connection string of the connection manager that I am reading my package config from. (Although I had to restart the SQL Server agent before it could find the new environment variable. Not ideal when I deploy this to Production) Looks Like when you run an SSIS package as a step in a scheduled task it works in this order: Load each of the Package Configs in the order they appear in the Package Configuations Organiser Set the Connection Strings from the Data sources tab in the Job Step properties of the Scheduled Job Start running package. I would have expected the first 2 to be the other way around so that I can set the data source for my package config from the scheduled job. That is where I would expect other people to look for it when maintaining the package.
