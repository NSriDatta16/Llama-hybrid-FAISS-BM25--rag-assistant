Read PDF through Java and get the HTML Content

I want to read an existing PDF file, get not only the text, but also the format information like: Font (Bold, Italic),paragraphs,images, tables. Basically I want to write an HTML similar to PDF. Is there an code library for doing this? I am looking for an Open Source Library. Regards, Tina Agrawal
