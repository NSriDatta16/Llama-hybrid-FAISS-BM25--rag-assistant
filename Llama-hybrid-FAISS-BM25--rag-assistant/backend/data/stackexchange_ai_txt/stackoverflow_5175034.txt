cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'init-param'

This is my web.xml xsd Here is servlet node spring1 org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet 1 contextConfigLocation /WEB-INF/spring-servlet.xml On the marked line xml validator says cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'init-param'. One of '{" http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee ":enabled, " http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee ":async-supported, " http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee ":run-as, " http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee ":security-role-ref, " http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee ":multipart-config}' is expected. What is wrong and how do I correct this error?
