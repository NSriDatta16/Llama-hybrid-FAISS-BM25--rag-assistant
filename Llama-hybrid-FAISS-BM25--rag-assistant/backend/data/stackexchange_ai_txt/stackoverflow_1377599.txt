core data or sqlite or plist files

I have a situation where I need to store the data in local (iphone) and the same data will be in the web server to be accessed by other users (like sending messages) . For the web server part I am not worrying, I created all the tables and relations. but I am worrying about Iphone side data storage and sync both sides correctly. Here is an example of how I want to use A table in both sides (iphone and web server) Messages table with : message ID (primary key with incremental) , user ID c(12) and message text C(100) I can able to send the user ID and message text to the web server(by using URL) and get the primary key of the message ID from the web server. Now my dilemma is populating the unique ID's(primary key) for each record in each table (will be an Integer ) weather in iphone side or In web server database ? Thanks In advance. Sridhar
