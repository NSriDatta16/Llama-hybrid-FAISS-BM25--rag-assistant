Isn't this sort of situation exactly what BigDecimal is for? Edited to add: "Per the second-last paragraph, I would prefer to avoid BigDecimals if possible for performance reasons." â€“ sanity "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Knuth There is a simple solution practically made to order for your problem. You are concerned it might not be fast enough, so you want to do something complicated that you think will be faster. The Knuth quote gets overused sometimes, but this is exactly the situation he was warning against. Write it the simple way. Test it. Profile it. See if it's too slow. If it is then start thinking about ways to make it faster. Don't add all this additional complex, bug-prone code until you know it's necessary.
