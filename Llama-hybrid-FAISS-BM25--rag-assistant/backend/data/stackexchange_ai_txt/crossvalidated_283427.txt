Examples of how statistical models can be helpful

I want to design something. In the process of the design I face a variable that is random and unknown to me. Using machine learning methods (e.g. Bayesian learning) I managed to find the probability density function (pdf) of this variable. Now I have a general question. What can I do with this pdf and what usually people do with pdfs. If I want to use only expectation of this random variable I did not need to go into this trouble finding PDF. Can you give me some examples of application of PDF in machine learning. If I have statistical model for any phenomena I only know the probabilities but I do not know exactly what will happen. So how can that help me? Can you give me some examples?
