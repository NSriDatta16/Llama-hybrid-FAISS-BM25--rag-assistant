The works of Minka ( Automatic choice of dimensionality for PCA , 2000) and of Tipping & Bishop ( Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis ) regarding a probabilistic view of PCA might provide you with the framework you interested in. Minka's work provides an approximation of the log-likelihood $\mathrm{log}\: p(D|k)$ where $k$ is the latent dimensionality of your dataset $D$ by using a Laplace approximation; as stated explicitly : " A simplification of Laplace's method is the BIC approximation. " Clearly this takes a Bayesian viewpoint of your problem that is not based on the information theory criteria (KL-divergence) used by AIC. Regarding the original "determination of parameters' number" question I also think @whuber's comment carries the correct intuition.
