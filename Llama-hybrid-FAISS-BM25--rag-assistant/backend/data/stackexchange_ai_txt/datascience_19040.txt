clustering multivariate time-series datasets

I am new to clustering.i have data from quality testing of an automobile manufacturing company. I have 100000 datasets.each dataset has 4 variables force, voltage, current, distance. each variable is a continuous time-series with 8000 data points each(1 to 17000 milliseconds). the length of time series differs from on dataset to another. all variables in one dataset has to be compared with another dataset I have to find clusters in the 100000 datasets based on similarities in shape of each variable in a dataset. which type of measuring best suits, in this case, to find similarity in shape of time-series
