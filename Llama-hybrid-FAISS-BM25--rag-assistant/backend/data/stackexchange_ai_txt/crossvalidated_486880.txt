Is the GAN min-max loss function a convex optimization problem?

The GAN loss function is binary cross entropy consisting of a discriminator function $D(x)$ and generator function $G(z)$ . $$ \min_{G} \max_{D} V(D,G)=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))] $$ is it solved with linear programming? dynamic programming? or convex optimization, and if so quadratic programming? how can you tell
