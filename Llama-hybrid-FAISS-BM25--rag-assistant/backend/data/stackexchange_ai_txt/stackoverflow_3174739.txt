could you try to remove the @JoinTable annotation and see if it works? I assume you have all the setter/getters in the beans (if not, add them!). I believe the issue is in that fragment of code, as it has worked for me without it. Also, I don't understand this limitation in the code you mention: ... @JoinColumn(name="personId", unique = true) ... To me it seems like that should be OneToMany, not ManyToMany...
