You've started the clock at static-initialisation time, and your C++ standard library may have more work to do during static initialisation. You're also flushing your stream repeatedly, and iostreams are a bit slow. Do this: #include #include int main() { std::clock_t start = std::clock(); for (int i=0;i (std::clock()-start)/CLOCKS_PER_SEC) A proper benchmark would involve you running this program a number of times and then taking the average of the results. The results you have are not at all reliable. (Also notice how I changed time.h to its C++ counterpart, ctime .)
