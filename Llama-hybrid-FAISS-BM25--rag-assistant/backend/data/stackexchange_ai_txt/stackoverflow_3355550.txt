You cannot know for certain which page a user is viewing, but you can keep track of which page they last viewed. Every time you deliver a page to a user, record that page's path in a database row associated with them. Voila. To keep the number of guests, I suggest tracking the number of distinct unauthenticated IP/HTTP-User-Agent combinations seen on a certain page in the last X minutes.
