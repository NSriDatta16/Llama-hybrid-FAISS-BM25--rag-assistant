What's the most efficient way to do these two foreach-loops?

i'm not sure this is the best way to do the following code. I'm not sold on a foreach inside another foreach. Could this be done *better** with Linq? *I understand that better could be either a) more performant b) easier to read / more elegant c) all of the above NOTE: .NET 3.5 solutions accepted :) NOTE2: the two IList's were the results of a multi-recordset stored procedure, via Linq2Sql. here's the make believe code: // These two lists are the results from a IMultipleResults Linq2Sql stored procedure. IList carList = results.GetResult ().ToList(); IList people = results.GetResult ().ToList(); // Associate which people own which cars. foreach(var person in people) { var cars = (from c in cars where c.CarId == person.CarId select c).ToList(); foreach (var car in cars) { car.Person = person; } } Cheers :)
