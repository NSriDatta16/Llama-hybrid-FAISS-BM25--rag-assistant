How to compare two time series with a GAM?

I recently got comments back from a review who suggested I use a gam to compare two time series to see what the trends are and if the two time series are different from one another. I'm am trying to figure out how this would work, as combining two time series seems misleading. Here is some made up example data: years =c(rep(2002:2020,2)) datatype=c(rep("DataSource1",19),rep("DataSource2",19)) ratio=c(3.6,5.3,2.5,6.8,8.5,4.3,2.5,9.1,5.2,4.3,1.0,2.8,2.36,5.3,2.8,5.6,7.4,5.8,6.5,0.23,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.24,0.56,0.89,0.78,0.35,0.21,1.8,1.4,0.25,0.68,0.23,0.45,0.67,0.58,0.68) df Basically, I have a time period from 2020 to 2020. For each of those years, I calculated a ratio based off of datasource 1 and datasource 2. Datasource 1 obviously had a higher ratio than datasource2. For my analyses, I took a linear regression of each datasource to see if the ratio was increasing or decreasing over time. I also ran a Kruskal Wallis test to compare the ratios between datasource 1 and datasource 2. I am now trying to compare the two using a gam, as the review pointed out that maybe the ratios do not follow a linear trend. Here is my gam code: gam1 with the output Family: gaussian Link function: identity Formula: ratio ~ s(years, bs = "tp") + datatype Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 4.8242 0.3601 13.40 5.80e-15 *** datatypeDataSource2 -4.2216 0.5093 -8.29 1.33e-09 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Approximate significance of smooth terms: edf Ref.df F p-value s(years) 2.709 3.371 0.899 0.499 R-sq.(adj) = 0.651 Deviance explained = 68.6% GCV = 2.8123 Scale est. = 2.4638 n = 38 I see that the datasource is important and not the year. I thought about doing an interaction term but that would negate the use of the gam. I guess I'm asking if this method makes sense? For some reason I think it is not correct but I'm trying to follow the reviewers suggestions.
