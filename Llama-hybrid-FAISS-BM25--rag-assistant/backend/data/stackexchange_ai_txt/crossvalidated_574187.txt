parallel lines (cluster) in PCA plots (PC1 vs PC2)

There are about 20 subjects, 3 treatment groups, and 1000+ genes in my data; the 1000+ genes were processed in two batches. Could anyone comment on why I am seeing parallel lines/clusters in the PCA plots? The plots strike me as funny because The way the analyte was processed shouldn't differ by batch. But why am I seeing two clusters that are perfectly aligned with batch? PCA doesn't create lines, so I think the lines represent some hidden, non-random pattern in the original data that are revealed by PCA after transformation. What kind of raw data would become lines after running PCA? . Also, "lines" in the PCA plot suggest PC1 and PC2 are linearly correlated...but isn't PC1 supposed to orthogonal to PC2?
