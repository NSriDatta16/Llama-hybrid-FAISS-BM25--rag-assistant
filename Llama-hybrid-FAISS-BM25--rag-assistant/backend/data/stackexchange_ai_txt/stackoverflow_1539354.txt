Generally speaking, I discourage non-standard behaviour of standard controls... so this is really borderline. I'd probably look for a way to refactor the UI to make it more intuitive for the user, who will expect a context menu to close itself after selecting one of the menu items. In this situation, if you're modifying the properties of a row in the grid, for example, you could use a Properties (modal) dialog box that gets opened from the context menu; or, implement something like the Visual Studio Properties window, where it updates itself depending on the selection context. Both of these solutions are more flexible and will provide better feedback to the user than a simple context menu.
