Performing PCA for normal score transformed data

In an attempt to improve the results of Bayesian NNT, I transformed the 7 variables that I have into normal scores (subtracted the mean and divided by SD). Then I used a PCA on the transformed variables to generate new 7 PCs. I used these PCs to run the Bayesian NNT and the classification results improved a little bit. My question is is this statistically valid and applicable or does it violate some fundamental statistical rules?
