Analyze misclassifications

I've trained a classification model (XGBoost) but I'm having some issues with misclassification (especially false positive). I want to analyze the misclassified observations to see if the model misses any aspects of the data. What is a feasible method to do so? I've been thinking about conducting logistic regression where the dependent variable will be a variable indicating if the observation was misclassified or not (all, false negative, false positive). Is that an appropriate approach? Thanks!
