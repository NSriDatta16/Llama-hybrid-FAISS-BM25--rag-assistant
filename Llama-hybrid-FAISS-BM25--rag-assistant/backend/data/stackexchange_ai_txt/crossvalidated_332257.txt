Converting survey results from a 1-4 scale average to a 1-5 scale average

I'm completely new at analyzing survey answers, and it will be great if anybody can help me out here with conversion technique. Survey participants were provided answer choices on a ranking scale of 1-4 and we got the average. We're trying to change the ranking scale to 1-5. I understand that there are different schools of thoughts that participants would have responded differently if they'd been given a different range of scale, but it needs to be converted. I keep thinking that there must be a formula that can be applied to this, but I cannot come up with it. For instance, if average score is 3.4, what kind of arithmetic formula should I use to get an average score on the 1-5 scale? Any insight will be greatly appreciated & thank you so much!
