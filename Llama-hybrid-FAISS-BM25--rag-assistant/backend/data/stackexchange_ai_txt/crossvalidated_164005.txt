It appears that there are only two outcomes in this situation: either the server gets a point or he doesn't (yes/no). As long as the Response Variable only has two possibilities (yes/no, 0/1, etc), logistic regression will work (under most conditions). The explanatory variables don't have any restrictions, they can be either numerical or categorical. Just make sure you're sample size is large enough to provide accurate results (it's good practice that each yes/no in the response have a number >10*(p-1), where p is the number of covariates + 1 (for the intercept)). There requires some set up in R to get your data transformed into usable form for glm to read it, but the glm(,data, family = "binomial") is a good starting point. Here is a good tutorial/article on how to set up Logistic Regression in R Here
