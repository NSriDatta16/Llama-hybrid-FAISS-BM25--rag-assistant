The law of total covarianc e says: \begin{align} Cov(A,B) &= E_G\{Cov(A,B)|G\} + Cov_G(E\{A|G\},E\{B|G\}) \end{align} In your application, the conditioning variable is G, gender. There are two terms. The first term is sometimes called the within term. It is easy to understand. If $A$ and $B$ are correlated within the population of men and are also correlated within the population of women, then it seems reasonable that $A$ and $B$ should be correlated in the overall population according to an average of these two covariances. This is what the first term says. It is the average of the covariance, within men, between $A$ and $B$ and the covariance, within women, between $A$ and $B$. You would calculate: \begin{align} E_G\{Cov(A,B)|G\} &= P\{G=Male\} \cdot Cov(A,B|G=Male)\\ &+ P\{G=Female\} \cdot Cov(A,B|G=Female) \end{align} The two covariances within each gender you can calculate with your data. If you are thinking of a target population which is 50\% male and 50\% female, then you just set the two probabilities that way. If you are wanting to describe your sample, then you set the two probabilities according to how they are in your sample. But, there is the second term, the between term (or the "composition effects" term). Even if $A$ and $B$ are uncorrelated within men and uncorrelated within women, they may be correlated in the overall population. How? Maybe $A$ is higher among men and $B$ is higher among women. This would give a negative correlation between the two. Anyway, calculate this second term as (abbreviating male as $M$ and female as $F$): \begin{align} Cov_G(E\{A|G\},E\{B|G\}) &= E\{A|G=M\} \cdot E\{B|G=M\} \cdot P\{G=M\} \\ &+ E\{A|G=F\} \cdot E\{B|G=F\} \cdot P\{G=F\} \\ &-\left(E\{A|G=M\}P\{G=M\}+E\{A|G=F\}P\{G=F\}\right) \cdot \left(E\{B|G=M\}P\{G=M\}+E\{B|G=F\}P\{G=F\}\right) \end{align} So, to decompose a population covariance using gender as a conditioning variable, you are going to break up the population covariance into three pieces---ie the population covariance is going to be the weighted sum of three pieces: The covariance between $A$ and $B$ among males The covariance between $A$ and $B$ among females The covariance coming from any average differences between $A$ and $B$ between males and females
