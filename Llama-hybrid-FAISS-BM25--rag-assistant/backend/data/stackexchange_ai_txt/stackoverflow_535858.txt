If you want to store application configuration settings , you can leverage the 'AppSettings' in the App.Config or Web.Config file depending on if its a windows or web application.

If you need to store information about users or other repeated entities in your system, you will need to build a database and write code to persist / read data to / from the database. You could make a class serializable and automatically serialize it to XML or Binary, OR you could use a SQL database. There are many .net technologies for accesing databases just look up ADO.net , LINQ and the Entity Framework.
