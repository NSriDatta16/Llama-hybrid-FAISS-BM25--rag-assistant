Depends what yoiu mean by waste. Making a calumn NULLable means that a Null Inidicator of some sort needs to be stored, I am not sure about MySql but in other DBMSes I know its a smallint with where '1' inidicates null and '0' inidcates the presence of a value. This extra two bytes gets carried around with the column value wherever it goes. So you will have a two bytes per nullable column stored, in the buffer, and in the structure presented to you program, plus in any index which references the column. So in your example above 20 bytes more disk storage and perhaps 60 bytes of memory has been "wasted". If this worries you then you should probably be coding everything in assembler and using raw disk IO.
