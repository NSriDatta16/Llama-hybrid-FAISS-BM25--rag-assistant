I will say that yes anything "CAN" be replicated, but the amount of time to do it might be a big bottle neck right away. I am going to assume that your current application is an ASP.NET application and that you are not moving from WinForms. (If you are the answers are still pretty much the same...but I might add a few extra comments). Out of the box, with drag and drop functionality from a UI perspective you have data validation and many other general out of the box items, that although they are done clientside you don't have to write a single line of JavaScript to get them working. This is a big cost saver, but can it be replicated elsewhere, yes, but it takes time. Secondly you have the very easy to work with ASP.NET AJAX functionality combined with the AJAX Control Toolkit. These again allow you to use .NET logic to put things together, but can they be replicated? Yes, jQuery and many other AJAX frameworks contain similar items to a lot of items. The biggest point that I have to make is that if you already have something and are familiar with the language and technology behind it, why scrap it, risk not getting done on time, and enter an unknown world of a new language. That is just my $0.02 I guess.
