You could use it for bitmasks to encode combinations of things. Basically, it works by giving each bit a meaning, so if you have 00000000 , each bit represents something, in addition to being a single decimal number as well. Let's say I have some preferences for users I want to store, but my database is very limited in terms of storage. I could simply store the decimal number and derive from this, which preferences are selected, e.g. 9 is 2^3 + 2^0 is 00001001 , so the user has preference 1 and preference 4. 00000000 Meaning Bin Dec | Examples │││││││└ Preference 1 2^0 1 | Pref 1+2 is Dec 3 is 00000011 ││││││└─ Preference 2 2^1 2 | Pref 1+8 is Dec 129 is 10000001 │││││└── Preference 3 2^2 4 | Pref 3,4+6 is Dec 44 is 00101100 ││││└─── Preference 4 2^3 8 | all Prefs is Dec 255 is 11111111 │││└──── Preference 5 2^4 16 | ││└───── Preference 6 2^5 32 | etc ... │└────── Preference 7 2^6 64 | └─────── Preference 8 2^7 128 | Further reading http://www.weberdev.com/get_example-3809.html http://stu.mp/2004/06/a-quick-bitmask-howto-for-programmers.html Why should I use bitwise/bitmask in PHP? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_%28computing%29
