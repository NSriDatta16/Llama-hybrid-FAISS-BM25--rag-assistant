Can you even enumerate all data augmentation options? The options are endless: rotate by 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 1 degree, 1.1, degrees, 1.12 degrees etc. increase saturation by 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2.5%, 2.4% etc. and so on. That puts a practical limitation on how you could look at "all options". You could do a specific subset (10°, 20°, 30°... and 5%, 10%, 15%...) and then implement all permutations, but to some extent natural variation in angles etc. does not necessarily come in specific increments. You might even worry that too regular a set of augmentations (applied in the same way to all images) may become a feature a neural network could memorize/exploit somehow. So why not draw random numbers for how to augment? If you do it often enough, you can span about the same range of possibilities as you would by enumerating the combinations of a fixed set of options in any case. Also, if you draw the augmentation randomly, you can keep drawing "new" images endlessly (if necessary for training).
