Guidance for picking likelihood in Bayesian analysis

I'm doing a Bayesian analysis for a time series response and wonder whether it is possible to get the likelihood function without making distributional assumptions. I suppose my response is log-normal, but what if I do not want to make distributional assumptions? My setting is a multi-armed bandit problem, so while my pay-off is log-normal, I could also define a discrete variable whether the pay-off increased from the last period to the current period. Then I would be in a binomial setting. Hence, it is not obvious which likelihood to go for. Is there a way to let the data decide what the likelihood is? So some form of non-parametric likelihood?
