This is a tough problem mostly because you have no way to identify customers. You would have to make some very strong assumptions about who comes into the store and when in order to perform the inference. For example, suppose you run a hardware store. How would you distinguish actual improvement in sales vs. one contractor coming in and buying his/her materials over the course of a week just by looking at sales data? It would be hard. Those problems aside, you have to ask what you want to know. Are you interested in increasing total sales, or average basket? Basket is easier to analyze since you are looking at transaction level data, where as total sales would likely require some sort of difference in difference design in which you need data from several months/weeks (depending on the time frame). So I guess this is a question back to you: What specifically do you want to test? Avg basket, total sales per month, etc. What are you trying to improve?
