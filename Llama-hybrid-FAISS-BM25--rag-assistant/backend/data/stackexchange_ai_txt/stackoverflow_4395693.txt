Determine When App Receives ANY User Interaction

I am writing an iphone app and I am trying to perform an action when the user interacts with the phone in any way. E.g. I am fading out some user interface elements (buttons) and I only want them to show when the user tries to do something. E.g. in android there is a method called onUserInteraction. I have tried just overriding touchesBegan in my UIViewController, but this seems to only be called sporadically. Any Ideas?
