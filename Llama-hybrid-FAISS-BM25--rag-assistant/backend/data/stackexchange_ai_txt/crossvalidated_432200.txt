1) No. I recall normality condition is needed only for small sample (finite sample) cases. For large samples, asymptotic normality holds given some assumptions. (See Halbert White, Asymptotic theory for econometricians. Sorry for non-Statistic biased recommendation) "Large" is ambiguous, but often say something like N>30. I suspect this came from t-dist and normal dist, that t-dist(N>30) becomes close enough to normal dist. Maybe you will find about this in Statistics. At least I haven't heard of Econometrics, though. 2) Though I don't have a clear answer for this, I guess this is coming from robust estimators' distributions being less trivial with finite samples. In this case, bootstrapped p-value can be used instead. One resamples, estimate coefficient in order to get "empirical distribution of coefficient". Then p-value can be calculated. (reference: Wooldridge, Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data - sorry again for the "tilt")
