They did as they did because they wanted a typed iterator for a non-generic collection. Edit foreach works since the compiler does some "magic" Try this with your changed code: var enumerator = peopleList.GetEnumerator(); while (enumerator.MoveNext()) Console.WriteLine(enumerator.Current.firstName); //compile error. It will not compile, you have to cast the enumerator to PeopleEnum or change back the return type. Edit 2 You can read about foreach's implicit type casting here: http://www.dev102.com/2009/07/28/pay-attention-to-the-foreach-implicit-casting/ http://csharpindepth.com/ViewNote.aspx?NoteID=1 And in the specification: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308966.aspx Scroll down to last section in 26.1
