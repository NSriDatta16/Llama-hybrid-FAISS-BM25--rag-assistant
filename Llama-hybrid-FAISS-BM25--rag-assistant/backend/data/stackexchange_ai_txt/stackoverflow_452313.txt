You sound like you might also want Symbol.to_proc (code by Raganwald ) class Symbol # Turns the symbol into a simple proc, which is especially useful for enumerations. def to_proc Proc.new { |*args| args.shift.__send__(self, *args) } end end Now you can do: (1..100).inject(&:+) Disclaimer: I am not a Rubyist. I just like functional programming. So this is likely to be un-Ruby-like.
