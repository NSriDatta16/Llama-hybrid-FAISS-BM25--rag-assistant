It looks this problem isn't completely specified. In particular, you need to distinguish within-ship variability from between-ship variability. Within-ship variability is how much a single ship's speed varies over time, whereas between-ship variability is how the relationship between time and speed varies across ships. In particular, it isn't clear to me whether "your data-minded employer" is talking about the within- or between-ship variability in the normal distribution he describes. By the way, you keep writing "velocity", but it seems that you mean "speed", since we're not considering the ships' direction of movement here. An object's velocity comprises its speed and its direction of movement. Edit: From your comment, it looks like the employer is only reporting the distribution of trip times (divided by the trip length, 3,000 nmi, to get average speeds), and you assume that all ships have the same distribution of trip times. It also seems that while we know that ships speed up and slow down quite a bit, not to mention changing direction, we don't have much information about the pattern of this over time. For example, it might be that if the ship is moving especially fast today, then tomorrow it's likelier to be fast than slow. But we don't have any data about this from previous voyages, so let's assume not. Then, in the mid-voyage problem, when we're estimating how fast the ship will go for the remainder of the voyage, we can ignore the ship's previous performance; we just need to know how much distance of the trip is left, and multiply that by the distribution of average speeds. Hence, the posterior completion time for the whole voyage is simply $T = t_0 + \frac{3,000\text{ mni} - d}{X}$ where $t_0$ is the time taken so far, $d$ is the distance traveled so far, and $X \sim \operatorname{Normal}(300\text{ nmi / week}, 50\text{ nmi / week})$. The posterior average speed is then $3,000\text{ nmi} / T$.
