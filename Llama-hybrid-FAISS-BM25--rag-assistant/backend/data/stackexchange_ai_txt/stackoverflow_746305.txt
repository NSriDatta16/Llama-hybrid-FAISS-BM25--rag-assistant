I've found that the best way to handle this sort of requirement is to just maintain a log of VehicleEvents, one of which would be ChangeOwner. In practice, you can derive the answers to all the questions posed here - at least as accurately as you are collecting the events. Each record would have a timestamp indicating when the event occurred. One benefit of doing it this way is that the minimum amount of data can be added in each event, but the information about the Vehicle can accumulate and evolve. Also, with the timestamp, events can be added after the fact (as long as the timestamp accurately reflects when the event occurred. Trying to maintain historical state for something like this in any other way I've tried leads to madness. (Maybe I'm still recovering. :D) BTW, the distinguishing characteristic here is probably that it's a Time Series or Event Log, not that it's 1:m.
