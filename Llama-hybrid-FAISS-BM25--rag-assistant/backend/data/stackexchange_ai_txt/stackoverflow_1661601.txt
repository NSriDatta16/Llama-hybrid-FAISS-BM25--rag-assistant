Some observations. First, the IE8 behavior on you describe on "#moveContact" is for normal mode only. If you hit "compatibility mode", the broken page icon to the right of the URL box, you get a different (and still wrong) behavior. Second, the way you include jquery is like this: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js I would encourage you to supply your own copy of jQuery. You can do that here . I would go for the latest 1.3.2. That may fix your problem. I notice that the release notes for 1.3 show testing against IE7 as the latest IE.
