As far as I know, it is not possible to configure your library to start a thread automatically, you have to define a class as starting point. Using Maven you can create an executable jar: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/executable-jar.html In your main class, simple use: ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("classpath:myspring-context.xml"); context.registerShutdownHook(); For threads, you can try either implementing the runnable interface, and initialize a bean which starts the threads using spring task executors. A more elegant solution that I can suggest is however creating your thread as a pojo and then using spring task scheduler, as follows: I hope it will be helpful.
