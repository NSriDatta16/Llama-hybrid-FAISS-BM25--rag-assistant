I have not seen any rule of thumb at any reliable source but there are a few common preferences that I haven seen while working with most developers. There are a few things that help you make the namespaces. Domain of the class Is it a class or an interface (I have seen some developers prefer namespaces like ShopApp.Model.Interfaces ). Works really well if your interfaces are some service or data contract. Dont have namespaces that are too deep, 3 (.) is enough. More than that may get annoying. Be open to reorganize namespace if at anytime u feel it has become illogical or hard to manage. Do not create namespaces just for the sake of it.
