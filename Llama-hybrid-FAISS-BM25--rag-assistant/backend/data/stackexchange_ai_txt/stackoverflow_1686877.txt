mkdir(name, mode) Exception Type: OSError at /admin/products/photo/add/ but your application is deployed at /var/www/django_projects/gangr/../gangr/ Do you have a directory path set to an absolute path "/admin/products/photo/add/" rather than something relative like "admin/products/photo/add/"? Check the MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL in your settings.py file. http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#media-root
