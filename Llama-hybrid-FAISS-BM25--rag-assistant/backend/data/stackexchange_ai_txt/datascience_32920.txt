selecting a number of neurons specifically for RL

If I would like to use DQN to train my Reinforcement-Learning agent, how do I select the number of neurons? In Supervised Learning, selecting too few or too many can result in either a too low potential (lack of neurons) or in a poor generalization due to overfitting (for example, due to too many neurons). We can use Genetic Algorithm to determine the best combination of hyperparameters instead of trying by hand. However, in RL - is generalization even a thing? After all, we are training a spider to run by moving its limbs in a most efficient way, an arm to grab a box in the fastest way, etc. Once learnt, are we even allowed to change the environment and expect agent to perform well, generalizing to new environment? And thus, is selecting neurons even a thing for RL, or can we just give it a maximum possible number of neurons and layers, letting it learn correct movement of creature's limbs?
