[a function], which takes two String arguments and does soem file writing stuff As others have suggested, you can place that function in a separate class, which both your existing classes could then access. Others have suggested calling the class Utility or something similar. I recommend not naming the class in that manner. My objections are twofold. One would expect that all the code in your program was useful. That is, it had utility , so such a name conveys no information about the class. It might be argued that Utility is a suitable name because the class is utilized by others. But in that case the name describes how the class is used , not what it does . Classes should be named by what they do, rather than how they are used, because how they are used can change without what they do changing. Consider that Java has a string class, which can be used to hold a name, a description or a text fragment. The class does things with a "string of characters"; it might or might not be used for a name, so string was a good name for it, but name was not. So I'd suggest a different name for that class. Something that describes the kind of manipulation it does to the file, or describes the format of the file.
