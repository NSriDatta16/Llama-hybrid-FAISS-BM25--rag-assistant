What does it mean (non) convex "constraint"?

I was referring SVM section of Andrew Ng's course notes for Stanford CS229 Machine Learning course. On page 16, he says: SVM optimization problem can be given as follows: $$\begin{align} \max_{\gamma,w,b}\gamma \\ s.t. & \quad y^{(i)}(w^Tx+b) \geq\gamma, \quad i=1,...,n \\ & \quad \Vert w \Vert =1. \\ \end{align} $$ But the " $\Vert w \Vert$ " constraint is a nasty (non-convex) one, ... I am unable to understand why the constraint $\Vert w \Vert$ is non-convex. PS: I understand the basic definition of convex "function" and I have not delved any deep in optimization theory.
