What is the SQL behind idjAdapter.Update() and how was it generated? Did you use the drag/drop designer in Visual Studio? If you did, then you will want to check the auto-generated update script? In my experience with the designer code in the MS SQL world, it will often include a very complicated WHERE statement where it only updates if every single old field of the row still exists. If your table happens to contain an auto-generated time stamp field, or something similar, then you can run into issues with two users where this field may get updated behind your back, and so the WHERE in the update will fail, causing this concurrency exception to be thrown by the adapter. You will then need to decide how to handle the issue. If you simply want to have last in wins logic, then you need to manually change the Update SQL in the designer (from the properties window of the designer for that table adapter) to only include your primary key for the table in the WHERE clause of the Update statement.
