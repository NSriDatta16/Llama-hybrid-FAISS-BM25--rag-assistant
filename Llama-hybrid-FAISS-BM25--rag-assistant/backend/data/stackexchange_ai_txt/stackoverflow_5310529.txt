Indexed properties in javascript

(I can't believe this isn't possible, but I'm probably not using the right search terms) I have a 'class' like this: function MyClass() = { this.getItem = function(key) { // return whatever; }; this.setItem = function(key, val) { // set whatever }; }; Is there someway that I can get/set via (what I think is called) an indexed property? var test = new MyClass(); test["key"] = "value"; alert(test["key"]); (Context, if it makes any difference, I'm trying to wrap localStorage in a class which adds a prefix to all keys. Wrapping setItem/getItem is easy. I just wanted to go further and wrap the [] functionality)
