Drag and Drop DropEffect style

Is there an easy way to change the regular drag and drop style of a ListBoxItem to make it look different? I'm talking about the style that shows the "Don't" sign, the + and the little rectangle in the cursor when you drag over another control. The style used by default is too 'ugly' and simple, we would like to show some information when a drop is about to occur. How can this be achieved? Thanks! EDIT: BTW. I already tried this solution Shell Style Drag and Drop , we don't want the drag and drop to interact with the OS, only within the application. I also tried setting an Adorner on top of the cursor. The Adorner renders certain visuals that move with the cursor, but that only works if we don't call the DragDrop.DoDragDrop method. The Adorner stops moving right after we call that mehod.
