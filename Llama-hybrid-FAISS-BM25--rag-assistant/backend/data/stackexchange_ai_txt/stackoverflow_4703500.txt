Document Management System - Where to Store Files?

I'm on charge of building an ASP.NET MVC Document Management System. It have to be able to do basic document management tasks like adding, editing and searching entries and also perform versioning. Anyways, I'm targeting PDF, Office and many image formats as the file attached to each document entry in the database. My question is: What design guidelines do pros follow when building the storage mechanism? Do they store the document files in the file system? Database? How file uploading is handled? I used to upload the files to a temporal location while the user was editing the data and move it to permanent storage when the user confirmed the entry creation. Is this good? Any suggestions on improvement?
