Thanks @EdM for the clarification! Now I can appreciate the difference between deviance defined on the full data (question 1) and cross-validated averaged deviance (question 2). The page you mentioned provides great explanation on how deviance is defined on an glment object, as well as the apparent normalization applied to the cross-validated deviance. To illustrate the relationship between the two different operational definitions for deviance, I generated the plot: plot(cvfit$cvm, deviance(cvfit$glmnet.fit)/length(y),main="cross-validated deviance (x-axis) and {full-data deviance/100} (y-axis)") The plot shows that there may be some kind of relationship between the two, which is probably what the "normalization" mentioned in this page was about.
