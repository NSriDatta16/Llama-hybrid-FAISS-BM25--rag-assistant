Visualize the predicted and actual class after training and testing

The data set X has 10 features with 50 instances labelled as 0 and 1. Considering only 6 instances as an example here, let YPred labels are [1,0,1,0,1,1] and the actual ground truth labels are YTest = [0,0,1,1,1,0] . I cannot draw a decision boundary after classification since the data set is multi-dimensional. In the following code, pred = predict(svmModel, X(testIdx,:)); runs k times. I cannot understand which predicted class labels should be taken after the cross-validation ends to say that this is the final "good" prediction.
