Organizing a Visual Studio Solution with "Solution Folders"

When setting up a Visual Studio .NET solution with many projects, do you find "Solution Folders" useful? What are the drawbacks? My original thought was that using Solution Folders can be useful to logically organize like projects within a solution. However, I was surprised to learn that a creating a Solution Folder does not create a corresponding Windows folder. From MSDN: "Solution Folders are an organizational tool in Solution Explorer; corresponding Windows folders are not created. We recommend that you organize your projects on disk in the same way that you organize them in the solution." I am considering organizing the solution so that every project is contained within a solution folder. Is this a good idea?
