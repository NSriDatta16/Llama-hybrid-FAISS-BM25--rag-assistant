Identifying competition climbing styles from World Cup data

In competitive climbing, it is well known that there are many different styles , differentiated by e.g. the steepness of the climbing wall. Some athletes excel at certain styles more than others. I would like to see if these styles can be discovered empirically from competition data, such as that publicly available for climbing world cups ( example ). My question is how to best infer styles from the available data. The nature of the data is as follows: Each competition round consists of four or five climbs, and each athlete has a few minutes to try each climb, with unlimited attempts. For each climb and each athlete, the scoring system records (roughly) whether the athlete made it halfway to the top or all the way to the top of the climb, along with how many attempts it took them to reach those two points. Many athletes compete in many rounds of competition, but most do not participate in all rounds over a season. There are probably about 70-120 climbs total per season, and about 200 athletes who try them, but not every athlete tries every climb. Because some athletes are better at certain styles, we expect to see certain groups of athletes perform better on certain climbs, and this clustering is how I'd expect styles to emerge from the data. The question is how to finesse this out. My most basic thought would be to assign a scalar value to each athlete's performance on a given climb and then do principal component analysis. Two issues I see with this are: Dealing with the missing data, where athletes didn't attempt a given climb. There seem to be ways of dealing with this, e.g. as described on this stats.se post . There is substantial arbitrariness in assigning a scalar value to an athlete's performance on a given climb. Are there better approaches to this problem? Are there principled ways of converting a discrete performance measure (like "reached the top" or "didn't reach the top") into a numeric value for PCA?
