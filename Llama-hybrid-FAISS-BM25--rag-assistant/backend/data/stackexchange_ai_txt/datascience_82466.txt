What's the difference between transfer learning and feature extraction in CNN?

So from what i understand, transfer learning is the fact of training a model on a dataset where you have a lot of data, then keeping most of trained coefficients, and only re-training the last layer on a dataset for a problem where you have a little amount of data And feature extraction for CNN means that you have a generic model which extracts features from the image, and then you only need to train the last layer to solve a particular problem on images. So is feature extraction just a particular case, or is there some subtlety i did not understand ?
