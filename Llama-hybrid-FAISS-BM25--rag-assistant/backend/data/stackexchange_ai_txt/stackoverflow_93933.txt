Two framworks I use often. Ragel Something worth checking out is Ragel . It's used to generate code for state machines. You just add some simple markup to your source code, then run a generator on Ragel generates code for C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java and Ruby, and it's easy to mix it with your regular source. Ragel even allow you to execute code on state transitions and such. It makes it easy to create file format and protocol parsers. Some notable projects that user Ragel are, Mongrel , a great ruby web server. And Hpricot , a ruby based html-parser, sort of inspired by jQuery . Another great feature of Ragel is how it can generate graphviz -based charts that visualize your state machines. Below is an example taken from Zed Shaw's article on ragel state charts. (source: zedshaw.com ) XMLBeans XMLBeans is a java-based xml-binding. It's got a great workflow and I use it often. XMLBeans processen an xml-schema that describes your model, into a set of java-classes that represents that model. You can programmatically create models then serialise them to and from xml.
