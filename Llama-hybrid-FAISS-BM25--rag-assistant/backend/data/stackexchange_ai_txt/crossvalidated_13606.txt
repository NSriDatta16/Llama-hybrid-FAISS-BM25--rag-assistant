This is a common scaling factor used for credit scoring models built with logistic regression. The interpretation of the dependent variable in logistic regression is as log odds , but in credit scoring, we like to deal in points, thus a scaling factor is applied to the log odds to convert to the point system. A widely used convention in credit scoring is the concept of " Points to Double the Odds " (often abbreviated PDO), and this is the source of the $\ln (2)$ in the question. For example, how many points does the score change if the odds increase from 100:1 to 200:1. A common default value for PDO is 20, because it produces credit score ranges that people tend to like. So, the interpretation of the $20/\ln(2)$ is that for a 20-point increase in score, the odds double.
