Can we identify ARIMA model without looking at ACF and PACF plot?

Can we identify ARIMA( $p,d,q$ ) model without looking at the ACF and PACF plots? I am trying to write a generalized R programme for fitting time series models. We may find out the orders $p$ , $d$ and $q$ from the ACF and PACF plots, but I want to know how to identify them from the numerical values of the ACF and PACF.
