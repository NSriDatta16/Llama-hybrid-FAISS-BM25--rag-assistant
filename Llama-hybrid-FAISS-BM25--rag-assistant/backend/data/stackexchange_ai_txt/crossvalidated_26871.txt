There may well be a better way to go about this but if you simply add all the entries from each job with the average time per entry for each job. You can then compute the average time per entry for each category. Not perfect, but differences between the average time for an entry in each category should show up. You can then use t-tests to see if they are significantly different from each other. If you have a number of predeternibed catefories You are likely to test you should, for rigor anyway, decide on the comparisons anyway and hold each test to a significance level equal to your target significance level, i.e. .05, divided by the number of comparisons. For doing all pair wise comparisons you could use Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test.
