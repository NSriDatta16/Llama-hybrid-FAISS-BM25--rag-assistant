It would be a mess and difficult to organize because I have many classes in this scenario. Do you mean that the java file look messy? You can split the internal classes in a different .java file. ClassA.java package org.application; public class ClassA { } Internal.java package org.application; class ClassB { } class SomeOtherInternalClass { } Hope this helps.
