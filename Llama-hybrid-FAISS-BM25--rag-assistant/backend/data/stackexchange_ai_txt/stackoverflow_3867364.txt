To compare two lists, I think something like this would avoid copying any part of your lists, and stops as soon as a mismatch is found: len(a)==len(b) and all(a[i] == b[i] for i in range(len(a)-1)) To find all matches in an arbitrary set of lists, I think you'd need to compare each pair of lists -- or at least, each pair which you haven't checked some equivalent version of (e.g., if A=B and B=C, you don't need to check A=C). I don't know offhand of an algorithm that makes this simple. Alternatively, if the lists are outrageously long and you want to avoid traversing them, you could maybe compute a checksum of the first N-1 elements of each, and then just compare the checksums.
