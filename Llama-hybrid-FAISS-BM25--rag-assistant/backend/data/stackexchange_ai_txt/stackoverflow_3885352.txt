More efficient ways of doing this

for i in vr_world.getNodeNames(): if i != "_error_": World[i] = vr_world.getChild(i) vr_world.getNodeNames() returns me a gigantic list, vr_world.getChild(i) returns a specific type of object. This is taking a long time to run, is there anyway to make it more efficient? I have seen one-liners for loops before that are supposed to be faster. Ideas?
