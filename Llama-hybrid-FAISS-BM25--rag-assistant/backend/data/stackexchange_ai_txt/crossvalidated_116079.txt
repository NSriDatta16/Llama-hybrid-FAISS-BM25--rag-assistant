Standard model for time series with (possibly multiple) seasonal component

Suppose you have a "new" way to formalize a seasonal component and you want to see if your method is worth to be published. My idea is to take a "standard" model for time series with seasonal component (where with standard I mean the method that is generally used and it is more effective), replace the seasonal component with mine idea, test it on some standard dataset used in literature for time series with seasonal components and see if the forecast improve. Do you have any idea of which can be the standard model (or models) and the standard datasets?
