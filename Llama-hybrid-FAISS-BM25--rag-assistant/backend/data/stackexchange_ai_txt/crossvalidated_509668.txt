This is not a complete answer whatsoever, but I think this question deserves some attention. In the discrete case we can easily get that if $T$ is sufficient, then $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})=g_{\theta}(T(\mathbf{x}))h(\mathbf{x})$ where $g_{\theta}$ is the p.m.f of $T$ . Indeed, \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})&:=P_{\theta}(\{\mathbf{x}\})=P_{\theta}(\{\mathbf{x}\}\cap(T=T(\mathbf{x})))\\&=P_{\theta}(\{\mathbf{x}\}|T=T(\mathbf{x}))P_{\theta}(T=T(\mathbf{x}))\text{, } \end{aligned} \end{equation} so, taking $h(\mathbf{x}):=P_{\theta}(\{\mathbf{x}\}|T=T(\mathbf{x}))$ and $g_\theta(y):=P_{\theta}(T=y)$ we have that $g_{\theta}$ is the p.m.f of $T$ . However, I found no evidence of an annalogous result being true for the absolutely continuous case (check this ). The book "Statistical Inference" by Casella-Berger seems to assume that this is true at least in: Theorem 8.2.4 Corollary 8.3.13 But also I found no complains about of this (at least) dubious assumptions in the internet. Also there is no mention about this in the several errata list I have checked to this day.
