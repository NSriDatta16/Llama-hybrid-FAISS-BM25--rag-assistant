Embedding/importing SWC at compile-time in ActionScript, without setting a library path

Hail, Stack! I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to import a SWC file directly in ActionScript, without setting a library path to the file. To exemplify, I need something like this: package { [Embed(source = 'Library.swc')] // This line won't work, of course... import ClassInsideSWC; public class MyClass extends ClassInsideSWC { public function MyClass() { super(); } } } Besides, I don't want to (I can't, in fact) import the SWC by loading it with Loader class. Well, someone knows a way to link to the SWC using only ActionScript Code? Edited Just to add more info about the problem, I'll showcase my scenario with more details... I have a class SubClass that wil be independent from the rest. It will extend a class SuperClass that is inside the SWC/SWF... This SWC/SWF have the whole framework. I can't compile every class inside a single SWF. Every part of my framework is a SWF apart and will be downloaded by Loader class on runtime. Sadly, @frankhermes answer won't work. That method won't download the classes and won't allow me to extend or use other classes inside the SWC. If I setup the library path this becomes possible...
