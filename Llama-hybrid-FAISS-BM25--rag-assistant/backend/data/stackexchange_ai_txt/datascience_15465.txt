Airbnb recently open sourced their internal data science knowledge repository: https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo From its readme, it seems it could loosely fit your use case: The Knowledge Repository project is focused on facilitating the sharing of knowledge between data scientists and other technical roles using data formats and tools that make sense in these professions. It provides various data stores (and utilities to manage them) for "knowledge posts", with a particular focus on notebooks (R Markdown and Jupyter / iPython Notebook) to better promote reproducible research. There's also a blog post commenting on its motivation.
