Parameter count isn't the only thing you need to track for measuring memory usage. You also need to store the data as it goes through the network, which could be require a lot of storage, depending on what you're doing.

The memory consumption of the filters in total is small, but storing lots of filtered versions of a large input image will consume a lot of memory.
