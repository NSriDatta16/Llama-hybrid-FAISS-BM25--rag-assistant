I assume that you refer to Section 7.2 in the original LDA paper . In that case, as the paper suggests in the first paragraph of Section 7.2, you must have a discriminative framework ; namely, a dataset with labeled documents. This is the only way to train an SVM classifier. From you question, I infer that you use LDA in order to extract topics for a corpus with unknown topics and that you don't have any labeled data . Therefore, you simply cannot build an SVM classifier with what you have.
