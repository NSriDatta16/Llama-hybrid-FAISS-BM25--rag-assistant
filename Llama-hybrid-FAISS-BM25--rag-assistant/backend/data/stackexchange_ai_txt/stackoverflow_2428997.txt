Export Flash as Transparent MOV

Is it possible to export a flash movie with a transparent background as a .MOV. I don't mean for embedding in a website, I mean the actual .MOV (or .avi). What I'm trying to accomplish is that I have a flash animation that I want to embed in a WPF application. I don't want to use a Browser within the WPF because of all of the issues that surround the browser control (has to be topmost control, etc). So my solution was to export said animation as a movie and play it in the MediaElement control. The only problem is that I need the background to be transparent, and I can't find a way to do this. Any suggestions or alternative solutions would be most welcome.
