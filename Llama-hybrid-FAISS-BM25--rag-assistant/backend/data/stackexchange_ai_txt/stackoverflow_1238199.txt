The resource filtering mentioned in the FAQ is run whenever the Maven builder is run on the project. In practice I've found this to be more trouble than it's worth as the Maven builder runs quite slowly, and is only run when configured (which by default is only on a full build), leaving you to scratch your head and wonder why your changes aren't picked up. I tend to modify the Eclipse classpath to include src/main/resources. This is sufficient for most use cases. For the cases where the simple approach doesn't work (for example if a dependent project has some complicated resource processing), I do as Robert suggests and turn off workspace resolution, then install the dependency to the local repository so it is included in the Maven classpath container.
