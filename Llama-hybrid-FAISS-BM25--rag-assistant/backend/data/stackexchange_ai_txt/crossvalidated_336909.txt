I aim to use random forest survival analysis to predict depression with the competing risk of death. My primary outcome is depression but I read that it is important to control for the competing risks. I have restructured my data so they look like the below: Status equals to: 0 if the patient is not dead and not depressed 1 if the patient is depressed 2 if the patient is dead. Question 1 : Is this the proper formatting for the data? I read lots of forums and it wasn't clear if the data should be long so each respondent has 1 row for each survey. Question 2 : to clarify how to use the competing risk of death. This is the code I have so far: data(patient_depression, package="randomForestSRC") depression.obj but I hope to verify it is correct. Unfortunately none of my advisors are familiar with this method so they encouraged me to contact someone familiar.
