Adjusting OR for confounding variable with non linear interaction

I have looked for similar cases but couldn't really find the answer to my question. I want to assess the impact (with an OR in logistic regression) of a predictor X1 on a binary response variable Y and adjust for a confounding variable X2 . The thing is X1 is known to vary in non linear way depending on X2 (e.g. a polynomial degree 3 could describe the relation between X1 and X2 , i.e. X1 = f( X2 ) where f() is a degree 3 polynomial) So my question is, how do I adjust the OR of X1 to account for dependency on X2 ? What kind of formula should I use in the logistic regression ? Thank you so much in advance !
