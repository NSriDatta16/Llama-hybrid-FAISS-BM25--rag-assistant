Classes should be organized into regions within an application using a layout determined by your application architect. These may be based on accessibility, type, or functionality. Consult your architect for the layout strategy used in your application. Example: // Class layout based on accessibility class Purchasing { #region Main #region Public #region Internal #region Protected #region Private #region Extern #region Designer Generated Code } Guidelines: o Use the same layout consistently in all classes in an application. o Omit regions if their associated class elements are not needed. o The Designer Generated Code region created by Visual Studioâ€™s Visual Designer should never be modified by hand. It should contain only code generated by the designer.
