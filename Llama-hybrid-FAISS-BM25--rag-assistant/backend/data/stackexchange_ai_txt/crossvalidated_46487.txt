"Dramatic" is subjective. One example where deep networks do better is the MNIST hand-written digit set. Yann LeCun keeps a web page of progress made by various techniques with many useful links. This is a relatively simple classification problem compared with speech recognition and image recognition, and deep networks are expected to outperform single hidden layer neural networks (with the same number of parameters) by even more on more complicated tasks.
