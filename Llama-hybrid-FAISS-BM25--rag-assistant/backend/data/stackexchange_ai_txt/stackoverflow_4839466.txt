How can I recognize a specific physical object from an image?

My goal is to be able to have a person with a mobile phone snap a picture of a local landmark (building or otherwise (ex. gazebo, statue, etc)) on our college campus and be able to identify the landmark and tell them what it is. For instance, they are walking around and they see a large building with a metal dome. They don't know what it is, but it looks interesting, so they snap a picture and the app tells them that it's the basketball center (and other relevant info). My limited knowledge in this particular field led me to think of using neural networks and training the program to recognize particular places. If this is the case, please also give me resources for this option, as the extent of my knowledge of NN is that they can be used to recognize things if they are trained. :) I know of the OpenCV library, but as I am not a C developer, I'd like to know if I need to go down that road before I start. I primarily work in Java, but I'm not opposed to getting my hands dirty. Thanks!
