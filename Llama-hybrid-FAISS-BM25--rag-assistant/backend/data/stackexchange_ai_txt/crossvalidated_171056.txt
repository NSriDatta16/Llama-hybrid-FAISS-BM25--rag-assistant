Are results significant?

I am fairly new to statistics so I am unsure which statistical test I should use to test which of the datasets shows a better result. The data looks something like this Variant A: { 3, 7, 10} Variant B:{ 2, 3, 6 } After correcting for outliers, can I just use the average of these numbers to determine a winner? How do I determine that I have sufficient data which of these sets shows a significantly better result?
