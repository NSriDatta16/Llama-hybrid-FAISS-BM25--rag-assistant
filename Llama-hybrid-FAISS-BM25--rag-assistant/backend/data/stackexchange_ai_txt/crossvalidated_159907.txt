For 1NN outlier detection: For each object: compute the distance to all other objects find the minimum (for larger k, choose the k smallest distance) store as outlier score Usually k=1 to k=10 will be enough. See for example: On the Evaluation of Unsupervised Outlier Detection: Measures, Datasets, and an Empirical Study by G. O. Campos, A. Zimek, J. Sander, R. J. G. B. Campello, B. Micenkov√°, E. Schubert, I. Assent and M. E. Houle Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 30(4): 891-927, 2016, DOI: 10.1007/s10618-015-0444-8 They did an insane amount of experiments. But on most data sets, kNN with k=1 was one of the best methods of I recall correctly.
