Controling the input for a dijit NumberTextBox?

I'm using a NumberTextBox and want to control the input in a way that the following requirements are met: a) no + or - should be allowed b) values must be between e.g. 4.5 and 19.8 c) the allowed format should be at most two digits before the '.' and not more than 4 after it. d) thus the control should hold at most 7 characters and must not allow to enter more Aside from the error message for violating b) I don't want to see any messages. I want it to be impossible to enter a third digit before or a 5 fifth digit after the '.' The best approach I manages to get was using - maxLength="7" - constraints={min="4.5",max="19.8",pattern="#0.####"} but that fails to do the task. I also tried with different patterns and making use of 'precision' but still was not able to get what I want. Is it possible at all? Or do I need to write extra code for this? Thanks for your time!
