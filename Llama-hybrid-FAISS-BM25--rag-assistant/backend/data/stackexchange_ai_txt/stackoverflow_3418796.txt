How can I get PHP simplexml to save < as itself instead of <

Basically I have a script that updates an xml document in various places... However, I need the text to be in CDATA... So I attempted this: $PrintQuestion->content->multichoice->feedback->hint->Passage->Paragraph->addChild('TextFragment', ' '); Unfortunately when I save the XML back to file, the in cdata come up as their respective Note: Our parser doesn't know how to read the &lt; and &gt; codes, so this is a serious issue after doing a print_r of my simple_xml object, the It must be the domsave that is converting it into the entity code... any ideas how to disable this? //Convert SimpleXML element to DOM and save $dom = new DOMDocument('1.0'); $dom->preserveWhiteSpace = false; $dom->formatOutput = false; $dom->loadXML($xml->asXML()); $dom->save($filename);
