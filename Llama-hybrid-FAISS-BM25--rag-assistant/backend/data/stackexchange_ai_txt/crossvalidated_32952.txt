Chuanhai Liu recently developed an interesting framework of statistical inference, called 'Inferential Model'. Behrens-Fisher problem is one of the examples which can be quite elegantly tackled using this framework; if interested, take a look at Chapter 4.2 of the following paper: "Marginal inferential models: prior-free probabilistic inference on interest parameters" by Ryan Martin http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chuanhai/docs/immarg.pdf It also contains some references to a number of key papers and review papers. I am not an expert on this topic, so I am not sure how comprehensive the reference is, but I guess it could be a good starting point!
