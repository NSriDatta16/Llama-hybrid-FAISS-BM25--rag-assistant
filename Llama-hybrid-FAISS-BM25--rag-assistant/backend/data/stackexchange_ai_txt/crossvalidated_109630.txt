How is the "classification error rate" of an artificial neural network calculated?

Frequently I see artificial neural networks compared by their "classification error rates" or "error rates", particularly for multi-class problems like CIFAR-10. What does this error rate actually refer to? Hamming loss? How is it calculated?
