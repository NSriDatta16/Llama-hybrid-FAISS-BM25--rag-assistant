Magento and the tag (e.g. HTML5 Video with Flash Fallback)

Is Magento somehow unique in a way that would make the (now becoming a standard) tag (e.g. HTML5 Video with Flash Fallback) and its related js + swf players not perform well in a Magento site? I understand that regular html blocks can be used in Magento but I have to ask because it seems like with Magento - ya just never know. Also, I have had a few developers tell me if I wanted to develop a store that has strong and current video features (e.g. video galleries with the latest custom players like flarevideo.com/ or mediafront.org/) that I would be better off going with Drupal (because of the existing modules drupal.org/project/mediafront and/or drupal.org/project/flashvideo). The problem with using Drupal is losing some of the richer e-com features of Magento. So what's up with getting current video solutions in Magento? any feedback much appreciated!
