I believe you need to specify the file location/name in standard URI format - which is close to the standard format except for servers. See the javadocs for the URI Class for more information. At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply "URI") in string form has the syntax [scheme:]scheme-specific-part[#fragment] And a little later: A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax [scheme:][//authority][path][?query][#fragment] so the URI should look something like the following: file://MyNet/folder/image.jpg where "file://" is the protocol, "MyNet" is the server, and "/folder/image.jpg" is the directory location under the share. Hope this helps a little.
