Scaling in SVM (why and how to , plus references)

Hi I know why feature scaling is preferred in SVM, I have two questions: 1-does anyone know of legit articles of books explaining it. I am writing my thesis and I need references. It doesnt have to be for SVM specific, even if it is for Neural Networks or other supervised learning algorithms it will be appreciated. 2-Other than the referencing part does anyone have another source for more explanations on the scaling or rescaling of inputs. Thanks
