The answer is 'no'. The loglinear model is more general than the logistic regression model. See Fienberg, 1980, Analysis of Cross-Classified Categorical Data, section 6.2 on how to specify a loglinear model so that it corresponds to logistic regression. Actually the reverse is true: If all variables are categorical, then every logistic regression model corresponds to some loglinear model.
