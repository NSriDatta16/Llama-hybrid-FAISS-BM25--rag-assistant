One thing you could use is a distance measure from a central point, ${\bf c}=(c_{1},c_{2})$, such as the sample mean of the points $(\overline{x}, \overline{y})$, or perhaps the centroid of the observed points. Then a measure of dispersion would be the average distance from that central point: $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} || {\bf z}_{i} - {\bf c} || $$ where ${\bf z}_{i} = \{ x_{i}, y_{i} \}$. There are many potential choices for a distance measure but the $L_{2}$ norm (e.g. euclidean distance) may be a reasonable choice: $$ || {\bf z}_{i} - {\bf c} || = \sqrt{ (x_{i}-c_{1})^{2} + (y_{i}-c_{2})^{2} } $$ There are lots of other potential choices, though.
