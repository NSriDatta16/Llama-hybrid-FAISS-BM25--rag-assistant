temporarily solved the problem by listening to dragComplete on the tree dragComplete="handleDragComplete(event) When the drag is complete i get the changed dataprovider from the tree and then i recursively search the "dragged item"("id" + "label") in the changed dataprovider to find its position in the tree ie. "id" of the node in which the selected node is dropped(parent node). and fire the save to database api. anyone has better options. pls reply thanks :)
