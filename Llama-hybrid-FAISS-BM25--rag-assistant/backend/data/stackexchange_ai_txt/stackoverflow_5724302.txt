using std::sort() on an array

I have a program which I have got to take numbers from a text file, add them to an array and write them to a file. I need to sort the numbers in the array using the std::sort() function call. My first attempt at it was this: void ArrayIntStorage::sortStd() { for (int i = 0; i "n" is a constant for the size of the array. I know this is wrong but im not sure how to takle it. Thanks in advance.
