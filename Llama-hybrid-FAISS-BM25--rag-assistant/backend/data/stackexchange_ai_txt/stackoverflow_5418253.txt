UIWebView loading from Sqlite3

I have an NSString variable 'body' that I am populating from sqlite3. The string is formatted with '\n' and '\t' such that when printed in NSLog it looks like gagan On 3/21/11 5:36 PM, From:User91@SMODEVGWS03.com To:"User91 Test" Subject: test it wrote: ravan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Attachment not downloaded due to unsupported type I am trying to load this string into a UIWebView and still preserve all the formatting for which I browsed and found out this. NSString *body contains the above string with all the formatting. NSData* data=[body dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; if (data) { [webView loadData:data MIMEType:@"text/html" textEncodingName:@"UTF-8" baseURL:nil]; } But I see in the UIWebView the formatting is not preserved and it turns up like this: gagan On 3/21/11 5:36 PM, From:User91@SMODEVGWS03.com To:"User91 Test" Subject: test it wrote: ravan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Attachment not downloaded due to unsupported type Can anyone come to my rescue?
