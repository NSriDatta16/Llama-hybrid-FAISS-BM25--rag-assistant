There are a few hierarchical models in MCMCpack for R, which to my knowledge is the fastest sampler for many common model types. (I wrote the [hierarchical item response][2] model in it.) [RJAGS][3] does what its name sounds like. Code up a jags-flavored .bug model, provide data in R, and call Jags from R.
