Your data is three years of data that is all zeros and five recent weeks with non-zero values. With such data, you don't have much ground for reasonable forecasting. It's not surprising that auto-arima fails. Given the long history of "no signal" predicting zero would be a quite reasonable forecast. Since the data is limited, you could check the Best method for short time-series thread, which suggests using very simple models in such cases (e.g. historical average, which in your case would again be close to zero). Second, an important question to ask yourself is what has changed during the last five weeks? There seems to be a significant change in the data. Is the historical data relevant to the problem at all? If yes, you should probably predict something like zero. If not, you probably should ignore it. This is a question to ask yourself or a domain expert in your area.
