Code analyzers: PMD & FindBugs

1. Regarding PMD: 1.1 How do I set the PMD checks, to ignore some of them, like "Variable name is too short, or too long", "Remove empty constructor, etc" - and if I do that, another warning appears that says the class must have some static methods. Basically, the class was empty, for later development, and I like to leave it that way for now. 1.2 Is it necesarry to follow this warning advice? A class which only has private constructors should be final 1.3 What is that supposed to mean? The class 'Dog' has a Cyclomatic Complexity of 3 (Highest = 17) 1.4 What about this one? I would love to change this, but nothing crosses my mind at the moment regarding the change: Assigning an Object to null is a code smell. Consider refactoring. 2.Regarding FindBugs: 2.1 Is it really that bad to write to a static field, at some point later than its declaration? The following code gives me a warning: Main.appCalendar = Calendar.getInstance(); Main.appCalendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis()); where appCalendar is a static variable. 2.2 This code: strLine = objBRdr.readLine().trim(); gives the warning: Immediate dereference of the result of readLine() where objBRdr is a BufferedReader(FileReader) . What could happen? readLine() could be null? The code is nested in while (objBRdr.ready()) test, and so far, I have zero problems there. Update1: 2.2 was fixed when I replaced the code with: strLine = objBRdr.readLine(); if (strLine != null) { strLine = strLine.trim(); }
