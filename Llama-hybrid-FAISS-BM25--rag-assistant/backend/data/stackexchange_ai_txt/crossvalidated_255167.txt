Another reason why this happens is due to heterogeneous treatment effects. Since your IV is giving you a Local Average Treatment effect, that is, the effect on compliers, it might be that only in the population of compliers, the effect is insignificant or not there. For eg: If you use sex of first two children as an IV for number of children a couple has, that is, if the sex of first two is same, then the couple is more likely to have third child, and reverse if the sex is different, then compliers are those who have a third child when treatment is switched on and not when it is off. If there are reasons to believe that compliers represent only a small proportion in your population then it is doubtful that the result you get is applicable to the population in general. This may in fact work in your favor.
