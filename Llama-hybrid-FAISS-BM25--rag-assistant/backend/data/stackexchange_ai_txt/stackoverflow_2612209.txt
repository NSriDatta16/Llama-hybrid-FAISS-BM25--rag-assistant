Nasty deep nested loop in Rails

I have this nested loop that goes 4 levels deep to find all the image widgets and calculate their sizes. This seems really inefficient and nasty! I have thought of putting the organization_id in the widget model so I could just call something like organization.widgets.(named_scope), but I feel like that's a bad short cut. Is there a better way? Thanks class Organization
