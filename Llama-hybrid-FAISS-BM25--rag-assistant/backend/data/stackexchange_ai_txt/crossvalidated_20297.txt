Is statistics.com class worth the money?

I'm debating taking some classes on statistics.com and was curious if anyone has taken classes there or knows any one who has or has any suggestions for good ways to learn stats/machine learning on the cheap-ish and on-line. NOTE: I'm already signed up for Andrew Ng's ML class for spring '12.
