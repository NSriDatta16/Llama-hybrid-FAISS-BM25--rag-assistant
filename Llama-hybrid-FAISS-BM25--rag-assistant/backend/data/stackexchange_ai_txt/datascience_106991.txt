Where shall I use odds logarithm and when shall I use sigmoid in logistic regression?

I have been interested in DS and ML recently and logistic regression was on of the first algorithms I learned. In my first course it was said that ln(p/(1-p) was used for the logistic regression. But then I took another course and there was told about sigmoid function for logistic regression. Which of them is better for binary classification? Where to use odds logarithm and where to use sigmoid?
