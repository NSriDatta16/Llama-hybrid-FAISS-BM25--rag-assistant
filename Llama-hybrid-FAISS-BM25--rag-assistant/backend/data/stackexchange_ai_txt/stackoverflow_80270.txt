There's two ways to go at this. The first is to just go buy a SAN or a NAS from Dell or HP and throw money at the problem. Modern storage hardware just makes all of this easy to do, saving your expertise for more core problems. If you want to roll your own, take a look at using Linux with DRBD. http://www.drbd.org/ DRBD allows you to create networked block devices. Think RAID 1 across two servers instead of just two disks. DRBD deployments are usually done using Heartbeat for failover in case one system dies. I'm not sure about load balancing, but you might investigate and see if LVS can be used to load balance across your DRBD hosts: http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/ To conclude, let me just reiterate that you're probably going to save yourself a lot of time in the long run just forking out the money for a NAS.
