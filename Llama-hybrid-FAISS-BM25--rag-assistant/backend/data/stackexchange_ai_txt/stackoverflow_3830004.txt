you are doing it totally wrong. never use regexp for password fields. this way you dont allow the user anything, you are just disallowing the user to enter whatever he wants to use as password (maybe some special chars like & or { or whatever. in any case your approach hurts more than it helps. what you should do, is encouraging the user to use specialchars and more complex passwords simply by displaying a "red-yellow-green" indicator besides the password field.
