How to improve accuracy of deep neural networks

I am using Tensorflow to predict whether the given sentence is positive and negative. I have take 5000 samples of positive sentences and 5000 samples of negative sentences. 90% of the data I used it for training the neural network and rest 10% for testing. Below is the parameter initialisation. Batch size = 100 Epochs = 30 Number of hidden layers = 3 Nodes in each hidden layer = 100 epochs = 30 I could see in each epoch the cost function is getting reduced reasonably. However the accuracy of the model on test set is poor (only 56%) Epoch 1 completed out of 30 loss : 22611.10902404785 Epoch 2 completed out of 30 loss : 12377.467597961426 Epoch 3 completed out of 30 loss : 8659.753067016602 Epoch 4 completed out of 30 loss : 6678.618850708008 Epoch 5 completed out of 30 loss : 5391.995906829834 Epoch 6 completed out of 30 loss : 4476.406986236572 Epoch 7 completed out of 30 loss : 3776.497922897339 ------------------------------------------------------- Epoch 25 completed out of 30 loss : 478.93606185913086 Epoch 26 completed out of 30 loss : 450.8017848730087 Epoch 27 completed out of 30 loss : 435.0913710594177 Epoch 28 completed out of 30 loss : 452.10553523898125 Epoch 29 completed out of 30 loss : 539.5199084281921 Epoch 30 completed out of 30 loss : 685.9198244810104 Accuracy of Train : 0.88155556 Accuracy of Test : 0.524 Is there any parameter that can be tuned to increase the accuracy of the model considering the same number of data set.
