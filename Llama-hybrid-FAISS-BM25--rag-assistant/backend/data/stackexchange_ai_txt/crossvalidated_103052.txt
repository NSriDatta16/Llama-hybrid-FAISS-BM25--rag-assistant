You want to perform an intervention analysis, which is a subset of time series analysis. To perform this analysis you will do 2 separate regressions, one to measure the impact of advertising on clicks and the second to measure the impact of advertising on signups. To accomplish this you regress the dependent variable (clicks or signups) for each day on the independent variable which is a dummy variable (or indicator function) which takes the value of 1 if the particular data points was collected with advertising and 0 if the particular dependent data point was collected during the period without advertising. The beta coefficient estimated from the regression would reflect the estimate decrease in average clicks or signups from foregoing advertising. Further the p-value for the beta estimate can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant decline in clicks/signups as a result of excluding advertising, i.e., if the average number of clicks/signups during the non-advertising period is statistically significantly less than during the period with advertising. A caveat would be that the model described above includes no other exogenous variables besides the existence of advertising. If any other non-included variables also changed during this period, the beta estimate produced by this regression model would be biased by the marginal impact of the excluded exogenous variables.
