Does XGBoost have a max-depth hyper-parameter?

According to the explanation in Complete Guide to Parameter Tuning in XGBoost , XGBoost doesn't use max_depth argument as Random Forest or GBM does. It expands the tree up to this depth and start pruning all the way up by judging if each node has a positive gain or not. But how does it split the nodes? Is it again greedy? And, if it is greedy, is it possible to have a first split yielding negative gain, and then positive gain?
