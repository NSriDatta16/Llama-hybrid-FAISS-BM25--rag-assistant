The observation returned by the `reset()` method is not contained with the observation space

i'm strugling to understand how custom observation_space should be coded and how there isn't so much info about some topics i have to ask here if for example i have to return a observation with an array of 6 numeric values: def __init__(self): # from my CustomEnv class self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(4) self.observation_space = spaces.Box(0,1, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32) def reset(self): return self._next_observation(self) def _next_observation(self): obs = np.array([0.098231, 0.098231, 0.098231, 0.098231, 0.098231, 231]) return obs When i procceed to test the Agent: import gym import envs ... env = gym.make('CustomEnv-v0') state = selv.env.reset() #this particular line my terminal throws: /gym/utils/passive_env_checker.py", line 115, in _check_obs ), f"{pre} is not contained with the observation space ({observation_space})" AssertionError: The observation returned by the `reset()` method is not contained with the observation space (Box(0.0, 1.0, (1,), float32))
