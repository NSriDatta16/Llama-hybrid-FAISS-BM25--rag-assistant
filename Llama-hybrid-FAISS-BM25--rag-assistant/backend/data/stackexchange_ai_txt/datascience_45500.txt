Neural Network Initialization - Every layer?

Does every layer of a Neural Network require weight initialization or just the first? Does the first layer feed into the next layer and initialize itself? My intuition is that every layer needs its own initialization but I'm finding it hard to see that said explicitly. Thanks!
