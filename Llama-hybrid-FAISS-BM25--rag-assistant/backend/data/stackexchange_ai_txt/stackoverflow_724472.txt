A class library is simply a set of classes encapsulated into a definable unit such as an assembly. The term is not restricted to any particular language or framework. The Base Class Library (BCL) is a specific term attributes to the set of class libaries that come pre-installed with the .NET Framework which provide classes neatly organized into namespaces so that you have an API against which to build your own solutions. A framework is a wider term that is inclusive of the class libraries, a virtual machine that manages controlled execution of processes, provides a runtime environment, along with other services such as memory management and exception handling. See the .NET Framework for more information.
