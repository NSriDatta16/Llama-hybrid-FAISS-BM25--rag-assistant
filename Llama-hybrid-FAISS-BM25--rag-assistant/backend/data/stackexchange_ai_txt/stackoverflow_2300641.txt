This control is called an NSTokenField in Cocoa AppKit. You can find something similar to start with in the three20 project . The control is called a TTPickerTextField I believe. You could use that as a basis for your control and add the drag and drop capabilities using the UIResponder methods touchesBegan/Moved/Ended.
