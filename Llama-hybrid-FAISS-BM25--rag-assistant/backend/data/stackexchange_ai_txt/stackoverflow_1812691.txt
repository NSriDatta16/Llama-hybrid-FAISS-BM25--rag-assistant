Average max concurrent users on Tomcat

I am doing stress test with JMeter on web application (built with Spring, Struts2 REST, uses PostgreSQL). I am simulating typical user's scenario with my app: 4 GET, 3 INSERT, 20 UPDATE calls. Server specs: 4core Intel Xeon X5365 3GHz 8GB RAM single 320GB SATA disk OS: Ubuntu 8.10 32bit DB: Postgresql 8.4 Tomcat 6.0.18 Java 1.6.0_14 The results show that server would handle around 130 concurrent transactions. Is this number possible? Are there any results online to compare with mine?
