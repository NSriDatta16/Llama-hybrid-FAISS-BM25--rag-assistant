IsolatedStorage: Delete preferences in uninstaller?

Our application saves user preferences in isolated storage. However,it's proving tricky to remove these files from our uninstaller! I can enumerate all of the files in IsolatedStorage (using the MSDN example code), locate the ones that are related to our strongname key, and attempt to remove/delete them. Unfortunately, that's where it all falls apart: MaxSize is not defined for this store. An operation was performed that requires access to MaxSize. Stores obtained using enumeration APIs do not have a well-defined MaxSize, since partial evidence is used to open the store. Can anyone help with this? I guess I could spend days trying to fake up some Evidence to allow the installer to act as an imposter, but there must be a better (quicker, cleaner) way?! If not, I guess I'm heading back to the good old registry.
