How to analyse my time series experiment

I have a question about how I can analyze the data from a time series experiment. I'm still a student and therefore am not really familiar with all the procedures and analyzes in SPSS, so i hope someone with the proper knowledge can help me with this problem. The goal is to show a relation between advertising en sales. To show this we have conducted a experiment with an experimental and control group. The experimental group is a province in which the people gets to see more advertising. In the control group the advertising stays the same as usual. The dataset contains weekly sales data from several stores throughout the country from the control area and experimental area. And how much advertising is used in all the periods. The data goes back for 1.5 years so there are 70 measures before the experiment, and 10 measures in/after the experiment. So my question is, how can I prove a relation between those two factors. I know I can do a simple t-test to test the difference between the two groups. But this doesnâ€™t take care of any trends of long/short term effects.
