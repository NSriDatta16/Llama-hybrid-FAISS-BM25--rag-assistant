There is a lot of "predict the future" in this question that no one can answer, so I'll skip those parts. Regarding community, the community is small (it's a relatively new language) but growing quickly. You can get a decent sense of it from blogs on the web, like the Planet F# feed, or from the questions in the F# tag here on SO, or from hubFS . Regarding the new license, it's now possible to do a lot of things you couldn't do before. You can package F# in a Mono distribution. You can write standalone F# tools/programs like F# Web Snippets without having to resort to ridiculous contortions to avoid breaking the license (the current implementation of that tool does crazy extra work to workaround the old license). You can, well, you can do whatever you want; if you want to fork the whole thing, put it on github, get ten or a hundred friends to bang on the code and make an F# clone for JVM or something, you could do that too. Realistically, I think what is most likely to happen in the near-term is that people will leverage the compiler source to write F# tools. If you like developing in emacs, then hey, now you can leverage all the existing logic of the F# compiler to easily create "go to definition" functionality when you press like Ctrl-Alt-Meta-G or something (I dunno, I don't use emacs). Or -- holy crap, I can't believe I only just now remembered this -- you could write a VS F# plugin that does what's pictured here: Is there an IDE out there that does structural syntax highlighting? which is something I always wanted to do, but it required using the F# compiler to do the heavy lifting to get the parse tree structure. Oh boy, I totally need to go find the time to do that now. Anyway, it's not all unicorns and roses; a number of people like to focus on the 'one-time-source-drop' and no-takesies-backsies of community contributions, which are maybe not ideal. But that's no different from the state of the world three days ago. So I'll focus on what is different from three days ago, and with the new license there's some cool possibilities to leverage the compiler code to build some cool tools and perhaps even grow more community around those tools.
