leverage() diagnostic test not supported for glmmTMB models in r

I am using a glmmTMB to look at the effect of numerous variables on how far individuals travel ( distance ). The example below is one of many datasets I am working with, all of which have the same underlying structure and problems. Some details about the data (full data here ): My response variable ( distance ) is overdispersed and shows some degree of zero-inflation All outliers are real values Numerical explanatory variables included in model were mean centered and standardized within year and location prior to exporting distance is not an integer, but I force it to be by rounding to the nearest whole number. As such, I have been using family=nbinom2 juv.density and local.density are correlated (Pearson's r = -0.73). We have kept them both in the model as per Morrissey and Ruxton (2018) . Sample of the data: individual distance sex BDAY food.density juv.density local.density winter litter_id year location 1 6130 60 M 0.299 -1.11 0.341 1.26 -0.432 3057 0 KL 2 6358 0 F -1.40 -1.11 1.62 1.57 -0.432 3078 0 KL 3 6391 75 F -0.109 -1.11 -0.937 -0.893 -0.432 3058 0 KL 4 6507 91 F -0.177 -1.11 -0.937 -0.277 -0.432 3059 0 KL 5 6528 361 F 0.865 -1.31 -1.13 -0.731 -0.432 3158 0 SU 6 6551 205 M 0.665 -0.00232 -0.110 -1.14 -0.342 3353 1 SU glmmTMB model and output: move=glmmTMB(distance ~ sex + BDAY + food.density + juv.density + local.density + winter_pressure + (1|litter_id), data = dist_moved, family=nbinom2) > summary(rec_dist) Family: nbinom2 ( log ) Formula: juv_disp ~ sex + BDAY + food.density + juv.density + local.density + winter_pressure + (1 | litter_id) Data: recruit_dist AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 804.6 824.3 -393.3 786.6 57 Random effects: Conditional model: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. litter_id (Intercept) 0.51439 0.71721 Number of obs: 66, groups: litter_id, 49 Overdispersion parameter for nbinom2 family (): 1.03 Conditional model: Estimate Std.

What am I missing? owls_nb1_simres Cook's distance plot:
