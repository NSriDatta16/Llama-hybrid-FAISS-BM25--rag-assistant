Drag and drop in dataGrid, custom cursor during drag not working

I have a datagrid that I want the user to sort the rows on. To make it obvious that it's sortable I am implementing some custom cursors. But I'm having a problem when I actually drag an item. here's a pseudo demonstration of the problem Application = normal cursor // fine Rollover datagrid = open hand cursor // good so far mousedown on datagrid = closed hand cursor // good dragging item around = closed hand cursor // switches back to normal cursor (if I move it around real fast I can see my custom curser for an instant) mouse up on datadrid = open hand cursor // not sure, after I drop it goes back to open hand but if I mouse down, dont move and mouse up I have a closed hand rollout of datagrid = normal cursor //good datagrid code: functions: public function over():void{ CursorManager.setCursor(grabCursor,CursorManagerPriority.LOW,0,0); } public function down():void{ CursorManager.setCursor(grabbingCursor,CursorManagerPriority.HIGH,0,0); } public function up():void{ CursorManager.setCursor(grabCursor,CursorManagerPriority.LOW,0,0); } public function out():void{ CursorManager.removeAllCursors(); } Edit 12/17/09: I've made a little bit of progress, I'm now doing this on rollOver var styleSheet:CSSStyleDeclaration = StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration("DragManager"); styleSheet.setStyle("moveCursor", grabbingCursor); CursorManager.setCursor(grabCursor,CursorManagerPriority.LOW); This is giving me the correct rollover and correct drag, but if I try to add any function to rollOut it screws up again, so now I'm stuck with the grabCursor. It seems like when I set a rollOut on the dataGrid it's firing for each row, same with mouseOut, is there any way to avoid that? Edit 12/21/09: It is a confirmed thing that roll/mouse out/over fire for every item in the datagrid. The solution I need is how to prevent that and only fire it when the user mouses out of the datagrid as a whole. I need flex to see the forest, not the trees. PS. the rollout only fires on every item when I am dragging. mouseout fires on every item regardless EDIT 12/21/09, End of the day: I have managed to answer my own question so my bounty rep is lost to me :-( Anyway since my answer solves my problem I will award the bounty to anyone that can answer this. My solution uses AS to remove the the rollOut/rollOver while a user is dragging. In a dataGrid. How can you get the same result without removing the rollOut/rollOver (so that rollOut is not firing for each item as you drag another item over it)?
