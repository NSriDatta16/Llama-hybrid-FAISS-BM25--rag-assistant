Corrupt iPhone App Name

I've done an adhoc build to test an application, but when I drag it into iTunes to add to my devices it is getting a corrupt name. It comes up with the name " Myapp Name http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd "> " which continues with the whole plist I've tried the obvious, clean/rebuild/reboot. This worked fine last time I worked on the app and I've done nothing to project settings other than incement the version number and a couple of minor code changes. I've since update XCode to 3.2.1 and iTunes to 9.0.3. Anyone seen this before?
