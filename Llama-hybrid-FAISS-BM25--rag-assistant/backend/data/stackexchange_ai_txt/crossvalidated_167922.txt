Classify users by the pages they liked

I have a data set of users, and a list of pages each users liked. My goal is to derive k classes of users. The first thing that comes to mind are bag-of-words models The way I see it, there are 2 approaches: Bayesian I was thinking of applying LDA and get a posterior probability of classes for each user. However, LDA is usually applied to topic classification of documents. In the topic case, a word can be repeated several times in a document. And in my case, a page can be liked only once by a user. Another option is to apply pLSA , which is ok since I know the list of possible pages in advance Factorizing the User-Page Matrix A different approach would be apply some factor analysis method on the user-page matrix, such as SVD or LFM From your experience, what algorithms work well for short documents ?
