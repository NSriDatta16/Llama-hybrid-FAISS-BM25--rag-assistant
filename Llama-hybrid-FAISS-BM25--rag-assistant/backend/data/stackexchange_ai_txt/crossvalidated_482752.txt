HDRs for standard probability distributions can also be computed using the stat.extend package. This gives a user friendly output for the region in set form. Here is an example of computing the region for a particular choice of parameters. #Compute and print HDR for the chi-squared distribution DF It can easily be established that the endpoints of the interval have the same density value (to within a small tolerance from the optimisation algorithm) and that the interval has the required coverage level. #Check endpoints of HDR dchisq(min(HDR), df = DF, ncp = NCP) [1] 0.002842709 dchisq(max(HDR), df = DF, ncp = NCP) [1] 0.002842709 #Check coverage probability pchisq(max(HDR), df = DF, ncp = NCP) - pchisq(min(HDR), df = DF, ncp = NCP) [1] 0.99
