One nice abstraction to think of it is this: Think of the Position of the Ant as $(0,0,0)$ and Spider $(1,1,1)$, now each move the spider can make will essentially switch exactly one of the three components from $1\to0$ or $0\to1$. So the question becomes: If I randomly switch bits in (1,1,1) after how many steps in average do I get 0,0,0 We see the shortest way is 3 switches. Since it doesn't matter with which bit I start the probability of that happening is 1 * 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9 . If we make 1 mistake (switch one bit back to 1) we will need 5 steps. And the chances of making a mistake are 7/9 - if we want to make only one mistake, we have to get from there back and do everything right again - so the chance of making exactly 1 mistake resulting in 5 steps is 7/9 * 2/9 and the chance of making 2 mistakes aka 7 steps is (7/9)Â² * 2/9 and so on. So the formula for the expected average number of steps is: $$\mathbb E(\mathrm{steps}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (3 + 2n) \cdot \frac{2}{9} \cdot \left ( \frac{7}{9} \right ) ^{n} = 10$$
