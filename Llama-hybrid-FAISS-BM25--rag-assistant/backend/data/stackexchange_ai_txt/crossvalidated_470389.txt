Your understanding is kind of correct. Yes, the purpose of the hidden state is to encode a history. Let's say your input is the sequence of data from day 2 to 11, the encoded history in the hidden state is due to the data from day 2 to 11 only. So your batches should contain all the history needed for each output prediction. You can also use another RNN to decode the hidden state into a sequence of predictions, if that suits your needs better. You definitely need to reset the hidden state between batches. When you're training a NN with something like SGD, you assume that your data is iid. Therefore by your assumption, subsequent batches are independent of one another. Surely you don't want your hidden state from your past prediction to influence the next one in this setting.
