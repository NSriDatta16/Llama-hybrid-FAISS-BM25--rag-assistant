The IBM example worked for me (under Z/os 1.9) but I had to add a pragma to set the codepage: on top of the example: #pragma filetag("IBM-500") The compiler did not accept the [ and ] in the char text[80]; I've tried to change char text[80] into char *text as well but I got the same strange result as you.
