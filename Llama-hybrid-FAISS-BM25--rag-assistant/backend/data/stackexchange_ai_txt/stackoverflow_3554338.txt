insert line break instead of in TinyMCE

I have initialised TinyMCE as follows. I want to force line breaks when user presses enter and not the paragraphs. I'm trying following, but not working. I'm using TinyMCE version 3_3_8. tinyMCE.init({ mode: "exact", theme: "advanced", elements: "textAreaId", cleanup: false, theme_advanced_toolbar_location: "", theme_advanced_buttons1: "", theme_advanced_buttons2: "", theme_advanced_buttons3: "", height: 200, width: 300, forced_root_block : false, force_br_newlines : true, force_p_newlines : false, oninit: InitPosition }); //init ends I tried to define forced_root_block : "" , but still it is not working. What am I doing wrong?
