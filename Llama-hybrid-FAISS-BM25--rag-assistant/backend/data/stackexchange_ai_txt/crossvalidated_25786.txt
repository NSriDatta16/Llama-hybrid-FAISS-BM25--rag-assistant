What sort of problems is backpropagation best suited to solving, and what are the best alternatives to backprop for solving those problems?

I am developing a neuroscience-inspired training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks. The natural benchmark for comparison is backpropagation. So I need to know to know what sort of classification problems backpropagation (and thus feed-forward NNs) is most suited for. Also, since I ultimately want to move beyond backprop, what non NN algorithms are the best alternatives to backprop, when it comes to the sort of problems that backprop is good at. Or, in other words, what problems should I benchmark a feed-forward network on, and what are the algorithms to beat for those problems?
