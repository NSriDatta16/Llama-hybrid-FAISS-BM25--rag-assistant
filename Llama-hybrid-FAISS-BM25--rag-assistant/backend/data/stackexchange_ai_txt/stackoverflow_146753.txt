I second what Dan Udey says. I had no trouble switching to a tablet and on the rare occasions that I use a pointer at all while programming, it is a blessing. One simple example: scrolling through a long list by dragging the scrollbar seems more natural with a tablet than a mouse. And as an added benefit, when I am in "graphic artist" mode on little projects the tablet is an obvious win. Spodi: I agree on the keyboard for shortcuts, so the only buttons I use on either the mouse or the tablet are the first and second, both of which are available on the pen; I am not sure what you mean by looking at the tablet to click buttons. As for the speed of getting to the mouse, I tuck the pen between two fingers on my right hand, so it is always right there.
