Let's clear things up. Metropolis-Hastings is an Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. "Monte Carlo" in MCMC stands for "simulation" (though there are non-Monte Carlo simulation algorithms ). MCMC algorithms are used to sample , not estimate, values from the distributions. Having samples from the distributions, we can use some sample statistics, e.g. sample mean, to calculate things like mean of the distribution, and treat this result as a point estimate. "Sampler" is an algorithm, so a Monte Carlo algorithm, that is able to sample, though I don't recall seeing this term often in the academic literature, but rather as a technical term used in software documentation. I'm not sure if I follow what you mean by "Fisher formalism", but it seems that you are talking about Laplace approximation , i.e. method to approximate the posterior distribution with a Gaussian (rather then sample directly from the distribution, as in MCMC). We use it usually when MCMC is computationally too expensive, so we cannot afford it. There are other algorithms to approximate posterior distributions as well, Laplace approximation is just one of the examples.
