MySQL and even SQLite already have spatial indexes, so no problem there. To store the datafiles you could use a BLOB field, but it's usually much better (and easier to optimise) to store as files. To keep the files related to the DB records you can either put the full path (or URL) in a varchar field, or store the image in a path calculated by the record's ID. To easily scale into the multi-terabyte store, plan from the start on using several servers. If the data is read-mostly, an easy way is to store the images on different hosts, each with a static HTTP server, and the database records where is each image. then put a webapp frontend for the database, where the URLs for each image directly point to the appropriate storage server. That way you can keep adding storage without creating a bottleneck on the 'central' server.
