It depends on how busy the server is going to be. The hardware sounds fine for lightweight usage, maybe a couple queries per second. Unless it's a huge school, that seems reasonable. You could certainly use a different platform that would run faster (PHP maybe) but Rails will be much faster and friendlier to develop with once you learn your way around, and I don't think the performance will be an issue for a small system. (Oh, and if you can, get Linux installed. Like a lot of open-source systems, Ruby gets more usage and development attention on Unix OSs than on Windows, so it tends to work better on them. Linux also makes more efficient use of lesser hardware.)
