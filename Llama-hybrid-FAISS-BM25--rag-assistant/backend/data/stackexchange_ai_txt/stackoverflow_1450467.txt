On top of what Chuck said, Apple would have to verify that everything in MonoTouch works and won't cause crashes that would make Apple look bad. That would mean Apple would have to rigorously test and QA not only MonoTouch now, but each MonoTouch subsequent release. Even if it's trivial to add MonoTouch support, it's not trivial to do it right . BootCamp was probably also a gigantic engineering effort to develop and QA for Apple, but it was worth it to lure Windows users (a gigantic market) to Macs.
