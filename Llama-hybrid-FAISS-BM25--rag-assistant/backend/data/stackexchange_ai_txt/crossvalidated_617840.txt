Estimating number and volume of cells in a rat brain from a sample

I have a sample made of several disjoint cuboids. Within each cuboid, I have cells entirely contained in the cuboid and fragments (intersecting one or more faces, so their total volume is unobserved). Cells are of different forms and sizes and lie in random positions and orientations. There are in each cuboid far more fragments than totally contained cells The problem is to estimate both total volume AND number of cells. There is no problem with volume, but I am struggling with the number of cells. I cannot count fragments as one cell, for that would lead to duplicity. I cannot estimate total volume and divide by the average volume of totally observed cells, because this average volume underestimates the real average volume: small cells are more likely to be totally contained in a cuboid. I would be grateful for any pointers or ideas on how to deal with this problem.
