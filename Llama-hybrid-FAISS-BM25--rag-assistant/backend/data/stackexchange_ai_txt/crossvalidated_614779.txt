Citing Gelman et al. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/ (page 20), where the second formula is always used: "Some authors use different notations for distributions on parameters and observables—for example, $\pi(\theta), f(y|\theta)$ —but this obscures the fact that all probability distributions have the same logical status in Bayesian inference. We must always be careful, though, to indicate appropriate conditioning; for example, $p(y\theta)$ is different from $p(y)\,.$ "
