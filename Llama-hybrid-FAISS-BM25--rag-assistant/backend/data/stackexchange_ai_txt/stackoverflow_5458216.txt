Running into problem with implementing highlighting current link rendered

Following this snippet , I have set-up in my rails application to highlight the current link being rendered. 'welcome' ) %> | 'pois' ) %> | 'news', :ref => 'home' ) %> | 'documents', :ref => 'home' ) %> | 'organisations', :ref => 'home' ) %> | 'welcome', :action => 'dashboard' ) %> | 'sign_out' %> 'sign_up' %> | 'sign_in' %> In application_controller.rb I have the following: def instantiate_controller_and_action_names @current_action = action_name @current_controller = controller_name end In application_helper.rb: def section_link(name, options) action = options[:action] || 'index' controller = options[:controller] if action.eql?(@current_action) and controller.eql?(@current_controller) link_to(name, options, :class => 'youarehere') else link_to(name, options) end end I think, I have everything set-up correctly. However, it is throwing this weird error at me: Showing /home/syed/work/projects/mapunity/environment/app/views/shared/links/_user.erb where line #2 raised: No route matches {:controller=>"devise/welcome"} Extracted source (around line #2): 1: 2: 'welcome' ) %> | 3: 4: 'pois' ) %> | 5: 'news', :ref => 'home' ) %> | Why is it automatically adding :controller => "devise/welcome" ? Any pointers to where I am going wrong would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
