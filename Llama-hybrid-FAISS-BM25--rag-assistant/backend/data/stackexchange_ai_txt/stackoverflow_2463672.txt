Can you explain a bit more as to why you want to avoid Google Charting APIs (I ask since I am intrigued as to why someone would not want to do something that is very simple, elegant and FREE)? Also there is a GraphingServlet section "Exposing Performance Graphs in a Web Application" which I think internally does the same thing. If you still want you can take the graph data (in raw csv format) and write some helper classes to create charts using libraries like jfreechart (rich client)
