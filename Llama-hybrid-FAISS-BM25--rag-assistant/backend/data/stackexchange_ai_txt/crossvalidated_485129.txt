Answering this question requires a degree of generalisation that may obscure the diverse pathways through which people become statistics professors. Here I will give some broad generalisations based on my own observations of the pathways through which my own mentors and colleagues became statistics professors. In my observation, most ---but not all--- statistics professors who work on theoretical material come directly from a mathematics background. Most have done an undergraduate degree in mathematics, and this piqued their interest in probability and statistics, leading to postgraduate work in statistics. For professors with this background, they were taught all the things in the coverage of an undergraduate mathematics degree, including exposure to naive set theory, axiomatic set theory, and the foundations of mathematics. This is usually something that they previously studied during undergraduate/postgraduate degrees, but it is not common for them to continue work in this area in their careers, and so they are usually quite rusty on this material. Other statistics professors come from an applied science background with an undergraduate degree that was in some area that used statistics but did not involve deeper study of mathematics (e.g., economics, actuarial studies, finance, psychology, etc.). For these people, they usually hit a bit of a mathematical wall when starting postgraduate work in statistics, and they have to learn a lot of mathematical material that was absent in their undergraduate degree. This would usually include learning measure theory and set theory, and learning real analysis in greater depth than is usually covered in an applied science degree. Deeper learning of the foundations of mathematics would not usually be required, but it is not uncommon for people to dabble out of curiosity. In terms of the depth of mathematical knowledge required for theoretical statistical work, for the most part, it is sufficent to have a solid understanding of logic and proofs (so that you can form theorems and prove them), and also have a good understanding of real analysis and measure theory. That is enough to understand the foundations of probability theory, which is where most statistical theory work starts. Knowledge of the foundations of mathematics is rarely required --- it is usually sufficient to take for granted that we can form a probability measure on a sigma-field of sets (e.g., the Borel sets) and start from there. Deeper foundational issues are left to logicians and mathematicians who work in that field. Finally, it is worth noting that probabilists and statisticians often consider themselves somewhat similar to logicians, insofar as probability theory can be regarded as an "extension" of propositional (true-false) logic. This is particularly true for Bayesian statisticians, who often regard their work to be merely inductive logic, framed in mathematical form as an extension of propositional logic.
