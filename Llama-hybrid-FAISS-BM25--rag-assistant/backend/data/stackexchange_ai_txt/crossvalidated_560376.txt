Weighted mean and error propagation, again

I was trying to implement the method proposed by @whuber in this question to average some of my data. For example: $62.7\pm 6.8$ $65.3\pm 0.94$ $66.5 \pm 6.0$ $71.8 \pm 7.8$ So far, I have two concerns: The data and uncertainty are not from direct measurements, but from data fitting, i.e., the uncertainty is usually given by the square root of the covariance matrix in chi2 minimization or some credible levels in MCMC sampling. Does this method still work in such a case? Because I notice that it assumes the $\sigma_i$ are accurately known. Applying the method to the above samples, I always get $\hat\sigma_{j} = 0$ in each step of the iteration. Does that mean the original uncertainty is big enough for determining the uncertainty of the weighted average? PS: Since I am not so familiar with statistics, what would be the best way to cite it if I want to use this method in one of my research papers?
