The SD Java Profiler collects profiling data in a way that generalizes test coverage. So if you have its profile data displayed, you have the test coverage data effectively displayed too; there's no need for a side-by-side comparison. Not free, and doesn't plug into eclipse yet, but does use a Java GUI.
