It is not directly possible to filter on the first item of a collection relation (such as Bs[0] ), for one because ICollection does not have an indexer. However, it is possible to use predicates such as Any in a Dynamic Linq expression, such as: result = list.Where("Bs.Any(Id = @0)", value); which is equivalent to result = from a in list where a.Bs.Any(b => b.Id == value) select a; (This translates to an EXISTS query in SQL.) I think that's what you're after, not Bs[0] . The full list of supported predicates and aggregates for System.Linq.Dynamic seems to be: Where ( condition ) Any () and Any ( condition ) All ( condition ) Count () and Count ( condition ) Max ( selector ) Min ( selector ) Sum ( selector ) Average ( selector ) For Bs[0].Id = @0 you'd need to have support for First ( condition ), which you could add to a private copy of System.Linq.Dynamic, by editing the interface IEnumerableSignatures , adding void First(); void First(bool predicate); void FirstOrDefault(); void FirstOrDefault(bool predicate); (Adding Last(OrDefault) and Single(OrDefault) as well would be a logical step IMHO.)
