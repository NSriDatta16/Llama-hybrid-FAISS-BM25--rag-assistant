In my organization, we had management help to foster the creation of a shared library. We also indoctrinate new hires to use it. Then, we put good code that must be reviewed by everyone for usefulness and completeness. This is where the group buy in comes into play. Also, we have a very robust, documented process for branching the shared lib for use in Visual Studio. Hint: we use svn:external property to manage checkouts from different repositories in the same folder structure. Potential shared code first exists in the branches before it gets promoted to the trunk.
