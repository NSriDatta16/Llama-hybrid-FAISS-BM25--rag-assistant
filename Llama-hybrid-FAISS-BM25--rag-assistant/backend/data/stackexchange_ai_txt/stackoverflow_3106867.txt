Can one be master of multiple programming languages or not?

Is it possible to be an expert at multiple programming languages and platforms (e.g. C#/.NET, **Objective-C/Cocoa, Java/Spring...Hibernate ) assuming you spend 5-10 years developing software with it. Or is it always going to lead to being good at one thing and mediocre at the rest? To put it in different words: To focus or not to focus in one development language/platform. PS: Please don't bring up Jon Skeet as an example . We all know he doesn't have to even learn programming languages; programming languages learn from him. Our assumption is an average developer.
