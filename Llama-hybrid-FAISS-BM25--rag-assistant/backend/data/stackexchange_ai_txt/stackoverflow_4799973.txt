One option could be ASP.NET profiles, but there are ugly data storage issues unless you want to roll your own persistance there. Cookie is generally the right way to go, though the trick there is to make sure you aren't counting bots. Another angle would be to steal a page from Google's book and put the tracking as asynchronous javascript. Then you'd need to cookie visitors and push the ID out to the client side (or read it from JS if you like such things). But that would generally eliminate bots as most of them don't do javascript. Yet.
