What is the simplest way to parse binary files in Cocoa Touch?

Say I have a binary file (generated with Java) containing a 32 bit int value. I'm currently using the following Objective-C code for parsing it: NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"foo" ofType:@"dat"]; NSFileHandle *file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:path]; unsigned long intValue; memcpy(&intValue, [[file readDataOfLength:4] bytes], 4); intValue = NSSwapBigLongToHost(intValue); [file closeFile]; My first question is to ask if it's the common way of doing things on the iPhone because I didn't find anything close to Java's DataInputStream. My second question is related to the line of code with a memcpy. I don't undestand why the following part (more elegant, less "low-level") is not working instead: [[file readDataOfLength:4] getbytes:&intValue]; I'm getting a warning on build: 'NSData' may not respond to '-getbytes:' On execution, I'm getting: 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSConcreteData getbytes:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
