You can exploit the inherent parallelism of your process by organizing work into threads. However whether the work truly runs in parallel or not depends upon the underlying hardware (single versus multiple CPUs, engines or cores). There are also threading models that bind to a system task or thread and others were the threads share the underlying tasks. On a multi-processor the underlying tasks can run in parallel. If you abstract the code correctly and it can take advantage of the threads then it will run fine on a single or multi-processor, exploiting the multiple engines when/if available.
