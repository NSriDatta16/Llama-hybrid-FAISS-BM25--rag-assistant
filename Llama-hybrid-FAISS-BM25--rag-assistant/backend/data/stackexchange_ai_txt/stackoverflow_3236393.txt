Magento catalogProductInfo - access denied for unknown reason

I am getting access denied when asking Magento with following request: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 119 Here is the response: 2 Access denied. Session id is correct and I can do other request but catalogProductInfo just fails. I am using Java and Axis 1.4 to access Magento.
