Answer 1: Write a statement like this: assert(output == expectedOutput) If this returns TRUE you have verified your code for one case. Repeat for a sufficient number and coverage of test cases to satisfy yourself. Seriously: write down a list of test cases and their inputs and expected outputs, check that your code produces the expected outputs. Answer 2: Add noise like this: noisyValues = values .* noiseVector; Create noiseVector with the characteristics of the noise you want.
