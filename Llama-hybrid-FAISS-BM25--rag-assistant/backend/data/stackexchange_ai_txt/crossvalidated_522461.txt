An exponential moving average ( $EMA$ ) is an IIR filter: Infinite impulse response, meaning that, technically, the "weights" vector of the $EMA$ is of infinite length, because an $EMA$ uses its own output in the previous time step as an input in the current one: $EMA =$ $\alpha$ $*$ $Close$ $+$ $(1 â€“$ $\alpha$ ) $*$ $EMA[1]$ with: $EMA[1]$ the value of the EMA in the previous step $Close$ the value of your input signal in the current time step. However, you can approximate an $EMA$ with a finite window length $n$ , depending on the number of decimals you require: I refer to this thread. It is known that the $\alpha$ of the $EMA$ is associated with window length $n$ like this: $\alpha$ $= 2 / (n + 1)$ or $n =$ $(2 / $ $\alpha$$)$$-1$ So an $\alpha$ of i.e. $0.1$ would correspond to a window $n$ of $19$ , a window of i.e. $n=10$ , would correspond to an $\alpha$ of $0.181818...$ And the general shape of the $EMA$ weights will look like this (although I would plot them in reverse order, because a window slides over a time series from left to right, if it's a causal filter). The interesting aspect about this question is that all these different types of moving averages (SMA, EMA, LWMA, HMA, ...) are more or less the same once you express them in function of lag. I refer to this thread.
