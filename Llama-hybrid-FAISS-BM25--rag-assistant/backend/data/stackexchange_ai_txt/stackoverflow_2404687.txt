Jquery Cycle: How Can I Paginate the Pager?

I am using the Jquery cycle plug in with the pager. I have a lot of items to page through. Is there a way I can add back and previous arrows to paginate the pager? So I have like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and I want the same but Is there an elegant way to code this? Many thanks for your help!
