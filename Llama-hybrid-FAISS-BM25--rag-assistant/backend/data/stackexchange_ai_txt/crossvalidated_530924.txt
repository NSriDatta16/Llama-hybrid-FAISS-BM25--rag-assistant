What difference between Mann-whintey U-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on truncated log normal distributions?

I have two populations who have been exposed to two different websites that should bring them to donations: one with a progress bar that pushes them to give (B, segment 2) and the other not (A, segment 1). And with log(y): So it looks log-normal. I have noticed that, on average, population B gives much more than A: s1 s2 count 3352.000000 3053.000000 mean 86.137828 109.417294 std 239.235495 231.897494 min 2.000000 3.000000 25% 20.000000 25.000000 50% 30.000000 50.000000 75% 60.000000 100.000000 max 9000.000000 6200.000000 I know that, as my distributions aren't normally distributed I need to have a non-parametric test but I wanted to know what method should I use to test that. Should I use a U-test or a Ks-test? Because I tried both and they gave different results. Indeed the U-test ( scipy library ) gave: p = stats.mannwhitneyu(np.log(df_segment_1), np.log(df_segment_2), use_continuity=True, alternative='less') alpha = 0.05 if p[1] > alpha: print('Same distribution (fail to reject H0)') else: print("p : ", p[1]) print('Different distribution (reject H0)') p : 6.975597756441267e-11 Different distribution (reject H0) Whereas the ks test ( scipy library ) rejects the null hypothesis: p = stats.ks_2samp(np.log(df_segment_1), np.log(df_segment_2), alternative='less') alpha = 0.05 if p[1] > alpha: print("p : ", p[1]) print('Same distribution (fail to reject H0)') else: print("p : ", p[1]) print('Different distribution (reject H0)') p : 0.9954748308681242 Same distribution (fail to reject H0) These results are very-different. Did I did a mistake? Or is one of them not fit for the use?
