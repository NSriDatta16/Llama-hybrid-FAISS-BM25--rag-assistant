I've been inspired by client side gist embedding and built a script.js hack library just for that (I also use it to remove the embedded link style and use my own style that fits better on my page) ... It's more generic than just embedding gists and pasties - actually I'm using it to dynamically load some third-party widgets / google maps / twitter posts) ... https://github.com/kares/script.js Here's the embedding example : https://github.com/kares/script.js/blob/master/examples/gistsAndPasties.html UPDATE : gist's API since then supports JSONP , jQuery sample: var printGist = function(gist) { console.log(gist.repo, ' (' + gist.description + ') :'); console.log(gist.div); }; $.ajax({ url: 'https://gist.github.com/1641153.json', dataType: 'jsonp', success: printGist });
