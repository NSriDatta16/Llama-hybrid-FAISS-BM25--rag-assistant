Basic Idea of Boruta Algorithm Perform shuffling of predictors' values and join them with the original predictors and then build random forest on the merged dataset. Then make comparison of original variables with the randomised variables to measure variable importance. Only variables having higher importance than that of the randomised variables are considered important. Difference between Boruta and Random Forest Importance Measure In random forest, the Z score is computed by dividing the average accuracy loss by its standard deviation. It is used as the importance measure for all the variables. But we cannot use Z Score which is calculated in random forest, as a measure for finding variable importance as this Z score is not directly related to the statistical significance of the variable importance. To workaround this problem, boruta package runs random forest on both original and random attributes and compute the importance of all variables. Since the whole process is dependent on permuted copies, we repeat random permutation procedure to get statistically robust results. Is Boruta a solution for all? Answer is NO. You need to test other algorithms. It is not possible to judge the best algorithm without knowing data and assumptions. Since it is an improvement on random forest variable importance measure, it should work well on most of the times.
