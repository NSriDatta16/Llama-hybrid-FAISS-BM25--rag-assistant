Factor analysis to remove noise

Performing factor analysis/PCA to remove potential hidden latent variables from high dimensional data is extremely useful to remove confounding/noise/measurement error and batch effects. However, when the variable of interest is also highly correlated across many of the factors/PCs. Is there anything you can do? What are the statistical limitations to removing hidden factors?
