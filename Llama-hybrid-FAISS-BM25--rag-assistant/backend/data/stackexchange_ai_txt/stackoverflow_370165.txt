Datareader returns no results in VS yet Stored Procedure returns multiple result sets in Sql Server

I am having trouble retrieving results from my datareader in visual studio 2008. I have several stored Procs in the same database. I am able to retrieve values from those that dont receive input parameters. However, when i use the executreReader() method on a stored proc with input parameters i get an empty datareader. Upon examining the result collection the message "IEnumerable returned no results" appears. I am baffled as I can execute the stored procs within sql server and return result sets. I was previously able to retrieve rows from these stored procedures within Visual Studio but apparently it just stopped working one day. I have tried using a dataadapter to fill a dataset with my results and using the executereader() method to get a sqldatareader and Still I get no results. No exceptions are thrown either. My parameters are all named properly but I should be able to call these stored procs with no parameters and have that return an unfiltered result set. The code im currently using is the following: string connStr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyConnectionString"] .ConnectionString; SqlConnection connCactus = new SqlConnection(connStr); SqlCommand cmdPopulateFilterDropDowns = new SqlCommand( "dbo.MyStoredProc", connCactus); SqlDataReader rdrFilterSearch = null; cmdPopulateFilterDropDowns.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; connCactus.Open(); rdrFilterSearch = cmdPopulateFilterDropDowns .ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection); return (rdrFilterSearch); Please Help!
