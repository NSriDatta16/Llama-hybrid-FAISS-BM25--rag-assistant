They don't ship synchronized releases of WebKit. For example, Google Chrome Official Build 2200 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.30 Safari/525.1 versus Safari 3.1.2 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; pl-PL) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.21 WebKit is very modular, so they have different drawing and javascript engines. Plugins are handled in significantly different manners as well. In practice, I have not seen any site that acts differently, and the two browsers should have identical behavior, as far as any sane webpage is concerned. You could, of course, sniff the user-agent and force different behavior... So no, there is no reason at the moment to test both. Keep in mind that Google does not have a stable release of Chrome yet.
