Is there a single regression quality metric for the median and the 95% percentile?

I want to evaluate the quality of prediction of two values the median and 95% percentile of a distribution. Is there a standard way to do this? I have thought about using "Mean Mean Average Error" of the two targets. With this I mean $$\text{MMAE} = \frac{\text{MAE of the median} + \text{MAE of the 95% percentile}}{2}$$ So if predicted median is 17 and the true median is 15, MAE would be 2. If the predicted 95% percentile is 20 and the true median is 19, MAE would be 1. MMAE for this example would be 1.5. I want to penalize distance to the target evenly, and not quadratically, which is why I'm not using mean MSE. Is this a common practice? I haven't found much literature about it. This example in the ML Mastery blog uses MAE , but it's not really what I want, as it's compared against a single prediction target and the target 95% is a true value for my application. For this application, I only care about these two particular values: median and 95% percentile not the shape of the distribution between them.
