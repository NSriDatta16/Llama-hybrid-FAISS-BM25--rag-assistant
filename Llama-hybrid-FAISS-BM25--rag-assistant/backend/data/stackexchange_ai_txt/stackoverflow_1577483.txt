After doing a little bit of research on the subject I got an answer to my question. Though I do not like it very much for it looks more like another hack. But I will use it unless somebody suggests a more elegant solution. So: In JBoss 5.1.0 (the one I am playing with) class loaders are registered with names like: jboss.classloader:id="vfsfile: " At the same time the string representation of a class loader object returned by the toString() method looks like this: BaseClassLoader@ {vfsfile: } Therefore it is possible to extract the archive-file-name from the class loader string representation and construct an appropriate ObjectName from it.
