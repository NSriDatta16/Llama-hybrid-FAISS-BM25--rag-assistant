In the eve of the semantic web, correctness is something to consider. Unfortunately, PHP's "Location"-header still uses the HTTP 302 -redirect code, which, strictly, isn't the best one for redirection. The one it should use instead, is the 303 one. W3C is kind enough to mention that the 303-header is incompatible with "many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents," which would amount to no browser in current use. So, the 302 is a relic, which shouldn't be used. ...or you could just ignore it, as everyone else...
