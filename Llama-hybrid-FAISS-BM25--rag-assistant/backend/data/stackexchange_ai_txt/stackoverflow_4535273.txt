Detecting inconsistent revisions of shared sources in SVN

I have an SVN repository containing several components: LibraryA LibraryB - depends on LibraryA Application - depends on LibraryB and LibraryA More detailed structure (branches and tags are not related to the problem): LibraryA LibraryA_code LibraryB LibraryB_code svn:externals to a fixed revision R1 of LibraryA_code Application Application_code svn:externals to a fixed revision R2 of LibraryA_code svn:externals to a fixed revision R3 of LibraryB_code The problem I'm trying to solve is automatic detection of situation when R2 differs from R1 (breaking expectations of LibraryB_code) and notification about this (e.g. build failure). I'll describe in an answer the only solution which I see for now, but I hope for something more elegant :) Environment: Windows, Visual Studio, SVN.
