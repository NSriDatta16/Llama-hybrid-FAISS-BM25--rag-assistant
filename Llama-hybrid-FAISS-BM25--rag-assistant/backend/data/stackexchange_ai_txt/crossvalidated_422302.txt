Help with Old exam questions on Bayesian Inference Problem

I've been trying to teach myself bayesian inference and I found a question sheet online ---> https://math.mit.edu/~dav/05.dir/ps6.pdf . I was attempting to solve question 4 but I'm not sure the method in doing parts a or b. The formula I have for posterior distribution is giving me the wrong answers. Can anyone tell me how I'd go about solving this, like a general solution that will help me solve questions like this in the future? Thanks
