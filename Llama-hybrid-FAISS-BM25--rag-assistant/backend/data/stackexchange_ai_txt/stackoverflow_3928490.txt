Is there a way to consume a web service in Access 97 VBA?

The question is simple enough. And judging by my last thirty minutes of searching around, I'm assuming that the answer is a resounding "no". So if it's a no, here's a follow up question: What's the best workaround? Is a COM wrapper around the web service a viable solution for a VBA version that old? Most of the functionality in the web service is simple data storage and retrieval, which I supposed I could do directly with a database connection. But this would result in a lot of duplicate work, and there are some actual procedural calls in the web service that I would still have to support somehow, perhaps in a standalone executable that gets called from the VBA code. Does anyone have any thoughts on this admittedly peculiar scenario?
