The R package bcp seem to fulfill all of these ( associated paper here ). It returns the probability of change point at each index in your data, so you have to set a threshold yourself. This is a nice feature compared to many other packages. For multivariate change point detection, it requires that the data is in a matrix format, i.e., that all outcome variables are observed simultaneously (or close enough that it's OK to pretend). It does not model autocorrelation which is often an important feature of time series. I have tried to make an overview of change point packages in R . Few match your problem but take a look at the list of not-yet-reviewed packages at the top of the page.
