Most android phones (with the exception of some current AT&T models) can have an option enabled in their settings menu to permit installation of applications from 3rd party websites, email attachments, etc. As far as I have heard, all current android phones (included the restricted AT&T models) can have USB debugging enabled which will permit applications to be installed by means of the software development kit (free). There's also a 3rd-party tool called the "sideload wonder machine" that permits windows PC's to leverage this installation mechanism without needing to install the actual SDK on the PC.
