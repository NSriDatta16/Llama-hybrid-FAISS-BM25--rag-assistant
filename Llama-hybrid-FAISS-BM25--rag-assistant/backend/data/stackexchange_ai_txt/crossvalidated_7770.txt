I've had good experiences with Madigan's and Lewis's BMR and BBR packages for multiple category dependent variables, lasso or ridge priors on parameters, and high dimensional input data. Not quite as high as yours, but it might still be worth a look. Instructions are here: http://bayesianregression.com/bmr.html
