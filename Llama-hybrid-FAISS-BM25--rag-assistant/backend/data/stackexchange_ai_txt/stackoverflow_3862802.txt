Security - Detecting user's device details on website

Is it possible to detect these for visitors or registered users on my website without using any plugins? I am creating the security features so scouting around for things i can detect for added security alerts. Security is very important with this service due to storage of confidential information so I am trying to use different security layers. One layer is to auto-detect device details for usage patterns and flag accordingly. But I need to know if these can be detected: If they are using Wireless internet or LAN. If wireless then the SSID. MAC address of network card Computer name Current screen resolution user is using ISP user is using User account currently logged in the OS. * Also, what else can we detect to uniquely identify a device? All all the above is good but can still change. Only item I can think of is Serial number of the device. Which I am not sure if we can detect without plugings. Platform is PHP but ofcourse can integrate any language if it is possible to detect these in some other language.
