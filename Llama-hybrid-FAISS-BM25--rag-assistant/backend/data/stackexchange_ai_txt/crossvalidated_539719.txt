Same random seed for different dependent variables in machine learning?

Consider dependent variables $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ , some of which may be correlated. For each dependent variable, I want to use machine learning with sample splits for model selection. Clearly, for each dependent variable, the sample splits should be random. However, across dependent variables, is there any need for the sample splits to be random? In particular, purely for the sake of convenience, I want to set the same random seed for each dependent variable. In either theory or practice, will this bias my analyses? If it helps, the machine learning method I'm using is Lasso.
