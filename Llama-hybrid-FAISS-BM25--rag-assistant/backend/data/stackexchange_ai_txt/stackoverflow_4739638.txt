Since the Codeigniter Structure is: Controller / Method / Params I assume that : User/authorize is your controller/method. Now, $route['user/authorize?code=:any'] = "user/asdf"; Should be : $route['user/authorize/:any'] = "user/asdf"; where function authorize($code = null) { echo $code; } will output same as function authorize(){ $code = $_GET['code']; } So oldskool php you write : ninja.php?code=something in CI is third segment. /user/authorize/TOCElrzcR5MYz_J8O67hWA__.3600.1295467200-17044424246|4FPbz0N-pXqGWYR81PWGPTY06A4 is equal to ninja.php?code=TOCElrzcR5MYz_J8O67hWA__.3600.1295467200-17044424246|4FPbz0N-pXqGWYR81PWGPTY06A4 as explained on the begining.
