std.algorithm.map works via a template alias parameter, and binding is at compile time. Walter Bright (the D language designer) hasn't been clear yet on the semantics of template alias parameters in these situations, though what you're trying to do seems to somehow work in practice. Clarifying this is a todo (I think). Perhaps you would be better off asking this on the digitalmars.d newsgroup, as this would get Walter's attention and encourage him to clarify the semantics.
