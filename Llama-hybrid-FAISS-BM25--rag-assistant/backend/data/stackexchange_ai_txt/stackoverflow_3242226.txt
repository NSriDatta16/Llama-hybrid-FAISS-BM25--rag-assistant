Getting a gmail address with... openid? oauth?

I'm getting confused. I was able to make openid login kinda work using LightOpenID . All I get doing that is just an openid_identity such as " https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=xxx ". Pretty disappointing: I was expecting to get the email address too. i.e. I need to login (that's what openid does) and to know the email address of the google account the user used to login. There is the function $openid->getAttributes() but all I get from that is just an empty array: I guess google isn't going to give me anything else than that openid_identity . So I guess I'm supposed to use OAuth , right? I'm clueless about that. I've only found horrible and confused documentation, that either pretends to explain everything (and I do mean everything ), or it fails explain anything at all . Yes, of course I've tried to look at the previous posts about that, just as I did search on google. Read again the above paragraph, please.
