How to compare different probability sets from different logistic models?

Do you know how to compare different sets of probabilities from different logistic models? For example, I would like to predict customer's probability to buy four different products, i.e. A, B, C and D. So I developed four different logistic regression models to give four probability sets respectively. Now I've probability sets A, B, C, D for all customers, but I want to know which product of four I should recommend to a customer. For example, a customer has a probability of 0.8 to purchase product A, 0.6 to purchase product B, 0.4 to purchase product C and 0.2 to purchase product D. Meanwhile, probability set A ranges from 0.7 to 0.9, while probability set B ranges from 0.5 to 0.6. I don't think simply sorting them in descending order is OK. So do you know how could I compare these different probabilities from different logistic regression models? Thanks a lot! PS I believe I've read somewhere that it could be done with some linear regression model, but I cannot remember clearly......pls help!
