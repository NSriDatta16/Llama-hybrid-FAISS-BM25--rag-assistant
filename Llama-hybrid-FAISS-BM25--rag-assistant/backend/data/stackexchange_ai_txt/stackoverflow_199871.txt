We used to either set up a small brief for them to work within a certain timeframe, or in some cases contract a job to them and see how they went. I was never that worried about making someone sit down at a laptop in an interview room and bang out a solution, because that kind of environment is not (you'd hope) very much like the normal working conditions. The exact nature of the brief will depend a lot on the skillset you are looking for. In some shops, the front end developers will have to take on a certain amount of filling the gaps in design, and/or performing "brand police" duties as they implement the design "vibe". In those cases, leaving some holes in the brief regarding some of the finer points of the typography and other small details can give you some hints as to their abilities in those respects. Let them choose the javascript framework, did they choose the one best for the job, or the one that they knew. (subjective question, yes. But pulling in dojo for the sake of a datepicker and some menu animations might be overkill) I would look for someone who can implement css based layouts, but can in fact work on table based layouts if needed when dealing with legacy projects. Maligned as they are, some of the finer details of hacky table layouts weren't always easy. The main thing in this sort of task is the attention to detail, have they added a set of style rules for printing, used appropriate image sizing and formats, produced clean and valid code, have they gone for gold because they really want the job, and are prepared to stretch themselves a little to get it. Because you give them some extra time, it is fair to expect that they try to impress, rather than the stress laden scenario of putting them at a strange desk and telling them to go for it. So, whilst being realistic and not expecting obsessively perfect work every day on every task, in this situation I'm looking for gold, or at least evidence that gold was the target. Throw in a curve ball of something they haven't done before... see how well they can pick it up in a hurry. Experience is good, but the ability to learn fast is probably more important in an area that changes so fast.
