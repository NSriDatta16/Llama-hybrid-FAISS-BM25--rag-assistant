Would you be able to use the client side storage to store the global variable? you will then, not lose it on page loads or refresh. You could either use this to debug and see if you are getting a page refresh because sometimes extensions are fickle and you don't even notice the refresh, but if you store the variable as a key value pair in web storage you might get past this. localStorage.setItem('imgId', '5'); to set your key/value pair localStorage.getItem('imgId'); to retrieve your key/value pair Then you can set a new local storage for each series of pictures that has been displayed to the client based on the last number that is set in local storage.
