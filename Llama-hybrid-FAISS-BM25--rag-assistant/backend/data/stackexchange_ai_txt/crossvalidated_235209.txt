Deep network to learn orientation from image data

I am training a CNN to classify images on the basis of type and orientation on a fashion dataset. (The dataset contains images of 25 categories, with image of each item being taken from 5 different orientations). I have finetuned bvlc-caffenet to perform classification on the basis of type, and am getting pretty good accuracy on a test set. Could someone suggest a deep network which could learn the orientation only from the data (to classify images only into one of 5 orientations). I also have to return the top-10 similar images in the dataset given a test sample. What similarity measure should I use (combination of type and orientation) to return the final 10 images. Also, could I learn a better (more compact) representation of the images in the dataset so I could perform the nearest neighbor queries much faster (perhaps euclidean distance in some vector space).
