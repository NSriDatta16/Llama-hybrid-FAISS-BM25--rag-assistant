in Interface Builder can I connect between a button in my custom controller and an action in the AppDelegate?

In Interface Builder can I connect between a button in my custom controller (in my custom NIB) and an action method I put in in the MainView NIB (i.e. the AppDelegate)? Background - In terms of understanding things I am trying to have two (2) customer controllers (with their own views), such that when the iPhone application is launched it starts up with View1. But then on View1 there is Button that if you push it would swap out the View1 controller/view with the View2 controller view. I wanted to cement of understanding of how the AppDelegate with the main Window is allocated a specific View to display which is contained in a custom NIB/controller that I supply. So I thought I should put the code that swaps out the views (similar to here ) as an action in the Application Delegate code (for better or for worst). (i.e. not in either of my view1 or view2 controllers) Anyway what I find it doesn't seem possible in IB to drag from the View1 button's TOUCH_UP_INSIDE event to the the MainViewNIB. Is it not possible to do this? So again, I'm effectively trying to get a button from one NIB to trigger an action method in another NIB(controller).
