As in any other imperative language: it depends. I've seen decent boosts in code performance when we use immutable objects, but they're also usually infrequently-modified objects, ones which are read out of an archive or set by a user and then passed around to all different bits of code. It doesn't seem worth doing this for all your code, at least not to me, unless you plan on heavily leveraging multiprocessing and understand the tradeoffs you're making.
