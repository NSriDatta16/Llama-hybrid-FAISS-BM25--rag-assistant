What are the basic assumptions of Bayesian probability/statistics?

Could you please rigorously define Bayesian probability in mathematical formula? What is the main differences between Bayesian probability and quantum probability theories? I have seen in literature like https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02480.pdf that quantum probability theory does not assume probabilistic communitivity and distributivity: $$A\cap B \neq B\cap A$$
