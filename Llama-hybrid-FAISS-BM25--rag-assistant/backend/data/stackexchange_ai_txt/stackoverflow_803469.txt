JPEG images are nothing but a bunch of bytes organized according to the JPEG format. A network socket isn't going to organize random bytes into the JPEG format. You can send the bytes that make up a JPEG formatted image across a socket as a binary blob, receive it on the other end, and write it to a file with a .jpg extension. An application can interpret this file as a JPEG image based on the extension and try to display it. But you are still responsible for providing a set of bytes that are organized as a JPEG image.
