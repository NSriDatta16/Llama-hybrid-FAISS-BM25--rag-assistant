Difference between average and expected value

I am new in statistics, I don't understand what's the difference between expected value and average, only two different ways to calculate samething. For example if i am given a table(relative frequency) like this. $(1/10, 1/20, 1/2)$now if i say $f(0) = 1/10 , f(1) = 1/20 , f(2) = 1/2$ which means that one out of ten men have good osense of locality ,second one has middle and third one has bad sense of locality. If i compute expected value then it will be equal to $m*f(m)$ , so i have $E(X) = (0*(1/10)+1(1/20)+2(1/2))$ and this results in $1.05$. Is it right? can someone tell me what's the difference between average and Expected value?
