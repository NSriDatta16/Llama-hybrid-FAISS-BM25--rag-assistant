You should provide more details about your data. From the limited details provided by you, assuming you have a data frame df which has response , trt , time , and subject information, then these are many ways to fit a LME model in R using lme4 package. However, I will illustrate three methods that I think will be useful for you. library(lme4) # Random intercepts for different subjects but time and trt effects are fixed mmod1 Once you have the p-values from the model fit above, you can use: HPDinterval(mmod1, prob = 0.95, ...) HPDinterval(mmod2, prob = 0.95, ...) HPDinterval(mmod3, prob = 0.95, ...) to obtain the 95% CI determined from MCMC sample. Since this CI is obtained from MCMC sampling, it takes into account of the random errors and you won't need to correct for multiple comparisons (I think so, please correct me if I am wrong).
