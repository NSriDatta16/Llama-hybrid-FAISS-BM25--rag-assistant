Why does Bitmap in Column Header not update it's x position when column is moved? PowerBuilder 10.5

I have a DataWindow that has a number of columns. One of the columns have a bitmap as as a header instead of text. I can move each of the other columns by dragging and dropping to change the column order but I when I try to move the column with the bitmap it does the following: Column Space 'Moves' but the bitmap's position is not moving. Other text headers now occupy the same space as the bitmap. The original column space is now an empty space in the position i moved it to. If i try to resize the column by dragging the edges, the bitmap scales up/down but it just does not move. I've tried checking the 'moveable' checkbox but it does not help the bitmap move when I move the column. Is there any other property I need to check to get the bitmap to move along with the column?
