The dts job step has variables and variable values it associates with the SSIS package. In SQL 2008, SQL Agent, Jobs, Job, Steps, Job Step Properties. There are a set of tabs. Each has influence on how the package runs. For instance, the Data Sources tab allows you to change the connection string to any of your data sources. Here's one guess - there's a connection named "DB.NAME" which is defined in the job, but not in the SSIS package. Anyways, if you made significant changes, try recreating the job from the SSIS package and see if that doesn't solve your problem.
