I suggest you look at the java.lang.instrument package , especially the ClassFileTransformer . Here is a good article: Instrumentation: Modify Applications with Java 5 Class File Transformations For actual bytecode generation, I suggest you have a look at libraries such as BCEL or ASM . The JRebel framework may also interest you. It can change implementation of method bodies, add / remove methods and constructors, add/remove fields, add/remove classes etc, all in runtime.
