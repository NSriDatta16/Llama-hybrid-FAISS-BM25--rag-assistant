Starting arbitrary activities via component names is fragile, because it breaks encapsulation. If the other chunk of code gets refactored, all of a sudden your string will no longer be valid. Only do that within a single project, where any such refactorings will get picked up by the compiler. Also, depending on where this file resides, there may be security issues. Either use PackageManager to find the activity via introspection, or have the file hold an action string and have the other activities set up Intent filters to match.
