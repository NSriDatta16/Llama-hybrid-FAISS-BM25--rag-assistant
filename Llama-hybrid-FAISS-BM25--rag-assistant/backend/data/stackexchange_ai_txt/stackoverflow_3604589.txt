Xcode 4 - removing "Default.png"

Possible Duplicate: Can't remove Default.png? I am using Xcode 4, but I am sure the issue does not pertain to this specific IDE. I have set a "Default.png" using the organizer, but I would like to remove it. At the time I had already created an image in my project which was no longer being used, instead replaced by the image set in the organizer. I have removed that file, and any "default.png" files from my application (*.app) folders, but the image remains. How can I get rid of this image?
