If you pull down a copy of visual studio express you could build a single screen application that allows editing a table with just drag and drop from the server explorer. No coding needed unless you're looking to add some more advanced logic. Alternatively you could just use Access to also build a one screen front end - with that as the start up form to your Access DB your users wouldn't even know they're in Access. Edit: Assuming you're in a windows domain - put all your users in to a security group and then grant this group access to the SQL Server. Only grant the group permissions on the specific objects that they need to edit. Create a blank Access DB. Link your SQL Server table in to the Access DB - e.g. in 2007 the option is in the External Data ribbon > more... > ODBC database. Once you have the table linked create a form to edit the data by doing Create > more > Form Wizard. This allows you to pick the exact columns you want them to edit, pick a layout etc. From here the options are really only limited by how much effort you want to put in but it's a good start in contrast to direct table access.
