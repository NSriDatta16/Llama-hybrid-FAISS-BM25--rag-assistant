I wouldn't say "take it with a grain of salt" (there is a lot of utility to code coverage), but to quote myself TDD and code coverage are not a panacea: · Even with 100% block coverage, there still will be errors in the conditions that choose which blocks to execute. · Even with 100% block coverage + 100% arc coverage, there will still be errors in straight-line code. · Even with 100% block coverage + 100% arc coverage + 100% error-free-for-at-least-one-path straight-line code, there will still be input data that executes paths/loops in ways that exhibit more bugs. (from here ) While there may be some tools that can offer improvement, I think the higher-order bit is that code coverage is only part of an overall testing strategy to ensure product quality.
