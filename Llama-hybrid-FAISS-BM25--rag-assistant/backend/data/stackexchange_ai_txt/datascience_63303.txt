Regression Task - Spark, PyTorch, TensorFlow or scikit

I know it's a broad question, sorry for that, but I'm still testing the waters with machine learning. I have a typical regression task (predict target numbers with the help of features x,y,z) and a dataset with about 1000 entries. I want to use this task to compare several machine learning libraries. My current selection is Spark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit. Is this selection okay? Do you have further recommendations? My only requirements are that they are open source. Thanks for your help!
