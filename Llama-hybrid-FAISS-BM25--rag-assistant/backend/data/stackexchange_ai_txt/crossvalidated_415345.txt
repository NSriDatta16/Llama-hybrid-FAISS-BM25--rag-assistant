Just use dummy variables for your categorical variables. Then, for the edible/nonedible example, you could try logistic regression, which will output a probability, which is more informative than simply a classification. A probability close to half would indicate a sample that is difficult to classify. For more than two levels, you could try multinomial logistic regression, but many other linear methods would also accept dummy variables.
