Querying through several models in Rails 3

I have several Models: Workspace User Asset WorkspaceUser WorkspaceAsset Workspace has many users and assets, through the two join tables (WorkspaceUser, WorkspaceAsset) I'm trying to find the most efficient and elegant way to find out if there exists a path between a User and an Asset, ie User -> WorkspaceUser -> Workspace -> WorkspaceAsset -> Asset This is what I have so far: Workspace.joins(:workspace_assets, :workspace_users).where("workspace_assets.asset_id = ? & workspace_users.user_id = ?", assetID, userID) Was hoping for a better solution and perhaps one that would return the asset in question.
