What are different time-series types?

I am having a time-series classification problem. I tried to using movingaverage and firstdifferences as two models to perform my classification. However, the results I am getting are pretty bad. Therefore, I am thinking whether there are any other types of time-series data that I can use instead (i.e. instead of movingaverage and firstdifferences`). If so please suggest me. I am happy to provide more details if needed.
