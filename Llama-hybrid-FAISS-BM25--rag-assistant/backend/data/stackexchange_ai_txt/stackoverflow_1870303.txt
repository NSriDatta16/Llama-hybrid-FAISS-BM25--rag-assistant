The only way to write better code is to write more code. Take a project you've implemented procedurally and convert it to OOP (assuming you're working in a language that supports both). You'll probably end up with a fragile, tightly coupled solution the first time around, but that's ok. Take the bad OOP implementation and start refactoring it into something better. Eventually, you'll figure out what works, and what doesn't. When you're ready to take the next step, pick up a Design Patterns book and learn some of the OOP design terminology. This isn't strictly necessary, but it will give you a better grasp of some of the common problems and solutions.
