Fine, let's do this. Following the instructions on Wikipedia : Exclude the third pair because it's a tie. Order the absolute values of the differences: {1,1,2,2,4,7,10,15,20} (they happened to be in order already) Rank them, averaging ranks for ties: {1.5,1.5,3.5,3.5,5,6,7,8,9} Multiply these ranks by the signs of the corresponding pairs' differences {-,-,+,+,+,+,+,+,+} Sum them: -1.5 - 1.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 39 = W This actually was a little confusing. It looks like V is just the sum of the ranks that are positive in step 5. Thus V is either 42 or 3, depending on the order of inputs. With y before x as you have it, V = 3. My math in step 4 subtracted y from x , which would give V = 42 instead, just like wilcox.test(x,y,paired=T) .
