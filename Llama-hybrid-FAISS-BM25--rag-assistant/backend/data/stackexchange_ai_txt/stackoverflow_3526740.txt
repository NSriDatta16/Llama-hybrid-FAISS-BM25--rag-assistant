Thanks duffymo! I am calculating Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integrals: plane and other wave diffraction through circular (2D) apertures in polar coordinates. As far as the programming goes: Currently a lot of my code is in Mathematica. I am considering changing to one of: scipy, java + flanagan math library, java + apache commons math library, gnu scientific library, or octave. My first candidate for evaluation is scipy, but if it cannot handle complex-valued integrands, then I have to change my plans for the weekend...
