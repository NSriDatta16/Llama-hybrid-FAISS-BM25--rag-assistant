Did you see this Wikipedia page that gives an overview of the sommon of the common spelling alphabets used by various organisations/countries? The British Forces / NY Police ones look quite straightforward (all very common words, so probably familiar to most non-native speakers too) - so you may want to go with one of those. In general, I wouldn't worry too much about how they sound - any common spelling alphabet will do. If you want to create one of your own (or a hybrid of existing ones), it probably shouldn't be much of an issue, though I don't see any particular reason for not choosing one of those listed on that page. Hope that helps.
