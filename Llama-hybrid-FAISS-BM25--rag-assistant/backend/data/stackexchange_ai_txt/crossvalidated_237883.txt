Interpretation of the PCA eigenvectors values

Imagine I've the following matrix, which gives the grades of students in the subjects German, Philosophy, Math and Physics: ger = c(2,4,1,3,2,4,4,1,2,3) phi = c(3,4,1,2,2,3,3,2,2,2) mat = c(1,3,2,4,1,2,2,4,3,1) phy = c(2,2,2,5,2,2,3,4,3,3) A = cbind(deu,phil,ma,phy) I combine everything to a matrix and scale the data: As = scale(A) Now, I perform a summary on the PCA: summary(princomp(As), loadings = TRUE) Which returns the following output: Importance of components: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 Standard deviation 1.3257523 1.1657791 0.59600603 0.35793402 Proportion of Variance 0.4882275 0.3775114 0.09867311 0.03558799 Cumulative Proportion 0.4882275 0.8657389 0.96441201 1.00000000 Loadings [eigenvectors]: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 ger 0.496 -0.502 0.519 0.482 phi 0.548 -0.443 -0.423 -0.570 mat -0.430 -0.572 -0.546 0.435 phy -0.518 -0.474 0.503 -0.503 I have a few hints for the first component (based on the loadings [eigenvectors]): There is a high positive correlation between german and philosophy and there is also a high positive correlation between math and physics. Who is good in language (german and philosophy) is often worse in MINT (math and physics) and the other way around. And an idea about the second one, which I cannot interpret: It's a weighted arithmetic mean over all four variables. But I have no idea how to interpret the Comp. 2 , Comp. 3 and Comp. 4 based on the loadings. Especially because all values of Comp. 2 are all negative, or have the same orientation. Can someone help me? Thanks in advance!
