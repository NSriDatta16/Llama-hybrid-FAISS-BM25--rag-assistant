storing multiple formats in a table

So here's the basic problem: I'd like to be able to store various fields in a database. These can be short textfields (maybe 150 characters max, probably more like 50 in general) and long textfields (something that can store a whole page full of text). Ideally more types can be added later on. These fields are group by common field_group id s, and their type shouldn't really have anything to do with categorization. So what's the best way to represent this in MySQL? One table with a short_text and long_text columns of differing types, one of which is to be NULL ? Or is there a more elegant solution? (I'd like this to be primarily driven by ease to select all fields with a given field_group_id.) Clarification I'm essentially attempting to allow users to create their own tables, but without actually creating tables. So you'd have a 'Book' field group, which would have the fields 'Name' (short text), 'Summary' (long text). Then you would be able to create entries into that book. I realize that this is essentially the whole point of MySQL, but I need to have a LOT of these and don't want users creating whole tables in my database.
