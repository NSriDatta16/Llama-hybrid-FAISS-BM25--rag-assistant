Robert's code is correct. However, you /can/ also use a struct without malloc, like so: struct retstruct { int a; int b; }; struct retstruct myfunc(void) { struct retstruct r; r.a = 1; r.b = 2; return r; } int main() { struct retstruct r; r = myfunc(); printf("a=%d b=%d\n", r.a, r.b); } This is typically shunned because it's generally a bit more costly (performance-wise) to be passing around structs like this, but if you only need a couple values like this, it can be sufficient.
