Your form uses the method POST, so in send_form_application.php you will have to use the mail() function . Name [Last, First MI] Primary Organization This above is your HTML that will POST variables contained in a $_POST array. So $_POST['name'] will contain you name and $_POST['primary_organization'] will contain the primary organization (what the user made as an input in the form) The "most important part" of this HTML input is the name because it is what you will use to "fill" the mail function with it's attributes. Your PHP will look something like: mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers); ?> The $content could be all the elements of the post like this (should actually be above the previous code) $content = $_POST['name'] . "\n"; $content .= $_POST['primary_organization'] . "\n"; ?> And so on... Please tell me if you cant understand something! IMPORTANT: while this might work, this is not really secure yet, you should ALWASY validate the user input!
