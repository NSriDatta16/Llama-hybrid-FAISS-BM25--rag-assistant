Yes and no. Actually both try to minimize a squared reconstruction error. But in kmeans, all points of the same cluster are represented with the same center, whereas in PCA every point is represented by a lower dimensional coordinate plus a transformation matrix. So if you just look at the numbers, you are comparing apples and oranges. KMeans can be seen as compression using k.d+n numbers only, whereas PCA uses n.p+d.p if p is the number of components. So PCA will usually be able to get much smaller SSE than KMeans.
