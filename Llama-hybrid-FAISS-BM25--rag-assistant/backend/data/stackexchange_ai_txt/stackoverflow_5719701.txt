Re-installation failed due to different application signatures

Possible Duplicate: Why does the app signature change in Android after a classpath change? I started getting errors in my Eclipse Workspace for several but not all of my projects. I noticed is was the oldest projects. I found help for the error, and built my own debug.keystore and changed the java build path to that folder. Now when I try to run any of the projects in an emulator I get this error: [2011-04-19 10:11:20 - enga] Re-installation failed due to different application signatures. [2011-04-19 10:11:20 - enga] You must perform a full uninstall of the application. WARNING: This will remove the application data! [2011-04-19 10:11:20 - enga] Please execute 'adb uninstall com.engatest' in a shell. [2011-04-19 10:11:20 - enga] Launch canceled! I tried removing the application from the menu in the emulator, got through the motions and drag it to the trash but it doesn't get removed. I tried running in terminal: adb uninstall com.dwclogic.engatest but the command wasn't found, adb probably not setup globally on my mac. I am new to the Mac and am unsure how to get the execute path for this fixed but that's an whole other issue. where do I try running this command? Is there any other ways to fix this problem.
