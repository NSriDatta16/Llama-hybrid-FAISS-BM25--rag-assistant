Preprocessing of 3D CAD files for Keras Conv3D input

I'd like to apply some machine learning on 3D CAD data. File format should ideally be mesh-based like STL. Keras offers 3D convolutional layers ( https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/ ), so it can handle 3D (5D) input data. The problem I have is the preprocessing of the input data. There seem to exist integrated methods in Keras for image preprocessing ( https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/ ). However that does only seem to apply to 2D images. I plan to voxelize the STL files somehow, and would appreciate input on the process of voxelization and preprocessing the data to be suitable for Keras. PS: I know there are CNNs which directly take mesh data. However I'd like to approach the voxelation way to compare performance and results.
