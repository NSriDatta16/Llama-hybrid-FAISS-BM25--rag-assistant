JQuery - Ajax saving sortables in connected lists when sortable item is moved

I have multiple JQuery sortable lists that connect with each other... They allow you to assign users to certain roles. Basically what I want to do is when a user is dragged from one list to another, I want JQuery to pick up the first list that the user was moved from so that I can send an AJAX request to delete it from that list in my database. I tried the following but every time you move the user over a list and haven't even dropped it within a list, it sends this request which means I'll be sending multiple AJAX requests... Does that make sense? $( ".selector" ).sortable({ out: function(event, ui) { ... } }); From my testing, I can use the following code to just update the list that user has been moved to so I've got the second half covered: $( ".selector" ).sortable({ receive: function(event, ui) { ... } }); Hopefully I am making sense :)
