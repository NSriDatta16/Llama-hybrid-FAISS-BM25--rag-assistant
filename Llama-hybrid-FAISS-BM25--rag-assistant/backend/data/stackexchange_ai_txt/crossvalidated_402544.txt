No, your understanding doesn't seem to be correct. There are two parts to the paper: user clustering, and then fast response churn prediction. K-means clustering appears in the former but not the latter. The idea is to pass each user's activity embedding through K different LSTMs, each of which computes a different user behavior embedding. The user embeddings are weighted and combined by an attention mechanism. Intuitively, each LSTM is supposed to specialize to a particular type of user. It would probably be pretty hard to understand this without first having a background understanding of LSTMs and attention mechanisms, so you should read up on those first.
