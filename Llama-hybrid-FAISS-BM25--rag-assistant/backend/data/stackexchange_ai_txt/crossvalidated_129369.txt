Determining a greater than chance cutoff for an assessment's results

I recently collected a set of data, and before I completed an analysis of it, I wanted to remove any "bogus" entries from participants that didn't actually read the stories. The study I conducted had participants through the internet complete a comprehension assessment, that involved them reading six stories, and after each story, they answered 12 questions related to the details of that story. I only want to analyze data from participants that performed significantly greater than chance, because anyone who actually went through these stories should easily be able to surpass that mark I feel. However, i'm not sure how to determine what that mark should be. I'd like for someone to explain how to find a greater than chance cutoff (i.e with p For some more reference, There are 72 questions in total, each question has 5 choices, and 223 participants completed the assessment. Each question is worth 1 point, so if someone is completely guessing, on average they would get a 14.4 / 72.
