Add a line from another data.frame to qplot

Is it possible to add a line (such as an additional time series) to an already existing plot? I know how to add horizontal or vertical lines, but how can I add from other data.frames? q_myplot is my basic plot, showing three different time series grouped by category. Is there a way to add another line to the plot for example by using layers? Of course I could add this additional data to mydf using another category, but I wonder if there's a better idea out there.
