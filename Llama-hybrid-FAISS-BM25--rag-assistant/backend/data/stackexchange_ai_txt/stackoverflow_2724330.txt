If you're using C# 3.0 or above (VisualStudio 2008, essentially), you can use auto properties. While this isn't exactly what you're asking for, it should (hopefully) do the trick. Rather than writing: private string m_Name; public string Name { get { return m_Name; } set { m_Name = value; } } You can just write: public string Name { get; set; } This will give you quick, "dumb" (i.e. no retrieval or assignment logic) properties that can go on your class. If you find you need retrieval and assignment logic later, just come back and do the full property declaration syntax and you won't have to change any of the calling code. The only real difference is that you'll have to use the property to get the value within your class, as the backing variable is generated and compile time and unavailable to your code.
