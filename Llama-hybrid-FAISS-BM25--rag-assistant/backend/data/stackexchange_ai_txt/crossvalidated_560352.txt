Radar Chart Alternatives for Two Variables

I am creating a customizable analysis in which a requested feature is a radar chart, which I have been powering using Plotly in Javascript. My issue is that I must now be able to output a Radar chart (or similar visual) if only two variables are relevant. Radar Charts really aren't suitable for less than three variables, so I'm curious what people have used as alternatives. I've considered adding an empty dummy variable to give the dimensionality, and then crop my chart to only show the variables of interest (below). I'm curious if people who have dealt with this have better implementations or suggestions, while keeping in mind they should be similar to radar charts . For example, please don't answer with a histogram or other visualization that is much different from the radar chart concept. Edits: I standardize the variables before plotting. My primary intention with this visualization is for someone to quickly tell how the variables are performing with reference to the "safe range" (the orange shading) There will only be one min, one max, and one average per variable. The raw data is from time series, each variable is a time series of said variable.
