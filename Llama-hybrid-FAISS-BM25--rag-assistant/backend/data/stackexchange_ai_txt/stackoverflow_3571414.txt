I am also throwing in a vote for Vrapper ( http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home ). I just started using Eclipse/CDT again for some C coding, and because Vrapper just emulates vi commands in the Eclipse workbench editor (instead of embedding VIM inside of eclipse), it appears to alter other Eclipse IDE functionality less. With vrapper my files end up with less unintentional h,j,k,l,/,? and line-breaks, that otherwise occur because my fingers forget they are not in vi. Vrapper doesn't have all the vi commands I want, but it is a big improvement over the Eclipse editor without Vrapper. It will be even better if they add some of their planned "future features", especially regular expression support.
