Testing drag-and-drop with Watir

I'm evaluating Watir right now. While Selenium has a dragAndDropToObject command (which seems to be broken) Watir seems not to have such a command. I couldn't find a script/tutorial with an example of how to test DnD with Watir. Did anybody try/succeed in testing drag-and-drop with Watir? Btw.: I am using jQuery for the DnD implementation.
