Is there something as "Vector Regression", instead of having just one numerical responsable variable I have multiple of them?

I'm interested in predicting the sequence of the order of the events in an individual giving a bunch of predictive variables using Machine Learning. So my guess is, for an specific instance with around 10 predictive variables, I write the rank of each event (Let's say that there are 6 of them (Event A, B, C, D, E and F), (for example Event A = 5 because it was the fifth). If I have a new individual with his info (his 10 predictive variables) then I apply regression to every of event rank variable individually, I will obtain for each of them a number between 1 and 6, and for each of them I will guess the sequence. I guess it must be a more intelligent way of predicting the sequence but I don't know how.
