If you're using .NET then I'd highly recommend Moq to create test only implementations of interfaces. If you don't have interface declarations then Moles will allow you to test hard coded dependencies. Use this with caution however as in my opinion if you're using moles a lot then you have design issues with regards to lack of abstraction. If you are looking for a unit testing framework then NUnit has a lot going for it in terms of how fluid it is to write. We've had some issues getting moles to play nicely with NUnit so in general we've moved over to MSTest which is built in to Visual Studio; whilst not as nice as NUnit it does testing without any problems. If you want to do unit testing of your sharepoint web pages then you're really looking at Selenium to help with that. It's very fragile though so i'd leave this until you're sure that your UI is complete If you are totally new to Unit testing I'd highly recommend reading about it first. If you get tired of looking at web pages then just create a new MVC web application and take a look at the unit tests that are created out of the box to get an idea (just ignore their terrible test method names)
