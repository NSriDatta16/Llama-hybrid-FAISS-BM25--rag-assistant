Is my understanding of this paper correct? Not sure whether the bivariate method they mentioned means regression?

I'm not sure if I understand the method used by this paper. Did they use simple linear regression multiple times? Because I'm only seeing one predictor variable and then multiple dependent variables. Papers I've read before are quite clear on what specific method they use (t-test, ANOVA, regression, etc.), but here I'm really stumped because they only mention "univariate and bivariate" analysis. Hope someone could help me understand the method they used here? Materials and Methods: The investigators designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of 883 subjects who presented for evaluation of oral and maxillofacial fractures (OMF) between March 1 and June 30 in the years 2018 through 2020. The primary predictor variable was the evaluation of OMF during a period with social distancing policies (2020 –experimental group) or without social distancing policies in place (2018 or 2019 –control group). The primary outcome variables were the facial fracture diagnosis, the abbreviated injury scale (AIS), injury severity score (ISS), and the mechanism of injury. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed, and the level of significance was set at P Results: The number of subjects presenting with OMF was lower during the period of social distancing (n = 235 in 2020) than during the periods without (2018: n = 330; 2019: n = 318). During the period of social distancing, there were more individuals who presented secondary to assault, whereas fewer individuals presented secondary to falls (P = .05). On average, those who presented in 2020 had more severe oral and maxillofacial injuries (mean AIS = 3.2+/-1.2 in 2020 vs 3.0+/-1.1 in 2019 and 3.01+/-1.1 in 2018. P=.03) and more overall injuries (mean ISS = 20.7+/-13.1 in 2020 vs 19.2+/-12.5 in 2019; 17.8+/-12.8 in 2018. P =.03). Thank you!
