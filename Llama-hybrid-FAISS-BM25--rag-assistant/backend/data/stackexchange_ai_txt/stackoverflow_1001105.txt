I think it's better to focus on the user productivity and on the business the software is implementing. To show operations that does not make sense for a specific user or in a specific moment will not help, disabled or not. For example, if you have a software that is used in several departments of an organization, each user/department will only be interested in the part of the software that implements the part of the business he is involved to. Anything else is useless for him and only will make the software experience worst. The same applies for a screen that is usefull for a user but shows useless options.
