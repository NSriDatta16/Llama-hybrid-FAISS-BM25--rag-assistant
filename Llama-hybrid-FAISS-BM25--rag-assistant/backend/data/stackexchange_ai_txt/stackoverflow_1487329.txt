More information might be helpful: Where are you getting this data from? Is it actually numeric, or is that just simplification for your example? If numeric, what range/accuracy is required? Is it discrete data, ie from a limited selection of recurring values? Does the data have to be exact, or would a close approximation still be good enough? What does it mean? How are you using it? Are you most interested in speed, or storage space, or code cleanliness, or what? How often does it change? Is that 700Mb all one array? Are your PHP instances memory-limited? Have you looked at how much memory your script uses, and how that varies with different array sizes? What is the largest single array you anticipate ever seeing (in terms of number of items / storage space)? How many different data arrays might you have to deal with? Is there any "overlap" between data sets, ie recurring data? Taking your example as representative, I would consider multiplying each number by 100 and casting to integer then storing as raw binary. Your array becomes 2880 bytes of data. If your data rarely or never changes, you could skip-read this directly from a binary file very efficiently.
