Learning parameters for a bayesian network from data with different oberservation frequencies

I have a Bayesian network of a given structure and nodes A, B, C, D, E and want to learn the parameters of the network, i.e. the conditional probabilities, from data with differing frequencies of observation at different timestamps. For example, lets say I have measurements at timestamps T1, ...., T1000: T1: A=true T2: A=true, B=true, C=false T3: A=false, B=true, C=false T4: A=true, B=true, C=false, E=false ... T1000: A=true, B=false, C=false, D=true, E=false The network has a fixed structure, lets say A D |\ / v v B C | / v E Question: What is the best approach to estimate parameters for this network in this case? Edit: one more remark the frequency differs by orders of magnitude, E can be observed approximately once a month, whereas some nodes can have multiple measurements per minute the network is assumed to be time-independent
