Summing "black-box" confidence

I have a table with observed and estimated values for political districts like this BEZIRK EDU_OBS EDU_WEI EDU_CI 101 157 5129 15 BEZIRK is an ID for the district, EDU_OBS is the number of actually observed people in a sample (lets say, inhabitants), EDU_WEI is the estimation based on some unknown, black-box, extrapolation, and EDU_CI is the 95% confidence interval in percentage of the estimated value, e.g. for district 101 , the estimation would be 5129 $\pm$ 770 with 95% confidentiality. Now, let's say I have another table with the same districts but other values. BEZIRK EDU_OBS EDU_WEI EDU_CI 101 180 5987 14 I would like to add the values (the estimates) of those with the first table, per district. What happens to the CI? I.e. how do I recalculate the new CI of the combined values without knowing how it was computed in the first place? Can I just average it? I don't think so.
