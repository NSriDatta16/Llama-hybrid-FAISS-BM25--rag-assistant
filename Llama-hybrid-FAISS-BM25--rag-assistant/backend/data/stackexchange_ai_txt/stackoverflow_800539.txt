I just wrote some code to move vmware virtual machines around, and ended up using os.path and shutil to accomplish file copying between sub-directories. def copy_client_files (file_src, file_dst): for file in os.listdir(file_src): print "Copying file: %s" % file shutil.copy(os.path.join(file_src, file), os.path.join(file_dst, file)) It's not terribly elegant, but it does work.
