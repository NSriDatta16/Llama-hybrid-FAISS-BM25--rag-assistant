Yes. This will make spoofing attacks a WHOLE lot easier (various encoded characters look nearly identical to the western ones). Filtering is going to be a pain. Some registries have stated that they will NOT support IDN (apparently .be and a few others), so it won't be universal. It's also not even clear if we're using UTF-8 or punycode or perhaps both (also depending upon which domain registrar you are dealing with, etc.). All in all it's going to be a gigantic mess, but not much more than the current one we live in.
