Yes, this is valid HTML. For the validity of the HTML document, the only thing that's important is that the href attribute points to a URI. You can check the validity of your document with http://validator.w3.org/check But â€¦ The script that is located at that URI has to serve any content with the correct header so the browser can actually interpret it as CSS. This is a completely different thing than HTML validity though. So for serving a CSS file, you have to set the text/css header. Note that using this approach is generally discouraged though unless you implement some sort of caching mechanism . When you point to a PHP file, the webserver will execute the PHP file so you lose any caching mechanism you'd usually have for static resources.
