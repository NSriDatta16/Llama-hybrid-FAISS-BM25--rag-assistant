Meaning Of The Terms In Isolation Forest Anomaly Scoring

In an isolation forest the anomaly score of a point is given by: $$2^{\frac{-E(h(x))}{c(m)}}$$ Now supposedly c(m) is the average length to termination in the search tree. And, E(h(x)) is the expected length to termination for the particualr point in question. What is the difference there? What I am missing or can anyone explain the terms (on a high level) in a better way?
