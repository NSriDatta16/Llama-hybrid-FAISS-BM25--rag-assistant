How to averge precision values of different length?

I have five queries with each precision and recall values. Now I want to report the average precision recall curve of 5 queries. Problem is that the length of precision vector is different for each query. query1_precision = [1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4]; query1_recall = [0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0]; query1_precision = [1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.35]; query1_recall = [0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0]; Please suggest.
