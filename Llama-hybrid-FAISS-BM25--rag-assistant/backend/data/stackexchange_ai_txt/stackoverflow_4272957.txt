subtracting a DateTime from a DateTime in scala

I'm relatively new to both scala and jodatime, but have been pretty impressed with both. I'm trying to figure out if there is a more elegant way to do some date arithmetic. Here's a method: private def calcDuration() : String = { val p = new Period(calcCloseTime.toInstant.getMillis - calcOpenTime.toInstant.getMillis) val s : String = p.getHours.toString + ":" + p.getMinutes.toString + ":" + p.getSeconds.toString return s } I convert everything to a string because I am putting it into a MongoDB and I'm not sure how to serialize a joda Duration or Period. If someone knows that I would really appreciate the answer. Anyway, the calcCloseTime and calcOpenTime methods return DateTime objects. Converting them to Instants is the best way I found to get the difference. Is there a better way? Another side question: When the hours, minutes or seconds are single digit, the resulting string is not zero filled. Is there a straightforward way to make that string look like HH:MM:SS? Thanks, John
