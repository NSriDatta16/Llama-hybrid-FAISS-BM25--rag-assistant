Is this variable suitable for a categorical regression (multinomial logistic regression)?

I have created a dataset starting from a series of multiple choice (3 choices) questions. Example of question: 1) What color is Hulk? A) Green B) Red C) Pink My dataset looks like this (I have computed many others statistics for each choice but the dataset down there is a good approximation of my real dataset for the sake of this question): The dataset: | question | frequency on Google | freq. on Google | freq. on Google | Correct | | id | of answer A | of answer B | of answer C | answer | |––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––| | 1 | 300 | 150 | 100 | A | |––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––| | 2 | 9 | 100 | 80 | B | |––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––| | 3 | 1000 | 400 | 800 | A | |––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––| | 4 | 35 | 50 | 125 | C | |––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––| | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | |––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––| My goal is to find the correct answer given the variables I compute Now here comes my question: Is the variable Correct answer really a categorical variable? I feel like it is not truly a categorical variable because correct answer of question 1 (which is A in the example dataset) has NOTHING TO DO with the correct answer of question 3) which is still choice A. Like, the two A's are not comparable because the questions are different! Do I risk to create a completely useless model? Or could it work? Thanks!
