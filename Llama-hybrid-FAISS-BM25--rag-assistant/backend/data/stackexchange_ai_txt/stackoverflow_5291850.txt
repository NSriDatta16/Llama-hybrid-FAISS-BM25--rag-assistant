When I loaded the page I did not get the Geocoder error in either Chrome or Firefox. Instead I got an error stating that in line 108 of draggable_marker.php that initialize was not defined. It looks like you are missing the braces after initialize in line 108. Perhaps google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize); should be google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize());
