How to determine maximum stack usage?

What methods are available for determining the optimum stack size for embedded/memory constrained system? If it's too big then memory is wasted that could be used elsewhere. However, if it is too small then we get this website's namesake... To try to jump start things: Jack Ganssle states in The Art of Designing Embedded Systems that, "With experience, one learns the standard, scientific way to compute the proper size for a stack: Pick a size at random and hope." Can anyone do better than that? A more specific example was requested. So, how about a C program targeting an MSP430 MCU with 2 kB of RAM using the IAR Embedded Workbench toolchain without an operating system? This IDE can display the stack contents and usage while using a JTAG debugger.
