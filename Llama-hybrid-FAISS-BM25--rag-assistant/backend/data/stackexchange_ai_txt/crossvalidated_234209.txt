So in general your question is a bit weird, dimensionality reduction is related to projection which, as the name says, puts something onto something but many things can be put on the same thing. (Think about a point in 3D that is projected on a surface then think about the perpendicular line to the surface passing through that point. every point on that line is projected onto the same point) Ok let's consider PCA which you claim is bijective (it really isn't), actually consider SVD since PCA is really just SVD. Full SVD is: $ M = U\Lambda V^T$ when you consider dimensionality reduction, you only consider the first largest elements of the $\Lambda$, a diagonal matrix, hence the representation $\hat M = U\hat\Lambda V^T$ now this representation can correspond to an infinite number of matrices $M$. In other words, you can build an infinite number of matrices $M'$ such that, when applying the same process of SVD truncation, you get $\hat M$ (so it's really not bijective) Indeed: let $M' = U \Lambda' V^T$ where $\Lambda'$ has the same first few singular values than $\Lambda$ and all the others are different (but smaller). The SVD truncation of all these $M'$ will give you $\hat M$.
