You may have discovered the fact that LDA models can suffer from instability : slight changes in the training set lead to very different models. There's a whole body of literature on the variance of resampling methods for validation. This may give you a good start. See also here for a related discussion . (I'm sure there is a literature list somewhere around here, but I cannot find it right now) Anyways, Braga-Neto has been working a lot on this There's a very nice technical report by Ron Kohavi We also did a study about Variance reduction in estimating classification error using sparse datasets And another one on Assessing and improving the stability of chemometric models in small sample size situations
