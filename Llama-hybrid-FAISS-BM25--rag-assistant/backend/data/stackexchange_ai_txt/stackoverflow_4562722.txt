Newbie question: undefined local variable or method , why?

I am new in Rails (I am using Rails 3.0.3), currently I am following the book "Agile Web Development with Rails" to develop a simple rails application. I followed the book to: --create a model ' Cart ' class; --implement ' add_to_cart ' method in my ' store_controller ', I have a line of code add_to_cart, :id => product %> in my /store/index.html.erb As you see, there is :action => add_to_cart in my index.html.erb , which will invoke the add_to_cart method in my *Controllers/store_controller.rb* But after I refresh the browser, I got the error " undefined local variable or method 'add_to_cart' ", apparently I do have the method add_to_cart in my 'store_controller.rb', why I got this error??? What is the possible cause??? Here are my codes: store_controller.rb class StoreController /store/index.html.erb Your Pragmatic Catalog ** 'add_to_cart', :id => product %>** Model/cart.rb class Cart attr_reader :items def initialize @items = [] end def add_product(product) @items
