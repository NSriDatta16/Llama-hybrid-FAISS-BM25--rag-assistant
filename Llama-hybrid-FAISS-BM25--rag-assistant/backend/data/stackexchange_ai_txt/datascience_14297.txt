First on methods and techniques: there are a lot of language-independent spam detection algorithms. The main task is feature engineering: one need to construct features, that will detect behavioral differences: temporal features (posting hour or minute entropy/autoregression, or even more complicated patterns), social media profile characteristics, other data, that can be gathered through network API (user's client id, activity patterns, friends attributes, etc). Here is a kind of "classical" paper on Twitter bot detection: Who is Tweeting on Twitter: Human, Bot, or Cyborg? . It's already 6 years old, but could be a good starting point. Bots are being detected through their posting activity patterns. Also you can use texts not even trying to "understand" (or parse) them. Just try shingle-based methods, locality-sensitive hashes (LSH). I advise to use Nilsimsa , but only because that is the only LSH, I used myself. And AFAIK, initially it was built exactly for spam detection. But you can try to search for any other. And on the datasets: I don't know publicly available Facebook and Twitter spam datasets, but here is a dataset with YouTube comments, hope it will be usefull: Network Analysis of Recurring YouTube Spam Campaigns
