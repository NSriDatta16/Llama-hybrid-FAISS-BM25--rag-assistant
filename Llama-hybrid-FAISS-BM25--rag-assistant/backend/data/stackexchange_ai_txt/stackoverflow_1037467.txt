Can the Visual Studio properties editor reference a property to component in another form (or class)?

As a Delphi developer moving to .NET I'm expecting similar concept like TDataModule & TForm to be available. However, I could not find way to make a reference from a component on a Form to another component on another Form (or Component) class. I understand technical difference underlying the issue. Delphi component architecture is based on component-streaming (resource serialization), but .NET form is actually a code generator. If it's not possible to do such thing; I wonder how typically, form UI designer put common component into the same place ? Does it always have to be implemented in code only ? For a bit more specific to what I'm trying to accomplish; I'm using DevExpress XtraGrid for which multiple instance of grids can reference to common "ExternalRepository" How can the grids in separated forms reference to the same instance of ExternalRepository ? Setting this property via code is completely eliminate grid design-time capabilities. Any trick here?
