If you're interesting in undirected conditional independence networks, you should try the package BDgraph . They use a Bayesian approach for structure learning. The package has an option for estimating Gaussian Copula Graphical Models (GCGMs), which should be more than capable of handling mixed input types. The authors are also approachable, I reached out to them for my master thesis a few years ago :) In case you only have one, or a few discrete variables, you could also consider using rags2ridges for joint estimation of the precision matrices of each class. Their approach is based on Tikhonov regularized covariance matrix inversion. The fused version lets you do this joint estimation. There are also various packages that do the same for the LASSO-based approach. Just Google for "R fused LASSO".
