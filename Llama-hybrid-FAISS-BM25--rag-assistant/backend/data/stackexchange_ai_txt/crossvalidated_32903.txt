What is the state-of-the-art regarding sampling from discrete distribution?

After struggling with auto-Poisson model (a.k.a. Random Markov Network with conditional Poisson distributions) trying to force Gibbs sampler to obtain discrete sample of the network (since I know conditional distributions) I realized that I have never seen discrete version of this sampler. I wonder what is the state-of-the-art regarding sampling from discrete distribution (not confined to Bayesian posterior sampling)? Is there something like Gibbs sampler to sample from conditional discrete distributions?
