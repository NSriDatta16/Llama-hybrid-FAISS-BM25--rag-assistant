I found the above very useful; I had a similar mapping issue where I had HTML which was not escaped or encoded stored in an xml file - and I wanted to map this to a String property. I used the annotation: @XmlElementWrapper(name="operations") @XmlAnyElement private List operations; Then used a transformer to print the node tree: public String getOperationsAsString() throws Exception{ StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); for (Node node: operations) { StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, "yes"); transformer.transform(new DOMSource(node), new StreamResult(writer)); builder.append(writer.toString()); } return builder.toString(); }
