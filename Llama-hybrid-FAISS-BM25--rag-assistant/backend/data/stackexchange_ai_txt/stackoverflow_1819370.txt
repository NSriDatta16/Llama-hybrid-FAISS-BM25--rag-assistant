If you want to generate a hyperlink dynamically on the server-side like this, you can either use Response.Write with an tag like slugster says, or alternatively consider the ASP:Literal control which renders exactly what you give it even if it contains markup e.g. In your markup: In your code: string myHTMLFragment; myHTMLFragment = "Hello. I am a link pointing to StackOverflow "; MyLiteral.Text = myHTMLFragment;
