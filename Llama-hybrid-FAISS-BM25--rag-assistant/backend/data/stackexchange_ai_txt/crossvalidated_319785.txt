Single-cell RNA-seq: deep & few or shallow & many?

My lab does a lot of single-cell RNA-seq. Our goals are to find out what cell types are present, characterize their gene activity, and (if possible) understand how the different subpopulations are related to each other (for example through pseudotemporal analysis). We often wonder which is better: should we sequence many cells at a shallow level, or few cells deeply? There's a paper on this here , but it is completely empirical. I am posting this question because I want to develop intuition via statistical analysis: given a reasonable stochastic model, what would we expect from shallow versus deep sequencing? To help formulate a stochastic model, suppose a typical mammalian cell has 200,000 RNA molecules, and we detect each molecule with probability 1% (for low coverage) or 2.5% (for medium coverage). I posted an answer below. I would be interested in answers that improve on mine in the following ways. Account for correlations between difference genes, or generally follow up on EdM's suggestion to account for natural variability in mRNA levels. Correct my math, especially the downright incorrect assumption that $\sum_jz_{ij}$ is constant. Quantify tradeoffs for more interesting target parameters. For instance, if you want to know whether a given cell state transition is continuous or discrete, you might want to test the adequacy of a two-cluster model (say, with K-means) versus a continuous model (say, 1-dimensional PCA). This ought to make the shallow sequencing worse, because higher technical noise will blur the clusters together, even though their centers will still be accurately estimated. I am not so interested in incorporating domain knowledge about single cell sequencing. For instance, I am aware that deeper sequencing leads to redundancy as the same barcode is detected twice, but that is beyond the scope of my question and it belongs in another discussion.
