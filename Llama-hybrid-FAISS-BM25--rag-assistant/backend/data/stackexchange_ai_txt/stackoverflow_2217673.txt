Reading through the answers there are some that will work but all have drawbacks of either using an external parsing library or possibly matching tags other than the P tag or also matching its attributes. I ended up using this solution with the str_replace_once function from here : str_replace_once(' ', ' ', $content); Simple enough and it works just as intended. Here's full WordPress code snippet to filter the first paragraph any time the_content() is called: add_filter('the_content', 'first_p_style'); function first_p_style($content) { $output=str_replace_once(' ', ' ', $content); return ($output); } Thanks for all the answers!
