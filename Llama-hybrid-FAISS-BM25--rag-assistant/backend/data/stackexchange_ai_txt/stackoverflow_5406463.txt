How to get a free lab session using this database-schema?

Hey all, thanks in advance for reading! The problem is to try and find a time in which an instructor is free, a lab is free and the students enrolled in a class are free. There is only one instructor, around 6 lab rooms, and an average of 20 students. Lab rooms, instructors and students have already times at which they are busy/occupied. Time is split into 1.5 hour blocks starting from 8-930, 930-1100 all the ways to 330-500. There are 5 days to consider, Monday - Friday. If there is not a single block that can fit all students,instructor and lab then the class can be split into sessions. Here is what i was thinking of as a database and inputs/outputs: Database: Table : Lab Fields : l_id, l_name, l_capacity, BM893, BM9311, BM11123, BM1232, BM233, BM335, BT893, BT9311, BT11123, BT1232, BT233, BT335, BW893, BW9311, BW11123, BW1232, BW233, BW335, BTH893, BTH9311, BTH11123, BTH1232, BTH233, BTH335, BF893, BF9311, BF11123, BF1232, BF233, BF335 (each field representing a block to time for a day… e.g. BM893 is Block Monday 8 – 930, all fields are integers where 0 is free and 1 is occupied/busy) Table: Student Fields :s_id, s_name, BM893, BM9311, BM11123, BM1232, BM233, BM335, BT893, BT9311, BT11123, BT1232, BT233, BT335, BW893, BW9311, BW11123, BW1232, BW233, BW335, BTH893, BTH9311, BTH11123, BTH1232, BTH233, BTH335, BF893, BF9311, BF11123, BF1232, BF233, BF335 (each field representing a block to time for a day… e.g. BM893 is Block Monday 8 – 930, all fields are integers where 0 is free and 1 is occupied/busy) Table: Instructor Fields : i_id, i_name, BM893, BM9311, BM11123, BM1232, BM233, BM335, BT893, BT9311, BT11123, BT1232, BT233, BT335, BW893, BW9311, BW11123, BW1232, BW233, BW335, BTH893, BTH9311, BTH11123, BTH1232, BTH233, BTH335, BF893, BF9311, BF11123, BF1232, BF233, BF335 (each field representing a block to time for a day… e.g. BM893 is Block Monday 8 – 930, all fields are integers where 0 is free and 1 is occupied/busy) Input: 1 instructor (i_id) All labs N students (s_id, s_id…etc) Output: Time block for session (if more than one section than also s_id of every student in each section) Could someone please help me with the algorithm? Thank You very much
