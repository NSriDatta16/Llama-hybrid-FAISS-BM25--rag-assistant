I've had the misfortune to work on Access front ends like you describe, here are some non-Enterpise arguments. Programming is easy! Creating forms in access is geared toward non-developers. Case in point, if you have multiple columns in a drop down, do you have list fields and data fields. No way! you just set he width of things you don't want to see to 0". So your looking at forms either thrown together by non-developers, or that will irk most people that have to work on them. Versioning? Who needs versioning?, Just send out an attachment If changes need to be made to the front-end re-deployment is time consuming and fault prone. This form, I'm thinking magenta The front end doesn't lock down well so end-users can get creative.
