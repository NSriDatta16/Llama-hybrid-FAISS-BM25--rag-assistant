On Developing Native Windows Executables

Which technology stack do you recommend for developing native windows executable (has GUI), other than .NET stack? Other that C++ (MFC, ...) some could be named; yet which one is mature and pragmatic enough? Delphi 7? Common Lisp (Which one is proper for developing GUI?)? Scheme? Qt or wxXXX stack?
