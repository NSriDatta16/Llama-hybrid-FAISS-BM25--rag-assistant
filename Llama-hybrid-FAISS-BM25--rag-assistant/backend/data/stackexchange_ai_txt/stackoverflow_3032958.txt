Opinions sought on the best way to organise classes in PHP

I am pretty much set on using the Java package naming convention of com.website.app.whatever but am unsure about the best way of doing this in PHP. Option 1: Create a directory structure com/ mysite/ myapp/ encryption/ PublicKeyGenerator.class.php Cipher.class.php Xml/ XmlHelper.class.php XmlResponse.class.php Now this is how Java does it, it uses the folders to organize the heirarchy. This is however a little clumsy in PHP because there is no native support for it and when you move things around you break all includes. Option 2 Name classes using a periods for the package, therefore names are just like in Java but can all be in the same directory making __autoload a breeze. classes/ com.mysite.myapp.encription.PublicKeyGenerator.class.php com.mysite.myapp.encription.Cipher.class.php com.mysite.myapp.xml.XmlHelper.class.php com.mysite.myapp.xml.XmlResponse.class.php The only real disadvantage here is that all the classes are in a single folder which might be confusing for large projects. Opinions sought, which is the best or are there other even better options?
