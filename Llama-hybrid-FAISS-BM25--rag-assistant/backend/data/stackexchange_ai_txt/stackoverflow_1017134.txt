SourceSafe backup script - best approach?

I was wondering what the best approach might be for creating a backup of my organisation's SourceSafe database, and moving it to a share on another server? Currently we have a scheduled job which runs a batch file, which in turn executes a PowerShell script. This Powershell script creates a backup file (using SourceSafe command-line arguments), moves it to a new server (via a drive that has been mapped on the SourceSafe server), and sends the output of the SourceSafe backup to our administrator via e-mail. This process works for the most part, but I can't help but feel there are more streamlined approaches or tools we should be utilizing. Any advice is welcomed!
