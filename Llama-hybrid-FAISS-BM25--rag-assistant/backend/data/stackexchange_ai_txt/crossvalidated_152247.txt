Actually performing demeaning and PCA first doesn't change the density up to a constant but makes things way simpler! Write the density in terms of the SVD of the matrix, and it depends only on the singular values! Furthermore, it is separable in those singular values, and I can sample them individually from $f(x) = e^{-\frac{n}{2} x^2} x^n$ pick a random sign for each of them, pick two random rotation matrices, and that's it! For $n>10$ or so, $f$ is very closely approximated by a gaussian distribution with mean $$\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)} ~= 1+\frac{1}{4n} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$$ and variance $$1+\frac{1}{n}-\frac{\Gamma\left(1+\frac{n}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)^2}~= \frac{1}{2n} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$$
