C# Gridview, rearrange

I really didnt know what to put to the title so sorry about that. I have 2 colums where i list files from 2 folders. Now what i would like to do is to give a user ability to rearrange the files by clicking on one file in one column and then on the other file in other column. The application merges these two files together. Just onother option would be just use datagrid and its drag and drop functionality (one column is static and one rearrangable with drag and drop or something) but doing it this way isnt really what i would like.. So, all options are welcome.. EDIT: Using WinForms, it doesnt have to be gridview, just i couldnt think of anything else..
