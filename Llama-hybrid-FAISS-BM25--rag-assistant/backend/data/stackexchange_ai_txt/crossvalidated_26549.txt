Sampling model for crowdsourced data?

I'm working on an open health survey application, planned to be used in developing country. The basic idea is that survey interviews are crowdsourced - they are performed by unorganized volunteers who submit forms data of the interviews they performed by using their mobile devices, and each survey is accompanied by the GPS data of the interview location. Traditional surveys compiled by government agencies are usually implemented using some standard sampling model - usually a probability sampling model. This requires a lot of centralized planning that cannot be always performed. (mentioned this to put my question in the right context) We can say that a volunteer will implement a convenience sampling around his area. He will interview arbitrarily number of people he can reach. The basic problem is: How can understand and characterize the overall sampling model of this surveying system? Are there any methodologies or composed models to deal with such cases?
