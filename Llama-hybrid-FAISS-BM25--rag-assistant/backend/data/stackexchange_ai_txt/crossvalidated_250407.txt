Predictions based on constrained ordination

This question is aimed at the use of CCA (or similar) in ecology. What we know for constrained ordination: axes summarizing compositional variation are constrained to be weighted combinations of the predictors. An easy example: library(vegan) data(varespec) data(varechem) vare.cca My question for this example would be: If I have new values for Al, P and K, without Species information, can I obtain predicted values for the ordination axes?
