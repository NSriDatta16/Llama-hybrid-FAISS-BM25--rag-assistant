As to your side question, I expect you're getting a "continuation token." If you're using the .NET storage client library, try adding .AsTableServiceQuery() to your query. As to your main question, fanning out the query is the best thing that you can do. It sounds like you're accessing storage from a local machine (not in Windows Azure). If so, I would imagine you can speed things up quite a bit by deploying a small service to Windows Azure which fetches the data from table storage (much faster, since there's higher bandwidth and lower latency within the data center), and then compresses the results and sends them back down to your local machine. There's a lot of overhead to the XML Windows Azure tables send back, so stripping that out and bundling up rows would probably save a lot of transfer time.
