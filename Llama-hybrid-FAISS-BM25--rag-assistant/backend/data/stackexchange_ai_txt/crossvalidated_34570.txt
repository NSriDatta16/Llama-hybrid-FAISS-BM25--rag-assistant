Exploratory factor analysis - promax & factor cross-loadings

I have a question regarding the best practice for dealing with cross-loadings on factors after conducting an exploratory factor analysis using a promax rotation. Just to give a bit of background information, I am trying to determine the factor structure of a set of 20 questions that I created about spirituality (based on PCA which identified 4 components). After conducting the EFA with 184 participants, I noticed that quite a few of the questions are cross-loading onto two or three factors. I read online that you should eliminate questions whose cross-loadings are less than or equal to .2, but I am confused because doesn't an oblique rotation (promax) imply that there is inter-correlation? For example, if question 2 loads onto factor 1 (.234), factor 2 (.346), and factor 3 (.212), what should I do?
