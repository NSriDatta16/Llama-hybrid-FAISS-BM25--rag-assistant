Preg matching and counting the resulting match in a short string

I already have a function that counts the number of items in a string ($paragraph) and tells me how many characters the result is, ie tsp and tbsp present is 7, I can use this to work out the percentage of that string is. I need to reinforce this with preg_match because 10tsp should count as 5. $characters = strlen($paragraph); $items = array("tsp", "tbsp", "tbs"); $count = 0; foreach($items as $item) { //Count the number of times the formatting is in the paragraph $countitems = substr_count($paragraph, $item); $countlength= (strlen($item)*$countitems); $count = $count+$countlength; } $overallpercent = ((100/$characters)*$count); I know it would be something like preg_match('#[d]+[item]#', $paragraph) right? EDIT sorry for the curve ball but there might be a space inbetween the number and the $item, can one preg_match catch both instances?
