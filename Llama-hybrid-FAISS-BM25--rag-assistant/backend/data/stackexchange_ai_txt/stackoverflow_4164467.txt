C Programming: Drag&Drop a file over a program's icon

i just made a little program that reads the name of a file dragged over it's icon and writes it into an output text file but if i compile this program, it crashes when i try to drag a file over it. if i open it with a doble click it's ok; if i open it with command line and parameters it's ok; but if i just drop a file over the program i have compiled, it always crashes and i don't know why just try to compile like this: #include int main(int argc, char * argv[]) { FILE * File=fopen("file.txt", "w"); fclose(File); return 0; } if you drag&drop a simple file over that program icon, the program crashes does anyone knows why?
