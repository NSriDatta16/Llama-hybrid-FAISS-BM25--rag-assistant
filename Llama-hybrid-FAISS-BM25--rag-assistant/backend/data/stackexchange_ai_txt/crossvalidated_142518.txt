Do realise that it is of importance to know when you have more than two outcomes, if the outcomes are ordered or unordered. In your case (class membership y/n) I don't understand how you can have 3 outcomes unless outcomes 3 and 4 are for instance nested on another property. In this case you can create new variables using for instance excel with an if-statement in which you say if your variable has option 3 or 4 it represents a one and zero otherwise. After this you can use binary logistic regression.
