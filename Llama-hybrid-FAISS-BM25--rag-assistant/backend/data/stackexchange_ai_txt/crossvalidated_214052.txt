Can logistic regression be used with "years" as a continuous variable?

We are currently collecting data for a study whose purpose is to show whether scientists are focusing more or less on a specific subject with time. To keep some privacy let's say the subject is jelly beans : we reviewed a thousand random studies and we checked whether they were about jelly beans or not. The dataset has only two columns and it looks like: | JellyBeans | Year | |------------|------| | YES | 2010 | | NO | 2001 | | NO | 2010 | | NO | 2015 | | YES | 2009 | | NO | 2016 | | ... | .... | | YES | 1999 | We thought of using logistic regression for the purpose as the DV is categorical. In R, this would look something like: logreg_jelly_year = glm(JellyBeans ~ Year, family = "binomial", data = dataset) We have, however, some doubts about the validity of the procedure, in particular: Is there any specific assumption we have to check that could jeopardise the scientific value of the procedure? Is the fact that Year is not truly continuous a problem? Is there any other test or procedure that we should run on top or instead of logistic regression?
