Time Series Expectation/Autocovariance Question

I have a stochastic process that's represented by $X_t = \epsilon_t \times \epsilon_{t-1}$ where $\epsilon_t$ ~ $N(0, \sigma^2)$ and iid. I'm asked to find the expected value of $X_t$ and the autocovariance function $\gamma(t, s)$ for all $s, t$. I've worked out the problem, but I am not sure if this approach is right. For the expected value, I have: \begin{equation} E[X_t] = E[\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}]= 0 \end{equation} using the fact that: \begin{equation} cov(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) = E[\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}] - E[\epsilon_t]E[\epsilon_{t-1}] = 0 \end{equation} because $\epsilon_t$ and $\epsilon_{t-1}$ are independent and have mean 0. Is this logic correct? Also, for $\gamma(t, s)$, I have: \begin{equation} cov(X_t, X_s) = cov(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_s\epsilon_{s-1}) \\ = E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_s\epsilon_{s-1}) - E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1})E(\epsilon_s\epsilon_{s-1}) \\ = E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_s\epsilon_{s-1}) \end{equation} since we found from before that $E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}) = 0$. Then, because the $\epsilon_t$ are independent, the expectation of the product is just \begin{equation} E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_s\epsilon_{s-1}) = E(\epsilon_t)E(\epsilon_{t_1})E(\epsilon_s)E(\epsilon_{s-1}) = 0 \end{equation} because they all have mean 0. Is my approach defensible? It's been a while since I've been exposed to statistical properties--any hints would be greatly appreciated.
