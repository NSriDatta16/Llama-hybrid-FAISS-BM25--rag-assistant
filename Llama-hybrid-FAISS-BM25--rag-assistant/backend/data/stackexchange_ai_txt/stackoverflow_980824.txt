Why is this intended interpolation interpreted as division by Perl?

G'day, Why am I getting the following two errors from the script fragment below? Argument "www4.mh.xxxx.co.uk.logstatsto20090610.gz" isn't numeric in division (/) at line 56 Argument "/logs/xxxx/200906/mcs0.telhc/borg2" isn't numeric in division (/) at line 56 The variables $dir and $log are both strings and the concatenation of the two strings, along with the slash in the middle, is also wrapped with quotation marks. foreach my $dir (@log_dirs) { foreach my $log (@log_list) { line 56: if ( -s "$dir/$log" ) { push(@logs, $dir/$log); } } } Edit: Line 56 is definitely the if statement. However, Paul, you're right, surrounding the division on line 57 with quotation marks fixes the problem. Thanks. Edit: The Perl version reporting Line 56 is stats@fs1:/var/tmp/robertw> /usr/local/perl/bin/perl -v This is perl, v5.6.1 built for sun4-solaris Copyright 1987-2001, Larry Wall Perl may be copied only under the terms of either the Artistic License or the GNU General Public License, which may be found in the Perl 5 source kit.
