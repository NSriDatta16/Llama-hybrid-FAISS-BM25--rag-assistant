CSS HTML organize 5 images - cross-browser compatible

I've got 5 images I'd like to organize in an ASP.NET MVC view. So what I need is an HTML+CSS solution (I prefer not to use jQuery for this, for maximal compatibility). I want to organize the images like so: Image1 Image2 Image3 Image4 Image5 At first I tried using tables, with the HTML being: and the css part: .mainArticleImage { height: 95px; width: 120px; } .ImageCenterContainer { margin: 0 auto; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; padding:0px; text-align:center; } but that doesn't work on IE. This approach also didn't work too well either. What is the best, simplest, cross-browser way to carry out what would seem to be an easy task?
