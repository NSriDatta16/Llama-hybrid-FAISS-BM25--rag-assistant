You can adapt it via a suitable distance . Unlike k-means, k-medoid centers are chosen directly from data. So, you don't have to implement addition operation between data samples. It just remains to use a well-defined distance, i.e. $d(x_i,x_j)$ . Several distances for time series with different lengths exist, e.g. Dynamic Time Warping . This library in R has many of them and also implements K-medoids algorithm with a lot of distance options.
