Combining Linear Regression and Time Series

Does anyone know of a predictive model that can combine the linear regression model and time series model? I have some data about some products. The data has two parts, some attributes about the products themselves, and some time series data of month-by-month sales amounts for each product. We want to predict future month-by-month sales amount for each product. with the products attributes data, we can build a regression model, or an svm model, to predict sales amounts. With the time series sales amount, we can build a time series model to predict sales amount, but is there any predictive model that can combine the regression, svm, and time series models to do the prediction?
