This is part of the HTML spec, though isn't a standard part of HTTP 1.1. (RFC2616 doesn't define the Link field.) Because of that, it's up to individual user agents to implement it. It's pretty obscure, and not very useful, so I guess that it isn't implemented in Webkit either due to unawareness, or deliberate intent to avoid obscure features.
