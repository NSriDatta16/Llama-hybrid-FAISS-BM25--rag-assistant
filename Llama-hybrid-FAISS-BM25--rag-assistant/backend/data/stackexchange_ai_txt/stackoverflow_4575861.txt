This is a pretty straight-forward question so here's a straight-forward answer: Mark-and-sweep (and occasionally mark-and-compact to avoid heap fragmentation) is the fastest when it comes to allocation and access (avoiding double de-refs). It's also very easy to implement. Since you're not worried about collection performance impact (mark-and-sweep tends to freeze up the process in a nondeterministically), this should be the way to go.
