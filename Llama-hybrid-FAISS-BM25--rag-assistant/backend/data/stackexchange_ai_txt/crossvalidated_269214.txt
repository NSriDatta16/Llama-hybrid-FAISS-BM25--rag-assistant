It's the Machine, Stupid! I am neither a statistician nor a Big Data(TM) expert. However, I would say that the essential distinction is that "machine learning" requires "a machine". In particular, it implies agency . The result will not be consumed leisurely by a human. Rather, the result will be the input to a closed cycle whereby an automated system improves its performance. Closed System This is very much in line with Sean Easter's answer, but I just want to emphasize that in commercial applications, a machine is looking at the results and acting on them . A classic example is the CineMatch algorithm which was the target of the Netflix Prize. A human could look at the output of CineMatch and learn interesting features about movie viewers. But that is not why it exists. The purpose of CineMatch is to provide a mechanism whereby Netflix servers can suggest movies to customers that they will enjoy. The output of the statistical model goes into the recommender service, which ultimately produces more input as customers rate movies, some of which were selected on the advice of CineMatch. Open System On the other hand, if a researcher uses an algorithm to produce statistical results which are displayed in a presentation to other humans, then that researcher is most decidedly not engaging in machine learning . This is, quite obviously to me, human learning . The analysis is performed by a machine, but it is not a machine that is doing the learning , per se. Now, it is "machine learning" to the extent that a human brain did not experience all of the sample inputs and derive the statistical results "biologically". But I would call it "statistics" because this is exactly what statisticians have been doing since the field was invented. Conclusion Thus, I would answer this question by asking: "Who consumes the results?" If the answer is: "humans", then it's "statistics". If the answer is: "software", then it's "machine learning." And when we say that "software consumes the results", we don't mean that it stores it somewhere for later retrieval. We mean that it performs behavior which is determined by the results in a closed loop .
