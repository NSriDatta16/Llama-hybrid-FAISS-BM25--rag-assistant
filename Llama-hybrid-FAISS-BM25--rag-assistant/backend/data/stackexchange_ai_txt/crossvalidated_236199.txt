As @Ben_Bolker says, this is a "how long" question. In my experience (mostly with marketing and sales data), 3 cycles is minimal, and usually sufficient if the seasonality is consistent. But who cares about the experience of a person who doesn't even post under his own name? What about a citation? Checking a popular textbook [John E. Hanke and Dean W. Wichern, Business Forecasting, 9th edition, 2009, Pearson] I see the following recommendations in table 3.6, page 80, for minimum data requirements: Seasonal exponential smoothing [Holt-Winters]: 2 cycles (seems too short to me; that's a lot of parameters to fit in two cycles) Adaptive filtering: 5 cycles Classical decomposition: 5 cycles (seems long to me, if the series looks pretty regular) Census X-12: 6 cycles (newer version available; note the Census versions have nice handling of holiday effects) Box-Jenkins: 3 cycles Time series multiple regression: 6 cycles
