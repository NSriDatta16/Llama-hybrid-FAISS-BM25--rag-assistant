How to infer one-to-one/one-to-many relationship?

We have a file with IP addresses patterns as shown below: source IP ,,,,,,, Dest IP 10.10.1.41 ,,,,,,, 12.13.67.89 67.34.6.8 ,,,,,,, 34.67.8.90 10.10.1.41 ,,,,,,, 12.13.67.89 10.10.1.41 ,,,,,,, 12.13.67.89 where ,,,,,,, represents other IP's. Based on this table we need to train a NLP engine that can infer the relationship between IPs. For example, it could be another column as below: ,,,,,,, RelationType ,,,,,,, one to many ,,,,,,, many to one ,,,,,,, one to one How can we infer this relationship?
