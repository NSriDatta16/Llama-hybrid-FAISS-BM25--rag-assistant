Capistrano + Git + DreamHost

I'm trying to deploy my rails application by using Passenger and Capistrano on Dreamhost. I'm using Git as a version control and we bought an account from GitHub. I have installed all required gems, Passenger and Capistrano in my local machine and I have cloned the repository of my project from GitHub in my local machine as wel. According to Dreamhost support, they have Passenger, Ruby, Rails and etc on their server as well. I'm currently following this article http://github.com/guides/deploying-with-capistrano for my deployment. The following is my deploy.rb. default_run_options[:pty] = true ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true # be sure to change these set :user, 'gituser' set :domain, 'github.com' set :application, 'MyProjectOnGit' #git@github.com:MyProjectOnGit.git # the rest should be good set :repository, "git@github.com:MyProjectOnGit.git" set :deploy_to, "/ruby.michaelsync.net/" set :deploy_via, :remote_cache set :scm, 'git' set :branch, 'master' set :git_shallow_clone, 1 set :scm_verbose, true set :use_sudo, false set :git_enable_submodules, 1 server domain, :app, :web role :db, domain, :primary => true set :ssh_options, { :forward_agent => true } namespace :deploy do task :restart do run "touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt" end end When I run "cap deploy", I'm getting the error below. [deploy:update_code] exception while rolling back: Capistrano::ConnectionError, connection failed for: github.com (Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed: gituser) connection failed for: github.com (Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed: gituser) Thanks in advance..
