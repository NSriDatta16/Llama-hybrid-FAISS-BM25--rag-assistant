With private repositories, how do I give someone read access versus write access? This kind of permission is not available for simple accounts. When you add an user as a collaborator, he gains read/write permissions. The story changes if you own an Organization . Organizations contains teams and each team can have different level of access, including read-only. You can assign users to a specific read-only group, and they will only have pull access to the repositories.
