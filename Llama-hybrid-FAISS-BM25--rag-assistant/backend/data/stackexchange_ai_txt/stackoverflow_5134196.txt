And yes this works, thanks Dogbert, however the reason why this didn't work for me the first time is this: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/child-category-missing-from-admin-list-but-its-there After going to phpmyadmin, and playing with fix table a bit, it works again in the admin menu, and on the page... Annoying bug here, and no real solution?! :(
