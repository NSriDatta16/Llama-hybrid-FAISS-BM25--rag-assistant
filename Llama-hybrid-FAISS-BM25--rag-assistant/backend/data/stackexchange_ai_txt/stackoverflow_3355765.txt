The problem, it seems, is that there is conflict between each of the different spring.handlers and spring.schemas in the META-INF folders of the various spring dependencies. The trick I found is to override these by creating these files in src/main/resources/META-INF and copying and pasting the contents of those individual files into these. Secondly, use the maven-jar-plugin to set the manifest's mainClass; and the maven-shade-plugin, instead of the maven-assembly-plugin. So the updated pom.xml looks like: maven-jar-plugin org.robert.xclades.Main org.apache.maven.plugins maven-shade-plugin package shade So all that is required now is maven package .
