The only concern that I can think of is that the speed of the dictionary relies on the key class having a reasonably fast GetHashCode method. Lookups and inserts are really fast, so you shouldn't have any problem there. Regarding using an array, that's what the Dictionary class does already. Actually it uses two arrays, one for the keys and one for the values. If you would have any performance problems with a Dictionary, it would be quite easy to make a wrapper for any kind of storage, that has the same methods and behaviour as a Dictionary so that you can replace it seamlessly.
