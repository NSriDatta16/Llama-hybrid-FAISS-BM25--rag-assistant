You can use method wrappers. To see what method wrappers are you can look for a paper called "Wrappers to the rescue". I think there is a package for squeak that already implements method wrappers. In addition, you can see how a test code coverage analysis is made in the last version of Pharo because it uses a kind of method wrapper to see what methods are evaluated during a test run. cheers, Gaboto
