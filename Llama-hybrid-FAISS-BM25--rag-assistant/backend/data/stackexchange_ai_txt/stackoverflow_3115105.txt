I think the drag and drop handler is possibly one way to go, but it seems quite heavy. An alternative solution is to use a Explorer Context Menu handler. With this in place, you would select all the files, but rather than dragging them, right click, and choose your new menu item "Send to ". When the menu item is selected, it passes the list of commands to your program. There are a couple of ways of doing this: launch your program, and feed the list of files to standard input write the list of files to a temporary file, and launch your program with just one command argument - the temporary file listing the files to process. List files are usually prefixed with '@' on the command line to distinguish them from ordinary file names.
