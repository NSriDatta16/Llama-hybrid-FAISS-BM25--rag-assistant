The problem is that $[B]$ behaves like $N_\infty-N_\infty e^{-\lambda t}$, and the log of this is nothing really interesting. You should subtract this from the asymptotic value to get exponential function again and restore linear look on the log-y plot. Easy to say, but how to get this $N_\infty$? One way is to wait some time (rule of thumb say $>3/\lambda$, but obviously the more the better) and collect some points then and average them (they will be very close to $N_\infty$). The better idea is not to plot any lines at all and just use non-linear fitting procedure (such as nls in R) to fit $N_\infty\left(1-e^{-\lambda (t-t_0)}\right)$ to the data and just get all those parameters nicely approximated with CIs.
