I modified the code slightly to just test the basic idea in a directory containing my perl programs and it does seem to work. You should be iterating through @docs instead of @dir though (and I highly recommend using both the strict and warnings pragmas). opendir(DIR, ".") or die "cannot open directory"; @docs = grep(/\.pl$/,readdir(DIR)); foreach $file (@docs) { open (RES, $file) or die "could not open $file\n"; while( ){ print "$_"; } }
