What exactly are the requirements and tasks in Scrum?

I am using Scrum with a small team for the first time and I have gone through many presentations and documents explaining this agile method, but I still don't know exactly what a requirement should be and what a task should be! Say I want to develop a mobile application that tracks my moves in real time, my first thought was organizing my requirements and tasks like this: Requirement 1: As a user I can see my position in real time on a map. Tasks that belong to the requirement 1: Code the class that creates a map using the Google Map API. Code the geolocalisation class. Draw a set of icons to represent the user. Write the unit tests. etc. Or, should we organize the tasks this way: Write the Unit tests. Code the Business logic. Code the UI. Now for the requirements should we have: As a user I can manage my account. Or: As a user I can login. As a user I can logout. As a user I can reset my password. etc. Finally is there a level above the requirements in Scrum? I have seen that some people separate the feeatures and the requirements but I can't see the benefit? If features exist in Scrum, what do they represent exactly? Thank you!
