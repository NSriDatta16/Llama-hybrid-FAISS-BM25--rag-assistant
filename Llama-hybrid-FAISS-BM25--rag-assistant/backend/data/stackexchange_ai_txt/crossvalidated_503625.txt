Statistical significance of causal models and cross validation

When tuning causal models (e.g. uplift models) using cross validation, how important is the statistical significance of the measurement (e.g., the difference between group A and B, or Control and Treatment) in each training and validation fold? Can a model be well tuned if the folds are not statistically significant? Update I am building uplift models which are design to capture the causal effect between a control and treatment groups. I am using xgboost as the meta learner, xlearner from the causalml python package and the Transformed Outcome method from the pylift python package. The training data set has a statistical significant effect (i.e, the difference between the treatment and control is statistical significant); however, when using a CV to tune the model some of the training and validation folds are not exhibiting statistical significance any more. Therefore, I am wondering if this will void the quality of the validation process. In addition, should the effect measured in the overall training dataset be identical to the effect in each training and validation folds or is this not necessary?
