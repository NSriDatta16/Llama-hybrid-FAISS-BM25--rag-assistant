Parsing impossible dates in C#

Is there an elegant way to be permissive in date input in C# to accommodate user input like '2009-09-31' (e.g. September 31, which doesn't exist and causes DateTime.Parse to choke)? Ideally I would like to parse this as October 1 (e.g. latest possible date plus overflow).
