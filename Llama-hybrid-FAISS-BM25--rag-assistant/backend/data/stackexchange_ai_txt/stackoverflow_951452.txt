This is a very difficult question with probably no great answer. However, there are a couple things you can do to increase the possibility of keeping yourself safe when using new technologies. Keep the following in mind: there are three types of vulnerabilities. Ones that are unique to the framework you are using (e.g. Ruby on Rails public controller problems), ones that are unique to the type of application you building (e.g. Web Applications have to worry about XSS), and ones that are unique to your application in particular. Identify how the new technology you are using mitigates application type security vulnerabilities. For example, how does ASP.Net MVC mitigate XSS? How does it mitigate SQL Injection? If there is no answer in the documentation, then figure out how you are going to address these common classes of vulnerabilities. Also, take pause because if the framework doesn't mitigate these issues then maybe the frameworks developers haven't prioritized security and may not have written a very robust framework. Figure out why you need security and what you are trying to protect. For example: Does your application require authorization before viewing sensitive data? If so, determine what features the framework provides for authorization. Look for a security section in the documentation. Often known issues are documented but people focus so much on getting their problem solved that they don't look for it. Code defensively and be aware of how user input is used. Be generous in defining what is user input. For example, the querystring or post fields are obvious, but in many MVC frameworks the URL dictates what code runs (e.g. see Ruby Routes vulnerability). Be very aware of how the data is handled Stress test your business logic and figure out how it could potentially be abused. So in short: Handle user input carefully, read the existing documentation, determine what security you require, and figure out how the framework mitigates common vulnerability classes. Being aware that security is a priority and paying attention is 50% of the fight.
