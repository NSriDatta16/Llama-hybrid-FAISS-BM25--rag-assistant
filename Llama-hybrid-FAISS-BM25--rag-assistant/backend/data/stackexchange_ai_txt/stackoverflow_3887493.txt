LWP::Simple is for very simple HTTP GET requests. If you need to do anything more complex (like cookies), you have to upgrade to a full LWP::UserAgent . The cookie_jar is a HTTP::Cookies object, and you can use its set_cookie method to add a cookie. use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(cookie_jar => {}); # create an empty cookie jar $ua->cookie_jar->set_cookie(...); my $rsp = $ua->get('example.com?GET=whateverIwant'); die $rsp->status_line unless $rsp->is_success; my $content = $rsp->decoded_content; ... The LWP::UserAgent also has a post method.
