Yes, in that situation sessions will be created every time. These do cost memory and will need to be GC'ed eventually. If you don't need to track users you can always opt to disable the creation of sessions. In JSP this is a bit difficult, since a page normally always creates a session. There is a directive to turn this off though. You can however write a filter and servlet request wrapper that prevents sessions from being created. In JSF there is a very unfortunate bug in the much used Mojorra 2.04 implementation that makes it more or less impossible to do this, but luckily Mojarra 2.1.0 has fixed this. In case that you really do need to track users, a form of fingerprinting could be used. This is always approximate though and I don't think you should ever use this for a login. IP + user agent is a form of fingerprinting, but because of proxies and large organizations installing the exact same browser for all their workstations this is quite unreliable . It's okay for usage statistics, but totally unsuited for logins. Alternatives are using HTTPS/SSL, as this protocol has a build-in kind of "session ID", or using DOM or Flash storage, which not everyone who disables cookies also disables.
