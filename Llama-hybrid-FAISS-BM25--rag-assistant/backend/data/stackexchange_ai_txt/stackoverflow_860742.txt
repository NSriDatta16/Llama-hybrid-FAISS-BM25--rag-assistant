Considering this is a simple school project, probably the easiest interpolation technique to implement is the "Nearest Neighbors" For each missing data point you find the nearest "filled" data point and use that as the value. If you want to improve the retults a little bit more, then you can lets say, find K nearest data points, and use their weighted average as the value of your missing data point. the weight could be proportional to the distance of the point from the missing data point. There are zillion other techniques, but nearest neighbor is probably the easiest to implement.
