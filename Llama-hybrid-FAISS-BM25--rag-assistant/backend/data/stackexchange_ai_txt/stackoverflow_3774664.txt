Semantic markup gives power back to users It is possible that you can write something like: and the browser will render it as: 3 days ago or in some other languages of the user's preference. Semantic markups are all about these kind of things. We are tagging text for their 'meaning', instead of for visual styling. The styling is just an extra. Once you get the meaning right, the user can style these markups to their preference, not to the author's preference. This wasn't possible with style markups, a bold markup may be used for adding emphasis, or it may be used for headings, while in other places it may be used for the first paragraph of an article. A time markup is always used for time, an emphasis markup is always used for adding emphasis, and nothing else. Many browsers support user stylesheet to allow a user to override the stylesheet used by the website, but they are very rarely used since they are currently useless, because they apply styling indiscriminately (and because of the lack of tool support, not every users fancies writing CSS code; but we can argue that the lack of tool support is because there are not many that will use these tools, given the limited usefulness they have with formatting markup). Then, there is the non-visual browsers; some people with visual disabilities uses aural browser. These browsers doesn't work well with formatting markups.
