For big files, I use cloud storage (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or whichever ecosystem your company's on), with folders named after the issue/project ticket name/number. These services support file versioning, by the way. Small files I just attach to the ticket. If have to share something small and transient with a handful of people I can use email or our corporate chat application.
