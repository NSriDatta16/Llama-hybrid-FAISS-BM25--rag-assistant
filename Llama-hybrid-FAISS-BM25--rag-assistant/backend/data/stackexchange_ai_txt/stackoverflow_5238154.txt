Monitoring the launch of process in Linux

I'm to make a script whose purpose is to kill a process. If this process is launched it terminates it instantly and if this process isn't launched it performs an infinite loop until it detects the presence of the specified process.(The name of the process is typed by the user). An instruction code in the loop will delay this loop for 10 seconds at each iteration so as not to outrageously consume the system's resources. The shell periodically checks the presence or absence of the launch process. The script should end when: -it tracks the launched process -or when the user has quit the application(process) So far so good I when my script detects the launch process , it terminates the process and the quits but it doesn't quit when the user quits the application instead it continues to loop. Actually I don't really now how to detect if the user has quit the application. Any ideas please? Thanks in advance. #!/bin/sh echo "Enter the name of the process to monitor " read nom while : do compteur=` ps -u $USER | grep $nom | cut -d " " -f2 ` if [ $compteur >0 ] then kill $compteur echo " Process terminated " exit 1 else echo " Searching $nom... " fi sleep 10; done
