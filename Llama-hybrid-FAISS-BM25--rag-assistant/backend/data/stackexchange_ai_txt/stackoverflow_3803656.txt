Layout out data-entry form in HTML: table or no table?

I want to create a data-entry form like the following: Name: [ Name textbox ] Age: [ Age textbox ] label n: [ textbox n ] Where the labels left-align, and the textboxes left-align. I know I can do this in a table element, but I'm also aware that "tables should only be for tabular data". While I part agree/disagree with that statement - I'd like to know whether my desired layout could/should be considered "tabular data", and what an alternative layout would be to produce the same results without dozens of lines of complicated cross-browser CSS. I don't do web development much at the moment (strictly WinForms for some time now when I do UI work), so I appreciate there may be an elegant solution. Possibly involving an unordered list with the bullet points turned off and a bit off label->field y position offsetting, perhaps?
