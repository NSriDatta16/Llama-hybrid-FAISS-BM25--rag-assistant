You are presuming the model form i.e. 1 slope ; no level shift ; no arima structure ; no outliers; no parameter changes over time ; no varaince changes over time. Simply form a robust ARIMA model and estimate it globally and then locally (each of the 4 separately). Conduct a Chow Test as described in my answer to How to compare two time series?
