Detecting grayscale images with .Net

I am scanning documents to JPG images. The scanner must scan all pages as color or all pages as black and white. Since many of my pages are color, I must scan all pages as color. After the scanning is complete, I would like to examine the images with .Net and try to detect what images are black and white so that I can convert those images to grayscale and save on storage. Does anybody know how to detect a grayscale image with .Net? Please let me know.
