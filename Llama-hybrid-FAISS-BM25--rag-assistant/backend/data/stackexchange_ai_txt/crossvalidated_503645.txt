Statistical significance of an effect or model parameter is not required in each fold of a cross validation. A meta-parameter is "well tuned" in a machine learning setting if it minimizes the cost function, regardless of any estimate of statistical significance. If, however, your effect of interest is not significant in any cross-validation fold, and presumably not significant overall, then your effect is likely not there. I can't give more specific help without more specifics on your model. What model are you training? How are you assessing significance? etc.
