If you can't use wpf, and you can accept do some work by hand, a very insteresting component is the SharpDevelop text editor: http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/Using%20the%20texteditor.ashx it is not exactly a drag'drop component, but you can extend it with some sort of language service to provide your own spell check mechanism. The component offers to you all the graphic part: squiggles, highlighting and so on. And it is Winform (even if now there is a wpf version too)
