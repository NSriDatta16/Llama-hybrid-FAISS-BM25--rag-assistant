The least elegant solution but it will work on linux. Create cron task to be executed every minute. Use cp command with " -u " option. From " man cp ". -u, --update copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing In crontab -e add * * * * * cp -u /path/to/bin-debug/*.swf /path/to/destination/ For more elegant solution - Ant the way to go.
