Using Guava : Multiset values = TreeMultiset.create(); Collections.addAll(values, 1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,6,6,7,7); Now the answer to your question is: return Iterables.get(values, (values.size() - 1) / 2); Really. That's it. (Or check if size is even and average the two central values, to be precise about it.) If the counts are particularly large, it would be faster to use the multiset's entrySet and keep a running sum, but the simplest way is usually fine.
