I agree for applications. Most people that use multiple levels of namespaces (in my experience) come from a Java or .NET background where the noise is significantly less. I find that good class prefixes can take the place of multiple levels of namespaces. But I have seen good use of multiple namespace levels in boost (and other libraries). Everything is in the boost namespace, but libraries are allowed (encouraged?) to be in their own namespace. For example - boost::this_thread namespace. It allows things like... boost::this_thread::get_id() boost::this_thread::interruption_requested() "this_thread" is just a namespace for a collection of free functions. You could do the same thing with a class and static functions (i.e. the Java way of defining a free function), but why do something unnatural when the language has a natural way of doing it?
