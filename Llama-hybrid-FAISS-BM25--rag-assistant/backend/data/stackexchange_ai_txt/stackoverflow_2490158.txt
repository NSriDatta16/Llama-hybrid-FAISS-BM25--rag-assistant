When you check out your working copy, you should check out the "trunk" rather than the repository root. I'm not familiar with Beanstalk, but I'd imagine you'd have some sort of repository URL assigned to you, like this: https://www.example.com/repos/will/ Instead of checking out that URL, you want to check out https://www.example.com/repos/will/trunk into your webroot directory.
