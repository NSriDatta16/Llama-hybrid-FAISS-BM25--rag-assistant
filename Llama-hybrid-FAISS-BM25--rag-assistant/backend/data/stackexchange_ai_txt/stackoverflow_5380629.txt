You can't do it the "elegant" way. If you really need this you could build the following: 1. User touches the control (control has focus ... open your custom SIP) 2. immediately switch the focus to a hidden, non textbox control 3. OS SIP will not show if this is done fast enough Sorry, this is the only way I am aware of :( A related example: http://www.dreamincode.net/code/snippet5650.htm
