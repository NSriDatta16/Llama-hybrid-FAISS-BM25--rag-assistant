The paper "Simple Buehler-optimal confidence intervals on the average success probability of independent Bernoulli trials" by Bancal and Sekatski ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12558.pdf ) would provide one solution. That paper studies the following problem: given $m$ independent but non-identical Bernoulli draws, produce a one-sided confidence interval for the average of the Bernoulli parameters. To apply this to your problem, consider that you have $m=7N$ independent Bernoulli draws in the form of $W\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times 7}$ , each with $W_{ij}\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(q_{ij})$ . In your special case we have that $q_{ij}=p_j$ . The paper above gives you a way to put a confidence interval on what they call $\bar q = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^7 q_{ij} / (7N) = \sum_{j=1}^N p_{j} / 7$ . That, in turn, implies a confidence interval on $\sum_{j=1}^N p_j = 7\bar q$ (just multiply the confidence interval from the paper by 7). Note . It might be possible to use the fact that $q_{ij}=p_j$ to enable tighter confidence intervals. Not sure.
