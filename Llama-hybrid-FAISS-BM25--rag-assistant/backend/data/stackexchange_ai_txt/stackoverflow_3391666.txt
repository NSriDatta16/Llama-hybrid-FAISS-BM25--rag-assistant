I don't know about a reference list... but the one issue which comes to mind for me (and it's not quite CSS) is the placement of your declaration. IE will not pay any attention to your declaration if it is not the very, very, very first thing on the first line of the file. If you put your declaration anywhere else IE starts to do whatever it wants with the rendering of your document. I've seen even the most seasoned professionals bugger this up; they think "Oh, hey, I'm using a DOCTYPE; everything must be good now, right?" WRONG.
