Partial not receiving all variables from :locals

In my controller I have: - @items.each do |item| = render :partial => 'item', :locals => { :item => item, :draggable => true } And in the item partial I have: %span{:id => "item_#{item.id}", :class => 'item'} = item.name - if defined?(draggable) = draggable_element "item_#{item.id}", :revert => true This is not working, however, because defined?(draggable) returns false . The draggable_element is never rendered. I know that item is passed through :locals because the rest of the partial renders. If I change the partial to read: - if defined?(item) = draggable_element "item_#{item.id}", :revert => true Then the draggable_element is rendered. Any idea why :draggable is not getting passed to the partial?
