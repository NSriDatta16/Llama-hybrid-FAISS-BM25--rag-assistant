iText page wrapping- changes order of elements

I'm using iText to generate PDF reports when I came across this issue, and worked up a simple example to illustrate it. I'm combining simple paragraphs, and images. The height of the images is such that 3 will fit on a PDF page, but when if text is on a page, only 2 images will fit. I create my PDF with the following code: Document document = new Document(PageSize.LETTER, 0, 0, 0, 0); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, fileOutput); document.open(); document.add(new Paragraph("hello world1")); addImage(document); addImage(document); addImage(document); document.add(new Paragraph("hello world2")); document.close(); I expect the output to look like this hello world1 image image image hello world2 Instead, what I get is, Hello world 1 image image hello world 2 image I'm not setting any sort of odd wrapping parameters using iText, the example really is just a simple one. Any ideas on why it seems to be auto-wrapping this incorrectly? In the real case, just adding a page break is not an acceptable solution. Thanks very much.
