As with many things, it depends. The specifics of the relationship of your variables to the domain they describe will dictate, and even then relationships may not be intuitive. Seemingly disparate features can have a significant effect when combined in what is known as feature extraction. Automated feature engineering techniques can help you decide what features are significant if you have the time and resources available, particularly when it comes to testing the impact of combined features. Additionally, some methods have the benefit of embedded feature selection, wherein the algorithm itself tends to diminish the effect of insignificant variables, e.g.: lasso regression, regularized decision trees, random forests, etc. Here's a nice primer: http://machinelearningmastery.com/an-introduction-to-feature-selection/
