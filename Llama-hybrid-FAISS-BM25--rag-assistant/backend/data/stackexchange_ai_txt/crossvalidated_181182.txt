Help with Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Q.4.16

Q.4.16. Consider a binary classification problem in which each observation $x_n$ is known to belong to one of two classes, corresponding to $t = 0$ and $t = 1$, and suppose that the procedure for collecting training data is imperfect, so that training points are sometimes mislabelled. For every data point $x_n$, instead of having a value $t$ for the class label, we have instead a value $\pi_n$ representing the probability that $t_n = 1$. Given a probabilistic model $p(t = 1|Ï†)$, write down the log likelihood function appropriate to such a data set. To me this question seems trivially simple, which usually means I'm doing something wrong. Is there anything else to this question besides substituting $t_n$ for $\pi_n$ in the classification formulas?
