"What is the problem with longerm forecasts for exmaple 140 data points are used to forecasts another 140 data points?" The confidence limits may broaden due to the form of the model . If there are "many outliers" i.e. empirically identified pulses allowing for them in the future can have a major effect in the widening of the prediction limits via bootstrapping. See How to set (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q) for SARIMA time series model for an example of how temperature can be efficiently modelled using pseudo-causals ( seasonal dummies) identified from the data suggesting month of the year effects along with anomalies and a level shift rather than arima effects as the better choice. Unwarranted arima differencing yields unecessarilily wide limits .
