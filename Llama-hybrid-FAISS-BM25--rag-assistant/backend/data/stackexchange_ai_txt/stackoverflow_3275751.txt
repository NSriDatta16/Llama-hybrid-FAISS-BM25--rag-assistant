Adding a user control "The Enumerator is not valid"

I'm using Visual Studio 2010 to create a small WPF application. I've created a user control that I am now trying to add to my main form. The user control does show up in toolbox but every time I try to drag the control to the form I get the error: The enumerator is not valid because the collection changed. I should know what's wrong and it is bugging me that I can't figure it out.
