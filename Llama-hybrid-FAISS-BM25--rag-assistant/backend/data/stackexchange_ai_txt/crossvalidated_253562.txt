Expectation of a matrix of variables is not the expectation of the columns of the matrix. What may confuse you is that you treat each column as a variable and calculate it's expectation estimate like an average of it's column. In this sense you are right. However covariance matrix is about covariation between this variables. So for example cell (1,3) is covariation between the third and the first variables and so on. Since you have 3 variables it can be 9 covariations (including covariation of variable with itself that is variation) that is how you get $3x3$ matrix. So covariance matrix is: $$\begin{bmatrix}Cov(X_{1},X_{1})& Cov(X_{1},X_{2}) &Cov(X_{1},X_{3})\\Cov(X_{2},X_{1})& Cov(X_{2},X_{2}) &Cov(X_{2},X_{3})\\Cov(X_{3},X_{1})& Cov(X_{3},X_{2}) &Cov(X_{3},X_{3})\end{bmatrix}.$$ Finally one more thing. Expectation of random matrix (i.e. matrix which elements are random variables) is a matrix of expectations of it's cells. That is if: $$X^{*}=\begin{bmatrix}X& Y\\Z& D\\\end{bmatrix},$$ where $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ and $D$ are random varibles, then $$E(X^{*})=\begin{bmatrix}E(X)& E(Y)\\E(Z)& E(D)\\\end{bmatrix}$$
