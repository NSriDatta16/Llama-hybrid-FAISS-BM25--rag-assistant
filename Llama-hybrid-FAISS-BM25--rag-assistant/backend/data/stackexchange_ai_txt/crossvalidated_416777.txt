The errors from your model may reflect omitted variables. The omitted variables can either be stochastic or deterministic. The effect of the unknown/latent and waiting to be discovered deterministic variables (reflecting omitted deterministic series) can be level/step shifts, local time trends, seasonal pulses, monthly effects and/or simply pulses. After adjusting for these effects by Intervention Detection / Model schemes http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html augmentation one can then study any remaining stochastic effects by examining the auto-correlation of the model residuals and the cross-correlation of model residuals with lags of the user-specified predictors to suggest appropriate model augmentation reflecting possible omitted stochastic series. Find correlation between two time series. Theory and practice (R) is an interesting thread that might be of help to you.
