It's nothing to worry about. Bayesian linear regression is (to simplify) just linear regression with random variables for the slope and intercept. Now, the posterior distributions for the slope and intercept random variables permit many credible values for those parameters. And those combinations of credible parameters permit many credible regression lines to be drawn: (Source for stylised image: http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/WorkshopUWM2012.html ) The shaded area on your chart is simply a similar representation for the above. I would argue the opposite to you: I would argue that you want the shaded region to be as tight as possible, to have more "confidence" (in the non-technical sense of the word) in the fitted regression line.
