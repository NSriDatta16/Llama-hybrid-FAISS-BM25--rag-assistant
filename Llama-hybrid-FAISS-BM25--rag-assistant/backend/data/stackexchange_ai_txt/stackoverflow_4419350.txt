Ignoring which language, I think my first question is if messUp is related to any other functions. If you have a group of related functions, I would tend to stick them in a class. If they don't access any class variables then you can make them static. This way, they can be called without needing to create an instance of the class. Beyond that, I would look to the language. In some languages, every function must be a method of some class. In the end, I don't think it makes a big difference. OOP is simply a way to help organize your application's data and logic. If you embrace it, then you would choose room.messUp() over messUp(room).
