It's going to depend on how your HTML is laid out, but you can use more complicated CSS selectors based on class name or ID. So, for example, in section one, you can wrap the entire section in a div: Blah Blah A section 1 paragraph And then use the following CSS rules to style just the links and paragraphs in that section: #section1 a { ... } #section1 p { ... }
