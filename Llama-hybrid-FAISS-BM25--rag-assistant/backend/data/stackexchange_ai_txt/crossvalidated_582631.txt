Just because some models are useful doesn't mean all models are useful. Even if "deep learning" is useful in many cases that doesn't mean that every single time someone uses it for something the result is automatically useful. It's a tool. Screwdrivers are useful but it's not true that every time someone tries to use a screwdriver they are doing something useful with it.
