Quoting part of Wikipedia's first paragraphs for each of atoi and itoa : atoi atoi is a function in the C programming language that converts a string into an integer numerical representation. atoi stands for ASCII to integer. It is included in the C standard library header file stdlib.h . itoa The itoa (integer to ASCII) function is a widespread non-standard extension to the standard C programming language. It cannot be portably used, as it is not defined in any of the C language standards ; however, compilers often provide it through the header while in non-conforming mode, because it is a logical counterpart to the standard library function atoi .
