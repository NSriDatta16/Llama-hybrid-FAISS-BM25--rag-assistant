First or second difference or log for simulated real GDP data?

For a paper I need to use simulated real GDP data to regress this on average income mobility (how much more the next generation earns). As a hint the assignment indicates that the STATA code for a difference should be used. However, after the first difference the result is as follows: I interpret this as a trend that is still upward sloping and not around mean zero. This is to be expected since GDP often exhibits quadratic developments over time. Therefore I decided to take the second difference, resulting in this: This leads me to two remaining questions. (1) After the first difference the Dickey-Fuller test indicates that there is no longer a unit root. Should I therefore stop at the first difference? (2) Both the first and second difference contain large values, should I therefore use a log instead?
