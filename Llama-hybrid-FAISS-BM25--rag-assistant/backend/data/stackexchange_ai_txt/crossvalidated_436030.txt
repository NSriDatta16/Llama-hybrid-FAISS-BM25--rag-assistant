I cannot understand formula for exogenous options in statsmodels' ARIMA

I need to use exogenous variables for my time series forecasting. And I found that I can include my exogenous variables into my ARIMA model using exogenous option. I want to know how this option works. Statsmodels docoument( https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.ARIMA.html ) says " If exogenous variables are given, then the model that is fit is $ϕ(L)(y_t−X_tβ)=θ(L)ϵ_t$ where ϕ and θ are polynomials in the lag operator, L. This is the regression model with ARMA errors, or ARMAX model. " I cannot understand what this formula means. I googled it and found what lag operator is. But I still don't understand what the above formula implies. I'm a undergraduate and took regression course. Could you explain above formula in terms of regression?
