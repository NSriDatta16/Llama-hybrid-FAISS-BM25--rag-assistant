Combining probabilities from 2 models to get one final probability

I have a question about probabilities. So I have one model which predicts probability of event A with 0.70 and event B with 0.30. Then I have another model which predicts probability of the same event A with 0.66, but event B with 0.55 because the second model predicts probability between A and B independently, hence the sum of A and B can be bigger than 1 in this case. Now my question is, is there a way to adjust the first probability based on the second one? So in my case the first probability 0.70 would be lower because the second model gave me 0.66 and the probability for event B is higher because the second model gave me probability 0.55. I thought about averaging but in the end I will end up with probabilities which are either lower/higher than 1. I just want to adjust the first model probabilities by second model but still predict 100%. I hope this was clear :)
