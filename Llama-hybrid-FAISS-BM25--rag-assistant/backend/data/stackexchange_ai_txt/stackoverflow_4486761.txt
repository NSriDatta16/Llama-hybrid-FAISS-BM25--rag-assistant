text to csv conversion

I have an output of the Linux command "who" which provides the following details..... CURRENT USER/ACCT INFO 17:31:36 up 4:49, 4 users, load average: 0.03, 0.04, 0.00 USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT root :0 - 12:59 ?xdm? 4:54 0.02s /bin/sh /usr/bi root pts/0 :0 12:59 4:31m 0.00s 1:20 kded [kdeinit] root pts/1 :0.0 16:18 1.00s 0.00s 0.00s -bash root pts/2 :0.0 16:25 49.00s 0.02s 0.00s bash This output I saved into a file named WHO.log Now how to convert this output into CSV format so that I can export it into some database, using some bash script?
