A couple notes: When a parameter has constrained support, you should declare that in the parameters block. For example, the variance must be positive. When you don't declare that, your sampler will select negative variance, try it, and reject. This wastes time. Fixing that issue alone increased the walltime to run the model immensely, even if it didn't fix the other issues. The model isn't identified when there's no prior on sigma. This is covered in any Bayesian statistics text -- the posterior is improper. Put any proper prior sigma, and this will fix identify that portion of the model. Constraining c and d likewise improves the model. I just bounded them between 0 and 100, but any plausible range will do fine. But really what you need here is a hierarchical model that puts some nonuniform probability on c and d, since even under the uniform model, some movement in one can be offset by movement in another. This is another identification question and is addressed in the stan users guide. The revised model achieves $\hat{R} library(rstan) set.seed(100) x b; real sig; real c; real d; } model { y ~ normal(a + b * x, sig); b ~ gamma(c, d); sig ~ normal(0,1); } " fit
