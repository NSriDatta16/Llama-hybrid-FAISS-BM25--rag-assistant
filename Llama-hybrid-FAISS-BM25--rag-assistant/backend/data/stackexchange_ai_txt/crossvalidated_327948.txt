I could not comment so add an answer instead. Within Cross Validated, there are already excellent discussions about this topic. For a solid understanding of basics of neural networks, I would recommend the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen. For your question, logistic regression for binary classification can be viewed as a special structure of neural networks, it's a sigmoid transformation of linear combination of input vector with a decision boundary. A neural network itself as a whole is an approximator for the data, and true, each node's output can be regarded a function of its forward pass, otherwise the backpropagation wouldn't be possible. But I think it is not accurate to say each node as a function approximates input data. My understanding is that each node extracts certain information out of input data such that a proper network structure could approximate the mapping between input and output.
