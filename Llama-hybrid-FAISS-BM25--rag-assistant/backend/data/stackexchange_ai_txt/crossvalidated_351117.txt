likelihood of machine learning model with continuous data must be zero?

Unlike the discrete case, the probability of any particular point in a continuous probability is zero. We must integrate over a small range of the pdf to bring a non-zero value. In a machine learning model that assumes continuous data (as is oftend done for sound or images), the probability of any particular training data is zero. Some models (such as variational inference models) are evaluated by their log likelihood. My question: if the data is continuous, how can the likelihood be non-zero? The likelihood is assumed to factor over the data points, and the probability of each data point is zero, ...
