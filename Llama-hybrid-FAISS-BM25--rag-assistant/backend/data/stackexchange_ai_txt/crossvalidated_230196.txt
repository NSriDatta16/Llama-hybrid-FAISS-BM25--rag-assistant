You seem to have two different questions here. (1) Is this approach valid? Yes - you will have two variables for each sample and that will be used to predict your output. Assuming you are correct that A1 and A2 measure similar things and B1 and B2 measure similar things, your resulting model should be good (assuming, of course, you use the right model, there is a relationship between A, B, and Y, etc...). (2) Will it capture any relationship between A and B? Your dimensionality reduction procedure will not capture any relationship between A and B. However, this is not necessarily a problem. If $A$ and $B$ are correlated, you might have to deal with problems that come from having correlated features, but this is a different problem, not a result or your procedure.
