Here's what you can do, you have 2 options: select * FROM users u LEFT JOIN organizations o ON (u.idorg = o.id); This way you will get extra data on each row - full organization info you don't really need. Or you can do: select o.*, group_concat(u.name) FROM users u LEFT JOIN organizations o ON (u.idorg = o.id) GROUP BY o.id http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_group-concat The second approach is applicable if you want to see ie. list of usernames "user1, user2, user3", but don't want to operate on the fields themselves...
