Calculation of Weights in Locally Weighed Regression

In Andrew Ng's lectures he introduces Locally Weighted Linear Regression (page 15) for which he describes the weight as: $$ \begin{align} w^{(i)} = exp\Big(-\frac{(x^{(i)} - x)^2}{2 \tau^2}\Big) \end{align} $$ However in the problem assignment for Locally Weighted Logistic Regression, the weight is described as: $$ \begin{align} w^{(i)} = exp\Big(-\frac{||x^{(i)} - x||^2}{2 \tau^2}\Big) \end{align} $$ where $x^{(i)}$ had dimensions $1 \times n$ and $x$ has dimensions $m \times n$. Looking at the solution set, it seems that they first get the difference between $x$ and $x^{(i)}$ (giving an $m \times n$ matrix) followed by element-by-element squaring (using the Matlab/Octave .^2 operator), and then sum along the rows to give a $m \times 1$ vector. In the linear algebra review notes (pages 7-8), multiple types of norms are described, but the sequence of operations performed doesn't seem to be consistent with any of the descriptions of norms. What is going on here?
