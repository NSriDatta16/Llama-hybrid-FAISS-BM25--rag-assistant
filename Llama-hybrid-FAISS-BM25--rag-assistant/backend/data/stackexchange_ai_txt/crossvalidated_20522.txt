In PCA, we attempt to "concisely" explain the variation in POSSIBLY CORRELATED data using principal components which are pairwise orthogonal to each other. The variation in data is represented by the variance-covariance matrix. On the other hand, a jaccard index is a similarity coefficient. Similarity and correlation are pretty different concepts. According to your description, if we take a matrix of Jaccard indices, the eigenvectors will be orthogonal to each other-that is fine: but will we be in a position to say what fraction of variation is explained by a given $"Jaccard PC"$, so to speak? In case of regular PC, we can surely say what fraction of the variation in data is represented by a given PCA, which is nothing but the ratio of corresponding eigenvalue and sum of all eigenvalues. To summarize, the fundamentally different concepts in jaccard index makes it not sensible for use in PCA.
