You can look at this as binomial proportions. I.e. proportion of correctly identified cases out of the ones that should be identified. So you could use all the theory for estimates (and confidence intervals) for sparse binomial data. One reasonable approach could be to assume a Beta(1/3, 1/3) (or a Beta(1/2, 1/2) or Beta(1,1) or something based on actual prior knowledge) prior and do a Bayesian analysis. Admittedly, in your case, you essentially have absolutely no data about sensitivity, so your posterior distribution would just be your prior. Once you have low numbers and just one of them being zero, this approach starts to be more interesting.
