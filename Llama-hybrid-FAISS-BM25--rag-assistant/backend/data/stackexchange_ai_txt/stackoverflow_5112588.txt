How make the same animation like UITableView reorder of cells?

I have a drag&drop operation between 2 UITableViews . The cell could be reordered in the source TableView, or move to another TableView. Because I need to move the cell between the two, I can't use the default reorder support. However, I want to make a similar animation like when the cell is moving around and the cell below them slide out. Any hint in how do this animation? UPDATE: You can see what exactly I'm looking for in the pulse app .
