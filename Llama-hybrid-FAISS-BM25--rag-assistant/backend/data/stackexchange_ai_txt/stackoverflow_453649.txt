That's a difficult question. I guess it would depend on exactly what you're doing. If you're building DALs and stuff, it would probably be easier to use VS, since there's some nice integration (drag-and-drop, etc.). VS is probably adequate for 95% of your daily db activity. But as someone already mentioned, you don't get the "Script As" helpers (which I use all of the time). You also won't get much (if anything) in the way of user management tools (logons, etc.). And as far as I know, there is no way to manage indexes via Visual Studio. You don't get anything with regard to importing/exporting data either.
