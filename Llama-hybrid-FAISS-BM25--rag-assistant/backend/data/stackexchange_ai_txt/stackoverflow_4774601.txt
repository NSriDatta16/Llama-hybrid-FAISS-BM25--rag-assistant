Well, after read @tadman and a bunch of answers I have received in the spanish ror mailing list [1] I have collected a few hot tips when you have to deal with Ruby deserializing and class loading in Rails: Super fast solution Use config.cache_classes = true in your development.rb but you will lost the class auto-refreshing. Better solution Require all the classes that are gonna be deserialized but not with require but with require_dependency [2] so in development environment the class auto-refreshing will remain working. Elegant solution Monkey-patch the YAML and the Marshal gem to tell them to call require_dependency when they find a non-defined class to deserialize. And @Xavi has sent me a proposition of monkey-patch Marshal (he says he wrote it on the air and it is not tested so use it in your own risk) [3] [1] http://lists.simplelogica.net/pipermail/ror-es/2011-January/024787.html [2] http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveSupport/Dependencies/Loadable/require_dependency [3] http://lists.simplelogica.net/pipermail/ror-es/2011-January/024796.html
