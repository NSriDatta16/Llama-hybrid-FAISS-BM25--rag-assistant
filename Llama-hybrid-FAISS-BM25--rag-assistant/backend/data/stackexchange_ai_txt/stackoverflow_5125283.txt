Simulating drags inside a scrollview

:) I am working on intercepting, and resending gestures sent to a scrollview. What I want to do: Kill all gestureRecognizers in the scrollview. I have accomplished this. Add new gestureRecognizers in the scrollview. I have accomplished this as well. Make the new recognizers behave the same as the old ones. I have NOT accomplished this, and I need help doing so. The only new recognizer I have added is a pan gesture recognizer, which requires at least two fingers. I want this to behave exactly as a one finger scroll. :) What kind of calls must I send when responding to the callbacks generated by the new recognizer to accomplish this?
