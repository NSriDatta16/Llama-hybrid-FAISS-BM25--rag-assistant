When you do for category in site.categories , category[0] will give you the category name, category[1] will give you the list of posts for that category. That's the way Liquid handles iteration over hashes, I believe. So the code you are looking for is this one: {% for category in site.categories %} {{ category[0] }} {% for post in category[1] %} {{ post.title }} {% endfor %} &#8617; {% endfor %} I've taken the liberty of fixing some markup issues - I've added ... around the post link list, a around the last link, a semi-colon after the 8617 , and also fixed the id at the top (was missing the -ref part). Regards!
