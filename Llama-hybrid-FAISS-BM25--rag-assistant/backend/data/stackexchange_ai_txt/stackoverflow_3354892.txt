The SAX API does not guarantee that any given text node will be delivered in one piece. It is permitted to break it up into multiple calls to the characters() method. Your application has to accommodate this possibly, and reassemble the pieces itself. Incidentally, Nation Created Our World & everything in it is not a valid XML text fragment, it would have to be Nation Created Our World &amp; everything in it . In this case the SAX parser may be breaking it up into Nation Created Our World , &amp; and everything in it , and your app is only remembering the last one.
