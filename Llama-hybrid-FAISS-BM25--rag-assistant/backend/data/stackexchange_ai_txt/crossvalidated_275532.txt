It seems that degree is entered into the model as an interval variable, while it is an ordered categorical one, and needs to be treated as one. The simplest way is to transform it into a Factor ( as.factor(degree) ). Without this transformation, the interpretation means that each increase in one(1) unit of degree will increase the odds of being married (if that is the dependent variable) by a factor of 1.108, for men, holding the other variables constant. You shouldn't interpret MA like this though. This would have been OK only if this was a count or continuous variable. What the coefficient means now, is the average difference in odds between each category pairs, but without set intervals, the model assumes that the interval is 1 (0-to-1, 1-to-2, etc..).
