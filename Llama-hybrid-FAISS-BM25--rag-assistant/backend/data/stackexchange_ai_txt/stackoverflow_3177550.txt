I think it'd be more elegant to use foreach: foreach data as item { if (item == "title") { echo "Skipping title "; } } How you have it now, you are checking if (data[0] == "title") every time you loop. data[0] will always equal "title", so it will always evaluate to true. You could increment an $index variable and do something like if (data[$index] == $title) then $index++ near the bottom of the loop, but why do that when foreach will essentially do that for you.
