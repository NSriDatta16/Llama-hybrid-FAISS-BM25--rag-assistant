XJC generated namespaces

I am trying to generate java source files from a package of *.xsd files using the xjc code generation tool. The namespaces used in those *.xsd files are as follows: http://www.domain.com/foo/bar.x http://www.domain.com/foo/bar.x.y http://www.domain.com/foo/bar.x.y.z XJC produces packages as follows: com.domain.foo.bar.x and places generated java files from "...x" and "...x.y" xsd namespaces there com.domain.foo.bar.x_y and places generated java files from "...x.y.z" xsd namespaces there What I would like to achieve here is proper: com.domain.foo.bar.x com.domain.foo.bar.x.y com.domain.foo.bar.x.y.z package names Is this somehow possible? Maybe using custom JAXB bindings? I've studied jaxb custom binding docs but I am not sure if it's possible. Basically I would like xjc to treat both "/" and "." as package separators. Any help appreciated. Adalbert
