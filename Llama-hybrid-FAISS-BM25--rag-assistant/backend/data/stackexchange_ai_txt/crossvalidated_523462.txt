The one that earns more money, although I’m not sure if profit margin is the best metric in here as it depends on factors not related to the model. For example, say that one model recommends expensive products, that have high production costs etc, like cars, another model recommends paperclips, with very low production costs etc. I personally would prefer to sell a car, even if I only got a small percentage of the selling price, than a paperclip, even if I could get nearly 100% of the selling price for myself. Another problem is the Goodhart’s Law . If you optimize for profit margin you may end up with recommending only the items with low taxes. If you optimized for money that you earned, you may end up with recommending only the expensive items. In general, using business metrics for evaluation is a good idea, but it is worth to consider consequences. For example, if you only recommend expensive items, you may discourage part of your customers from your website. “But we earned more money.” Yes, though in short run. What if those consumers bought a single expensive product and never came back vs customers that buy less expensive, but regularly? Picking metrics is a tricky business.
