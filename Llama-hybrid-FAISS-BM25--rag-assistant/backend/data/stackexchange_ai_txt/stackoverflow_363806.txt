An additional bit of information I was able to find. StarTeam does not always disconnect a user (or agent in the case of CruiseControl accesses), and can result in having dozens of open connections/logins for the same user/agent. Unfortunately, it is very hard to confirm if this is a related issue because I cannot reliably overload the server. We are using an older version of StarTeam that does not have MPX. I wonder if anyone has experience using StarTeam on a different continuous integration environment that supports the MPX method.
