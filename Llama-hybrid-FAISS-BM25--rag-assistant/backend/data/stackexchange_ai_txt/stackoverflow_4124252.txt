Alright, here is the answer: I had to add the following commands: #pragma (lib, "freeglut_static.lib") #pragma (lib, "gltools.lib") after putting in the library path of the needed files in the Project Directories. After that I also needed to include glut32.dll in my Solution directory (as I had also linked to Glut32), and then it worked. Hope this helps someone!
