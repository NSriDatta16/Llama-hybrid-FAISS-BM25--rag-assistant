Here is a lateral solution:- This provides the same visual appearance of a vibrant rectangle in a washed out image. The apparent rectangle can be manipulated by modifying the BorderThickness property. Events from this rectangle can be trapped on the Border because a Transparent background has been added so it can be dragged about for example. Other content could be added to internals of the Border , for example a Grid of transparent rectangles could provide some sizing features. The accepted answer here is significantly more complex by comparison albeit a more direct answer to your actual question.
