How to make these rails routs

I'm trying to make some routes to view and manage missions in an app. The missions belong to organizations. My idea is to do something like this: organizations/1/missons #(index) list of missions of the organization organizations/1/missions/1 #show a mission that belongs to an organization organizations/1/admin/missions #list of missions in a new view that has the commands to admin the missions organizations/1/admin/missions/1/edit #edit the mission organizations/1/admin/missions/1/destroy #destroy the mission missions #all missions of all organizations missions/1 #show mission page I don't really know if this is a good way to rout a system like this or if it's overkill in a way. For now I have the standard routing working: resources :organizations do resources :missions end But I wish to have some more views. What's the best way to route this, and how many controllers to keep them lean and with few actions?
