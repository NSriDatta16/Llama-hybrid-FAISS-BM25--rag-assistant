Since it's a solid color, I'd avoid using an image at all and use an RGBA color: http://24ways.org/2009/working-with-rgba-colour As for IE, you don't say which version, but IE6 and IE7 both have very wonky support for alpha transparency in PNG files. There are a variety of methods to get them working, though most still have trouble repeating as backgrounds. You could try, instead of repeating a small image, just using one larger image. Or, be pragmatic. Use the RGBA and just let IE degrade into a solid color. We need to stop babying IE users ;)
