I haven't played around with embedding Google Maps before (I generally go straight to the API for stuff like this). I tried a couple of approaches: I figured maybe the embed syntax would be the same as the static maps api. So I grabbed a static maps URL, copied the markers param from that and tried sticking it into the iFrame URL. This didn't work so much. I created a Google MyPlaces and customized the marker to use the one your provided. This created a Test map which had the appropriate marker icon. I then grabbed the embed code and stuck it on a test page and voila!
