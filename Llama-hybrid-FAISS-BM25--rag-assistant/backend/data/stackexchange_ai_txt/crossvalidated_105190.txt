Extracting decision function variable from libsvm

I'm trying to use LIBSVM's single class SVMs for some classification and need to extract the following sum post classification (i.e. the variable that the decision function takes in) $$ \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i K(z,z_i) $$ I'm not too sure on this so I just want to check that I have the right idea, but could I calculate the sum just by using the primal variable $\textbf{w}$? So for a libsvm model $m$ I just call w = (m.SVs)'*(m.coef); and then calculate $\textbf{w}^T \textbf{z}$, where $\textbf{z}$ is the feature vector of what I'd like to classify. I'm not sure though, I guess it may just be easier calculating the kernel function explicitly, but if anyone knows of a good way to access the info in libsvm I would be very grateful
