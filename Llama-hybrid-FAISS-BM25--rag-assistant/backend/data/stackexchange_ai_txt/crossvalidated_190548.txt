Probabilities of betting odds not adding up to 1

I am currently studying logistic regression. So the Probability(p(x)) of assigning an outcome is calculated as : $\frac{p}{1-p} = e^{\beta_0 +\beta_1X} $ Further, I read that the fraction on the left is also called odds, frequently used in betting references. So I went to a betting website, here were the odds given by them for a football match. Chelsea vs West Brom ( Win Draw Win : 1.5, 4, 7.5) Now I understand that they would have used a program to come up the odds. But I figured that using the odds, I should be able to calculate the probabilities, that their software is assigning to each of the outcome. When doing the calculations : I got 0.4 prob of Chelseas win, 0.2 of Draw and 0.11 chance of West Brom Win. Why is this not adding up to 1?
