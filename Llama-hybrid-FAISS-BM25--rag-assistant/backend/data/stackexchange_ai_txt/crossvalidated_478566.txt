There is very little context in names y x1 x2 x3 x4 except that Site and your choice of language and command leads me to a guess that this is ecological data. This isn't really much more than a comment, but the graphs won't fit in any such. Referring to a Poisson distribution leads me to a Poisson fit of y on x3 , graphed here, which does turn in a P-value of 0.010, stronger than I would have guessed from the graph itself. The fitted relation is an exponential and in this case approximately straight over the range of the data. Naturally this fit says nothing about the other predictors, data on which are not accessible at the moment. A graph separating the sites surely needs your subject-matter knowledge for interpretation, but it doesn't do much to help me. Some sites seem more heterogeneous than others, so what else is new? This is the kind of armchair comment that is disappointing if not annoying, especially if your dataset in fact needed long and difficult hours to produce it: However, even with 36 data points rather than 20 as I guessed wildly, this is a rather small dataset to be fitting a complicated model. People closer to your field should be able to say more if they were told what your variables really are. The full dataset or a printout of fuller model results might also allow more to be said. I used Stata for the graphs, but they are, or should be, mundane in any language or environment worth attention.
