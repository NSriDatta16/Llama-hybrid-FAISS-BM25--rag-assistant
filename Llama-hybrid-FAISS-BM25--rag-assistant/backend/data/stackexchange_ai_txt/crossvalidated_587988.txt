What is the distribution of this ratio?

Suppose $X\sim F(n_1,n_2)$ , then, what is the distribution of $Y=\log \frac {\exp(X)}{X}$ ? I don't even have a clue about this distribution. Any helpful suggestions and answers are greatly appreciated! Following Christoph Hanck's suggestion, I got the answer. Note that $Y=X-\log X \in [1,\inf)$ . The CDF of $Y$ is $$ F(y)=\mathbb{P}(X-\log X \leq y) $$ Since $f(x)=x-\log x$ monotically increases from $(1,\infty)$ and monotically decreases from $(0,1)$ . Then, we derive the range indicated by $X-\log X \leq y$ . For $$ x-\log x=y $$ we can equivalently obtain $$ -xe^{-x}=-e^{-y} $$ Since $-\frac 1 e\leq-e^{-y} , from the wiki page w.r.t. the Lambert $W$ function , we deduce that there are two roots (as expected). Finally, we have two roots $$ x_1=W_{-1}(-e^{-y})\\x_2=W_{0}(-e^{-y}) $$ Then, \begin{align} F(y)&=\mathbb{P}(W_{-1}(-e^{-y}) \geq X \leq W_{0}(-e^{-y}) )\\ &=\int_{W_{-1}(-e^{-y})}^{W_{0}(-e^{-y})} f_X(x)dx \end{align} and \begin{align} f(y)&=\frac{\partial F(y)}{\partial y}\\ &=f_X\left[ W_{0}(-e^{-y})\right] \frac{\partial W_{0}(-e^{-y})}{\partial y}+f_X\left[ W_{-1}(-e^{-y})\right] \frac{\partial W_{-1}(-e^{-y})}{\partial y} \end{align} Thanks for the suggestion from @Xi'an. A more tractable solution can be found from wiki page
