Grails, when it's run in dev mode, provides a whole host of environment properties to its Gant scripts and the app in turn, including basedir. Take a look at the grails.bat or grails.sh script and you will find these lines: Unix: -Dbase.dir="." \ Windows: set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dbase.dir="." When these scripts start your environment in dev mode you get these thrown in for free. When you take the WAR and deploy you no longer use these scripts and therefore you need to solve the problem another way; you can either Specify the property yourself to the startup script for the app server, eg: -Dbase.dir=./some/dir .. however ... it usually makes more sense to use the Grails Config object which allows for per-environment properties
