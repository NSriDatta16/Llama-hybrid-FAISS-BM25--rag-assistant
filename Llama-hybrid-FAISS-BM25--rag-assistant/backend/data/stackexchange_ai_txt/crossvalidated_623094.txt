My CNN seems to reach a certain loss threshold, then stops learning from there

I wasn't sure how to phrase this question, but yeah. My CNN ( code here ) keeps getting up to an accuracy of around 66% until it stops learning anymore. It just keeps fluctuating around the 66% range. I've been tuning hyper-parameters, but I just can't get it to work. Can anyone help?
