This is not evident from the code: did you persist event2 by calling save() ? Get will try to retrieve it from the persistent storage (the in-memory database for example) and if the event wasn't saved, the retrieved instance will be null. If you did save it, did the save go through OK? Calling event.save() will return false if there was something wrong while saving the item (like a validation error). Lastly, you might try calling event.save(flush:true) in case the Hibernate session doesn't handle this case as you might expect (I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it can't hurt to try).
