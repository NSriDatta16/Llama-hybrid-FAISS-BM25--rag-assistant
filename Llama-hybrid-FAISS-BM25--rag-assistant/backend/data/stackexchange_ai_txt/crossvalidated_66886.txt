What is the sampling distribution of a sum of scores?

Can you help me understand, or refer me to a source about, what is the sampling distribution of the sum of scores? I know how to get the sampling distribution of the mean to construct a t-test, etc. More specifically how does the variability of the sampling distribution of sums of scores relates to the variability of the underlying variable in the population. e.g. People pass sand bags to each other. I measure the total time for a sample of n=10 people to pass the bag, and calculate an average. If I repeat this sampling I will have a standard deviation of the sample mean, and then I can calculate the variability in the population. Assuming a relatively normal process, even though I am measuring time, etc. The problem is if I measure the same sample of 10 people passing bags every time. The samples are related. Any advice?
