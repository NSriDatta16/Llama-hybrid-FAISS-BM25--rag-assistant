For the binary case (both treatment and instrument) estimating the local average treatment effect (LATE) is straightforward, and you can estimate it as $$E(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}|D_{i0}=0, D_{i1}=1) = \frac{E[Y_i|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i|Z_i=0]}{P[D_i=1|Z_i = 1] - P[D_i=1|Z_i = 0]} $$ So how does this compare to the multivalued instrument case: first of all, the conditions for identification of a LATE are very similar to the binary case. One additional requirement is strict monotonicity. Suppose your $Z_i$ has a finite support and takes values from $0,...,J$, and you have a binary, endogenous treatment $D_i$, then the requirement on the first stage is $$P(D_i = 1|Z_i = j) > P(D_i = 1|Z_i = j-1)$$ so the higher your value of the instrument the higher is the probability that you get treated. Also suppose that individuals with the lowest value of the instrument have $D_{i0}=0$ and conversely those with the highest value have $D_{iJ} = 1$. What your instrumental variables estimator will give you in this case is a weighted average of Wald ratios, $$E(Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}|D_{i0}=0,D_{iJ}=1) = \sum^J_{j=1}\mu_j \cdot \text{wald}_{j,j-1} $$ where $$\text{wald}_{j,j-1} = \frac{E[Y_i|Z_i = j] - E[Y_i|Z_i = j-1]}{P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j] - P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j-1]}$$ and $$\mu_j = \frac{P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j] - P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j-1]}{\sum^J_{j=1}P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j] - P[D_i = 1|Z_i = j-1]} $$ are the weights which sum to one. So you do lots of pairwise comparisons between the $J$ subgroups of individuals where you always compare group $j$ with group $j-1$, which is why the above stated monotonicity condition is needed. The proof for all of this is rather lengthy and annoying so I would like to avoid it but from the statement you already see why multivalued instruments are not necessarily well liked because they are hard to interpret. That's because the average treatment effect you estimate here is the average of treatment effects in each of the $J$ subgroups of compliers. A critical discussion of the LATE framework in general is given by Deaton (2009) and Heckman and Urzua (2009) with a response by Guido Imbens [link] . Another discussion regards whether discretizing even highly continuous instruments rather than estimating a weighted average of Wald ratios is better (in the sense of being less biased) but I haven't seen any paper which would settle this debate. Nonetheless I hope this helps to clear up for you what you are getting into when you use multivalued instruments in the LATE framework.
