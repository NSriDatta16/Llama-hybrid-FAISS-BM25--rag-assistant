+1 to Jon. Well put. I've found a lot of value in structuring my tests in a more BDD style. That is... reject the fixture-per-class mindset, instead go for fixture-per-context. I also found that RhinoMocks 3.5's AAA syntax is much nicer. Those cover organization and clean/readable tests. To make my tests less brittle I've started to pull back on mocking. Mock frameworks are crucial for stubbing out dependencies, but the more you mock the more the test knows about the implementation. If the implementation changes (but behavior doesn't) then your tests shouldn't break.
