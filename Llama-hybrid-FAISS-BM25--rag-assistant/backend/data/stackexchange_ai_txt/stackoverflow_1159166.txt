Understanding Classes

I'm new to programming and have some questions about classes. I'll use Karel as an example: public class Karel extends robot{ .... } then I extend Karel: public class SuperKarel extends Karel{ .... } but then I want to organize some groups of methods: public class KarelJumps extends SuperKarel { .... } public class KarelColor extends SuperKarel { .... } But then if I want to make Karel jump I have to create an instance of KarelJumps rather the SuperKarel . But because KarelJumps is a different object then KarelColor I couldn't use any of its methods. So would I just put all of the KarelJumps and KarelColor methods inside SuperKarel? Do I just make one large object?
