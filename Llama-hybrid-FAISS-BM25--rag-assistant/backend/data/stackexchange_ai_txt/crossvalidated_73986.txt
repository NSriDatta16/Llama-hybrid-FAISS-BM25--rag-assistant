On a related note, you can accomplish the same objective if your ARIMA model has external regressors. This has been helpful for me on occasion. For instance, say your first model was created as follows: fit.arimax Then suppose that after creating your model, you observe additional values in your response and external regression variables, and would like to forecast or simulate future outcomes given these new observations. E.g., say you are predicting electricity demand, and you observe another hour of demand (i.e. response) and temperature (i.e. external regression) data. Then, you may fit the original model to the updated time series as follows, where response.new and xreg.new are your updated response and regression variables. fit.arimax.new You can use this new model to forecast or simulate future outcomes, conditional on all observed data. Note that you must provide forecast external regressors for each. E.g., forecast.Arima(fit.arimax.new, h=length(xreg.forecast), xreg=xreg.forecast) simulate.Arima(fit.arimax.new, n=length(xreg.forecast), xreg=xreg.forecast) Another way to accomplish all of this is to make an entirely new model using the updated data. But the method described above is appropriate in real-time applications, in which case fitting a new ARIMA model would take too long.
