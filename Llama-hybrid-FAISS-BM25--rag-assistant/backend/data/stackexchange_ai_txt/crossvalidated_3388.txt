Logistic regression is a pretty flexible method. It can readily use as independent variables categorical variables. Most software that use Logistic regression should let you use categorical variables. As an example, let's say one of your categorical variable is temperature defined into three categories: cold/mild/hot. As you suggest you could interpret that as three separate dummy variables each with a value of 1 or 0. But, the software should let you use a single categorical variable instead with text value cold/mild/hot. And, the logit regression would derive coefficient (or constant) for each of the three temperature conditions. If one is not significant, the software or the user could readily take it out (after observing t stat and p value). The main benefit of grouping categorical variable categories into a single categorical variable is model efficiency. A single column in your model can handle as many categories as needed for a single categorical variable. If instead, you use a dummy variable for each categories of a categorical variable your model can quickly grow to have numerous columns that are superfluous given the mentioned alternative.
