Personally I am a "pragmatist" rather than a "frequentist" or a "Bayesian", so I cannot claim to speak for any camp. That said, I think the distinction you are alluding to is probably not so much MLE vs. MAP, but between point estimates vs. estimating posterior PDFs . As a scientist working in a field with sparse data and large uncertainties, I can sympathize with not wanting to put too much confidence on "best guess" results which may be misleading, resulting in overconfidence. A related practical distinction is between parametric vs. non-parametric methods. So for example I think that both Kalman filtering and Particle filtering would be accepted as Recursive Bayesian Estimation . But the Gaussian assumption of Kalman filtering (a parametric method) can give very misleading results if the posterior is not unimodal. To me these kinds of engineering examples highlight where differences are neither philosophical nor mathematical, but manifest in terms of practical results (i.e. will your autonomous vehicle crash?). For the Bayesian enthusiasts I am familiar with, this "see what works" engineering-style attitude seems to be predominant ... not sure if this is true more broadly.
