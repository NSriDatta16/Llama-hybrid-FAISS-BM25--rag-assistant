Multiple SVN users with the same login credentials on a Unix machine

Here's our usecase for small projectets that rarely require attention from multiple developers at the same time: Projects are on a shared Ubuntu dev server Shared office account used to access the actual dev server Developers have their own SVN user credentials User A) checks out the project and does a few commits User B) works on the same project few days later, but his commits are pushed to the repository with the credentials of the first committer. How could we easily swap who the "committer" is on our dev box? Something like svn ci file --user "foo" -m "fixed stuff"? Googling for the issue gives me multiple hits which aren't exactly about what I'm trying. Maybe I'm misusing SVN if I thought this should be possible, since from most sources I find that I'd have to run relocate commands and edit configuration files, which is not feasible.
