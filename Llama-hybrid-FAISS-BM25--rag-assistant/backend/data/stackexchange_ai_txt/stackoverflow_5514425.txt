CronTrigger would indeed serve your purpose better, as you can use its setTimeZone method to define which timezone will be used when resolving the trigger's CronExpression . And no, the scheduled time and system time do not need to be on the same timezone. So, it should certainly work. (Of course, pay attention to the notes about daylight savings and crontriggers in the documentation you linked to.)
