Node.js is a (really nice) programming model that's leveraging the great suitability of Javascript for asynchronous programming for implementing asynchronous web apps. The principle is very similar to the asynchronous programming model on Windows and especially in .NET (WCF supports this quite well) where all work is done on callbacks invoked by I/O threads and the app never locks a thread. Node.js creates a stringent JS programming model around this foundational mechanism to allow better scaling apps. So contrary to what a few folks here are saying, Node.js is quite exactly at the same layer/level as WCF. From a protocol perspective a Node.js implementation will likely always sit between the app and the HTTP listener provided by the underlying HTTP infra.
