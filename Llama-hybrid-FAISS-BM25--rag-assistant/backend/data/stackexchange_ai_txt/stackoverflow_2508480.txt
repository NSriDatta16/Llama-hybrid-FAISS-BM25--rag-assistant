ruby one line "check value and return"

I'm digging through some interesting code which I'm convinced is wrong. I wondered whether anyone had a thought as to the syntax the developer was trying to use? Heres' the bogus code: render :nothing => true and return if params[:name].nil? My naive fix alludes to my programming language background: if params[:name].nil? render :nothing => true, :status => 404 return end Is there a more elegant, more ruby-like way? (semicolons don't count :)
