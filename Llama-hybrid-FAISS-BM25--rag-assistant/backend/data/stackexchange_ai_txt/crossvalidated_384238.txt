What does the author mean in this description about "mean"?

I am reading the book "Intuitive Introductory Statistics" and it has the below paragraph about the mean which I don't understand. For example if you take a series 1,2,3,100 and calculate the mean, it would be 26.5. How are values less than 26.5 equally balancing values greater than 26.5? If we interpret the visual center of a data collection to be the balance point where data values larger than the center are equally balanced by those that are smaller than the center, the numerical average or mean is a natural statistic for identifying and measuring the center. This is the case, for example, when our interpretation of the ‘visual center’ corresponds to a value for which the numerical contribution from data points that are greater than the ‘center’ is equally balanced by the numerical contribution from those that are less than it. In such settings, the appropriate statistic to measure this ‘visual center’ is naturally the average, or mean, of the collected observations.
