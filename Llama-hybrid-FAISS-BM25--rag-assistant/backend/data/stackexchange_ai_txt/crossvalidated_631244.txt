Is r2 train= 0.977 and r2 test = 0.941 overfitting for a machine laerning regresssion model?

I'm tuning the hyperparameters for different Machine Learning models with Optuna package. For ExtraTreesRegressor I got r2 train = 0.938, r2 test = 0.922 and RMSE test = 0.907. In this case the average 5-fold CV on training data was 0.924. But for HistGradientBoostingRegressor I got r2 train= 0.977, r2 test = 0.941 and RMSE test= 0.793. and average 5-fold CV on training data was 0.919. I'm wondering if the latter model overfit and which model is preferred in this situation?
