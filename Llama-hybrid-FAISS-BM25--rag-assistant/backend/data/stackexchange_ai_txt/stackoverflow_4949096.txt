comparing the old values vs new value and update

NOTE: i havent implement the above solution but closing this question and accepting this as answer even thou i havent implement. what is the best way of doing? and i know that i can store the repeater in a different var and compare but i just wanted to know the elegant way of doing. here is my for loop code that i want to compare and update the values that have changed and ignore the values that have not changed GridViewRow row = gv.SelectedRow; Repeater _rpt = gv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[8].FindControl("rptReg") as Repeater; Repeater _rpt1 = gv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[9].FindControl("rptVisitor") as Repeater; for (int i = 0; i i) TextBox _txt3 = _rpt1.Items[i].FindControl("txtVisitor") as TextBox; //update db } }
