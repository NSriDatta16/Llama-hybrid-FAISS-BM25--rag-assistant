You could do this progressively. For example, you could cluster embedding and try to classify ethnicity, gender and age. Then you only need to search for people in that ethnicity, gender and age. Similar procedures to reduce the search region. Just by gender, you already reduce your number of comparisons by half, age can help you separate it in (say you use 10 years) about 11 parts (which will be of different size, but still a nice improvement), you can reduce it further by separating by ethnicity. Demographics of the world (Wikipedia) Age: According to the 2006 CIA World Factbook, around 27% of the world's population is below 15 years of age. 0–14 years: 26.3% (male 944,987,919/female 884,268,378) 1 15–64 years: 65.9% (male 2,234,860,865/female 2,187,838,153) 1 65 years and over: 7.9% (male 227,164,176/female 289,048,221) (2011 est.) 1 Gender: This can be approximated by half/half distribution Ethnicity: The largest ethnicity is Han (Sino-Tibetan -> Chinese) with 1.3 billions of members So, for the worst case, with a 15-64 years world person, male or female, from Han ethnic group you have $$ 1.3 \times 10^9 \times 0.5 \times 65.9\% = 428.35 \times 10^6 \text{ people} $$ Using your time estimate of $15 \mu s$ we have: $$ 15 \times 10^{-6} \times 428.35 \times 10^6 = 1.78 \text{ hours} $$ The second worst case would be Arabs of the same age, which would take about $ 37 \text{ minutes}$ and for UK it would take about $ 18 \text{ minutes}$ This is still a slow procedure, but you can probably find clusters inside this large groups to reduce the search time even further. I suppose it is viable to separate age 15-64 into at least 3 groups. If this can be done
