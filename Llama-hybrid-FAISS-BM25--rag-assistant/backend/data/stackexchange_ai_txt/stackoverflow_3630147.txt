Per your own link , posted David Thomas answers it: On a tangent, it might be worth adding a to your table with the following css thead {display: table-header-group; } so as to print the table-header on all subsequent pages (useful for loooooong data tables). â€“ David Thomas Nov 19 '09 at 14:38 Whats wrong with that solution? Does it not fit the bill? About table-header-group : table-header-group (In HTML: THEAD) Like 'table-row-group', but for visual formatting, the row group is always displayed before all other rows and row groups and after any top captions. Print user agents may repeat header rows on each page spanned by a table. If a table contains multiple elements with 'display: table-header-group', only the first is rendered as a header; the others are treated as if they had 'display: table-row-group'.
