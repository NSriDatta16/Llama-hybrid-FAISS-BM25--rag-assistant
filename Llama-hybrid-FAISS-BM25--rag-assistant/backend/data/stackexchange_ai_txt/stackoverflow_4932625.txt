Are relationship tables really needed?

Relationship tables mostly contain two columns: IDTABLE1 , and IDTABLE2 . Only thing that seems to change between relationship tables is the names of those two columns, and table name. Would it be better if we create one table Relationships and in this table we place 3 columns: TABLE_NAME , IDTABLE1 , IDTABLE2 , and then use this table for all relationships? Is this a good/acceptable solution in web/desktop application development? What would be downside of this? Note: Thank you all for feedback. I appreciate it. But, I think you are taking it a bit too far... Every solution works until one point. As data storage simple text file is good till certain point, than excel is better, than MS Access, than SQL Server, than... To be honest, I haven't seen any argument that states why this solution is bad for small projects (with DB size of few GB).
