How to make a Facebook "Like" button that is just a link, not an iFrame?

I would like to put a "Like" button into an email message that it going out to our e-newsletter subscribers. The usual way of embedding a Like button, which uses, an iframe technique, is not going to work. What I would like to do is to have a static hyperlink, where clicking on the button image will just go to a particular URL that is our corresponding Facebook page, and do the action of becoming a fan. Can anybody figured out an official or unofficial kind of URL that one could link to that takes you to the page on Facebook and performs the appropriate action?
