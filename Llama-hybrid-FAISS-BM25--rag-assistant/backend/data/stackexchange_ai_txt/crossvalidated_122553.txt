Posterior mode estimator unchanged under coordinate transformation?

I'm looking at a data set where the posterior mode has noticeably less "bias" than the posterior mean and posterior median, and somewhat less error. However, the posterior mode is not invariant under coordinate transformation. So, I was considering reporting the mode of the posterior/prior. This should be invariant under coordinate transformations. Is there an approach that fits better with Bayesian philosophical leanings? Unlike the median and the mean, this doesn't seem to be based on minimizing a posterior risk. But it does look kind of like a Bayes factor. Also, is there a name for this kind of thing? -BenRI
