Force applicationCache to reload cached files

I'm using the HTML5 applicationCache to store many Javascript, CSS, image, etc. files for a page. If I update one of those files, the browser never reloads it. I have tried the following: Calling applicationCache.update() on page load Listening for applicationCache's updateready event, and calling swapCache() and window.location.reload() Adding a timestamp comment to the manifest file itself to force the browser to realize the manifest has changed Surely this can't be this hard. How do I convince the browser to re-request some cached file?
