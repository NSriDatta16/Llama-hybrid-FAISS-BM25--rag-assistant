I would try to avoid embedding the data directly into SQL to start with. Use a sequence of prepared statements with parameters, and set those parameters to the values (without formatting them). That's safer and is likely to be a lot more efficient. Whether you can still do this in a batch rather than in several separate calls just within the same transaction, I'm not sure.
