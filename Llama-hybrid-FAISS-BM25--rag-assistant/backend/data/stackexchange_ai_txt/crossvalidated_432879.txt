It is not clear to me what you are trying to do, or why. Maybe I can say something useful anyhow. First, if $X \sim \mathsf{Unif}(-3, 3)$ and you seek $P(X then you can do the exact computation easily in R (or, in this particular case, with simple arithmetic): punif(0.44, -3, 3) [1] 0.5733333 (.44 + 3)/6 [1] 0.5733333 If somehow you are able to take many samples of size $n = 100$ from the same unknown population and you want to know the percentage of the population below 44, you can average the results from many such samples to get 0.1958 as a good approximation. set.seed(1023) b.44 = replicate(10^5, mean(rnorm(100, 50, 7) Here we are pretending you don't know the population distribution. But if you did, you'd know that this probability is exactly 0.1957, to four places. pnorm(44, 50, 7) [1] 0.195683
