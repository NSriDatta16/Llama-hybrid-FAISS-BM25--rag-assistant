Why and When Do We Need Standardization for Machine Learning

When and why do we need standardization for machine learning? What's the benefit for doing so? For example, we replace $y_i$ with $(y_i - u_y)/ \sigma _y $ we also replace $x_i$ with $x_ij - u_j / \sigma_j$ It would be great if someone provides me some intuitions.
