If you are spawning a child-process, it is quite hard and you'd probably need to use each browser's specific API (it won't be the same between FF and IE, for example). It doesn't help that in many cases the exe detects an existing instance and forwards the request there (so you can't trust the exit-code, since the page hasn't even been requested in the right exe yet). Personally, I try to avoid assuming any particular browser for this scenario; just launch the url: Process.Start("http://somesite.com"); This will use the user's default browser. You have to hope it appears though - you can't (reliably and robustly) check that externally without lots of work. One other option is to read the data yourself ( WebClient.Download* ) - but this may have issues with complex cookies, login, user-agent awareness, etc.
