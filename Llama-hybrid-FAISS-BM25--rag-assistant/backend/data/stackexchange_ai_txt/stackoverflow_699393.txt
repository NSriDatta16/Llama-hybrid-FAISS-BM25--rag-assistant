That seems to be a silly database design, and it's going to cause you more problems than just this. If all the data are the same, then they should be in a single table. Whether you partition the physical storage of that single table is a low-level implementation issue, not somthing that should show up in the schema. I don't even know how you'd go about telling EF that you had added a new table, and it's to treat it like all the others. It just doesn't make too much sense.
