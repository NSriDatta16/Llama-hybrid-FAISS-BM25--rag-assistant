As pointed out in the other answers, there are many different ways to define an interval that includes 90% of the density. One that hasn't been pointed out yet is the highest [posterior] density interval ( wikipedia ), which is defined as "the shortest interval for which the difference in the empirical cumulative density function values of the endpoints is the nominal probability". This method has some advantages (and is preferred by many Bayesian statisticians for summarizing posterior densities), but unlike the quantile-based approaches is not invariant to transformations of the variable. library(coda) HPDinterval(as.mcmc(x), prob=0.9)
