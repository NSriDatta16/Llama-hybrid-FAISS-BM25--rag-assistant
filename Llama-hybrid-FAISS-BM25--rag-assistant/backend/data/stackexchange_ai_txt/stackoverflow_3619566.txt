What is the preferred way of allocating C++ class member data?

Let's say I have a class that allocates some arbitrary member data. There are two common ways that I have seen used (I know that there are others): class A { public: A(); ~A(); //Accessors... private: B *mB; } A::A() { mB = new B(); } A::~A() { delete B; } Versus... class A { public: //Accessors... private: B mB; } Assume that A itself will be allocated on the heap by consumer code. In the general case, which method is preferred? I realize that specific situations really encourage one way or the other, but in absence of those demands, is one way preferred? What are the tradeoffs?
