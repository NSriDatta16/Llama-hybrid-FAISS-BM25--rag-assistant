The horizon forecast means how many days ahead you are able to predict. I don't know what 'additive' or 'multiplicative' means, but you can make linear or non-linear predictions with different algorithms. For instance, a linear regression vs a polynomial regression . Seasonality detection depends on the algorithm you use. Neural networks like LSTM or models like SARIMA can find patterns quite easily.
