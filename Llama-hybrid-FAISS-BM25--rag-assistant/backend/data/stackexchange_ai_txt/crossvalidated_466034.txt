Why does Logistic Regression output show Z-test whereas Linear regression show T-test in the ouput?

Why does Logistic Regression output show Z-test whereas Linear regression shows the t-test in the ouput? Why logistic regression prefers Z-test when the same can be achieved with the help of t-test? Also suggest me if there is something I can read about this.
