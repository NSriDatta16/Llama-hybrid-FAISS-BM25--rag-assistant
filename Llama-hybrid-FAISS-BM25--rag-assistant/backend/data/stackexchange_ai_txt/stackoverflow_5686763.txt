Any advice on how to remove this extra (per-device) bars? Talk to ARCHOS, as that bar is not part of the standard Android environment. I suspect that it cannot be removed , but that is just a guess. Bear in mind that the system bar on Android 3.x cannot be removed, except perhaps by custom firmware. The system bar fills the same role as does the status bar and this ARCHOS side bar, and users must be able to return to the home screen, press the BACK button, etc. I strongly encourage you to consider alternative approaches to your problem (e.g., make the "school guide" be the home screen), or plan on working with somebody to build your own custom firmware.
