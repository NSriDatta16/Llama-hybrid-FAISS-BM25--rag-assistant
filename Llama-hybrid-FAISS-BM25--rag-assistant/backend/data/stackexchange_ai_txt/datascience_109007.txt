Are predictive features with 0 SHAP values included in the model?

I have trained and XGBoost by enforcing no-feaure interaction and calculated Global Shap values: It looks like only 6 features have some SHAP values, whilst the remaining ones have a SHAP value of 0. Question. If a feature has a SHAP value of 0 across all records in the sample, does it mean that that feature has not been included in the model?
