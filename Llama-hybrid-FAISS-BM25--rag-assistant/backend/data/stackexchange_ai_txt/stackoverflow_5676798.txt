If eclipse can't resolve a package fragment of an import statement, then it tells you (with that error), that there is no library on the classpath that contains a class from that package (or from a package whose name starts with the missing part). An easy way for standard java/eclipse: create a folder lib in your projects root directory (with the eclipse workbench!) copy and paste the jar into that folder right-click the copied jar and select "add to build path". This should eliminate the compiler errors immediately. (Previous part of the answer) Taking the error message literally, it looks like you have a line of code like that: import javazoom; This would be wrong, because we don't import packages but classes from a package . To import all classes from the javazoom package, we'd say: import javazoom.*;
