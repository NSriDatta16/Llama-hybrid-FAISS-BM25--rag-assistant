The reason Q-Learning is called so because it uses Q values to form it's estimates. The usual learning rule is, $Q(s_t,a_t)\gets Q(s_t,a_t)+\alpha(r_t+\gamma \times \max_{a} Q(s_{t+1},a)-Q(s_t,a_t))$ and it should be clear why it is called Q-Learning. But the actual question in my view is why Q-Learning is called so. Though there does not seem to be a satisfactory answer, this link mentions that Andrew Barto , who is one of the founders of Modern Reinforcement Learning, thinks that $Q$ stands for Quality, called so because it characterizes how good the result of pulling an arm would be.
