What is the defining Set in NLP

I am reading the paper Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings here is the pdf . On page 6, we read: Step 1: Identify gender subspace. Inputs: word sets W , defining sets D_1 , ..., D_m. However, they paper before and after this statement does not mention what these defining sets are? Can anyone give me a definition or description of these sets? Thank you.
