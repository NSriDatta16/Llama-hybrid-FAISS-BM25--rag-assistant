Serving static files with apache and mod_wsgi without changing apache's configuration?

I have a Django application, and I'm using a shared server hosting, so I cannot change apache's config files. The only thing that I can change is the .htaccess file in my application. I also have a standard django.wsgi python file, as an entry point. In dev environment, I'm using Django to serve the static files, but it is discouraged in the official documentation, saying that you should do it using the web server instead. Is there a way to serve static files through apache without having access to Apache's configuration, changing only the .htaccess or django.wsgi files??
