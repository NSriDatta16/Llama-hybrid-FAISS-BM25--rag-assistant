The Ruby/Johnson port of env.js has some holes in event support that tend to crop up when using jquery, particularly the latest release, which relies more heavily on live/bubbled events, and jquery.ui. Moreover, autocomplete is particularly problematic since as a virtual browser, env.js has no keyboard or mouse from which to generate change and focus events. env.js is generally developed by people scratching their own itches, so you're welcome/encouraged to contribute.
