There is a Python distribution called SciPy that has lots of tools for scientific programming and people have used it to do data classification . Some bioinformatics people have built Excel2SVM in Python. If the focus of your work is on the data classification, not on developing software, then Python is a good choice because you can be more productive than with languages like java or C++.
