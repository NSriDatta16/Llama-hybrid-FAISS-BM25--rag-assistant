Separating two complex-valued datasets that have been multiplied together

I have two complex-valued datasets, A and B that can be considered as vectors with the same number of elements. The datasets are multiplied together using complex point-by-point multiplication, such that the first element of A is multiplied by the first element of B , the second element of A is multiplied by the second element of B , and so on. The multiplication is similar to the Matlab dot operator, C = A.*B . The resulting dataset is C . A is a filter kernel in the frequency domain, which models the effects of a medium on a signal B . B is the reflection of the signal from the medium. I want to treat B as noise. The point-by-point multiplication of A by B in the frequency domain is equivalent to a convolution in the time domain. Suppose that I do not know A or B , but using a statistical algorithm I want to remove B from C to get A . C is a signal that is recorded by experiment, and so A and B are unknown. However, I can assume statistical properties of A and B . This problem has given me much headache because normally in the literature, B is treated as the desired signal to be extracted, and A is removed as unwanted "noise". I want to do this the opposite way around. This is the reason why I have tried (perhaps unnecessarily) to recast the problem in a different way, and this is also the reason why I have turned to statistical analysis. I need some guidance on which type of numerical procedure to use, and perhaps a good reference with some example problems. I suspect that some form of linear prediction algorithm used in numerical statistics might be beneficial here. Here is more detailed information that might be pertinent. Given only C , but not A and B , I would like to approximate A and B using a statistical method. I am searching for an algorithm or method that is reasonably well-known and documented (i.e. a tutorial, book or paper is available, and the method is known to work well.) Here is what I know about the datasets. I am certain that these statements can be written in a more precise manner. Datasets A and B are uncorrelated. A and B are not constant. A has smaller variability than B Both the real and imaginary parts of A are "smooth" curves, where the rate of change is gradual The real and imaginary parts of B are "spiky" curves, and the rate of change is quicker than A The histograms of the real and imaginary parts of B are not skewed. Multiplying A by B skews the histograms of C . Can the histograms of C be separated in some way? A represents the frequency-domain attenuation kernel of a signal, hence the need for complex variables. B represents the signal in the frequency domain. The signal B is modified by A . The signal B is a reflection from a waveform that has been passed through an attenuating medium. A models the effects of the medium on the waveform. Despite A and B being in the frequency domain, they are nothing more than just datasets of complex numbers. Alternately, the problem can be reformulated so that A has elements consisting only of real values, and B is complex-valued, with real and imaginary parts. Thus, the imaginary part of A is zero for all elements in the dataset. The same statements above hold for A and B . Does this make the problem easier? I wonder if PCA or Fourier-transform methods would be useful for this problem. I am not certain which class of statistical methods would be useful for this type of problem.
