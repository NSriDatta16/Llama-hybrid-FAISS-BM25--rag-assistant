Magento addAttributeToFilter not working the way I think it should

I have a product attribute that I have set the scope to website (so in theory it would be different on each website defined). However for some reason when I use it in an addAttributeToFilter() it seems to ignore it. Let me show you the code I am using: $total_products_obj = Mage::getModel('catalog/product') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('discontinued', array('neq' => 1) ) ->addAttributeToFilter('video_url', array('notnull' => '') ); The attribute I am having trouble with is the video_url attribute. Like I said it's scope is set to Website where discontinued is a Global attribute. I have not really done much with Website attributes, is there something else that I need to do in order to get this attribute to not be ignored? Right now I am getting a collection of all the products where discontinued does not equal 1.
