Help with Regex.Replace("GARGANO/MART/RUBI250/(FLAH)", @"\bRUB(I(N?)?)?([0-9]*)\b", "TOKE")

I have regular expression problem where I have to replace a word or the abbreviation of a word in a string. Let assume that we have the string "GARGANO/MART/RUBI250/(FLAH)". The word in this string is RUBIN but has been abbreviated as RUBI250. However, when I used the expression Regex.Replace("GARGANO/MART/RUBI250/(FLAH)", @"\bRUB(I(N?)?)?([0-9]*)\b", "TOKE") I get this "GARGANO/MART/TOKE/(FLAH/GENN)" My desired result is "GARGANO/MART/TOKE250/(FLAH/GENN)" It seems like, it thinks the number is a part of the work and is replacing the number. When I change the regular expression to @"\bRUB(I(N?)?)?\b", then it DOES NOT return any match because I guess the number screws everything up. Please help.
