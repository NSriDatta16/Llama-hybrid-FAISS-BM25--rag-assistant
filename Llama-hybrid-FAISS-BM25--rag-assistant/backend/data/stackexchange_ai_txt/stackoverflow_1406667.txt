Short-circuit evaluation has nothing to do with const or non-const. It happens no matter what. The statement A() && B(); will do exactly what if (A()) B(); does (although it isn't a perfect substitute, as the second one allows an else ). This is sometimes used to change a statement into an expression (such as when writing a macro, or embedding it in another statement).
