T-test in the presence of autocorrelation

I have a time series data and I would like to check if the sample mean is statistically significantly different from zero. I was going to do the t-test, but the t-test assumes independent data, while my data are heavily autocorrelated (about 40% lag-1 autocorrelation), so my t-stats are also extremely bloated. I know I can subsample my data, so that the autocorrelation is minimized. But is there anyway to correct for the autocorrelation of the time series while still using the full data, so that the t-stats and p-value correctly indicates the probability of observing similar mean at random from a zero-mean data? I guess there are some corrections to the sample size, so we can have some "effective sample size" that is smaller than actual sample size.
