Nang. An easy way to approach this (and to learn it) is to figure out how you'd do it in the UI. Then move onto figuring out how to do the same thing in script. When you say, "get all account of an employee," do you really mean get all accounts where a particular employee is on the account team? In the UI, that would be done by going to: Accounts > All Accounts Across Organizations, and querying for that specific user in the "Account Team" multi-value field. From that same view, go to Help > About View in the application menu. You'll see in the popup that the view uses the Account business object and the Account business component. A quick examination of the applet you queried on will show you that the "Account Team" field on the applet is really the "Sales Rep" field on the Account business component. Here's how to mimic what we did in the UI, in script: var boAccount = TheApplication().GetBusObject("Account"); var bcAccount = boAccount.GetBusComp("Account"); bcAccount.SetViewMode(AllView); // like All .. Across Orgs bcAccount.ClearToQuery(); bcAccount.SetSearchSpec("Sales Rep", "NANG"); bcAccount.ExecuteQuery(); Then you can walk through the list of accounts and do something with each one like this: // for each account for (var bIsRowActive = bcAccount.FirstRecord(); bIsRowActive; b = bcAccount.NextRecord()) { // do something here } I hope you're enjoying Siebel.
