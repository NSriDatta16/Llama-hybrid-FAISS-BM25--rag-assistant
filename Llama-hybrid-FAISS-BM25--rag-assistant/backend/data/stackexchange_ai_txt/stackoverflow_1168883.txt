SQL Replication Setup - Almost There

I'm trying to setup replication between two SQL Servers and I'm almost there but stuck on a permission error (it appears). The servers are connected via VPN. Publisher/Distributer = W2003 + SQL2005 (Domain Controller) Subscriber = W2008 + SQL2008 (Stand Along Server not on a domain) I have set it up to Pull rather than push only because that's the way I got past the logins issue. Current status is that both agents are running and the snapshot has completed but it doesn't start replicating. There error is below which seems to indicate that the Subscriber does not have permissions to the Snapshot folder but I have set Everyone (Full control) just to try and get it working. I'm thinking is there some issue with trust or something. I can bring up the snapshot share on the Publisher from Subscriber and access files without any permission issues. But SQL seems to be having some kind of issue. Any thoughts on the next steps here to trouble shoot? Thanks. This is the end of the log: 2009-07-22 23:34:47.838 Initializing 2009-07-22 23:34:49.263 Snapshot will be applied from the alternate folder '\[MachineName][share]\unc\SYDNEY_MIRRORMIRROR_MIRRORMIRRORPRODUCT\20090722085146\' 2009-07-22 23:34:50.809 Agent message code 20143.
