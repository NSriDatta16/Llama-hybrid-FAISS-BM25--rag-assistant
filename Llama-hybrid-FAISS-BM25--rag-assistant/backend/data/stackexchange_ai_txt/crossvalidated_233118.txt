NMF does not always include regularization -- for example, see the first two cost functions here . But, regularized NMF can be useful: If you're willing to add extra constraints beyond nonnegativity, you can produce highly interpretable structures, including the K-means centroids . If you want to fit an NMF so that $X = LR$ where $L$ is wider than $X$, the model is useless (trivial, ill-posed, non-identifiable) because you could just set $L$ equal to a zero-padded version of $X$ and set $R$ to a zero-padded identity matrix. In this case, an L1 penalty on each factor matrix will help out by encouraging both factors to contribute. For a low-dimensional example, a pair of 3's incurs a lower L1 penalty than a 9 and a 1. Another possible answer is that SVD is a rigid term and NMF is not. If you added regularization to an SVD, it would no longer be called an SVD, but the term NMF is less prescriptive.
