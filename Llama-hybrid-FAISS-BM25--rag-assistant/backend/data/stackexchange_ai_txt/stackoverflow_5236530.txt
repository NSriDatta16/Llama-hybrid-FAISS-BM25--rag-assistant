While strongly seconding Vincent's suggestion to use bind variables (which is likely going to be a huge performance gain as well as preventing the DBA from throttling you for crushing the shared pool) and Brosto's suggestion to do bulk binds, I would tend to question why you would write this sort of thing in C# in the first place. It would be much more efficient to do something like use external tables so that your application causes a file to be placed on the database server's file system and the parsing and loading of the data is done by the external table definition (or even having your application invoke SQL*Loader). That lets you leverage the code Oracle has already optimized for this sort of processing. Additionally, since you are counting the number of lines in the file once at the outset in order to display a progress bar, you can optimize that by getting an approximate row count from more easily obtained information. You know roughly how many bytes per line in the file and the size of a file is a relatively easy file attribute to retrieve. That should allow you to estimate the number of lines in the file relatively accurately which should be more than enough for a progress bar.
