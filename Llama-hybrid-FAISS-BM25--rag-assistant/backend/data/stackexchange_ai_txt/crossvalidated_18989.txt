I found Programming Collective Intelligence the easiest book for beginners, since the author Toby Segaran is is focused on allowing the median software developer to get his/her hands dirty with data hacking as fast as possible. Typical chapter: The data problem is clearly described, followed by a rough explanation how the algorithm works and finally shows how to create some insights with just a few lines of code. The usage of python allows one to understand everything rather fast (you do not need to know python, seriously, I did not know it before, too). DONT think that this book is only focused on creating recommender system. It also deals with text mining / spam filtering / optimization / clustering / validation etc. and hence gives you a neat overview over the basic tools of every data miner. Chapter 10 even deals with stock market data, but the focus is not on time series data mining. Maybe the only drawback (for you) of this excellent book.
