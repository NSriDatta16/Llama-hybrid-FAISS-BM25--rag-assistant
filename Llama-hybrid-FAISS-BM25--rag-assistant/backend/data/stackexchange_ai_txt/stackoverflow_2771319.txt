BizTalk Server Threading in Receive Pipelines

I am building custom pipeline components for receive pipelines in BizTalk Server (2006 and 2009). I am building the components in a streaming fashion. My question: for any single inbound message, if I have a disassembling component, when I create n messages from a single inbound message, will the message agent always use a single thread when reading the (body) streams and persisting the messages to the message box? I would think so, but confirmation would be helpful. Say if I create five messages in the disassembler, will any of these messages be persisted sequentially from the same thread? Or could these messages be processed in parallel?
