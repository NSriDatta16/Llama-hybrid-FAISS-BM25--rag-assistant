What to do with a winforms app that looks poor with medium/large fonts enabled on windows 7?

I have a windows forms app built with .NET 3.5 and a relatively old version of Infragistics controls. It turns out some of the forms/controls look quite poor when viewed in Windows7 and Medium or Large Fonts. What are my options to resolve this? I have some tens of forms and would like a short-term solution rather than a rewrite, as the app will be migrated to WPF or Silverlight in the medium term. Is there a switch I can 'turn off' medium/large fonts for the app as an immediate fix? What general principles need to be followed for winforms apps to render nicely with medium/large fonts turned on?
