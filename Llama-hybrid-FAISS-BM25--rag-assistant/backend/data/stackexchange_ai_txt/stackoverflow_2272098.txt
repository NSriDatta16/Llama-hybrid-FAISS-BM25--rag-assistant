Does rails3 provide any hooks for dropping in pluggable, re-usable components?

What efforts have been made in rails 3 to encourage code re-use? Is there anything akin to merb slices / engines built into the framework that would allow me to drop in a configurable component such as a 'blog' engine? If so, what is considered best practice?
