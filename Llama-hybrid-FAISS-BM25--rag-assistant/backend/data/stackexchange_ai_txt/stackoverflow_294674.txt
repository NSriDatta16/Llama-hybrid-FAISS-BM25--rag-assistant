Adobe's new Pixel Blender is the closest technology out there. It is cross-platform -- it's part of the Flash 10 runtime, as well as the key pixel-oriented CS4 apps, namely After Effects and (soon) Photoshop. It's unclear, however, how much is currently exposed for embedding in other applications at this point. In the most extreme case it should be possible to embed by embedding a Flash view, but that is more overhead than would obviously be idea. There is also at least one smaller-scale 3rd party offering: Conduit Pixel Engine . It is commercial, with no licensing price clearly listed, however.
