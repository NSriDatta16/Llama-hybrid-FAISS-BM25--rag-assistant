What you need to do is, fix the bugs before you start measuring test coverage. If your program is failing other tests, coverage information is meaningless anyway. Crashing is clearly a failure of some kind, so you need to fix this. Fix the bugs, then you can find out how effectively your (non-faulty) program is being tested. Perhaps it will help if you write an automated test to reproduce the crash, to ensure it doesn't subsequently regress?
