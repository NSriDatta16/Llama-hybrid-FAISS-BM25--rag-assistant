Weighted generalized regression in BUGS, JAGS

In R we can "prior weight" a glm regression via the weights parameter. For example: glm.D93 How can this be accomplished in a JAGS or BUGS model? I found some paper discussing this, but none of them provides an example. I'm interested mainly into Poisson and logistic regression examples.
