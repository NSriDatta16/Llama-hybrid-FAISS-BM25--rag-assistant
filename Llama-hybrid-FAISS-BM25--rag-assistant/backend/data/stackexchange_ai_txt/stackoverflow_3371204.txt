A simpler TinyMCE hyperlink plugin

TinyMCE has a hyperlink plug-in that allows you to select a piece of text, and wrap an around it. But it's a bit too obtrusive- it opens up a big new popup window, with many options for the user to pay attention, wait, think and configure. Is there a simpler alternative to it? Something that does a basic job of inserting an anchor in a more subtle way (maybe just with a one-click simple javascript input prompt)? Thanks, Pradyumna
