A parametric model has fixed number of parameters, in case of non-parametric model , the number of parameters grows with the size of the data. What follows, with a parametric model we need to make stronger assumptions about the distribution of the data, while in case of the non-parametric model, it is "learned from the data" to greater degree, but the practical differences may be blurry in some cases. That is why models such as Gaussian processes are considered as non-parametric, no matter that they make distributional assumptions and have parameters. Kernel regression is one of the non-parametric regression models, so it cannot differ from non-parametric models. It is a model that uses kernels to approximate the expected value of the distribution of the data. Other non-parametric models may use different ways of achieving this, for example in case of $k$ -NN regression the predicted mean would be just an average of the $k$ closest neighbors of the datapoint.
