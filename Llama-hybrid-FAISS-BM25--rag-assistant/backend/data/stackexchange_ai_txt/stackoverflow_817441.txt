IPhone like scrolling on Silverlight ListBox

I need a listbox with IPhone-like functionality for Silverlight. That is, animated scrolling, and click and drag to scroll. Scrolling will continue a bit after the mouse up event based on the "speed" of the dragging. I've search and found no control vendors providing this. So question is how should I build it? I need some hints to get started. There's two parts to this question: Part 1, How to get the animated scrolling of the listbox. Part 2, How to build a "draggable" scrolling, I guess I should put a canvas on top and track the mouseevent, and simulate some physics. Some hints here would have been great. Thanks Larsi.
