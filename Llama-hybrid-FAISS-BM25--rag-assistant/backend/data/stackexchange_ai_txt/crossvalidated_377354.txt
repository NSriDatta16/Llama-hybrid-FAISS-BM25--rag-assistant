Logistic regression appropriate with skewed outcomes?

I am currently examining a dataset pertaining to a specific behavior (chirping) in guinea pigs and the factors that influence whether a guinea pig will chirp or not. Previously, this behavior was thought to be quite rare (affecting about 1 in 10 piggies) but after conducting a survey, it appears that approximately 75% of pigs display this behavior every now and then. I thought about running a generalized linear model with a binary logistic link (chirps - does not chirp), since I have categorical (gender, reproductive status, etc.) and interval (age, number of companions) variables, but I am not sure logistic regression is appropriate for datasets where the distribution of the outcome variable is so heavily skewed in one direction. Any advice appreciated!
