Using the NetLogo API to get turtle coordinates

I am trying to get coordinates for turtles in NetLogo by using the Java API. I have managed to get the workspace loaded and have been using the following code that I made: public static int getX(HeadlessWorkspace workspace, String playerName, int agentNum) { Double doubleX = null; int xVal = 0; try { xVal = doubleX.valueOf((workspace.report("[xcor] of "+playerName+" "+agentNum).toString()).trim()).intValue(); } catch(Exception ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } return xVal; } However, there is one small problem. It is extremely slow when there are more than 5 turtles. When I run the Flocking code with 200 turtles, without getting the coordinates, then I get about 300 ticks in 10 seconds. When I run the code with the coordinates, then each tick takes about 3 seconds. Is there a more efficient way of achieving this? Thanks, Nadim
