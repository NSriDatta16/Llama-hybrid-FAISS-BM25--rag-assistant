There is no int type in JavaScript. Only number. parseInt is fine if you have a non-decimal number, or you might have trailing garbage on the string like "5asdkfkasdk". But for the common case, when you know your string is only decimal digits, I prefer to use the Number() constructor. It looks more elegant and it's more familiar to C and Python programmers who do a lot of casting. var numericValue = Number("100000"); var numericValue2 = parseInt("100000", 10); These yield the same result of the same type.
