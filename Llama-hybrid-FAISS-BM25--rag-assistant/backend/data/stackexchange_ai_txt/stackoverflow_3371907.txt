I just came across the same issue yesterday and found a hack, which is not an elegant solution. If you want to stop the dijit.Dialog from repositioning you can: 1) Set the property ._relativePosition of a dijit.Dialog object (in this case it's "pop") after calling the method pop.show(): pop.show(); pop._relativePosition = new Object(); //create empty object Next steps would probably be: Check browser type&OS: dojo or even better BrowserDetect Check when the virtual keyboard is activated and disable repositioning Extend dijit.Dialog with custom class (handle all of the exceptions)
