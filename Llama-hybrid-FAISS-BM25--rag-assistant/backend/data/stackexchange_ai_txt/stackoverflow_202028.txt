You have to store a permanent version of user settings in a more durable store like database. Your application can decide to use the isolated storage if it is available. If it is not available (because of a newer version), the app should get the settings from database and use it to re-initialize the settings in isolated storage. If settings are changed, you should update both places. Unless there is a newer version of the app, your app should not have to get the settings from DB.
