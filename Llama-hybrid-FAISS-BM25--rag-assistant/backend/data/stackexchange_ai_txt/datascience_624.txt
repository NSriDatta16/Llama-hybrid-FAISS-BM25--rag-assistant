In most cases a practicing data scientist creates his own working environment on personal computed installing preferred software packages. Normally it is sufficient and efficient use of computing resources, because to run a virtual machine (VM) on your main machine you have to allocate a significant portion of RAM for it. The software will run noticeably slower on both the main and the virtual machine unless a lot of RAM. Due to this impact on speed it is not common to use VMs as main working environment but they are a good solution in several cases when there is a need of additional working environment. The VMs be considered when: There is a need to easily replicate a number of identical computing environments when teaching a course or doing a presentation on a conference. There is a need to save and recreate an exact environment for an experiment or a calculation. There is a need to run a different OS or to test a solution on a tool that runs on a different OS. One wants to try out a bundle of software tools before installing them on the main machine. E.g. there is an opportunity to instal an instance of Hadoop (CDH) on a VM during an Intro to Hadoop course on Udacity. VMs are sometimes used for fast deployment in the cloud like AWS EC, Rackspace etc. The VMs mentioned in the original question are made as easily installable data science software bundles. There are more than these two. This blog post by Jeroen Janssens gives a comparison of at least four: Data Science Toolbox Mining the Social Web Data Science Toolkit Data Science Box
