Are Class Activated Maps an example of backpropagated Explainable AI?

Class Activated Maps (NOT GradCAM) is listed in van der Velden et al as a back-propagation approach in table 1, but that is not actually true, is it? CAM doesn't use back-propagation in the method, there is no gradient to be computed. Is it appropriate to still call it a backprop approach of Explainable AI? Bas H.M. van der Velden, Hugo J.
