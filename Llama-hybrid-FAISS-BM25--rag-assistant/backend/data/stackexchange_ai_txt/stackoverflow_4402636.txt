Magento Upgrade

I'm looking to upgrade a themed/custom Magento from 1.3.x to Magento 1.9 Enterprise. So far, after multiple attempts at upgrading, I have failed. After the first upgrade, I uploaded the new Magento in a clean environment, copied the database to a dev database. Using this, the upgrade occurred with two errors: It appears Magento upgrades only support 1.4+ currently, and previous mysql upgrade scripts were not included. After the "install" of the upgrade, I couldn't access wither the admin, or the frontend, and there was no errors to tell me what gives. Scrapping that idea, I tried a clean install: It worked fine. Then I tried importing all the products from a CSV export. Worked OK, but custom attributes such as images, sizes, etc. didn't transfer over. I have over 900 product, and entering everything manual would be a pain, and unfeasible. Scrapping that idea. Now I'm at various upgrade configurations, upgrading from Magento 1.3. I'm going to try and upgrade 1.3 to 1.4, and then 1.4 to Enterprise, but has anyone performed such an upgrade successfully before and might be able to provide hints? Thanks, Bryon
