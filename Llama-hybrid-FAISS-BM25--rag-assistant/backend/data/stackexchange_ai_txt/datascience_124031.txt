how to implement federated transfer learning?

I'm exploring the concept of Federated Learning and Transfer Learning and am interested in combining both to implement Federated Transfer Learning. I understand that Federated Learning allows model training on decentralized data sources, and Transfer Learning enables leveraging pre-trained models for related tasks. However, I'm unsure how to effectively combine these two techniques. Specifically, I have the following questions: How can I transfer knowledge from a centralized model to multiple decentralized models in a federated setting? Are there any specific architectures or algorithms that are best suited for Federated Transfer Learning? How do I handle data heterogeneity across different clients in a federated setting while transferring knowledge? Are there any open-source implementations or frameworks that support Federated Transfer Learning? Any guidance, references, or code snippets would be greatly appreciated!
