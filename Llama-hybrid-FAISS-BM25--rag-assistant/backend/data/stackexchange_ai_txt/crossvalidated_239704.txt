Analysis of dependent variables

How does one use machine learning to identify/analyze the importance and impact of independent variables on dependent variables? Let's say I have a data set with independent variables being: carbohydrates, fiber, fat, protein and dependent variable is: healthy . Independent variables are linear (grams consumed in the past week) and healthy is categorical. With this data, imagine having person X walk in and asking what makes me healthy and what doesn't? How would you go about analyzing that question and responding in in a quantifiable answer?
