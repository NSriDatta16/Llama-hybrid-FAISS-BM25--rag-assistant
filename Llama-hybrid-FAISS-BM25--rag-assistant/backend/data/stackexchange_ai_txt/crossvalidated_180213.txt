You could treat this as a survival analysis assuming you know both how long people who have been successful in obtaining housing have had to wait as well as how long people who are still waiting for housing have been queued. In survival analysis, this latter group are called "censored" observations meaning that information as to their status wrt obtaining housing is not available as of the last period in the time series. Survival analysis is a class of models developed specifically for those special cases in predictive modeling where data are censored. One excellently written and intuitive introduction to this class of models is Paul Allison's Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, Second Edition . This book covers the waterfront from the simplest Kaplan-Meier survival curves through parametric failure models to Cox proportional hazards models. Forget about the fact that it is focused on SAS software, Allison's development and overview of the methods is software agnostic in most important respects. In other words, while it would be nice to know and use SAS software in the context of his book, it remains a highly useful resource without it. What is problematic about your specific question is that it asks for a likelihood of a value less than anything in your observed data. While this is theoretically possible, the usual caveats apply when extrapolating to data outside the observed range of any reference information.
