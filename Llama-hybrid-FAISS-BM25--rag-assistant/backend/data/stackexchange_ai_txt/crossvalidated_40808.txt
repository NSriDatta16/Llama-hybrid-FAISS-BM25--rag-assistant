Is a strong background in maths a total requisite for ML?

I'm starting to want to advance my own skillset and I've always been fascinated by machine learning. However, six years ago instead of pursuing this I decided to take a completely unrelated degree to computer science. I have been developing software and applications for about 8-10 years now, so I have a good handle but I just can't seem to penetrate the maths side of machine learning/probabilities/statistics. I start looking at learning material and on the first page it might include something which confuses me and immediately sets up a barrier in my learning. Is a strong background in maths a total requisite for ML? Should I try and fill in the blanks of my maths before continuing with ML? Can self learning really work for just a developer without any hard computer science background? Related question: Book for reading before Elements of Statistical Learning?
