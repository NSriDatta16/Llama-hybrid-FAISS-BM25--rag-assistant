Magento Collection Model Filter Modification

Two of my modules are conflicting and it's causing a serious issue, I'm not all that familiar with back-end programming so I've come here hoping someone can help me out. P.S. I did try to solve this on my own for at least an hour or two, learned quite a bit but not anything that was straight forward enough to solve this. I need to modify the following function so that when it is used in a manner similar to the example further below, it excludes from the collection any items where id_path contains the string 'questions'. public function filterByIdPath($idPath) { $this->getSelect() ->where('id_path = ?', $idPath); return $this; } $collection = Mage::getResourceModel('seosuite/core_url_rewrite_collection') ->filterAllByProductId($productId) ->sortByLength('ASC') ->addStoreFilter($storeId, false); ->filterByIdPath($idPath) The class this function is located in is an extended version of Mage_Core_Model_Mysql4_Url_Rewrite_Collection. We also have access to request_path if id_path is not suitable. Here are a few examples of id_paths: product/2/3/questions, product/5/3, category/3, product/3/3/questions.
