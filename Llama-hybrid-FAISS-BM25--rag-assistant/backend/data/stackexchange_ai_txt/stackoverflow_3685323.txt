I have run into a very similar circumstance where I was enabling the ability to drag and drop elements around the page using javascript. To solve this problem, you have the ability to capture the text selection event and on capture of the event if you return false, the selection will never take place. For a good example of this being put to use, please reference: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex9/noselect.htm Alternately if you are familiar with the jQuery framework, a perfectly simplistic and effective plugin is available at: http://chris-barr.com/entry/disable_text_selection_with_jquery/ Bets luck to you!
