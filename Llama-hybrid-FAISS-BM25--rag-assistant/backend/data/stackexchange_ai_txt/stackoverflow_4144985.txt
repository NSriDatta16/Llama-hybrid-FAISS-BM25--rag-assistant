Creating a thread in Application Object

I have an Application which, reads files from Sdcard and does some intense processing. To speed up the user experience I created a subclass of Application object. With in this i created a Thread where, i actually got a reference to the files on Sdcard and did the startup activities so that once the activity is shown there is no lag to the user. public class GAppClass extends Application { class setMapDirThread extends Thread { public void run() { setMapDir(); } } public void onCreate() { setMapDirThread objThread = new setMapDirThread(); objThread.start(); } private void setMapDir() { Log.d(TAG, "Inside initMapComponent"); String extDirName = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() .getAbsolutePath(); /* some processing related to opening and reading files from Sdcard and allocating cache */ } } Is the above mentioned approach safe to use? i.e. creating thread in the application class to do some background processing is good approach or bad? Does it slow down application startUp? Is it safe to create a thread like this to read contents from Sdcard and allocate some memory for internal caching?
