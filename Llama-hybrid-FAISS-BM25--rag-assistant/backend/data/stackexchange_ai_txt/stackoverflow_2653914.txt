Postcode and radius lookup recommendations

I look after a number of divisional websites for a uk based membership organisation and what we want to do is provide, as well as other address functions, is a closest member lookup to a web user from the websites themselves. A few use cases that I want to fill: Case 1 : The user puts in their post code and wants to see all the members in a 5/10/15/20/30/40 mile radius from them Case 2 : The member puts in an area (city, county, etc.) and gets a list of members in that area. Essentially what I'm looking for is a programmable API which I can code against to do: post code lookup and returns addresses (after picking house number for example). search post code + radius (5miles, 10miles etc) and get a set of applicable post codes to then join onto the membership records in the database Any recommendations? It can be a quarterly update install on the server, it can be a queryable web service. I'm open to suggestions. Thanks in advance Edit Not forgotten about this; something else has been thrown into the mix at work and this has gone onto the back burner. Will update when it comes back to the boil (applogies for the pan boiling comments :-))
