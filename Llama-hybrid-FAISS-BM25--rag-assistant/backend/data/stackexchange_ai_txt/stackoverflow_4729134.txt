Instead of using a program I would try to use the certificate store mmc plugin: Start mmc.exe , this will give you the MMC in authoring mode. Click File -> Add/remove Snap-in Find and double-click "Certificates". This will pop up a dialog where you can select which certificate storage you want to administer. I think "Service Account" is the appropriate selection for you here Click next Select local if you are on il-mark-lap already, otherwise select "Another computer". AFAIK, you will have to be logged in with a domain administrator account for this to work though. Click next Select your service click finish. At this point you should already be able to access the certificate storage for your service. If you want to do this more often then I suggest you do this as well: Right-click "Certificates" in the tree and select "New Window from Here" Switch back to the console root window and close it Save your work of art to a .msc file Edit Before you save, select "Certificates" from the tree, and then View -> Options. Here you can select to see the "Physical Certificate stores" if you like.
