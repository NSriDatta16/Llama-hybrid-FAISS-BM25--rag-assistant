A sensible choice of loss could be the negative of utility. Within the framework of maximization of expected utility (MEU), we would have additive loss, since we would use average (over the set of test cases) negative loss as an estimate of expected utility. On the other hand, we could have nonadditive loss if we abandon MEU. E.g. if we are trying to maximize the utility of the worst outcome, we could choose the negative maximum (over the set of test cases) loss as an estimate of our target. A key observation here is that the maximum is not an additive function.
