AR(q) model with F-test

I am wondering that if we have an AR($q$) model for time series: $$X_i=\beta_1X_{i-1}+..+\beta_{p}X_{i-p} + \beta_{p+1} X_{i-p-1} +...+\beta_{q} X_{i-q}+\epsilon_i,\epsilon_i \;\text{iid}\; N(0,\sigma^2)$$ Does the F-statistic for the F-test to test the null $H_o: \beta_{p+1}=...=\beta_{q} = 0$ vs $H_1:$ some of the $\beta_i,p+1\leq i\leq n$ are nonzero still follow $F$ distribution with degrees of freedom $q-p,n-q$ under null? I know that under fixed design of $X$, $Y=X\beta +\epsilon, \epsilon \sim N(0,I_n)$, we could have the F statistic following an $F$ distribution with the right degrees of freedom. I think for random design, we assume $\epsilon |X \sim N(0,I_n)$ so that the same conclusion holds conditional on $X$. Would this be the case for the AR($q$) model? Or I am missing something?
