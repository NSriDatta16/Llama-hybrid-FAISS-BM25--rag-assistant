If you're familiar with Python then Scrapy is available. There is a learning curve involved because it's a full crawling and screen scraping framework. It should be capable of doing what you require. Here is a documentation link for simulating user logins . It also supports user-agent spoofing so it can appear to be a browser. One thing it will have trouble with is interacting with dynamic content (i.e. JavaScript). If you want something really simple try scrape . I've used it on a few projects and it's been able to do the job. It's more of a scraper so you'd have to add the crawling logic yourself.
