Why do the ensemble learners do well on regression/classification tasks?

I was watching this short video on ensemble learners, and I am confused about why they tend to do better , and how is goodness measured. If the goodness means a low mean-squared error (MSE) as usual and if you are averaging the continuous-valued predictions from each learning method, then the MSE you get will apparently be the average of the MSEs from the individual methods, and which means ensemble has an average performance. So I don't understand why the error would decrease compared to the individual methods by the ensemble method. Apparently I am missing a big chunk here, and I appreciate any help.
