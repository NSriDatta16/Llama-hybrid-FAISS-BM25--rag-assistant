The theoretical way of doing a backup safely is to use the svnadmin hotcopy command ( more details here ). It basically does a copy of one repository (not a dump , a copy ), taking care to block all the operations during that time. This operation is quite fast, so I shouldn't think any client would have an error, they may experience some delay though (depending on the server load and so on). You can find an example of script on the Apache subversion project website . If you do a dump, besides the huge time it takes, you won't be sure it will done in an atomic way. Dumps are useful to make sure you can migrate from one version to the next - think long-term backups. For example if your server is upgraded from version 1.4 to 1.5, or to 1.6, it's interesting to make a dump then a load of your repositories to take full advantage of the improvements. In some more drastic upgrades it's a necessity because the repository format changes too much. filter files out, or merge repositories, those are more complex operations, out of topic here. Before opting for a dump, should you prefer that anyway, I encourage you to do the operation manually before, to make sure it is not too long. Make sure also to compress those files, which are much bigger than a repository (hotcopy) - the latter is very well compressed.
