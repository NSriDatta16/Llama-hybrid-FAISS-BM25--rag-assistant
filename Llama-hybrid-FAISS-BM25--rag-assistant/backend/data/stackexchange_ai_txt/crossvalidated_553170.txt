Random Forest vs Support Vector Machine. Which is faster?

I am comparing the performance of Support Vector Machine with a radial basin function and Random Forests with 250 trees. I am using e1071 (SVM) and randomForest (RF) packages. My dataset contains about 500,000 training samples. Although both methods obtain similar OA, the training time is very different for both. In RF the training time is small, however in SVM the training time grows exponentially as the number of samples increases. Is this a habitual behavior? Is it a characteristic of the SVM and RF algorithms or is it the e1071 implementation which is too slow? Is this relationship true in other implementations such as scikit-learn ?
