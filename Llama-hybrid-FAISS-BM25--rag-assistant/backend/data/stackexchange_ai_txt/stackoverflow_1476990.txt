How about making the table temporarily non-visible (eg. display: none ) whilst you make the changes, then putting it back when finished? Only two reflows and you don't have the clone overhead. Whilst it would theoretically be possible to fool jQuery by using a DOM cloneNode instead of clone to create full copies of the table elements, keeping the magic expando property that jQuery uses to identify nodes, this seems pretty ugly and fragile to me.
