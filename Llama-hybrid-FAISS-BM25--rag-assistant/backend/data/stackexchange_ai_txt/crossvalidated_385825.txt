PCA: violation of the normal distribution assumption

I try to understand why normal distribution is an assumption for PCA and what might happens when it is violated. I found one answer on this plattform and a lot of different answers in literature. It varies between "there is no need for normal distribution as long as the data variables are linear correlated " and "normal distribution is essential, if violated PCA can go really wrong". I would be really happy if somebody could explane the connection between normal distribution and PCA.
