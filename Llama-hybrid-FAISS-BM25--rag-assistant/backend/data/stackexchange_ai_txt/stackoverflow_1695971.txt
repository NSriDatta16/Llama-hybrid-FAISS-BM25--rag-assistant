Does WordNet have "levels"? (NLP)

For example... Chicken is an animal . Burrito is a food . WordNet allows you to do "is-a"...the hiearchy feature. However, how do I know when to stop travelling up the tree? I want a LEVEL. That is consistent. For example, if presented with a bunch of words, I want wordNet to categorize all of them, but at a certain level, so it doesn't go too far up. Categorizing "burrito" as a "thing" is too broad, yet "mexican wrapped food" is too specific. I want to go up the hiearchy or down..until the right LEVEL.
