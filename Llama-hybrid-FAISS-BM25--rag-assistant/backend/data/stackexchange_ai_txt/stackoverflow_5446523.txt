Typically you log in to the place you registered the Domain (gandi.net) and there should be a place to configure the Name servers for that domain. Lithium hosting should have info somewhere on what their nameservers are, so find that and put them on gandi.net. There maybe some additional setup you have to do on the Lithium side as well (like telling them what domain name you are hosting on their services).
