Should I use an application server?

I'm developing a Java application which will act as a server for an information retrieval application. In the past, I've run the Java application in a screen with the command java -jar MyApp.jar . Recently, I've been using Glassfish for hosting a web app, and I like the way it handles applications and deals with deploying, starting, etc. What benefits are there to using Glassfish or another application server for containing my application? Are there any potential problems with it? Would it be better to just go with the screen method? Thanks.
