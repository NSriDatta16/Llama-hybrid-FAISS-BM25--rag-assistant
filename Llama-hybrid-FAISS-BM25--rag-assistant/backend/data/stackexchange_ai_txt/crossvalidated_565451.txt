It reports exactly what it sounds like, but that’s perhaps not what you want. Imagine getting $1/2$ the first time and $94/98$ the second time. Combined, you are $95/100$ , but the average accuracy is $\dfrac{\dfrac{94}{98}+\dfrac{1}{2}}{2}\approx0.73$ . While you’re quite not wrong to say that the average accuracy is $0.73$ , you decide which is more representative of your data. I’d go with the $95\%$ , and I would expect most people to interpret “average accuracy” this way.
