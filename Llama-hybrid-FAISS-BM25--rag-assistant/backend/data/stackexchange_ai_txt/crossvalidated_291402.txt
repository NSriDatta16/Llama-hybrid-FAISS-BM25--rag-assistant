machine learning techniques for classifying images with timestamps

I'm doing 2-class image classification (determining whether an object is present or absent in images) with CNNs. The dataset is a bunch of photos with continuous timestamps. And I observed that timestamps could be used for prediction as well. For example, in a series of photos, if one image is predicted to have the object I want to capture, then the adjacent ones have more chance to contain that object than other images. What kinds of machine learning techniques could take timestamps into consideration? It will be great if these techniques could be combined with CNNs. Please kindly point out a direction for me. Thank you very much.
