I have faced with the following issue. I have Random forest binary classifier and then I apply isotonic regression to calibration of probabilities. The question: why is Brier score of calibrated probabilities a bit worse than the one of non-calibrated probabilities? Which problem could it be? Whilst the graph shows that the calibrated classifier performs significantly better, the brier score loss is actually slightly better on the uncalibrated model. Looking at the code, one sees that the brier loss is calculated with sample weights, whilst the calibration and calibration curve are calculated without sample weights. This explains the appearance of different performance between curve and brier score. As an aside, I would suggest not using an additional calibration step that needs its own crossvalidation, but searching for RF parameters that give good probabilities see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05792.pdf
