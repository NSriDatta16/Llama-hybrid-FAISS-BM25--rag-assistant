what does it mean if the partial auto correlation function of a time series have a value >+1 or <- 1?

I have a time series data and I applied the first difference operator to make it stationary. When I plot the partial autocorrelation function of this differenced time series, I find peaks with value >1 and less than +1 or I have attached the image of PACF plot. Kindly help me. Any help is appreciated. Edit: Actual Time series data. Time series data after first difference.
