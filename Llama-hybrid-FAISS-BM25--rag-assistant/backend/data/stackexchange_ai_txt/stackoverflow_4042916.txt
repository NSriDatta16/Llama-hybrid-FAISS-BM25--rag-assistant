I would suggest that you have either a Scheduled Task or Windows Service that polls a common storage repository to see if a batch job should be run - as batch jobs are typically used for long running process. Your could persist the deatils of which batch file and arguments you want to run from your ASP.NET website into a database (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc) and then have your Windows Service / Scheduled Task poll against this database at regular intervals.
