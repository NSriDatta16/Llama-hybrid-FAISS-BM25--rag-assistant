Confidence intervals of proportions for clustered data

I am trying to compute the proportion of "yes"'s in data that is clustered (participants within cities). If I ignore the cities, I get very nice and narrow confidence intervals. If I compute the proportions within each city, I get rather wide confidence intervals. When I try to fit a "multilevel model" in WinBUGS through logistic regression[1], I get a very wide confidence interval... How should I interpret these results, and what is the best way to go about it? [1] This is my WinBUGS code for the "multilevel" case: model{ for (i in 1:3215){ x[i] ~ dbern(theta[city[i]]) } for (j in 1:142){ logit(theta[j])
