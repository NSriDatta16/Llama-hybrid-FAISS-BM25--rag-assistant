It seems that you are really modeling intervals between events. From your description it sounds like the trends do not follow smooth periods (Fourier) or autoregressive patterns. So the model could be: at what date(s) is there evidence of a change in average period between events? This is an intercept change point. There are a lot of change point packages out there for R. Using mcp , you could do: # Make some data with 7 and 14 days intervals. Then compute diff. df = data.frame(day = c(seq(1, 180, 7), seq(194, 365, 14)) + rnorm(39, 0, sd = 2)) df $diff = c(NA, diff(df$ day)) # Model it as two intercepts and sample it model = list( diff ~ 1, # Intercept ~ 1 # Intercept ) library(mcp) fit = mcp(model, data = df, par_x = "day") Now you can see the posterior distribution for the change point, and some sample lines from the posterior: plot(fit) Or in table format: > summary(fit) Population-level parameters: name mean lower upper Rhat n.eff cp_1 183.2 166.7 205.7 1 2987 int_1 7.2 5.4 8.9 1 4922 int_2 14.4 12.1 16.7 1 4793 sigma_1 4.2 3.2 5.2 1 4058 You can do loads of other stuff as well, including comparing models. See the mcp website for more examples.
