Where to look depends on the level of abstraction you interested in. Books I've know which touch this topic, by level of abstraction: Hardware: 'Structured Computer Organization' by Tanenbaum; OS Level: Several books about Linux kernel and Tanenbaum's 'Operating Systems Design and Implementation'; OS Level API (not implementation): Books by Richard Stevens -- 'Unix Network Programming' & 'Advanced Programming in the Unix environment'; In case you interested in distributed systems: again's Tanenbaum 'Distributed Systems: Principles & Paradigms';
