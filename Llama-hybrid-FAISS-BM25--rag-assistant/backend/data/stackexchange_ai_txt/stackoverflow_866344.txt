I was also going to say storing the positions in text fields is a bad idea. jQuery UI provides draggable and is easily used. The example below will send a ajax request whenever the element is dropped. $('#draggable_element').draggable({ stop: function(event, ui) { $.post("http://example.com/some_action", { top: ui.position["top"], left: ui.position["left"] }, function() { // callback stuff } ); } });
