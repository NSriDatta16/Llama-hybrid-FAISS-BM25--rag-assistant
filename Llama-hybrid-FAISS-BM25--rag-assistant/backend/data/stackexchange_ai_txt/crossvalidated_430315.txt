LSTM model for multistep univariate Time series forecasting

I have scenario where i have time series data (1 per day) for past 365 days. And I need to make a prediction for next 365 days. Is this possible using LSTM or any other ML models. I have been through some articles where we are predicting for the next few time steps (t+1,t+2,t+3) but not sure if i can predict the next 365 time steps. Any help on the approach for this will be appreciated. Thanks Atul PS: Please also suggest if there are any other methods like ARIMA etc
