This might work, might not, but it fixes a lot of these situations: Download iPhone Configuration Utility Kill Xcode Delete all profiles using iPCU Plug in your phone, find the list of profiles, and select "remove" for ALL of them Manually drag/drop each profile into iPCU, from the Finder Restart XCode ...because XCode's internal code for selecting the right certificates to use for code-signing is buggy. No particular reason for this, just Apple didn't write it very well. It's getting better, but even in latest Xcode it still sometimes goes wrong. NEVER use xcode to install a provisioning profile - no matter what Apple says, the Xcode install-handling code is still buggy, whereas strangely the iPCU code is not. Also, your phone will sometimes have multiple versions of the same profile (which ought to be impossible, but it's not) ... iPCU lets you fix that
