Can I use timeline scripting on embedded SWF assets w/ the Flex SDK?

I've embedded a SWF into a class using this syntax above my class definition: [Embed (source='/../assets/MyMovieClips.swf', symbol='SpecialMovieClip')] public class SpecialMovieClip extends MovieClip The MovieClip asset seems linked with my class okay, and instantiates along with it, and is visible, but: I can't access instances placed on stage within that clip. The timeline scripting seems non-functional. Is this the drawback of embedding SWF files at compile-time with the Flex SDK? So, maybe I should just go back to compiling with the Flash IDE if I want timeline scripting or instances positioned on-stage?
