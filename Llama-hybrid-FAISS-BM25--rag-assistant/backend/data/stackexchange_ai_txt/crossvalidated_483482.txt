Are EM and MCMC closed-form analytical solution

I came across the concept of closed-form analytical solution while learning MCMC and got a bit confused. At this point, my understanding is that the problem does not have closed-form solution if it can not be expressed by explict mathmatical formula with specific parameters found through certain optimization of loss function. If my understanding is correct, I guess methods like EM and sampling method (MCMC) are without closed-form analytical solution. Is my understanding regarding closed-form solution accurate?
