It's a problem with a quite established corpus of research (of which people is apparently unaware). I suggest to not reinvent a poor, defective wheel if not absolutely necessary (such as, for example, so unusual requirements to allow a trivial solution). Some keywords: replication , mobile DBMSs , distributed disconnected DBMSs . Also these research papers are relevant (as an example of this research field): Distributed disconnected databases , The dangers of replication and a solution , Improving Data Consistency in Mobile Computing Using Isolation-Only Transactions , Dealing with Server Corruption in Weakly Consistent, Replicated Data Systems , Rumor: Mobile Data Access Through Optimistic Peer-to-Peer Replication , The Case for Non-transparent Replication: Examples from Bayou , Bayou: replicated database services for world-wide applications , Managing update conflicts in Bayou, a weakly connected replicated storage system , Two-level client caching and disconnected operation of notebook computers in distributed systems , Replicated document management in a group communication system , ... and so on.
