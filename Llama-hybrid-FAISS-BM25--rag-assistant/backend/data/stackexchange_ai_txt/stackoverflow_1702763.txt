Nested C# Classes - Calling Outer Method From Inner

I have a ViewController class called GamePlay. In GamePlay there is a nested class called MyPinAnnotationView. When MyPinAnnotation's method TouchesBegan() gets called, I want to call a method CheckAnswer() from the parent GamePlay. I do not want to create a new GamePlay instance because I have variables and instances already set. Can I access the parent in some way? ( Other than event listeners)
