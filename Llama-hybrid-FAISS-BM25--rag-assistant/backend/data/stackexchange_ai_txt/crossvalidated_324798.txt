You have intermittent-time-series , i.e., your time series are integer-valued, nonnegative and "mostly" zero. You may want to search for "forecasting intermittent time series" or similar. The classical approach for point forecasts in such a case is crostons-method . One alternative is a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression on whatever regressors make sense (e.g., trend, seasonal dummies, causals etc.). I have also seen Integer ARMA (INARMA) models, e.g., in a Ph.D. thesis by Mona Mohammadipour, but these are not very common. One thing that I have not yet seen is linking multiple such time series together. In the continuous case, this would be Vector Autoregression (VAR, not to be confused with VaR, which is Value at Risk). An analogue to the integer case could conceivably be called VINAR, but as I said, I have never seen this.
