Is a recursive solution really so bad? (always examine your design first). File Exchange is your friend. (steal with pride!) Why bother with the trouble of a proper Queue or a class - fake it a bit. Keep it simple: q = {}; head = 1; q{head} = param; result = 0; while (head %process param{head} and obtain new param(s) head = head + 1; %change result q{end+1} = param1; q{end+1} = param2; end %loop over q return result; If the performance suffers from adding at the end too much - add in chunks: chunkSize = 100; chunk = cell(1, chunkSize); q = chunk; head = 1; nextLoc = 2; q{head} = param; result = 0; while (head numel(q); q = [q chunk]; end q{nextLoc} = param1; nextLoc = nextLoc + 1; q{end+1} = param2; nextLoc = nextLoc + 1; end %loop over q return result; A class is certainly more elegant and reusable - but fit the tool to the task.
