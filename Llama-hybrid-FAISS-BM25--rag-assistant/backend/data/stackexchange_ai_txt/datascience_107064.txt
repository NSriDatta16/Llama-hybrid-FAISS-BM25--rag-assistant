Prediction based on predicted data

may I ask if anyone of you knows well references on the prediction method based on the predicted data? By prediction based on the predicted data, I mean for example I have constructed a predictive model (via machine learning or any other method) using the current state $u_0$ to predict the next state $u_1$ , then in the next step, I use the predicted $u_1$ to get $u_2$ , and so on. My experience with LSTM seems to indicate that this way the prediction will deteriorate very quickly.
