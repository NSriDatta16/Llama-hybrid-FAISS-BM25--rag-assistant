Question answering (QA) is a complex problem and an active field of research. There are probably some academic prototypes around, but I doubt there's any general-purpose ready-to-use QA library. However there are probably state of the art implementations for closed QA, i.e. QA restricted to a specific domain (I'm not aware of any specific library though). Paraphrasing is a related but different problem, and also an active research question. Extracting keywords is a much more standard task and is an important part of traditional Information Retrieval methods.
