Zend Framework and switching view script paths

I have a problem. Basically, depending on whether a user goes to /es or /br or /cn etc on our website, we have different language template files. So far, we were using a custom templating engine to make this work, but are making a switch over to ZF. I can't seem to figure out how to get ZF to look for a view script in say cn/about-us if the language varuable is cn. I can't (don't want to) use Zend_Translate for this because we have way too many translated template files and it's just not feasible using Zend_Translate for bazillion different files with multi-paragraphs of Chinese/Korean/Japanese, forgetting for a second that I don't speak those languages. Can anybody help me?
