The memory may be fragmented. AFAIK memory is only given back to the OS iff it is page aligned and a multiple of a page size. Some memory allocators don't ever give memory back, googles malloc comes to mind. So if Qt or your app constantly mallocs and frees small blocks of randomly different sizes, the memory may be kept. The increase of the memory footprint should slow down over time though. If you are updating some QWidget like object, make sure to use update() and not repaint().
