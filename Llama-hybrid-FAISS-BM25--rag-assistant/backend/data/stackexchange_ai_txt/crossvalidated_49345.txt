I'd suggest that you use the whole data set, i.e. not average. This would potentially allow you to estimate the variance at each trial. Let's assume that 3 repeats per trial allow you a sufficient model fit (or you are able to record more repeats). You would run an ANOVA if the trials constitute separate categories, e.g. different experimental conditions. You could run a linear regression model if there is a relationship between following trials. You don't want to run multiple t-tests to compare every possible combination, e.g. Trial 1 vs Trial 2, Trial 1 vs Trial 3, etc without correcting for multiple comparisons.
