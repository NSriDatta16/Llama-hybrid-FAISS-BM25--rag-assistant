Problem with 2 variable PCA loadings- Loadings are the same for all variables

I'm working on a problem for which i want to do some dimensionality reduction using 3 different PCAs of 2 variables each. Basically i want to perform a PCA and keep the first component between the pairs M.max-max.Z; M.min-min.Z; and P-N. For this im executing the following code: pca.min % select(M.min, min.Z)%>% princomp() pca.max % select(M.max, max.Z)%>% princomp() pca.NP % select(N, P)%>% princomp() My problem is that even though these variables are different, have different values between them, and are not highly correlated (except the min.Z-M.min pair which has a 0.74 correlation), when i ask for the PCA loading i get: > pca.min$loadings Loadings: Comp.1 Comp.2 M.min 0.707 0.707 min.Z -0.707 0.707 Comp.1 Comp.2 SS loadings 1.0 1.0 Proportion Var 0.5 0.5 Cumulative Var 0.5 1.0 > pca.max$loadings Loadings: Comp.1 Comp.2 M.max 0.707 0.707 max.Z 0.707 -0.707 Comp.1 Comp.2 SS loadings 1.0 1.0 Proportion Var 0.5 0.5 Cumulative Var 0.5 1.0 > pca.NP$loadings Loadings: Comp.1 Comp.2 N 0.707 0.707 P 0.707 -0.707 Comp.1 Comp.2 SS loadings 1.0 1.0 Proportion Var 0.5 0.5 Cumulative Var 0.5 1.0 So they all have the same loading for each variable (0.707). When i do the biplots the proportion of explained variance by each component is different (not 0.5 as the $loadings shows), so my problem is not so much the explained variance by each component but rather the loading of each variable in the components being the same. I don't understant why this is happening. I am definitely not a PCA expert so this might be a rather obvious question to some, but its baffling me. I have tried using different PCA functions and it is the same. PS. All data is previously centered and standardized. Here are the scree plots for the 3 PCAs
