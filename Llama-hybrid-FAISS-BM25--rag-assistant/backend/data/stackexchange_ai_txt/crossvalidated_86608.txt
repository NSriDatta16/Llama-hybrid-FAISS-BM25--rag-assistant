Layers size in convolution NN

I have a pretty complex function that I'm trying to make my computer learn using CNNs. It involves 70 X 70 grayscaled images. The final output is the output of the last unit (it's because I want to predict probabilities from 0 to 1). What's the best layer architecture to address complexity but at the same time not resulting in overfitting. Any ideas?
