Simple mod_rewrite and website dir structure

I am making a site with photo albums for agents. Each agent has his folder with .css file. Each agent dir has album folders with index.php and .css /example.com/ /agent001/ agent001.css /000005/ index.php main.css /photos/ aaa.jpg bbb.jpg /000006/ index.php ... /agent002/ agent002.css /000009/ ... So the path to agent's 000005 album would be: /agent001/000005/index.php I want a shortcut like: /000005/ which forwards to /agent001/000005/some-title-here Another thing I can't really get my head around is my dir structure. I really need the agent and album folders to organize my stuff. But index.php and main.css are all the same, should I move these files to the root? Any help greatly appreciated!
