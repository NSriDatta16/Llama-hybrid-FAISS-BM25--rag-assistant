Why are these low-variance principal components correlated among subjects?

I'm analyzing some body tracking data. Beginning with velocity data from each upper-body joint, PCA is run on about 15 minutes (~1000s of frames) of this tracking data for 24 participants. Out, we get 13 different PCs (as there are 13 joints tracked by Kinect) for 24 participants. As one would expect, the first two or three principal components are correlated among participants. They essentially describe rigid body motion (if I sway side-to-side with talking, the positions of all my joints move) and arm motion (next often, I move my hands while my body stays still). However, I'd expect the PCs that have very low variance would be mostly noise, but they are HIGHLY correlated among all participants. Is there a statistical reason this would happen, or is this likely due to the fact that joints move similarly across people?
