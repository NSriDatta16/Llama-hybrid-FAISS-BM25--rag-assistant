Let's say an object is a singleton at high level in complete linkage, and say that there are otherwise bigger clusters. This means only that the maximum distances between the object and the other clusters are large; the singleton object can still be close to quite a number of objects of the clusters, and is therefore not necessarily an outlier. A high level singleton of single linkage is separated from all clusters, its minimum distance to all clusters is large, so its distance to all other objects is large. In this sense it is well qualified to be called outlier. The only issue is that some people would say that there could also be small groups of outliers, which will not normally show up as singletons in any algorithm, but in single linkage an object may not be singleton anymore if it is close to one single other object. Average linkage is a compromise between these two; it can have the problem that complete linkage has potentially missing outliers, but it is less likely. I don't have much experience with the centroid method, but I'd expect it to behave similarly to average linkage in this respect. So single linkage is probably most suitable, at least if an outlier in your definition is an object that is far away from all the others.
