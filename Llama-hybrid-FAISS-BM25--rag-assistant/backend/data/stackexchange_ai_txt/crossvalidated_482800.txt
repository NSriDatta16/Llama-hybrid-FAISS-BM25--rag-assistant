I think you are looking at this from the wrong perspective. First you need to understand why you get such a high odds ratio for one of your predictors. The usual explanation for this is a phenomenon called separation. I suggest you look at this Q&A How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? particularly the answer by Scortchi which is better, in my opinion, than the accepted one. If that solves your problem then fine otherwise edit your question with details of what you have done, what you found, and ask what to try next.
