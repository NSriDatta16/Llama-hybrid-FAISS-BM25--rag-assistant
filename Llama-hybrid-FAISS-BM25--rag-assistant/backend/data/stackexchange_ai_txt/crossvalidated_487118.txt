Basic mean question

Learned today in stats this cool piece of information: If you wanted to optimize the $(y-\overline{y})^2$ or differences squared, of some data. Where $\overline{y}$ is a constant y = number, then you get the average or mean. Basically if you want to do a one dimensional regression where the best fit line is $y= b$ . $b$ is the mean. If you do this but you want to just optimize $(y-\overline{y})$ then you get some number that isn't the mean. This was mind blowing to me that the best fit line $y=b$ of data is the mean. Why does the mean come from these differences squared and not the differences?
