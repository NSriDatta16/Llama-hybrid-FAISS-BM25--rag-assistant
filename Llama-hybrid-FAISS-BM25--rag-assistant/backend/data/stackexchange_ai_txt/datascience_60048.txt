Time series modelling

I have daily data for 2.5 years , but with more data points as 0, so when i excluded them in the cases which seems to be invalid. Can i use any other model than models used in time series or should i consider time series with missing values and proceed ? since they are quite a lot of missing values and am new to time series i dont know how to proceed with this. Any input is highly appreciated.
