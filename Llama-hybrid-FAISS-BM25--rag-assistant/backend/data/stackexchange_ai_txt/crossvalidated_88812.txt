The random forest variable importance scores are aggregate measures. They only quantify the impact of the predictor, not the specific effect. You could fix the other predictors to a single value and get a profile of predicted values over a single parameter (see partialPlot in the randomForest package). Otherwise, fit a parametric model where you can estimate specific structural terms. Your other question is about the effect of CITY and STATE . You may have used the formula interface when creating the model (i.e. function(y ~ ., data = dat) ). In this case, the formula interface might be breaking up the factor into dummy variables (as it should). You might try using a non-formula interface where x has the predictors (in factor form), y is the outcome and the call function(x, y) . That will avoid dummy variable creation and treat a factor predictor as a cohesive set.
