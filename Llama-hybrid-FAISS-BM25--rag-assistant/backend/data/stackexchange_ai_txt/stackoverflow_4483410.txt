IPHONE: UIAlertView called twice in a custom function/IBAction

i have an IBAction which does some processing and within will have a few UIAlertViews (to show alerts). However it seems that the FIRST alert in the paragraph is being called TWICE (once immediately after i clicked and another time after all the other alerts has occured). Additionally, the first time the alert appears, the alert automatically closes even though i have an OK button and the user has not clicked on it. The 2nd time the alert appears, it will require the user to click on OK. I tried moving the paragraph out from IBAction into its own function but still the problem occurs. all the alerts in my IBAction/function are the same: UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"blah" message:@"blah" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil,nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; but the other alerts function normally. the code looks like this ("blah" is the one being called twice): -(void)function { if (......) { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"blah" message:@"blah" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil,nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; for (int i=0; i please help!
