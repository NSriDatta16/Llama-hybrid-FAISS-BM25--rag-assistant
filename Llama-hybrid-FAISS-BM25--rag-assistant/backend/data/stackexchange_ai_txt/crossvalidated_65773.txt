When computing the $r^2$ between the histogram and the continuous PDF, one should use the normalized values of the histogram (indicative of frequencies, such that the area of the histogram is 1) and the mean of the PDF in each bin (the integral over the range of each bin, normalized by the width of the bin). See this webpage for a description of how to obtain a continuous function's mean within a given range. Note, however, that other statistics may be more appropriate for assessing goodness of fit between the observed distribution and the PDF. Two suggested in the comments to my question are the $\chi^2$ statistic (thanks, @AdamO) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Zhang and Luck (2008, 2009) calculated these in addition to $r^2$. Specifically, $r^2$ is inappropriate when the PDF being compared to the data is the uniform function, for the reasons @whuber states in one of his comments. @NickCox claims in one of his comments that all three of these measures are inappropriate for circular data. @NickCox offers the Kuiper statistic as the best measure for testing the goodness of fit in the present scenario (thanks for that!), but claims it is unlikely to be available in software. This pessimism is unfounded: The KS test is available in the SciPy package for Python as scipy.stats.kstest (see the documentation here ), and the results from this function can be used to calculate the Kuiper statistic (see this webpage for the latter statistic's definition). It appears at least one user of Python has written code that directly calculates the Kuiper statistic. As most reviewers of scientific papers are unlikely to be satisfied with the use of a single measure of goodness of fit, I recommend using several, perhaps all, of the suggested statistics. Another option, vaguely alluded to by @NickCox, is to compare the fits of different models with something like the Bayesian Information Criterion (see van den Berg et al. [ PNAS , 2012] for an example of its application) or the Akaike Information Criterion (see Fougnie et al. [ Nat Commun , 2012]).
