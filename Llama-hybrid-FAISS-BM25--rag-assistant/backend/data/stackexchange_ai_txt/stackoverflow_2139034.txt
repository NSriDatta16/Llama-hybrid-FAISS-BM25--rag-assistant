HTML5 localStorage for assets (stylesheets, JavaScript, images etc)

To save both client download time and network usage, is it possible to use the localStorage feature of HTML5 to store contents of linked stylesheets, javascript files and binary data (e.g. images), rather than hitting the server each time? Would that just complicate things - since I assume you would have to add the linked asset via JavaScript rather than just a script or link element, breaking the page for those without JavaScript enabled)? Unless you can parse the content (using HEAD requested to check last modified date and other headers) before the browser downloads it. Or best just to stick with 304 Not Modified and eTag headers?
