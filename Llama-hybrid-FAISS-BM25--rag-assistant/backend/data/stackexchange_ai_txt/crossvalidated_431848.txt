How does BATS model work?

I am using BATS on a univariate time series model. I have observed strange behaviour. I have data from 2016 to till date (weekly level). If actual are considered from 2016 to 2019 May, I have used 2019 June, July, Aug for validation. The model does pretty good job. However if I include June 2019 for training, it gives out a straight line (constant number) for next 80 periods. Can some expert explain this phenomena?i wonder how one month inclusion of actual have such effect on bats model. Using the forecast package in R Thanks
