I'm not sure switching to gant will solve your problems. Gant is just writing build files in groovy instead of xml. I think your issue lays more in the way you're using ant. Hard to say without more details, but phrases like "dumb amount of duplication" and "copying build files around" make me think you could be using ant more efficiently. If you haven't already, look at your ant tasks, and see if you can refactor them so eliminate that duplication. Also, checkout the -find option to ant if you haven't seen it already. You shouldn't need to be copying build files around. BTW, Ivy is for dependency management, not building.
