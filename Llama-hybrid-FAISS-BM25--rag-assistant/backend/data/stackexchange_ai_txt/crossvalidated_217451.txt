Estimate value of dependent variable such that P(Y>y|X=x) = p

I want to model a dependent variable Y on an independent variable X (and possibly some covariates as well). In my situation, it is safe to assume that the relationship is monotonically increasing. Once the model is built, I will have new observations of X. For each, I want to estimate the value of Y such that the new case has probability p of exceeding the estimate. This is sort of like a reverse of logistic regression. Instead of fixing the cutoff criterion for Y to be considered a success and estimating for each case the probability of success given the observed value of X, I want to fix the probability of success and estimate for each case the cutoff criterion for Y given the observed value of X. I know that, if I have a bivariate normal distribution, the distribution of a prediction is a location-scaled t distribution whose parameters can be derived from the regression model and the observed X value, and so I can use the quantile function of that distribution to find the desired value of Y. However, if there exists a statistical technique designed for the current purpose, and which makes fewer assumptions (or is more robust to violations of assumptions) than linear regression, I'd prefer to use that instead.
