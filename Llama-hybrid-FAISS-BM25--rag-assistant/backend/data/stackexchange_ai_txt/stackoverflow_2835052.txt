There is no such concept as a "line event" unless you decide to implement one. I would suggest adding a MouseListener and a MouseMotionListener to the Canvas or JPanel onto which your geometric shapes are drawn. Use the MouseListener 's mousePressed(MouseEvent) callback to determine whether a given shape has been clicked on. Once you've established this, use MouseMotionListener 's mouseDragged(MouseEvent) method to move and redraw the shape as the mouse cursor is moved.
