Already an excellent SE answer about this. To summarize quickly, a GLMM gives parameters estimates for individuals, and GEE gives marginally estimated parameters (for the population). So, if you would like to describe average characteristics of the population, I'd elect for GEE. If you'd prefer subject-specific interpretations, go for GLMM. Both are easy enough to fit in modern software, though the definition of your variance structure may have an impact (if events are less correlated over time, you may choose GEE with an "autoregressive working correlation" structure; while if each individual has an unknown effect on the probability for their unit, an individual "random effect" from GLMM may be best). For more information, I'd read the excellent answer linked above.
