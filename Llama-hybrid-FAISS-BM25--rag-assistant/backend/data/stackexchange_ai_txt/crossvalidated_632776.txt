Textbook Recommendation other than ESL

My current background is as follows: (core subjects only) Math : Linear Algebra, Analysis, (half of) Measure Theory Stats : Mathematical Statistics, Regression Analysis, Multivariate Analysis "half of Measure Theory" means I've covered upto the ch.4 (Intro. to Hilbert Space) of Stein's Real Analysis. My advisor recommended me to study some chapters of a book The Elements of Statistical Learning , including the following chapters: ch3. Linear Methods for Regression ch4. Linear Methods for Classification ch5. Basis Expansions and Regularization ch6. Kernel Smoothing Method ch12. Support Vector Machines and Flexible Discriminants. His main interest is focused on those chapters, so I've tried to self-study them. But, after reading the textbook, I found the book difficult to self-study. That is, there seem to be a number of omission so that I can't fully understand the mathematical expressions in the book such as why the expression holds or where it came from etc. So I want to get some recommendation about other textbooks covering the same (or similar) topics of the above chapters that introduce more rigorous mathematical explanations on those theories. Thank you.
