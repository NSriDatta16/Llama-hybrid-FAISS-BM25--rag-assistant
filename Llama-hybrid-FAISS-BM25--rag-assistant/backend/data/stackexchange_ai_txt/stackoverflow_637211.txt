The choice is not going to be able to please everyone. Robert Sedgewick has written his "Algorithms in..." books in multiple languages . I had the C version for a course and bought the C++ version when I started working with C++ at work. You can't escape language features (even pseudo language features). To try to please as many people as possible you could choose two languages, say one functional and one not. It could help illustrate motivations in algorithm choice.
