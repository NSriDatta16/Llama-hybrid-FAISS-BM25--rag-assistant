Which machine learning/AI method is this problem related to?

I am new to machine learning and AI, and I am working on a problem in which I need to clean a table (database) of text/words. For example I should delete words like and, the, etc. , or replace words like COMP with company or substitute other acronyms with the suitable words. I wanted to find some resources on the techniques proposed for this purpose and to find what else I can do to better clean the table. Thanks for your help.
