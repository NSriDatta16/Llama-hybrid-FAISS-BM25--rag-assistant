On HTML5 compatible browsers I would save these on the local storage. You can detect a new tab open like this: on page load set a cookie by javascript use the onbeforeunload event to clear the cookie When the visitor will open your site, it will set a cookie eg session=1 , if they click on a new link on your site, when they leave the site the cookie will be eg session=0 but as soon as they arrive again on your site it will be session=1 . When the visitor will open a new tab, it will encounter a session=1 so probably will do that session=2 . You got the point?
