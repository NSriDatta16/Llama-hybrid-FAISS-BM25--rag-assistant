One way to cheat might be to use a probabilistic cellular automaton with a well-chosen transition table to simulate the motion of the blobs. Some popular screensavers (in particular ParticleFire) use this approach to elegantly simulate complex motions in 2D space by breaking the objects down to individual pixels and then defining the ways in which individual pixels transition by looking at the states of their neighbors. You can get some pretty emergent behavior with simple cellular automata - look at Conway's game of life , for example, or this simulation of a forest fire .
