Why does $r^2$ between two variables represent proportion of shared variance?

Firstly, I appreciate that discussions about $r^2$ generally provoke explanations about $R^2$ (i.e., the coefficient of determination in regression). The problem I'm seeking to answer is generalizing that to all instances of correlation between two variables. So, I've been puzzled about shared variance for quite a while. I've had a few explanations offered but they all seem problematic: It's just another term for covariance. This can't be the case, as factor analysis literature differentiates between PCA and EFA by stating that the latter accounts for shared variance and the former does not (PCA obviously is accounting for covariance in that it is operating over a covariance matrix, so shared variance must be a distinct concept). It is the correlation coefficient squared ($r^2$). See: http://www.philender.com/courses/linearmodels/notes1/var1.html , or http://www.strath.ac.uk/aer/materials/4dataanalysisineducationalresearch/unit6/correlationcoefficient/ This makes slightly more sense. The trouble here is interpreting how that implies it is shared variance. For example, one interpretation of 'sharing variance' is ${\rm cov}(A,B)/[{\rm var}(A)+{\rm var}(B)]$. $r^2$ doesn't reduce to that, or indeed a readily intuitive concept [${\rm cov}(A,B)^2/({\rm var}(A)\times{\rm var}(B))$; which is a 4 dimensional object]. The links above both attempt to explain it via a Ballentine diagram. They don't help. Firstly, the circles are equally sized (which seems to be important to the illustration for some reason), which doesn't account for unequal variances. One could assume it is the Ballentine diagrams for the standardized variables, hence equal variance, in which case the overlapping segment would account for the covariance between two standardized variables (the correlation). So $r$, not $r^2$. TL;DR: Explanations of shared variance say this: By squaring the coefficient, you know how much variance, in percentage terms, the two variables share. Why would that be the case?
