Nice try, but the '0' for the first outcome is a prefix for the third and fourth outcomes. How would you decode the sequence 0010100? Is it 1121211, or 3134, or 1443, or what? The problem arises because of DELIMITERS, and once you include them, the average number of bits increases. And did you mean that H(X) = lg(4) = 2 was the UPPER bound?
