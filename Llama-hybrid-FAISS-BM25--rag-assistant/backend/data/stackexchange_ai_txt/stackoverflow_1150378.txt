One of the central tenants of DB theory is that data is stored unsorted. The idea is that there's many ways that people might want to sort the data down the road, so applying a particular sort order to the raw storage is wasteful. It's just an accident / implementation detail that DBMSs display unsorted data in the order that it was inserted (and I've seen cases where that's not always true as well). If you want a particular order to your data, you should apply that desire explicitly using order by clauses (and potentially indexes).
