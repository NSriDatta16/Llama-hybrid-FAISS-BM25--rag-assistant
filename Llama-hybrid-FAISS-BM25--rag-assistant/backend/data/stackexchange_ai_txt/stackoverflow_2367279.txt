Per MSDN documentation, there is no public constructor for the Lookup class: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb460184.aspx You can create an instance of a Lookup by calling ToLookup on an object that implements IEnumerable . You will want to do something like: new Component { ID = 1, Name = "MOBO", Category = new[] { … }.ToLookup(…) } Update to address comments: I'm not sure where you are getting your category info from, so I will make something up… new Component { ID = 1, Name = "MOBO", Category = new Dictionary { { 3, "Beverages" } { 5, "Produce" } }.ToLookup(o => o.Key, o => o.Value) } My guess is that your categories will come from some other source instead of instantiating a dictionary like I did here.
