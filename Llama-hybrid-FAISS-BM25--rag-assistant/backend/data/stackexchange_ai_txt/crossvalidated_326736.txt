How to solve crossword puzzle by Machine Learning?

If we have enough crossword puzzles with answers in our database, is that possible to build a Machine Learning model to solve crossword puzzles? I read the paper: Learning to Understand Phrases by Embedding the Dictionary But this paper is mostly about finding the word for each question. How to put the constraints, i.e. word length and letter sharing, into the algorithm? I was thinking about nearest neighbor to find all possible words and filter by the constraints. Is there any other straightforward way?
