Nodes can be added and removed freely from the graph, and nodes don't have to be connected. So it doesn't matter if changes to your graph create disconnected nodes or sub-graphs. You'll probably want to keep track of them in an index, both for direct look-up and to not lose disconnected nodes since they can't be reached by a traversal. Deleting a node first requires that all relationships to the node have been deleted. Neoclipse is a little out of date at the moment, compatible with earlier 1.1.x versions of Neo4j. Some licensing issues have been worked out and that should get some attention soon.
