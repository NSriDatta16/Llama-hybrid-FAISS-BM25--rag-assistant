The 301 redirect means "moved permanently" and is the correct way to move pages as far as search engines are concerned. If you do a URL rewrite, which would return the .aspx page to the user agent but at the original .asp URL, the search engine will be no wiser and will continue to keep your old URL in its index. If you decide to use this approach, you can implement the rewrite using an HTTP module in the ASP.NET pipeline - there is a URL Rewrite plug-in for IIS which will do this and is easy to configure. The drawback is that you have to maintain this forever. I would recommend continuing to use a 301 redirect and be patient while Google re-jigs its index. Don't forget the Google web-master tools that can help you with this kind of transition.
