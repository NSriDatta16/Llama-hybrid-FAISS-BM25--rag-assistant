Call the HDOP the independent variable. Use this for weighting later on. So you have sets of co-ordinates - call this (x1,y1); (x2,y2), etc... First ignore outliers. Calculate the weighted averages of the x co-ordinates as [(x1*h1)+(x2*h2) +....+ (xn*hn)] / [sum(h1,h2,...,hn)] where h1,h2,... is the HDOP value. Do the same for the y co-ordinates. This will give a fairly accurate average value for each co-ordinate. Dealing with outliers can be a bit tricky. How do you know if they are outliers or not? Strictly you need to determine a statistical fit to the observations and within a confidence interval determine if they are genuine or not. Looking at the question the Poison Distribution does come to mind. But this is probably a lot of work and I'm sure you don't want to go into this. Maybe use an approximation? Say you assume that the average co-ordinate value is a good mean to use. Then determine a value for the standard deviation. I think the standard dev or the poison distribution is 1/(mean). Then approximate using the normal distribution and a 95% confidence interval. Say if an observation is outside the interval (mean-*1.645*std dev ; mean + 1.645*std dev) then it is an outlier? Give this a go. Maybe go do a bit of reading on the poison distribution and incorporate the HDOP value into this?
