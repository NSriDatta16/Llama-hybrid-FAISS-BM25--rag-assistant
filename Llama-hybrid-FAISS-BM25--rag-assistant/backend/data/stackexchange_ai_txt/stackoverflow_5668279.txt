Programming Traditional Artists' Materials and Tools

Where is the Body of Knowledge for programmers interested in developing applications that simulate traditional artists' materials and tools, such as simulating natural paints? Is there any substantial body of knowledge or resource for software engineers interested in creating applications that reproduce the effect of painting and drawing media such as watercolor, oil, chalk, charcoal and color pencil? Clearly the knowledge exists and is shared by software engineers at Adobe, Corel, etc. But out here in the open, where is this information? So far I've only come across fragmentary knowledge of a little technique here or there, but have not yet found any substantial resource. If you know where I need to look, please point me there. Where are the best academic resources? Are there any blogs that specialize in this area? Are their organizations that specialize in this?
