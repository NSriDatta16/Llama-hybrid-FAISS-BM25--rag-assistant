I think poll results were extrapolated to the extent of the public assuming the voter demographics will be similar to poll taker demographics and would be a good representation of the whole population. For example, if 7 out of 10 minorities supported Hillary in the polls, and if that minority represents 30% of the US population, the majority of polls assumed 30% of voters will be represented by that minority and translated to that 21% gain for Hillary. In reality, white, middle-to-upper class males were better represented among the voters. Less than 50% of eligible people voted and this didn't translate into 50% off all genders, races, etc. Or, polls assumed perfect randomization and based their models on that but in reality the voter data was biased toward older middle-to-upper class males. Or, the polls didn't exactly assume perfect randomization but their extrapolation parameters underestimated the heterogeneity of voter demographics. ETA: Polls of previous two elections performed better because of increased attention to voting by groups that aren't usually represented well.
