Difference between lag plot and acf plot

I am not sure if I understand the difference clearly between ggAcf and gglagplot. Specifically, from lag.plot documentation in R 'Plot time series against lagged versions of themselves. Helps visualizing ‘auto-dependence’ even when auto-correlations vanish.' In summary, I think I am not very clear about how to interpret gglagplot, but I think I have some fair understanding about ggAcf
