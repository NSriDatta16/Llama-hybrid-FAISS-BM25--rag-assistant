A few things to note. Most obvious, but probably least important, you model age as a continuous linear predictor in the first model but as a factor in the second model. Second, note that your second model is actually a set of 4 separate models done on 4 different subsets the data. The effects of temperature, humidity, age, gender, and job are modeled separately within each subset, rather than all together as they are in the first model. That could certainly lead to this type of result. (That's pretty much what Nick Cox is saying in a comment that appeared as I was writing this.) Third, the results from the separation into 4 models will differ depending on the distributions of the Pollutant values within each of the quartiles. For example, if for one or more quartiles they are bunched near one of the edges of the quartile cutoffs, comparing the results against the continuous fit could be quite misleading. (That's related to what Frank Harrell says in the first paragraph of his answer.)
