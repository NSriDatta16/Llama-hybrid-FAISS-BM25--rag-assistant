Two other methods worth mentioning here are: 1) Lundberg & Lee's SHAP algorithm, an extension of Å trumbelj & Kononenko's game theoretic approach that they claim unifies LIME and a number of other local importance measures; and 2) Wachter et al.'s counterfactual method, based on generative adversarial networks. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. SHAP is very fast and comes with a user-friendly Python implementation . Unfortunately, however, it always compares points against the data centroid, which may not be the relevant contrast in some cases. Also, like LIME and a number of other algorithms, it assumes (or enforces) local linearity, which can lead to unstable or uninformative results when our case of interest is near a distinctly nonlinear region of the decision boundary or regression surface. Wachter et al.'s solution is more flexible in this regard, a refreshing deviation from what Lundberg & Lee call the "additive feature attribution" paradigm. I'm unaware of any open source implementation, however. The added overhead of GAN training can also be extremely onerous for some datasets.
