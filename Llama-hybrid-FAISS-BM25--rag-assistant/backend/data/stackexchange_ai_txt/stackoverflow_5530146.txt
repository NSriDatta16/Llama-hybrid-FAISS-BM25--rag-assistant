If you will be working with UNIX-like systems, then I recommend Programming With POSIX Threads by David R. Butenhof. If you will be working with Microsoft Windows, then I recommend Writing Multithreaded Applications in Win32 by Jim Beveridge and Robert Wiener. Irrespective of which threading package(s) you will end up using, I recommend you look at two presentations I wrote: Generic Synchronization Policies and Multi-threaded Performance Pitfalls . Those short presentations contain useful information that, unfortunately, is not discussed in many other books and articles.
