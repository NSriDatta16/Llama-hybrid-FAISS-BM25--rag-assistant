Running into this question myself. I think an approach might be to use something like phpQuery to make your tests less fragile. Instead of testing for exact output, test that there should be an h3 tag ~somewhere~ in the output. If it gets wrapped in a div later because a designer needed to tack on an extra background, or because of some ie6 float bug workaround, then your test still works. It's not very pure, but still potentially a very useful tool.
