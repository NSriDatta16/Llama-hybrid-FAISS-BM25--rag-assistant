Ooh yes, little problem there. As a rule, if you're going to be manipulating strings from inside a function, the storage for those strings had better be outside the function. The easy way to achieve this is to declare arrays outside the function (e.g. in main() ) and to pass the arrays (which automatically become pointers to their beginnings) to the function. This works fine as long as your result strings don't overflow the space allocated in the arrays. You've gone the more versatile but slightly more difficult route: You use malloc() to create space for your results (good so far!) and then try to assign the malloc'd space to the pointers you pass in. That, alas, will not work. The pointer coming in is a value; you cannot change it. The solution is to pass a pointer to a pointer, and use it inside the function to change what the pointer is pointing to. If you got that, great. If not, please ask for more clarification.
