Okay, I've found that the following code works in all orientations without any issues (In my case there are no overlapping views so this is appropriate for me): -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *t = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point = [t locationInView:self]; for(CALayer *layer in self.layer.sublayers) { CGPoint convertedPoint = [self.layer convertPoint:point toLayer:layer]; if([layer containsPoint:convertedPointPoint]) { NSLog(@"%@",layer.name); } } } While this manual point conversion works correctly, the question still remains as to why the original method call did not. Can anybody enlighten me? Adam
