"Repeat a large number of times". I think you're saying you have 24 observations in total. It is probably easier to identify by hand the observations that appear being an outlier and removing those by hand. It might be hard to get the full characterization of the maximum with such a limited set of observations without dredging over the high leverage points you might have in your dataset. What I am saying is that high(er) leverage points are those which might skew your results and having only 24 results give quite a high prob of having those picked; and that would skew the distribution of the max. I am not sure if the concentrations you're monitoring are determined by external environmental factors or by the action of a human. In any case, perhaps, traditional sensitivity analysis would help. Sensitivity analysis, in my jargon, means changing the value of a feature by x% from the value in the optimal set of parameters. That would help assess, e.g, how much more biomass we would have if we increase something by x%
