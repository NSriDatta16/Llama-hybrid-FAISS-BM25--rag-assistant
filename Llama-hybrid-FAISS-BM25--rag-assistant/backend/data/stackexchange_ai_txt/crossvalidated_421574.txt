why we should use neural network in detecting objects like detecting license plates

Am learning some techniques to be able to detect license plate accurately But I saw some recent researches talk about DEEP learning or Neural network (NN) for reaching best results. do I should use it for detecting the plates accurately, I need just advice to start working in the right away? .I implement some methods to detect object using python and OpenCV 3.1.16 and test my code on California plates it gave me some good results, but when I rotate them a bit for 5 degrees or 10 some My system gave me poor results. if I should use NN - is the training dataset just cropped plates ? or some characters images - if the images have rotation means I should wide my training data set after that, if for example need to extract the plate took each cropped plate and search for it in the image ?
