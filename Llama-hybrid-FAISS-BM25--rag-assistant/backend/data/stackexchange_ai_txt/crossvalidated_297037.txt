How to classify mixed data?

I am trying to do some classification tasks on mixed data set (Hepatitis data set)from UCI ,I will apply SVM and Naive Bayes in R & WEKA, both of them can not handle mixed data directly. Naive Bayes for example deals with categorical data only, in this case I need to convert numerical to nominal for Naive Bayes ,or dummy the variables for SVM, I am not sure if I am dong the correct steps or no , does any body has any idea how can the two algorithms deal with such data?
