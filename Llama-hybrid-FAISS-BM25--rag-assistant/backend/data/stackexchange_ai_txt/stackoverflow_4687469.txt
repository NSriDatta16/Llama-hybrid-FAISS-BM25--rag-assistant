After further research on lambdas, I've discovered they will give me a much more elegant solution and it does not use reflection So I used in my list definition public delegate MyBaseType TypeCreator(); ... public TypeCreator Creator; and in my function call, a simple and elegant lambda: AddToList(()=>{return new MyType();}); I think this is quite a bit cleaner than my reflection method because it allows putting parameters into the constructor, and a few other reasons outside of the scope of this question. (It just goes with my project well)
