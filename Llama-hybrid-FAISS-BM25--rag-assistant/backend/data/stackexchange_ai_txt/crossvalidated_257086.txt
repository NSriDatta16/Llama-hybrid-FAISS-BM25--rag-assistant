Finding the prior of a Bayesian model based on test data

I have a Bayesian modelling problem different somehow from standard modelling problems I have come across. Instead of learning a posterior estimation of the parameters from some data, we are interested in learning the prior given two separate sets of data: input/training data (which gives likelihood) and output/test data sampled from posterior. The simplest example: Assume we have a coin. A person observes a number of coin flips, e.g. [0, 0, 0]. He is then asked to sample (predict) a number of next coin flips, e.g. [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. Weâ€™re interested in estimating the prior on the coin probability p the person had in the beginning (for these data, it's some bias in favor of a fair coin). Is there a body of literature on this type of problems (of course to deal with more complicated data and models)? I'm looking for at least some key words to start with. Is there any software dedicated to finding priors efficiently? I'll appreciate all comments / ideas, thanks!
