Dojo dnd: Avatar positioning

Is it possible to change the positioning of the avatar with dojo toolkit's dnd api? At the moment, when dragging, the avatar of the dragged item appears to the right and below the mouse cursor. I want it to be in the same position as the mouse cursor. I ran some usability tests on my application, and most people seem to attempt to try and drag the avatar into the drop area, as opposed to moving the cursor over the drop area. Any input would be nice. Thanks!
