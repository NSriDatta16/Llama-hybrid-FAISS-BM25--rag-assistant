The other answers work well, again, as they said, except for IE6/7. However, realize that you will not affect margin between paragraphs if you set your p bottom margin to 0 as long as you set your top margin for p to be the greater of the two values that your margins are currently. As long as you don't have an issue setting the ul top margin to 0 then your p margin spacing will not be affected. So let's say you have this currently defined: p {margin: 10px} Setting it to this: p {margin: 10px 10px 0} Will not affect your margin between p tags (which seems to be your concern), as the 10px bottom margin is collapsing with the top to make the gap only 10px . If your bottom margin is currently set greater than the top margin, you will need to change your top margin to the greater value to see the same spacing you have been. Now, if you want some bottom margin on the last p then you will have to accommodate for that. If what the user types ends up in a specific wrapper div that you can target (via id or class ), then you could just set these styles for p and ul to apply only within that wrapper if that is a concern.
