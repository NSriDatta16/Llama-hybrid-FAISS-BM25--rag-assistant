jmap not working on windows server 2003

jmap works fine for me on XP. But when I try to execute the command, it throws and error Not enough storage available to process. I used the following command jmap -dump:format=b,file=heap1.bin . Note that tomcat is running as a service on windows server. I tried the same on windows xp and no problems there. Any ideas?? Thanks
