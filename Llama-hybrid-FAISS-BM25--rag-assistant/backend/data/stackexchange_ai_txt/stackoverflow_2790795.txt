When you call the deleteImage($item, $unid) function, which image element are you trying to delete? This is important as that will take the place of the $(this) . Say you want to remove the first tag in the gallery, then you can trigger a click on that item as follows: $(document).ready(function(){ $('ul.gallery > li:first').trigger('click'); }) Wrapping that trigger function inside of a document.ready function will call the function on page load (after the DOM is fully loaded) And one more note, there is no need to wrap the ui.draggable object because it is already a jQuery object... this will work : ui.draggable.attr('id');
