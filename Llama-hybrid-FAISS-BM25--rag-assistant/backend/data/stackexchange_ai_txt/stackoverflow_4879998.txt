Both UIFont and CTFont just hold information about a particular font, and they are immutable. However, you can create an NSAttributedString or an NSMutableAttributedString and apply some properties to some sections of the underlying string. I do not know if the properties you mention specifically in your question can be modified, though, but many can, like weight, appearance, size, kerning, spacing, etc. Check out the documentation on CTParagraphStyleRef for information about the properties that can be modified when displaying attributed strings.
