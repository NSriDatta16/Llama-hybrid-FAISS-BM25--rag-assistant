The answer to your question has two elements. Operationalinalization of scientific concepts to make them measurable Statistics estimated on measured quantities In step 1 of the process you would define what you mean by the 'vaguely' defined concept, such as customer value. In science you need to be clear on what you mean by a concept before you can systematically observe it. Second you need to come to an operational definition: how can you make the concept you theoretically defined measurable? For example you could take answers to the question "Do you like brand xyz?" (yes/no) from a survey questionnaire as operational definition of high customer value. If that's a good operationalization is then debatable, but you have made it clear. In step 2 you start the statistics and their use always depends on your goal (research question). If you want to predict when a brand has high customer value, then the variable measuring that concept becomes the dependent variable in an analysis, which could be logistic regression, for example. Which is the appropriate staistical method often depends on the distribution of the variable, which in case of dichotomous variables like answers to yes/no questions is often binomial, and hence logistic regression is appropriate.
