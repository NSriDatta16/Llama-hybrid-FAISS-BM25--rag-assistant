Raghu, I don't think that the problem is the default page. The problem is that there is an error with your installation. Check the event log: Admin \ Event Viewer. I'm guessing you'll find errors there. You have many dotnetnuke questions that are much better handled on the dotnetnuke forum , it is very actively managed, and there you will find many people who can help you get started with dotnetnuke.
