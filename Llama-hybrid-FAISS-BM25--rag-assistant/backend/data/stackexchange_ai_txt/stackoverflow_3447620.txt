How to evaluate jQuery on the server in c#

Following Rick Strahl's example we evaluate javascript on the server. Now I want to leverage jQuery. However, evaluating the jQuery script gives an error: 'Expected identifier or string' Any clue what this might be? Ultimately I want to render jQuery Templates on the server in the same way as they are rendered in the browser.
