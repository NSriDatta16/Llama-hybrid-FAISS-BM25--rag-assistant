Since the time for the bounty expired and I received no answers, I'll post the answer I was able to come up with, though my limited experience with Bayesian inference suggests that this should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. I) Setup I downloaded & installed JAGS 3.4 and R 3.0.1 I installed the packages rjags and coda by initiating R and using install.packages(pkgname) II) Model & Data - Used the model & data files already detailed in the question. To answer question #1, I added one additional observation onto the data with all four variables as 0. III) Answering questions I ran JAGS on the model/data (open the command line, go the the directory with your files, and type > jags-terminal Command.cmd . It ran and output a few files In R, I used the following commands: library("rjags") to load the installed package (and its required package coda) setwd() to get to the directory where the outputfiles were results=read.coda("STEMchain1.txt","STEMindex.txt") To answer the first question: As a PDF plot, "plot(results[,3*N])" As quantiles, "quantile(results[,3*N],c(0.025,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.975))" Where N is the number of observations, and the last observation corresponds to the position of the "all 0's" observation. (1 to n is for variable p_A, n+1 to 2n is for p_B, and 2n+1 to 3n is for delta) To answer the second question, same as above, but change 3*N -> 2*N+y I'm not sure this is the correct way to get the answer, or whether a more complex model would produce better results, particularly in the case of correlation, but hopefully eventually someone more experienced will chime in...
