TFS Build: Fails to run tests

I am trying to setup a TFS Build, and am having trouble getting my tests to run as a part of the build. I am getting the following weird error message in the build log: D:\TeamBuild\main-production\Company-Test DEV\Sources\root\main-production\customer-projects\Company\sc6-v2\Company-DEV.vsmdi The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters. MSBUILD : warning MSB6006: "MSTest.exe" exited with code 1. The previous error was converted to a warning because the task was called with ContinueOnError=true. Build continuing because "ContinueOnError" on the task "TestToolsTask" is set to "true". Basically, it is complaining that the path to my .vsmdi is too long. But it is not, it is only about 150 characters, when the limit is stated to be 260 characters. How can I fix this ? Here is the TFSBuild.proj file: 2 Master build for CUSTOMER v-tfserver webdanmark-production D:\TeamBuild\ \\UNKNOWN\drops true Never false Bug System.Reason=Build Failure;System.Description=Start the build using Team Build Build failure in build CUSTOMERNAME: This work item was created by Team Build on a build failure. The build log file is at: The errors/warnings log file is at: true To change the order in which the solutions are built, modify the order in which the solutions appear below. To call a target (or targets) other than the default, add a metadata item named Targets. To pass custom properties to the solution, add a metadata item named Properties. For example, to call the targets MyCustomTarget1 and MyCustomTarget2, passing in properties Property1 and Property2, add the following: MyCustomTarget1;MyCustomTarget2 Property1=Value1;Property2=Value2 --> Debug x86 The Include attribute value should be unique for each ConfigurationToBuild node. --> Release Any CPU Use %2a instead of * and %3f instead of ? to prevent expansion before test assemblies are built --> Customer;Tradelink;Webdanmark.Common $(BuildProjectFolderPath)/../../customer-projects/Customer/codecoverage.testrunconfig BVT;HighPriority --> true \\test-Customer\Web\Sitecore\Customer\6.0\Website-v2\
