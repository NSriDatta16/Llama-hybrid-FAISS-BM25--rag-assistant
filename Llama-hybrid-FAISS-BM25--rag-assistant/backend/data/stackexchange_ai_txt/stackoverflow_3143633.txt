Is there an automatic release with setTitle (UIButton class)?

As everyone knows, setTitle automatically retains the string passed as a parameter. When the button caption needs to be changed, I guess that it is necesary to release the current (old) string before setting the new one. I wonder what is the most elegant way to dot it. See my code sample (here, getPlayerHandFromGame method produces autoreleased strings which are retained when setTitle is invoked): colourString = [pGame getPlayerHandFromGame:1 withColour:COLOUR_HEARTS]; // Split colourString into array of strings if not null. if ([colourString length] != 0) { listCards = [colourString componentsSeparatedByString:@" "]; for (cardCounterSameColour = 1; cardCounterSameColour This portion of code will be called several times since the button caption will be updated several times. I guess that before setting the title, I should do something like this: [currentCardButton titleForState:UIControlStateNormal release] in order to release the string which will not be used anymore (titleForState returns a pointer to the NSString). Is that the right way to avoid that the device memory gets loaded with unused strings ? Many thanks, Apple92
