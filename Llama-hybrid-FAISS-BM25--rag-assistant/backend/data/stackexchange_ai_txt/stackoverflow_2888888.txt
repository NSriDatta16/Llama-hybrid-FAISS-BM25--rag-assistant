Java reference storage question

In java, when you pass an object to a method as a parameter, it is actually passing a reference, or a pointer, to that object because objects in Java are references. Inside the function, it has a pointer to that object which is a location in memory. I am wondering where this pointer lives in memory? Is a new memory location created once inside the function to hold this reference?
