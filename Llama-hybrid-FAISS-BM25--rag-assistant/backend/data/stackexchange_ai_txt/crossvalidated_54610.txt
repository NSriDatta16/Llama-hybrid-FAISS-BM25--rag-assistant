Formula suggestion for a scoring system, weighted solution

I'm trying to validate a series of words that are provided by users. I'm trying to come up with a scoring system that will determine the likelihood that the series of words are indeed valid words. Assume the following input: xxx yyy zzz The first thing I do is check each word individually against a database of words that I have. So, let's say that xxx was in the database, so we are 100% sure it's a valid word. Then let's say that yyy doesn't exist in the database, but a possible variation of its spelling exist (say yyyy ). We don't give yyy a score of 100%, but maybe something lower (let's say 90%). Then zzz just doesn't exist at all in the database. So, zzz gets a score of 0%. So we have something like this: xxx = 100% yyy = 90% zzz = 0% Assume further that the users are either going to either: Provide a list of all valid words (most likely) Provide a list of all invalid words (likely) Provide a list of a mix of valid and invalid words (not likely) As a whole, what is a good scoring system to determine a confidence score that xxx yyy zzz is a series of valid words? I'm not looking for anything too complex, but getting the average of the scores doesn't seem right. If some words in the list of words are valid, I think it increases the likelihood that the word not found in the database is an actual word also (it's just a limitation of the database that it doesn't contain that particular word). NOTE: The input will generally be a minimum of 2 words (and mostly 2 words), but can be 3, 4, 5 (and maybe even more in some rare cases). EXAMPLE 1: Say the following scores: xxx = 100% yyy = 100% zzz = 0% The average is 66.66%. But since already two words in the list exist in the database, the chances are that zzz is also a real word. Scoring this series of words as just 66.66% seems low.
