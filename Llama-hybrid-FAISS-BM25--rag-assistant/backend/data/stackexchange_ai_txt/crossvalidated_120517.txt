Specifying Cross-Level Interactions in LMER

I am trying to figure out if it's okay to specify cross-level interactions in a hierarchical model with fixed effect predictor variables at both levels using the lmer function, and, if so, how to do it. I have asked a few other people and have heard varying responses, with some saying that I need to use a Bayesian approach while others saying that the frequentist approach using the lmer function in the lme4 package would be fine. My data are hierarchically structured with two levels. I have one site-level variable (elevation) and two annual-level climate variables (temperature and precipitation) to predict tree growth. The annual level variables (climate variables and growth) are nested within each site (24 sites total). Each site has about 2000 growth records, for a total of approximately 50,000 data points. There are two ways I would think to write the model using lmer : model1 Thus model 1 has a random intercept for site, and allows the effects of temperature and precipitation on growth to vary depending on elevation (my site-level predictor variable). Model 2 is similar, but has a random intercept for site as well as a random slope for site and the two climate variables. For both models, I am a bit confused how the model knows that elevation is a site level predictor variable. Secondly, because I have cross-level interactions, would it be incorrect to specify model 1? My initial thought was to only use the random intercept for site with the cross-level interactions. However, in reading some of the very limited examples of cross level interactions with fixed effect predictor variables (e.g., JOM crosslevel [ pdf ], and Model specification in nlme ), I noticed that the examples provided included both a random intercept and random slope for the site level. When I compared the two models with my dataset, I noticed that the confidence of the elevationXclimate estimates were much wider (i.e., the SE for the estimate was much larger) in model 2 as compared to model 1. I am unsure if this is because model 2 is actually incorporating my hierarchical structure or if it is just because model 2 is more complex.
