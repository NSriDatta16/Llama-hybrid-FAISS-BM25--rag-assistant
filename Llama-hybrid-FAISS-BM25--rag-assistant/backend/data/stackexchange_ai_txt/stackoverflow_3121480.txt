highlight item in spark list

I have two spark lists and want to drag items from one list to the other. When im dragging an item and over the other list item, i want the target item to change the background coloer. Basically instead of showing the black line indicating that I will drop between elements, I want to see the target item highlight. Thanks in advance. Edit: Something that would look similar to this drag and drop: (source: blogspot.com )
