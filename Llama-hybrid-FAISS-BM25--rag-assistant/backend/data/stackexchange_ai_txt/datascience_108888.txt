The closest NLP task that I can think of is automatic summarization : given some text of any length, the system is supposed to produce a short summary of the most important points. I would imagine that if one provides multiple similar headlines to a good summarization system, the system should be able to output only the main information as output. It's not guaranteed that it would be exactly one sentence though.
