The task you are trying to solve is called Semantic segmentation, which assigns a label (probabilities) to each pixel. It is a supervised task so you will need some labeled data. All good algorithms that solves this task are based on deep learning. For example Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) or ENet . scikit-learn is not a good choice for deep learning. The best at the moment would be PyTorch or TensorFlow. There are many implementations of semantic segmentation in both frameworks. I personaly used this implementation .
