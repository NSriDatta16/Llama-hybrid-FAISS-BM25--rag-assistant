You will not break SourceSafe. This is an excellent way to work in your situation Update: Ignore any file that is not of direct interest to you, such as scc files. Your repository does not need to recreate the entire project, just keep track of the things you change. I do the same thing with Mercurial and CVS. The company uses CVS, and I use a local Mercurial repository that I check in whenever I like, and check in to CVS when I am happy. [aside] Changing source control systems at an individual level is fine, but for a team can often be problematic. People get used to the way source controls work, and leverage that to their advantage. Change the system without total buy in and it can take a long time for them to feel the advantages outweigh the features they have lost. While getting used to the new system they make mistakes, lose work, and can be a little remiss in thanking you for changing a system they thought worked perfectly well.
