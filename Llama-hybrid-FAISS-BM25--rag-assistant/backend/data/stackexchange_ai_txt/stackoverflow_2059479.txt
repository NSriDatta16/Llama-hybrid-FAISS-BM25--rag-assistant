Is it possible to create or exchange Javascript properties on access

I would like to have some sort of lazy initialied object properties in javascript and would thus want to somehow overload the property read and write access i.e.: var someval = myobj.lazyprop; // invokes myobj.get("lazyprop"); myobj.lazyprop = someval; // invokes myobj.set("lazyprop",someval); where myobj is some object I provide to the script. Rationale: I want to use Javascript (Rhino) as scripting engine in an application and the datastructures that need to be accessible by the scripts can be very large and complex. So I don't want to wrap them all in advance to javascript objects, esp. since the average script in this application will only need a very small subset of them. On the other hand I want the scripts to be as simple and readable as possible, so I don't want to require the use of get or set methods with string arguments explicitly in the scripts.
