c++ value initialization

I'm reading c++ primer 4th edition by Stanley Lipmann and I'm on page 92 about value initialisation. I just don't understand when about value initialisation. I browsed around and I know there are also default initialisation and zero-initialisation. Can anyone explain about value initialisation? Coming to this paragraph .. clause a) "Some classes does not define default constructor. We cannot initialise vector of such a type by specifying only a size, we must also specify an initial value" I do understand the above but I find that the below contradict the above sentence. clause b) "Element type might be of a class type that does not define any constructors. In this case, the library still creates a value-initialised object. It does so by value-initialising each member of that object" I don't understand the clause b. Any help is appreciated
