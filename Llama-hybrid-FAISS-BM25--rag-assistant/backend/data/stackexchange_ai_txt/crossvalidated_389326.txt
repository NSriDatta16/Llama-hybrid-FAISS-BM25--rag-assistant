Indeed, for dichotomous outcomes, as you seem to have here, the corresponding mixed effects model, namely a mixed effects logistic regression gives you fixed effects coefficients that have an intepretation conditional on the random effects. A detailed explanation can be found here . Most often, this is not the interpretation you want. The GEE approach does give you coefficients with a marginal / population-averaged interpretation. However, an additional practical point that you also need to consider is missing data. You have not given us enough details with regard to this point for your application, but almost always we have to deal with incomplete data. With regard to this point, mixed models give you valid results under the less stringent missing at random assmuption compared to the (standard not weighted) GEE that give you valid results under the less realistic missing completely at random assumption. Taking both points (i.e., interpretation and missing data) into account, you would most often like to fit a mixed model to be more protected for the missing data but want to obtain parameters that have a population averaged intepretation. An early solution towards this direction was the marginalized mixed models propoposed by Heagerty, but, in general, these are computionally intensive to fit. A more recent approach that seems to solve the problem has been proposed by Hedeker et al. This is implemented in the function marginal_coefs() of the R package GLMMadaptive . You can find an example on how to use this function here .
