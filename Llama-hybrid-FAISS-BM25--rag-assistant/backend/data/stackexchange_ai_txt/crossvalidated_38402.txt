Question about weighted logistic regression

I'm helping a friend perform a logistic regression on field data pulled from several archeological sites. By chance the overwhelming majority of records in the analysis dataset were collected from a single site. In order to prevent the characteristics of this one site "overwhelming" the other sites, is it appropriate to apply weights (by site) to the records, say weight=1/(stnd error)?
