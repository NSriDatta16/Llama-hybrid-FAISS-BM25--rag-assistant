Silverlight/WPF Many to Many List of Checkboxes Binding

I have an entities model with a many to many relationship. For simiplicity, lets assume its a car entity and a feature(cd player, moonroof, etc.) entity. I have a Silverlight/WPF form in which you edit the car entity. I would like to have the list of possible features (everything in the features table) be a list of checkboxes. That part is easy. However, I am trying to think of an elegant way to bind the checkboxes so that when I check, uncheck one of them, it add/removes the association between that feature and car. I know that this can easily be done with good old WinForms-style event handlers, but I would like to know if anybody has a way of doing this using data binding so that I can still keep my presentation and my logic separated
