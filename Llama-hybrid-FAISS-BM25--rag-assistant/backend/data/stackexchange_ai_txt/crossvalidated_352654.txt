How to make $h$-step interval forecasts from an ARMA-GARCH model?

I recently wrote various Python functions to fit ARMA models and make forecasts from them. I am now trying to do the same for ARMA-GARCH models. To make $h$-step forecasts from ARMA models, I used the innovations algorithm, as described in Brockwell's Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting . I was wondering whether I could still use this algorithm to make $h$-step forecasts from ARMA-GARCH models? If not, is there any good literature out there which explains how to make $h$-step interval forecasts from ARMA-GARCH models, and how to compute the prediction error?
