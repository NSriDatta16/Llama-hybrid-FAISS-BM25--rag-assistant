G'day, You can interface Perl onto C libraries by writing an XS interface between the two. Here's the perlXSTut over at CPAN . This is how the XML::LibXML and XML::LibXSLT modules are implemented. You can also interface Ada to C libraries buy means of pragma Import. This is also true for libraries written in C++. And COBOL and FORTRAN BTW. HTH cheers,
