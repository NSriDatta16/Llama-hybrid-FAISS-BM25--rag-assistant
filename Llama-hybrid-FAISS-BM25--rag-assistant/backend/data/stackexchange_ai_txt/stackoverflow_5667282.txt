I see no possible benefit to number 2 at all, it is more complex, more fragile (it would not work at all in SQL Server) and gains nothing. Remeber the groupId is without meaning except to identify a record uniquely, likely the user willonly see the group name not the id. So it doesn't matter if they all start from 0 or if there are gaps because a group was rolled back or deleted.
