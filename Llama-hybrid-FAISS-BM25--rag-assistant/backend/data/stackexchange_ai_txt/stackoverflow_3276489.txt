convert txt file with mixed spaces/tabs to tabs only (where possible)

I have some source code file which has mixed tabs/spaces and I want to convert it to a file where it has automatically replaced all indentation spaces by tabs for a given tab space length (i.e. for example tab = 2 spaces). Any easy solution (with common Unix tools, MacOSX, bash or zsh)? Some sed script or Python command or so? Thanks, Albert
