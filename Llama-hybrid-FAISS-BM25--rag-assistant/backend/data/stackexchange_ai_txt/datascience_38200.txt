Reinforcement learning: Discounting rewards in the REINFORCE algorithm

I am looking into the REINFORCE algorithm for reinforcement learning. I am having trouble understanding how rewards should be computed. The algorithm from Sutton & Barto: What does G, 'return from step t' mean here? Return from step t to step T-1, i.e. R_t + R_(t+1) + ... + R_(T-1)? Return from step 0 to step t?, i.e. R_0 + R_1 + ... + R_(t)?
