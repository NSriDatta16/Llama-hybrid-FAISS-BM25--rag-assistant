Spacy Returns Nonidentical Results for Doc. Examples?

I am getting started with Spacy, and I was just experimenting the given examples. It is weird though that when I run them over their containers using their experimental console it gives me different results than when I run them locally. For example, when I run the following example from their console, import spacy nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md') # make sure to use larger model! tokens = nlp(u'dog cat banana') for token1 in tokens: for token2 in tokens: print(token1.text, token2.text, token1.similarity(token2)) It gives me: dog dog 1.0 dog cat 0.80168545 dog banana 0.24327646 cat dog 0.80168545 cat cat 1.0 cat banana 0.2815437 banana dog 0.24327646 banana cat 0.2815437 banana banana 1.0 But when I run the exact same thing locally, it gives me: dog dog 1.0 dog cat 0.0 dog banana 0.0 cat dog 0.0 cat cat 1.0 cat banana -0.044681177 banana dog -7.828739e+17 banana cat -8.242222e+17 banana banana 1.0 To me the former makes sense, not my local result. And the problem persists for other examples as well. I am so confused! What is happening locally? Spacy: '2.0.12' Python 3.6.5 Anaconda, Inc. Mac OSx 10.13.5 I am not sure if it is relevant, but I was getting this error running it in Jupyter, so I exported the followings, as suggested in the git, in the terminal before launching the Jupyter: export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
