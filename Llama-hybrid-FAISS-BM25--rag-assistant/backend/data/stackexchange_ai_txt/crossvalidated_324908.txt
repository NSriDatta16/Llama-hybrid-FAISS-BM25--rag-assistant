Build a single lm() model from hundreds of stores in R?

I’ve built many lm() models in R, but this is a new challenge. I have 100s of independent stores as objects. Each stores has simple 2 column time series (1 X and 1 Y). Very simple! I want to build a single linear model that is based on these independent stores and their corresponding time series. Is this mixed modeling? If I do a loop I’ll just get 100s of different models, one for each store. But I want 1 single model that is fit to all of them.
