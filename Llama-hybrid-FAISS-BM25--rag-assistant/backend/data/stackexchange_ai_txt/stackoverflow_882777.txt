Afaik, In VB.NET you can use the SyncLock to place a lock around an object while accessing it, to prevent other threads from simultaneously working on it. Public Shared objStorageLock As New Object Private Function getSumOfPositivesFromList1() As Integer Dim SumOfPositives As Integer = 0 SyncLock objStorageLock For Each x As Integer In List1 If x > 0 Then SumOfPositives += x Next End SyncLock Return SumOfPositives End Function
