I think someone will close this question, but I'll give you some help anyway. The nanodegree is expensive and in my view not very useful You should familiar yourself regression. Don't bother deep learning if you can't do linear regression Learn the practical tools (e.g. tensorflow). Try to train MINST digits, can you do it? Then, then try to train something harder. Kaggle is your best friend. Practice your skills in Kaggle competitions and look at other people's submission. Read, study, fork and ask their solutions. Learn basic about feature engineering, look at how Kaggle people do it. You have too many books to read. Deep learning is probably not expected for a graduate position, so skip it. You need to spend more time on the foundation. None of your book is about visualization. Data visualization is actually the most important skill set for a data scientist. Again, drop your deep learning book and your Bayesian analysis. Study PCA plot, scatterplot, histogram, normal distribution smoothing, ROC curve etc You should be familiar with the most common R packages such as ggplot and car . You should also learn scikit-learn , numpy and pandas Python packages. They are very popular in the industry. Train your programming in R and Python Visit Kaggle everyday, bookmark it Typically, some of the advanced stuffs you read such as Bayesian analysis and probability theory is done by people with a PHD degree. You don't have time to read it, focus on what people in Kaggle talk about . EDIT: Study classification metrics, such as confusion matrix. Read up what you should do if your data set is imbalanced. You need to understand when to use accuracy and when to use precision. Study how to work with different data formats - CSV, REST API, SQL etc.
