Repeated measures with lmer and logistic regression

I have a question about the lmer() function and repeated measures design with R . In my study, each participant sees 60 trials, presented at random. In each trial, the participants have to report whether they see something or not (so, it is a yes/no answer). I was recommended to use R and the lmer package. I built the following model, which seems to support my hypothesis. Yet, I want to be sure that I am building it correctly. Basically, the syntax is the following: model.1 X , Y , and Z are my predictors (all continuous variables). I also tested a second model (see below): model.2 My questions are: Is model.1 correct in terms of random effect? What is the difference between the two models?
