As a long time (4 year) user of Woot.com and purchaser of a few bags of crap, amongst the many other items now taking up space in my garage, it seems that the solution should be part of the overall Woot theme. Use captcha, but in a humorous vein. Much like the $1,000,000 promotion, make a game out of identifying yourself as a person. This has, in the past delayed the "sell out" of the BOC for a reasonable amount of time, while people, like myself, scramble to figure out the fairly simple but humorous puzzle to enter a coupon code. Also, while people complain endlessly about the server errors, they don't stop coming back. Part of the thrill of a BOC in my opinion is the fact there are a gazillion other people trying to get one. If the servers throw an error, or a funky page, it's a sign that I'm somewhere in a group of way too many people trying to get one of 1500 products. If you put as much creativity into building the puzzle, and it is original enough, it will delay the bots long enough to give everyone else a chance. Incorporating a random word that's captured as a code, putting an interim page between the "I Want One" and the purchase page, that requires some uniquely human interaction, you've stopped the bots there, until they figure out what needs to happen. • You haven't implemented a boring, and sometimes painfully difficult to read captcha • you've made the process more fun, • you've reduced the load on the actual secure purchase server • You'll train the users that they will need to "DO" something to get a BOC • You'll stopped the bots at the interim page, delaying their purchases until most people have at least had a chance to try and figure out the funny, but not terribly difficult puzzle. • Since being random is what a BOC is all about, a random, and changing puzzle/task would fit in simply with the whole pitch of a BOC. As you experiment, the technology behind the interim page can become more advanced, with random information that can be captured for use in the purchase page. Since I have purchased, without the aid of bots, or any scripts other than wootalyzer, which I feel is an acceptable aid, 7 BOC's since 5/31/05. The best one, which I didn't get, was the Please Please Me BOC. The B&D batteries were also fun, but I'm guessing didn't stump the bots, only frustrated the regular users. Sometimes the best solution for a technology issue, isn't more technology.
