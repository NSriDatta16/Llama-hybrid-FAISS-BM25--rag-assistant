How do you encourage end users to fill out trouble tickets?

So, I work in a fairly small IT section. We have a trouble ticketing system that about half of our end users use. Some of my coworkers don't really do much to encourage our end users to use the system we have in place. The end result? Constant interruptions because end users will get us by IM or come to our offices directly for trivial things. This can obviously make it difficult to do a good job of writing code. Now, I suppose I could just say "hey, would you mind filling out a trouble ticket next time?", but then I'd come off as the bad guy because others won't do that. I also don't want end users to feel that I'm unapproachable. I just want them to understand that there's a proper way to ask for help. So what's the best thing for me to do in a situation like this?
