MCMC algorithm to generate samples

I read that MCMC algorithm is used to draw samples from a distribution. The example mentioned in the text book is about a 6x6 matrix which after 1000 iterations will converge to a steady state 1x6 matrix as shown below. Okay I understand how this reaches the state state part, [ 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1 ] How will I generate samples from this matrix ? This is where I am confused.
