Getting an Excel file with many sheets into R

I am importing data from an Excel file that contains 15 sheets. Each sheets represent a year in which there are observations on the same variables. Here is what I would like to do (elgantly) from R: import all the data from all the sheets into one dataframe with one new variable which is the sheet where it came from or the year. I could do all the necessary preparation by hand in Excel and then use read.xlsx("...myfile.xls", 1) but the main aim of my project is to improve my R skills.
