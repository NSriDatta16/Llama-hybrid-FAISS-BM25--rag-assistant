Does random forest (and, decision tree) require an independent observation assumption?

I am wondering if random forest models require an independent observation assumption. My date includes observations from the same participants, but I do not have a way to identify each participant. I would like to analyze this using random forests or decision tree, but I am not sure if I have to worry about the independent assumption like regression models or not. I would appreciate your guidance and literature would be of great help.
