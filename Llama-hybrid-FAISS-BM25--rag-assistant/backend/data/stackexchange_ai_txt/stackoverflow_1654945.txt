Resources to successfully making applications scriptable

In the process of designing an application we've come to the conclusion that the user needs to be available to add custom behaviour to the program and we want to allow this through scripting, however, none of us got any experience embedding a scripting engine in an application and even less designing the application to successfully allow the scripting to place. We suppose that the key to making the application scriptable is to create a large set of events that the scripts can respond to, as well as exposing functions for the script to use. Instead of rushing into scripting recklessly we would prefer reading up on some resources on the topic. We're looking for resources (preferably books) which covers the process of designing an application for scripting. Any advice would be awesome as well. More or less any advice on the topic would be nice. If details of the project in question is needed just say so an I'll add a paragraph explaining more in-depth detail.
