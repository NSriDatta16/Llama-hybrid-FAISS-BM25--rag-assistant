How to interpret BayesFactor::contingencyTableBF BF results in R?

Say we build the following table: nnn $Gender, tib$ Completers) Then, we do a Bayesian analysis: bf The output is the following: > bf Bayes factor analysis -------------- [1] Non-indep. (a=1) : 0.3471187 ±0% Against denominator: Null, independence, a = 1 --- Bayes factor type: BFcontingencyTable, poisson My interpretation is that BF10 = 0.3471187 , with a 0% error rate. However, when I extract the BF result alone, the output is the following: > bf@bayesFactor$bf [1] -1.058088 My questions: What does this result mean (first output): [1] Non-indep. (a=1) : 0.3471187 ±0% ? Given the code above, how/where can I retrieve it from (I don't seem to find it anywhere)? What does the result -1.058088 of bf@bayesFactor$bf mean? sessioninfo::session_info() extract: setting value version R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) os macOS Monterey 12.6 system x86_64, darwin17.0 rstudio 2022.07.1+554 Spotted Wakerobin (desktop) ---- BayesFactor 0.9.12-4.4 2022-07-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) expss 0.11.1 2022-01-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) tibble 3.1.8 2022-07-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)
