There are a lot of paired comparisons among 3 treatments and 3 time periods. Depending on your level of curiosity, perhaps as many as ${9\choose 2}= 36$ comparisons altogether. Suppose there are no true differences anywhere in the experimental design, then each paired test at the usual 5% significance level has probability $0.05$ of rejecting $H_0$ to make a 'false discovery'. At worst, that might mean An average of $36(.05) = 1.8$ false discoveries per experiment and A probability $1 - (.95)^{36} \approx 0.84$ of at least one false discovery. The advantage of doing an ANOVA first is that that you can do one test at the 5% level to see whether there are any differences at all. Then if you reject the overall $H_0$ at the 5% level, you can take an approach towards finding true differences that keeps the probability of false discovery low.
