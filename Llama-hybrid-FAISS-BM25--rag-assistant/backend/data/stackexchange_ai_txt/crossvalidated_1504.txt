This subject matter is often discussed under the discipline of HCI ( human-computer interaction ) which has it's own journal . There is a lot of great work being done on this at Stanford under Jeffrey Heer (the creator of protovis and prefuse amongst other things) and in the Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Group . As an example, read the "Sizing the Horizon: The Effects of Chart Size and Layering on the Graphical Perception of Time Series Visualizations" paper. The material on the CS147: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design and cs448b Data Visualization homepages may also be of interest. You can also look at the projects list in the CMU HCI Institute .
