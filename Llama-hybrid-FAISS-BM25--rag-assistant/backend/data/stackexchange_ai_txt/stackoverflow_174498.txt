What is the equivalent to JUnit in C#?

I am coming from Java and am currently working on a C# project. What is the recommended way to go about a) unit testing existing C# code and b) accomplishing TDD for C# development? Also is there an equivalent to EMMA / EclEmma (free yet powerful code coverage tool) for Visual Studio and C# code?
