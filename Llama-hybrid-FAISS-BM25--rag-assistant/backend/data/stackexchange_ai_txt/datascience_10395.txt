This all depends. SAS is great and is backed by the SAS Institute, meaning if you're working for an organization that has invested in SAS, you can contact the support team for anything funky happening with the software. R is free and open source, and there are also organizations being created that are building on to and supporting R much like SAS Institute has done. The difference being that SAS has been around much longer and is much more structured than R. They both have their ups and downs, and it depends on what type of analytics you plan on doing in your career. So, to answer your questions, I would decide what you envision yourself doing. To my understanding R is good for Big Data applications and Machine Learning, SAS is great for statistical analysis (ARIMA, etc).
