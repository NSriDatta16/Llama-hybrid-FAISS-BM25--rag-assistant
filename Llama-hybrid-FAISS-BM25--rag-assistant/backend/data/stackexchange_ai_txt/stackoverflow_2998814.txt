Implement a Wiki Converter for ScrewTurn . I used MediaWiki's Syntax Converter as a base since the basic wiki syntax is very similar. I also implemented a few Converter classes, UserDateConverter (requires the Confluence UDMF plugin ), PagenameConverter , AttachmentsConverter , MetaDataCleaner (to remove the first three lines in ScrewTurn page files that include page name, date, and ##PAGE##). In ScrewTurn, change the page storage provider to Local Pages Provider (if its using a different provider such as SQL). Run the customized UWC implemented in step 1 and convert one namespace at a time. You can download the source code from GitHub .
