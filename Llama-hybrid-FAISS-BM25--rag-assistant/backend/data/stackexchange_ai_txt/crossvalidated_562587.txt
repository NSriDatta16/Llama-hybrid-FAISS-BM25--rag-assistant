Identifying Confounders

Currently I am interpreting NHANES data through proc logistic in an attempt to identify confounders; relationship of interest is 'rate of depression' from 'total savings.' However, when I employ multi-categorical variables like race and or marital status, I cannot employ the 10% rule as encouraged by my professor to identify confounding. Many of the subcategories are split on whether they are or are not statistically significant at the alpha 0.05 level under the table of Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Estimates. That said, I was encouraged to employ a type III Analysis under proc logistic which identifies if the overall relationship is statistically significant rather than looking at individual p-values (correct me if i'm wrong please). That said, I was wondering if someone could help me understand how 'Race' under the Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Estimates is only partially statistically significant but its p-value under the type III test for the variable of interest is well below the alpha 0.05 level (makes no sense). I will include a picture of the output down below in an image. Thanks
