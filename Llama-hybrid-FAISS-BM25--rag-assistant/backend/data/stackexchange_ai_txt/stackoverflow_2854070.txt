The problem: dictionary.XPathSelectElements("group[field[@name='StipulationType']]") This selects all the group elements satisfying the predicate, which are children of the current node . However, you want all group elements (satisfying the predicate) -- from the XML fragment it is clearly seen that not all group elements have the same parent. The solution : Evaluate the XPath expression from the grand-grandparent (based on the provided fragment!): One example would be: component/group[field[@name='StipulationType']] Based on the structure of the complete document (not provided), more location steps might be necessary. What to avoid: Avoid the // abbreviation as it may cause (with not good optimizing XPath engines) an extensive traversal of the whole subtree (even document) that starts from the node against this is evaluated.
