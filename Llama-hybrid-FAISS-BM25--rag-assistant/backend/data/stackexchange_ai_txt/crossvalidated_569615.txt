is it possible to use a bayesian neural network to calculate the covariance matrix among a set of predicted values?

as title says, i have created a little bayesian fcnn with dropout layers trained on some cosmological data that come with a covariance matrix that is almost 0 everywhere. My goal was to use the NN to predict some continuous values in a range where data are scarce (it's a regression case), but i also need the covariance matrix among the predicted values. I was wondering if there was a way to calculate it. wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_covariance_matrices gives a formula for the estimate of covariance but i don't know if it's valid for the result predicted by a neural network , especially one with dropout layers turned on. thanks
