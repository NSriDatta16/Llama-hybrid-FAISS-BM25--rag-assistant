The legend is that Scott Hanselman once said "It's not a real demo unless someone drags a datagrid" (pg 478 Silverlight 4 In Action, Pete Brown) You have to remember that demos, are all about selling software, and not at all about communicating best practice. So your observations about the demos are absolutely correct, they cover the basics, and leave it to the observer to fill in the blanks. As to your comment about Stored Procedures, and various answers to your question about the generator. The generator is good, and getting better. Howerver there are certain circumstances when it will generate completely unusable queries. (see my SO question here and discussed on the ADO.NET team blog ) Therefore there are occasions when hand crafted queries are your only recourse (either by way of stored proc, table value functions, views etc)
