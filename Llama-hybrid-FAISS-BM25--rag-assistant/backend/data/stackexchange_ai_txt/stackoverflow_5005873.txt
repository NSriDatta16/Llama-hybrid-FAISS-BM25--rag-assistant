I have this JTable having an AbstractTableModel as its model. THe AbstractTableModel is not the tables model. You are extending AbstractTableModel to implement the model storage and other methods that need to be implemented. I would just use the DefaultTableModel. It already implements these methods and it provides an addRow(...) method that allows you to dynamically increase the number of rows in the model. Am I going to use a TableModelListener? That is one way. Every time the data in a cell changes you check the entire row to see if it is full. If it is the last row in the table, then you can just invoke the addRow(...) method on the DefaultTableModel to add another row.
