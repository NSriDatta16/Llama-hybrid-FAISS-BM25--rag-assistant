Need presentation materials for convincing a customer to use Maven

My customer needs a more organized inventory of all 3rd-party libraries (such as JAR files) that are used in production for their projects. I am involved with a number of their Java-based projects. Their inventory has not been consistently maintained in the past and the time has come to account for all the libraries that are currently being used (there are quite a few!) and to enforce a structured process for introducing new libraries into the build environment. I have tried pitching the idea of using Maven and Artifactory in their build process to leverage those tools' ability to manage a repository of binary libraries and handle transitive library dependencies. The customer is resistent to the suggestion because they think it will create more work for them to maintain an Artifactory server and learn the basics of Maven. Currently, their Java projects are all built using Ant scripts. Transitive dependencies are largely managed by trial-and-error. The inventory of libraries currently in use is maintained by hand and the binaries are stored in a Subversion repository. The customer recognizes that this needs to be improved, but the current suggestions for improvement involve more ad-hoc "manage it by hand" approaches. I want to convince the customer that a combination of Maven and Artifactory is a viable off-the-shelf solution for their Java library management needs. Can anyone direct me to literature/materials that I can use to create a presentation for my customer on the features and strengths of Maven and Artifactory? Any other arguments/suggestions/etc that would assist me in this would also be appreciated.
