Your series is not stationary - by definition a seasonal series is not stationary. If it were stationary then the d order in your ARIMA model would be 0. For complex seasonalities, your best option is TBATs. You can also try Facebook Prophet if your time series is daily or above (based on your plot I assume that it is).
