Your best bet is a plugin that is already done, you can see a demo here for example: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/file/jquerydragdrop/ You can find the source code and tutorial here: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/dynamic-dragn-drop-with-jquery-and-php/ I use these quite often and work really well. Things worth remembering and noting: I would add a handler (a button of a sort) to grab the line and move it around. This will allow you to add input fields and other info on the rest of the bar. Don't forget to add a order field in your DB or array. So that when it gets reorganised, it can be stored. I hope this helps.
