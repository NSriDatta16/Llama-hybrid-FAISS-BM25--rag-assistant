You can achieve practically any url scheme you desire with ASP.Net MVC Routing. What controllers you have and where your actions live has nothing to do with your urls . Only routing defines your url's. Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever to sacrifice code clarity and organization for the sake of a particular url scheme. Furthermore, in most ASP.Net MVC applications I've seen, the controllers are already unwieldy, and combining them all into a single controller would increase the disorganization exponentially . Even small sites have a handful or two of controllers. Significant sites have dozens, very large sites could have hundreds. Do you really think it is in any way at all feasible to combine dozens of controllers into a single one?
