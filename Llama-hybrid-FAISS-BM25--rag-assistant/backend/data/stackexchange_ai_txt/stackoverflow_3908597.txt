The best use of canvas for creating a game-like interface that I've seen actually uses YUI, but in my own projects, I can tell you that this is possible with jquery as well. See http://ernestdelgado.com/articles/ddwdd/ The interaction here is really only having a canvas where you can drop objects that can be manipulated by the user via dragging, rotating, and resizing. If you're interested more in animating objects, you might want to look at impactJs.org
