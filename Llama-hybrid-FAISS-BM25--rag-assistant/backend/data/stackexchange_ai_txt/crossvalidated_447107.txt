Variance (which ST is derived from) measures differences from the mean. Given differences from the average d1 and d2, whether D > 0 or D d1 d2 === d1^2 d2^2 . Examples: d1 = 2 d2 = 3 2 I don't know exactly how standard deviation works in practice but it holds true that larger differences give a larger value and small differences give a smaller value even if squaring switches from increasing to decreasing going down passed one. I think this is valid as once you reach as low as 1, the only way from there toward 0 is down. On a plotter it should produce a continuous curve. Standard deviation will be compared to standard deviation and variance with variance. As long as you stick to that whether using the standard deviation (square root) or variance (averaged squared differences) they'll remain proportionately comparable. I believe that SD will effectively be converting it from a geometric (squared curve) to a linear curve. Please excuse that I am from a programming background. The notation I use is works are means compare (-1 less than, 0 same, 1 more than) and === means exactly equal. Numbers in variables are part of the variable name, multiplication only happens with an explicit * .
