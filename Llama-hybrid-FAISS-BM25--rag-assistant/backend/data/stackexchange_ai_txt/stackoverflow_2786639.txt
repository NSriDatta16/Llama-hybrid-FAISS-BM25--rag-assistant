Just kill the parent process. Open up a terminal, use pstree -p to find the process ID (PID) of the git process, then kill -9 it. On my system, it looks something like this: $ pstree -p ... ├─gnome-terminal(20473)─┬─bash(10302)───git(10331)───pager(10332) ... $ kill -9 10331 Not exactly elegant, but it works. On your system, pager will probably be something different, but it will have git as a parent process.
