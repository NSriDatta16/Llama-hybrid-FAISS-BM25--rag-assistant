help using pcap library to sniff packets

i am using pcap sample codes to create my own sniffer. i downloaded their sample sniffer and its working on windows but not on linux. i am using gcc compiler on both machines, and i have only pcap.h included. the error is : dereferencing pointer to incomplete type. the netmask is causing the error. the netmask is the mask of the first address of the interface. u_int netmask=netmask((struct sockaddr_in*)d->addresses->netmask))->sin_addr.S_un.S_addr; any solutions?
