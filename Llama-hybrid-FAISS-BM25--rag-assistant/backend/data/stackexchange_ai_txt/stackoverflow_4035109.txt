Magento Custom Module database query

I have written a module to add my own events, and in the home page i would like to show only latest events. So in that case i have to add order by to query but i couldnot do that, it always throws fatal error. This is what i have done. $_offers = Mage::getSingleton('offerings/offerings')->getCollection(); This returns all the records, here i could able to set filter options but i could not add sort order like this $_offers = Mage::getModel('offerings/offerings')->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSort('offerings_id', 'DESC') ->setPageSize(5) ->setPage(1, 5); or even using Mage::getSingleton. Whats the problem here am facing. Please help me
