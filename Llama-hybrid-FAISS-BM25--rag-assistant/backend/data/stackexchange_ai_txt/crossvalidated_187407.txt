Confidence interval for the number of successes in a population

In the answer to this question How to Calculate a Confidence Interval for Estimating a Proportion When the Population is Very Small the method for constructing an exact 95% confidence interval for the number of successes in the population is given. This interval is exact in the sense that it uses the hypergeometric distribution to construct the interval. However, the interval may not have a coverage of exactly 95%. Can someone suggest a reference that discusses how to calculate the achieved coverage for one of these exact confidence intervals? Thanks.
