The following is just a guess. .doc file is actually OLE structured storage compound file . The latter is a way to pack multiple streams in a single document in a well-defined way, and the structure is actually pretty close to a filesystem-in-a-file - for example, it has "sectors", and sector allocation table. Such an approach makes it possible to edit document file in-place without rewriting it completely. However, this storage approach results in some redundancy, such as unused sectors. When you roundtrip the file, you effectively recreate it from scratch, and thus any such redundant storage artefacts are eliminated.
