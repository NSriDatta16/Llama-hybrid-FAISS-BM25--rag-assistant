Using DirectorySearcher you can connect and read the structure of one Active Directory, including the structure (organization units, groups, users, computers, domain controllers). In order to connect to a different domain, you would need credentials of that other domain. We had problems in connecting to another domain from a machine that belongs to a different domain than the target one. I'm also curious if that's even possible.
