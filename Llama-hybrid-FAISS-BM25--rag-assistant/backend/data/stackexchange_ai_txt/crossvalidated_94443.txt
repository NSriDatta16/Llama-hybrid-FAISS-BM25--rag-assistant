Is there any tool that can do Vector ARIMA modeling in time series

Vector ARIMA model is used in multiple time series analysis. I am just wondering if there is any software or tool can be used to build the model. Some tools,like R, can only be used to predict the value after the Vector ARIMA is already built by the user. So is there any tool can create the vector ARIMA model? Thanks in advance!
