Right, this is a bit embarrassing. I gave a little white lie in the original question. By omission rather than a deliberate attempt to mislead. I am not, in fact, using a GridView but a subclass of it that will display rows when the datasource contains no data. This enables the user to insert new rows when the table is empty. This subclass overrides the FooterRow property and, to my shame, it was this that was getting things wrong. So I made two errors here: first I failed to test my GridView subclass properly and second I sought to prevent what I thought would be unnecessary attention on my subclass by not showing its use in the code snippets I included in the question. My bad. Thanks to Tim for taking the time to try and help me. Dan
