EMMA coverage tool not displaying line-by-line coverage

I am using the EMMA tool for code coverage yet despite my best efforts, EMMA is refusing to see the original .java files and generate coverage on a line-by-line basis. We are using ANT to build the code and debug is set to true. I know that EMMA is measuring coverage as the .emma files seem to be generating and merging correctly. The reports are able to present high level method coverage with percentages. But why won't it see the .java files? All I get is: [source file 'a/b/c/d/e/f/code.java' not found in sourcepath]
