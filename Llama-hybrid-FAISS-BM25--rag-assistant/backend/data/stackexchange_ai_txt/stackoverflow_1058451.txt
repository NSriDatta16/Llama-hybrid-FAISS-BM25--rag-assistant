Sql and Linq differ on certain points. Sql has implicit grouping - take all of these and make one group. In linq, one may fake implicit grouping by introducing a constant to group on. var query = from i in Enumerable.Repeat(0, 1) from a in AList from b in a.BList select new {i, a, b} into x group x by x.i into g select new { Avg1 = g.Average(x => (x.b.CompletedDate - x.a.CreatedDate) .TotalMilliseconds ), Avg2 = g.Average(x => (x.b.CompletedDate - x.b.CreatedDate) .TotalMilliseconds ) };
