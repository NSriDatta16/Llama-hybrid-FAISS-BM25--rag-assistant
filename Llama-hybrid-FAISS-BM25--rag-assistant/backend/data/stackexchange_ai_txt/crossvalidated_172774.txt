I'm going to interpret your question as succinctly as I can. Let me know if it changes your meaning. I'm quite confident that 6 of the predicting variables are associated with the binary response [but] I see no significant pattern in the pca I don't see any "significant pattern" either, other than the consistency in your pairplots. They're all just roughly circular blobs. I'm curious what you expected to see. Clearly separate point clusters some of the pairplots? A few plots very close to linear? Your PCA results - the bloblike pairplots and only 85% of variance captured in the top 11 principal components - don't preclude your hunch about 6 variables being sufficient for binary response prediction. Imagine these situations: Say your PCA results show that 99% of variance is captured by 6 principal components. That might seem to support your hunch about 6 predictor variables - maybe you could define a plane or some other surface in that 6 dimensional space which classifies the points very well, and you could use that surface as a binary predictor. Which brings me to number 2... Say your top 6 principal components have pairplots that look like this But let's color code an arbitrary binary response Even though you managed to capture nearly all (99%) of the variance in 6 variables, you still aren't guaranteed to have spatial separation to predict your binary response. You might actually need several numerical thresholds (which could be plotted as surfaces in that 6 dimensional space), and a point's membership to your binary classification might depend on a complex conditional expression made of that point's relationship to each of those thresholds. But that's just an example of how a binary class could be predicted. There are a ton of data structures and methods for representing, training, and predicting. This is a teaser. To quote, Often the hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right estimator for the job.
