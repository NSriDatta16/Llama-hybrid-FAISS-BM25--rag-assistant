jQuery is javascript. This means you are limited inside the current page view. To persist data to the website, you can either Use Sessions, but you need a server side language like php, asp, ruby, etc.. store cookies ( if the user does not accept you can do nothing .. ) Use HTML5 localStorage , but browser support is limited combination of the above.
