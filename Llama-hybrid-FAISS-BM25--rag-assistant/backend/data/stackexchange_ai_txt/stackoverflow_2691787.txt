If you're working with folders and you're using an SPQuery object you also may want to use the ViewAttributes field to allow for recursive item retrieval. Setting the value to Scope="Recursive" will retrieve items from subfolders and will not retrieve the folder objects in the result set. myQuery.ViewAttributes = "Scope=\"Recursive\"";
