How to model repeated measures with time-varying covariates in SPSS?

I wanted to test the effectiveness of a particular type of "talking" therapy on depression. I envisaged selecting ONE group of people and measuring their heart rate and scores on depression scale for a period of 8 weeks. So I would have 8 measurements for the heart rate (session heart beat average) and 8 measurements for depression scale. How do I go about choosing the right statistical test, and how do I get my head around this in SPSS?!
