Expressing beta estimate in terms of odds ratio for a continuous variable

I am making a table from results of an analysis using generalised linear model which involves detecting association of a categorical predictor variable over multiple outcome variables. Of those multiple outcome variables, few are binary where I display the odds ratio for each category of the predictor (as we do in logistic regression); while few are continuous outcome variables, in which case I can display the beta estimate for each category of the predictor. My question is will it be ok if exponentiate the beta value and express it as odds ratios. Can I do that?
