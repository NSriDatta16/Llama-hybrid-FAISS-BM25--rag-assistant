If you want to stop caching more permanently then you could use Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1)); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false); Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Take a look at this answer or this answer for more information of how to create a custom attribute.
