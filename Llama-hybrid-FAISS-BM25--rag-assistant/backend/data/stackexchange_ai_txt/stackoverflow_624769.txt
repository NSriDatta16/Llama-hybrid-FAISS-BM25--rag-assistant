Cocoa With Love have a short-series on writing a came using CoreAnimation, perhaps it might be of use? Cocoa does take a lot of getting used to, and does seem really overly convoluted, but when you compared it to.. well, most other GUI toolkits I've used, it suddenly seems very elegant and simple. The problem with the example code, and most tutorials (including the one I linked to, albeit to a slightly lesser degree) is they only show you the finished application - it doesn't show the increments. There's no "I have a empty canvas", then "I worked out how to draw a circle", then "I've animated the circle". Try making a new application, look through the example code/IB project/tutorials/documentation for the bit that initialises the canvas-thing. Then look for the code that adds a simple shape. Then look for the code to animate the code (Genericrich answer, for example)
