My intuitive feeling tells me that the answer would have something to do with a Pivot Table outline, which has a fixed number of zones, namely: - the Page Fields zone - the Column Fields zone - the Row Fields zone and - the Data zone In my wild guess: - The Page zone builds the WHERE part of the ad-hoc query. - The Column zone will put whichever fields drag-dropped to it in the GROUP BY clause. - The Row zone will build a SELECT DISTINCT - The Data zone will apply an AGGREGATE function to the field drag-dropped to it. What do you think would happen "behind the scene" when we drag fields to those zones?
