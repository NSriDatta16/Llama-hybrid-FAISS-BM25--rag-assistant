a neural network can be used as an optimizer?

I was wondering if a neural network can be used as an optimizer. In other words, a network2 used as an optimizer takes the loss value of network1 and based on that it predicts the best weights for network 1. as a discriminator in architecture, gan imitates a function of loss.
