Another update: I don't see an .so or a .a file in your list of where EXPAT is... doesn't that seem a bit strange? Normally it will create an alias for the library name for example /usr/lib/libblah.so -> /usr/lib/libblaah.so.1.2 Is dynalib some Macintoshism (I don't use Macs much) is .la the static version extension on this platform? Update: The quotes around the path seem troublesome... -L"/usr/lib" Try changing this to -L/usr/lib and -L /usr/lib Older stuff: The directive for the linker to include paths during the link step is -L. You need to look for some linker flags to update to include -L path_to_expat. I don't think the linker pays any attention to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I am not sure what documentation you have read to set EXPAT_INCLUDE or EXPAT_LIBPATH.
