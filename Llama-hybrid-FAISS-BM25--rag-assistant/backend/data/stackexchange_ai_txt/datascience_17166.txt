Google Cloud NLP PERSON entities

I'm using Google Cloud NLP Entity Recognition to recognize Persons/People, when I paste a chunk of text, it correctly provides PERSON information : In the example: "Google, headquartered in Mountain View, unveiled the new Android phone at the Consumer Electronic Show. Sundar Pichai said in his keynote that users love their new Android phones." Sundar Pichai is correctly identified as a person, but also the word users . How can I differentiate real names vs words which refer to persons? I have seen that for popular people there is metadata like Knowledge Graph mid or Wikipedia articles, but for others there is no reference, (Example: from "Susan Fowler" recent Uber scandal) Any ideas/pointers will be greatly appreciated.
