The forecast seems to be quite strange What exactly do you mean? What is the question here? Also, how can it be, that every forecast for the same time series is the same but e(t+1) should be a random variable? The best point forecast for the error term e(t+1) under square loss is its estimated conditional mean, which is zero. You do not expect e(t+1) to actually be zero, but zero is your best guess. That is why the point forecast for e(t+1) is zero every time. My goal is not to find the best guess but to model a time series model (at least that is what my professor said). So is there a way to set e(t+1) equal to a random variable with zero mean and the conditional variance instead of zero? Your question title says "forecasting", so I answered it as such. Now if you want to model the time series for some other purpose, you can still use the same model as an approximation of the true data generating mechanism. If you want to simulate some paths from your estimated model, you can do that with the functions ugarchsim and/or ugarchpath . They will generate some random errors according to the estimated properties of those errors from the historical data.
