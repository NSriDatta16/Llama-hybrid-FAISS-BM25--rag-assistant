What can happen as a result of using (nolock) on every SELECT in SQL Server?

I get that the (nolock) optimizer hint allows for "dirty reads", but under what very specific scenarios is this a bad idea? I've never seen such widespread use of (nolock) in an organization, and it makes me nervous. I'd like an explanation in terms of user stories. "Paul does A, Peter does B, X happens instead of Y".
