Create a httphandler which checks the authenticated user before streaming the document out to the browser. Then you can set the link on the page to point at the hander with a document id instead of the file directly. Once this is done the document can be stored near enough anywhere you choose, being the file system or database or even encoded into an xml file if you want. This is useful for when you want to move storage location but don't want to have to update all the links in the web application.
