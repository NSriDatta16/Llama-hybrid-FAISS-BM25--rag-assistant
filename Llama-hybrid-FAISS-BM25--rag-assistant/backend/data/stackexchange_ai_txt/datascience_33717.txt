Best way to deploy and Schedule Deep Learning Model

I am looking for best way to deploy my Deep Learning application which does the following: Fetches data from BigQuery Finds anomaly (based on trained model) Throws the output in a mysql database. I want this program to run everyday on a specific time like a cronjob. Any lead on how can I achieve this deployment, other than using a cronjob because it will be unnecessary to pay for the time and resources when it will not be in use. Thanks in Advance.
