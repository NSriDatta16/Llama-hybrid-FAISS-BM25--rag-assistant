RuntimeException s like IllegalArgumentException are used to indicate programming errors . The program itself should rarely be able to handle it. Someone needs to manually fix the code. Potential RuntimeException s should be documented somehow in the function contract (i.e. javadoc), either with the explicit @throws , or while describing the inputs. If you don't have a javadoc for the function, you may want to add the throws clause just to document the potential pitfalls of using the function, but in general adding throws clauses for runtime exceptions is discouraged. If giving a wrong length is not actually a programming error, but is an exception situation, I would create a new checked exception (such as BadLengthError). If it is not an exceptional situation, don't use exceptions for flow control.
