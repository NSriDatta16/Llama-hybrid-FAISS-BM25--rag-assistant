"Fastest" and "most reliable" don't necessarily go well together : it's often one or the other. ABout memcached and a database, you must be aware that memcached is a caching mecanism , and not a data-storage mecanism. It means it should not be used to store data that you cannot regenerate : if there is a system failure (like a crash / reboot) , you will lose what was in memcached -- while database are more able to recover if there is not enough RAM to store the data, memcached will remove some old items from the cache, even if you didn't ask for it memcached is great when it comes to creating a distributed caching cluster ; but should not be used to store data that is important and that you cannot afford to lose.
