Well, I can't find a good answer about this timing (and it would be useful to know in other instances), but, as a workaround I just used a public List that was thread safe, and my UI thread can access this public list and add information to it. In particular I used a ConcurrentLinkedQueue . I found this in the official JetBoy game sample provided by Google, so maybe they don't even encourage using the Handler in this situation :)
