Why ML model produces different results despite random_state defined? And how to set global random seed for sklearn

I have been running few ML models on same set of data for a binary classification problem with class proportion of 33:67. I had the same algorithms and same set of hyperparamters during yesterday and today's run. Please note that I also have the parameter random_state in each estimator function as shown below np.random.seed(42) svm=SVC() # i replace the estimator here for diff algos svm_cv=GridSearchCV(svm,op_param_grid,cv=10,scoring='f1') svm_cv.fit(X_train_std,y_train) q1) Why does this change happens even when I have random_state configured? q2) Is there anything else that I should do to reproduce the same results every time I run? Please find below the results that are different? Here auc-Y denotes yesterday's run
