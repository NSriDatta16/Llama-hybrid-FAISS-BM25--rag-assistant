WCF RIA Services / Linq-to-SQL: include property from foreign tables

Say you have the following related tables ( Stores -> Categories -> Products ) Stores Categories Products And I want to create a grid to edit Products . This is straightforward with RIA Services. But what if I also want to show StoreName from Stores and CategoryName from Categories in my Products list? The two extra columns should be readonly. How can this be implemented? Update : I'm trying to do this in it's simplest form. That is no ViewModel, only drag'n drop, code (if any) will go in codebehind. I'm using Ling2Sql and returning the default implementation for the GetProducts query. Regards Larsi
