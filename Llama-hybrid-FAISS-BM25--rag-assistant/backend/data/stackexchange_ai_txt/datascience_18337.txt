Look into this package for Python: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Distance/ You can use this to generate a numeric value representing the similarity between word. Here is a similar post that should help: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/123060/clustering-a-long-list-of-strings-words-into-similarity-groups Additionally, a level up in complexity would be to use t-SNE on an array generated using word2vec (this is word embedding). Examples and resources for this are: https://www.codeproject.com/tips/788739/visualization-of-high-dimensional-data-using-t-sne http://sebastianruder.com/word-embeddings-1/
