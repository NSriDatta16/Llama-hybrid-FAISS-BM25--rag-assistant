All the 2 levels designs can be computed just by pen and paper with the need of no dedicated software. Of course a more suitable approach is to use at least a spreadsheet. You simply need to multiply each variable's column by the column of your response. Then the average on every column will be the effect of your factor. If you want to do it faster, but always for free, you can use R with the package DoE.wrapper or RcmdrPlugin.DoE . The calculation I've suggested you is, for 2 levels design, equivalent to linear regression analysis and variable selection has to be performed comparing the effects on each parameter with your experimental variability multiplied by a proper $t$-value.
