I think you're confusing Azure Table Storage with SQL Server or SQL Azure, which are completely different. You cannot access Azure Storage tables at all with SSMS. The code sample you provided is using the Azure SDK (which is using the Storage REST API underneath). That's the only way to access Azure Storage. If you want to create / view tables in a more graphical way, try Cerebrata's Cloud Storage Studio , ClumsyLeaf's AzureXplorer , David Pallman's Azure Storage Explorer , or some other similar tool. These tools all rely on the SDK or direct API calls. Now, regarding your code: You need to create your table before inserting objects. See CreateTablesFromModel() and CreateTableIfNotExist(). The Azure Platform Training Kit has a great intro/lab for creating and using tables, and shows how to use CreateTablesFromModel().
