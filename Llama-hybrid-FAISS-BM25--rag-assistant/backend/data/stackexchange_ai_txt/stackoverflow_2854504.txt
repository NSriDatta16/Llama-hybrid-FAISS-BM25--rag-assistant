Drupal and Login Toboggan -- infinite redirect loop

I'm getting a redirect loop when using Login Toboggan. It doesn't happen all of the time and I think I've narrowed it down to something with the session, specifically the active-tabs[last-active-href] value. Since it's intermittent, I was able to print out a session of a working copy and a non-working copy. Here are both: WORKS -- Array ( [active-tabs] => Array ( [last-active-href] => index ) ) toboggan/denied DOESN'T WORK -- Array ( [active-tabs] => Array ( [last-active-href] => user/register [user] => user/register ) [wantsEvents] => [wantsResources] => [wantsSupport] => ) toboggan/denied I've also noticed that if I comment out the following line the redirection loop stops (although no page loads): $return = menu_execute_active_handler('user/register'); Any ideas? I'm at my wits end.
