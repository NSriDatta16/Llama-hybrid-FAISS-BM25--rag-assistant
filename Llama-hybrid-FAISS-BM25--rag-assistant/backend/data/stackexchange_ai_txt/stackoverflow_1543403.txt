Use a relational database. Really fast when retrieving data based on a key, if you put an index in the key. Good scaling Don't get easily corrupted Tools already available for: Backups Replication Clustering Cross-platform Works over the network Allow really fast JOIN s, grouping, agreggation, and other complex queries, in case you need them You can easily create a class that works like a dict or hash table, but uses the database as storage. You can make it cache as much as you want on memory.
