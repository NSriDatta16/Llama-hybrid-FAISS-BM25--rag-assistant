I've been doing something similar a few weeks ago. Here's a possible solution, it's written from scratch, so it's kind of beta-release or something like that. I'll try to improve it by removing loops from code... The main idea is to write a function that will take 2 (or 3) arguments. First one is a data.frame which holds the data gathered from questionnaire, and the second one is a numeric vector with correct answers (this is only applicable for single choice questionnaire). Alternatively, you can add third argument that will return numeric vector with final score, or data.frame with embedded score. fscore I'll try to do this in a more elegant manner with some *ply function. Notice that I didn't put na.rm argument... Will do that # create dummy data frame - values from 1 to 5 set.seed(100) d Now apply a function: > fscore(d, sol) [1] 6 4 2 4 4 3 3 6 2 6 If you pass data.frame argument, it will return modified data.frame. I'll try to fix this one... Hope it helps!
