Draggable cards (touch enumeration) issue

I'm trying to let a player tap, drag and release a card from a fanned stack on the screen to a 4x4 field on the board. My cards are instantiated from a custom class that inherits from the UIImageView class. I started with the Touches sample app, and I modified the event handlers for touches to iterate over my player's card hand instead of the 3 squares the sample app allows you to move on screen. Everything works, until that is, I move the card I'm dragging near another card. I'm really drawing a blank here for the logic to get the cards to behave properly. Here's my code: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSUInteger numTaps = [[touches anyObject] tapCount]; if(numTaps = 1) { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { [self dispatchFirstTouchAtPoint:[touch locationInView: self.boardCardView] forEvent:nil]; } } } -(void) dispatchFirstTouchAtPoint:(CGPoint)touchPoint forEvent:(UIEvent *)event { for (int i = 0; i My questions are: How do I get the touch logic to disallow other cards from being picked up by a dragging finger? Is there anyway I can only enumerate the objects that are directly below a player's finger and explicitly disable other objects from responding? Thanks!
