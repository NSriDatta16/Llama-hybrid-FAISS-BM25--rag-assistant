PCA and exploratory Factor Analysis on the same dataset: differences and similarities; factor model vs PCA

I would like to know if it makes any logical sense to perform principal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the same data set. I have heard professionals expressly recommend: Understand what the goal of analysis is and choose PCA or EFA for the data analysis; Having done one analysis there is no need to do the other analysis. I understand the motivational differences between the two, but I was just wondering if there is anything wrong in interpreting the results provided by PCA and EFA at the same time?
