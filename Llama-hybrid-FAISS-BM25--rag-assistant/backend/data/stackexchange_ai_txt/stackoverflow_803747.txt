I use vim for just about any text editing I do, so I often times use copy and paste. The problem is that vim by default will often times distort imported text via paste. The way to stop this is to use :set paste before pasting in your data. This will keep it from messing up. Note that you will have to issue :set nopaste to recover auto-indentation. Alternative ways of pasting pre-formatted text are the clipboard registers ( * and + ), and :r!cat (you will have to end the pasted fragment with ^D). It is also sometimes helpful to turn on a high contrast color scheme. This can be done with :color blue I've noticed that it does not work on all the versions of vim I use but it does on most.
