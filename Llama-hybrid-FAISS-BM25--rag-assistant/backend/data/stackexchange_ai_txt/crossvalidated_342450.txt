Because MDS is arbitrary with respect to direction. In very simple terms, it's roughly like changing a scale from "conservatism" to "liberalism". It's arbitrary whether you say "Joe is high on conservatism" or "Joe is low on liberalism". In MDS, the interpretation of the dimensions is up to you. (Similar things happen, for similar reasons, with factor analysis and PCA).
