Difference-in-differences model: do I have to include hierarchical terms with interaction term?

I am contemplating using a DiD model to see the effect of an intervention on population attitudes. My DVs of interest are ordinal (Likert-style) and binary. I have two agencies measured at two time periods--one received the intervention, one did not. I'm using Stata. My understanding is that, to construct a DiD, you create an interaction variable with timevariable*groupvariable (time1=0, time2=1, controlgroup=0, treatmentgroup=1), and include all terms in your model; i.e. ologit outcomescale interactionvariable timevariable groupvariable. While this does make theoretical sense to me, is there any occasion for leaving out the time and group variables and having just the interaction term? Also, are there any unseen issues in using DiD for ordinal logit or regular logistic regression?
