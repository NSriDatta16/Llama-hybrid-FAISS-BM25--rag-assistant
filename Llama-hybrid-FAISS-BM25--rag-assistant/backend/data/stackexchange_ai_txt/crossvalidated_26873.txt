Is SVM-RFE a "filter" or a "wrapper" feature selection algorithm?

I am wondering whether SVM based recursive feature elimination (Guyon et al., 2000) would be considered a filter or a wrapper method. On the one hand, it "wraps" around an SVM to get the lowest-weight features. On the other hand, the trained model is never applied to any test set. What do you think?
