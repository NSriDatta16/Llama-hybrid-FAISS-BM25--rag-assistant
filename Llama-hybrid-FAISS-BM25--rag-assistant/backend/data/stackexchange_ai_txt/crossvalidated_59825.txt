Necessary amount of countries in the model for 1 macro level predictor?

Within my logistic regression models I use cross-national data in order to say something about individual soft drug tolerance. In total I have 29 countries with 37.000 individuals. My supervisor wants me to find some theoretical fundament to the rule of thumb I have used (and she proposed), namely the fact that for every 10/15 countries 1 possible macro-level predictor can be included in the regression model. Can anybody provide me with this literature (and a reaction to this presumed rule of thumb). Thanks in advance!
