One thing worth highlighting: the only standard way of deploying a MIDlet is via OTA download so you wouldn't expect a J2ME-capable phone to not have a web browser. Mobile web browser like Webkit and Opera are getting better faster than J2ME (at least until MIDP3.0 starts shipping, if ever). No matter which platform you choose, you will need to test your service on many devices. I don't think switching from J2ME to webapp makes a huge difference in that regard, because phone manufacturers keep changing the binaries that go into the phones firmwares. Getting people to use a website on their mobile phone is easier than getting them to download an application. unless that application is already installed when they buy the phone, that is. You might want to look at LWUIT for better and easier J2ME GUI. One thing that J2ME will accomplish for a flight booking service is save battery life by not requiring constant network data transfer, thanks to the local storage mechanisms.
