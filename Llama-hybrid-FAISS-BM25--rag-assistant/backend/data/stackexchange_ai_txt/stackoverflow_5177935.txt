Do I want an ORM?

We have an object model being used across three applications. Two programs collect data, another reads it and generates reports. The system is very disconnected, so we cannot have a single database all the programs talk to. Right now, the programs just use a common library to populate an object model and serialize/deserialize to the disk. Specifically, we're using XML serialization. There are a couple problems with this model. 1) XML could be considered wasteful. The files could get large and unwieldy. Honestly, file size isn't a huge concern right now. 2) My biggest concern is memory foot print. The entire file is loaded into an object model, operated on, then saved. Hopefully I've conveyed my worry, at some point we will run into memory issues with this application during runtime. Enough data will get collected into a single "database" (xml file) that it cannot be loaded into memory all at once. What I would like to have, is access to my object model backed by file storage instead of memory. I want the changes to the object model to be minimal. When an object is accessed, it comes from the disk and when it is set, it is saved (automatically, if possible). We have looked into NHibernate with SQLite, SQL Compact 4.0 and EF 4, and LINQ to XML (briefly). I've also used db4o in the past for caching objects to disk, but that was an unrelated project. Before I dive in and commit time to learning one of these, I'd like to know if my idea makes sense. Can I have an object model that'll "magically" cache to a storage medium instead of just bloating my memory footprint infinitely? What's the shortest path to get this done, even if it isn't the most elegant? Are there other technologies that could help me? Memory mapped files, linq-to-sql, Lazy(T) (for only fetching objects from files when needed possibly). I realize this is an open ended question. I'm looking for a big picture response and details if someone out there has real world experience doing this. Links would be helpful... Thanks.
