What are the best metrics to compare an OLS model and Random Forest model to predict house prices?

I am working on an assignment where the objective is to predict housing prices. My initial approach involves using an Ordinary Least Squares model. Following this, I plan to make a Random Forest model for comparison. Generally, it is understood that these 'black-box' machine learning algorithms offer better predictive capabilities but lack the interpretability of OLS models. I want to quantify the differences in their predictive power. However, I am uncertain about the most appropriate evaluation criteria to use. Question 1: What are the most suitable metrics for comparing the predictive power of two OLS models? Question 2: What are the most appropriate metrics for comparing the predictive power of an OLS model with that of a Random Forest model? It would be great if relevant literature could be recommended, but any help is highly appreciated!
