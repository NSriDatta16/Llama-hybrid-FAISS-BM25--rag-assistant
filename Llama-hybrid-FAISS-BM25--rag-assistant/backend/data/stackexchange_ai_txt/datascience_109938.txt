If the time series of the individual users are correlated in any, even a subtle way, if your model has sufficient capacity it will definitely exploit the info from already seen future timesteps. So, unless your timeseries are not 100% uncorrelated, I would strongly advice against feeding in per-user, and rather do the time dimension split. Given you are putting these users in a joint dataset, I assume its very likely that there is a correlation between their timeseries. So, try the time split; you can read about walkforward testing, as a keyword.
