It is probably the categorical encoding, yes; but it is not randomness. CatBoost encodes its categoricals using a sliding target encoding. During training, for each row, the value is the average target among rows above itself with the same level. (There may be some smoothing or noise, but that's the general idea.) But at prediction time, the encodings need to be fixed (you don't have a target anymore): they are the global target encoding from the training set. Your training scores are using the special catboost-encoding, while the evaluation scores are using the global target encoding.
