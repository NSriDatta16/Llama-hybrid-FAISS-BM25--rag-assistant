Typing six file names, or using the declarative style with #pragma comment(lib, "foo.lib") is small potatoes compared to the work you'll have to do to turn this into a DLL or COM server. The distribution is heavily biased towards using this as a static link library. There are only spotty declarations available to turn this into a DLL with __declspec(dllexport). They exist only in the 3rd party dependencies. All using different #defines of course, you'll by typing a bunch of names in the preprocessor definitions for the projects. Furthermore, you'll have a hard time actually getting this DLL loaded at runtime since you are using it in a COM server. The search path for DLLs will be the client app's when COM creates your control instance, not likely to be anywhere near close to the place you deployed the DLL. Making it a COM server is a lot of work, you'll have to write all the interface glue yourself. Again, nothing already in the source code that helps with this at all.
