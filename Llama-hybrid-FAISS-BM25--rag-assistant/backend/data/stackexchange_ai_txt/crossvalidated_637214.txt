Methods to derive cut-offs for continuous variables

I am working on a project to determine the variables that better predict the binary outcome. I am using conditional random forest and permimp::permimp for determining the importance of variables for my subgroup analysis. Now, I want to determine the cut-offs for the continuous variables which could help to predict the outcome. Could you please suggest the method to do so? there are so many methods so I got lost
