I would recommend solving a few different kinds of problems from Project Euler in Python and having a discussion about the solutions, how they could have been done differently to be more efficient, etc. as part of the seminar. Python is a very elegant language for solving mathematical problems and should be one of those easier understood than most by mathematics students, so I think you made a good choice there.
