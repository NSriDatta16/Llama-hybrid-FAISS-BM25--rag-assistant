Augmented Dickey-Fuller test - showing residuals are serially uncorrelated

I ran an Augmented Dicket-Fuller test to see if there was a unit root present in my time series. I would know like to show that the residuals from the test regression are serially uncorrelated. In the output there is the Durbin-Watson statistic - is this value enough to show the uncorrelation? Or is there a better way?
