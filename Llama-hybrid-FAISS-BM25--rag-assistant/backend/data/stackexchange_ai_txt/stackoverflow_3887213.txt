Azure: Can't find TableStorageDataServiceEntity class

I've been working my way through this tutorial . I got stuck when it asked me to make a class that inherits from TableStorageDataServiceContext . I can't seem to find the .dll or namespace or whatever. DataServiceContext works fine. That tutorial is a bit old. Has the class been moved or no longer exists or something?
