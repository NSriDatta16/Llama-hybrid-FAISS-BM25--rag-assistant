nvarchar(MAX) will hold up to 2GB which is about 1 billion characters since it is unicode in your case it is 0 also take a look at this, datalength counts storage, len counts characters, for varchar these will be the same declare @string nvarchar(MAX) = '' select datalength(@string), LEN(@string) GO declare @string nvarchar(MAX) = '1' select datalength(@string), LEN(@string)
