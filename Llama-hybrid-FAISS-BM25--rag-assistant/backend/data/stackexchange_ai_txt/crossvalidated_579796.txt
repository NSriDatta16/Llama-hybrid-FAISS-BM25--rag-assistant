We made some progress regarding this. Thus here an updated answer. Assumptions All existing comparisons for this (thus also the results summarized by Jeromy, and all claims I make dependent on all regression assumptions being met, and the predictors being multivariate normally distributed. For a more formal treatment, see Shieh (2007) or Karch (2020) 1. Population $R^2$ As Jeremey notes, this is commonly called squared population multiple correlation coefficient $\rho^2$ . It is defined as the amount of variance explained by the true regression model. The unbiased estimator has been derived theoretically in Olkin & Pratt (1958) and is correspondingly known as Olkin-Pratt estimator. Until recently, this estimator was not available in any software as it's nontrivial to compute it. However, I showed how to do that (Karch, 2020) and provide an R package for extracting it from a fitted regression model. Note that unbiasedness might not be what you want. Especially Bayesians tend to get angry at the Olkin-Pratt estimator as it can return negative values, which of course has a posterior probability $0$ . At the same time, sometine returning negative values is needed for unbiasdness. If you consider other optimality criteria, most notably, lowest MSE, the results change dramatically, see Karch (2020) , Which is better: r-squared or adjusted r-squared? , and Would the real adjusted R-squared formula please step forward? . 2. Out of sample $R^2$ First a warning: The squared population cross-validity coefficient $\rho_c^2$ is not equivalent to the description in the question the r-square that would be obtained if the regression equation obtained from the sample (i.e., $\hat{\beta}$ ) were applied to an infinite amount of data external to the sample but from the same data generating process. If we call the value described in the quote $\rho_c(\hat{\beta})$ , $\rho_c^2$ is actually the expectation $E[\rho_c(\hat{\beta})]$ (Shieh,2007) . After consulting the latest paper on the issue (Shieh, 2007) , it seems that no unbiased estimator for this exists yet.
