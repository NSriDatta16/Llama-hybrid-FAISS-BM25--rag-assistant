There is no shortcut for creating get / set property in F#, but if you want a property with just get you can use the following simple syntax: type Test(n) = let myValue = n * 2 member x.Property = // Evaluated each time you access property value myValue + 5 Since F# is a functional language, F# types are very often immutable. This syntax makes it very easy to define immutable types, so it also encourages you to use a good functional programming style in F#. However, I agree that a shortcut for get / set property would be very useful, especially when writing some code that needs to interoperate with C# / other .NET libraries. EDIT (5 years later...): This has been added in F# 3.0, as the answer from Ben shows :-)
