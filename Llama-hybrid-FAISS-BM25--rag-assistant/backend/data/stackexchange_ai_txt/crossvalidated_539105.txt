This task (filling in the rest of some data / image, given only part of it), is called inpainting. This can be done with conditional GANs. In a conditional GAN, the generator is given both the noise vector $z$ and also the conditional input $x$ (the fragment of valid data), and is supposed to output a plausible reconstruction of the whole data. The discriminator GAN can also be conditioned on the available data $x$ , and tries to judge if the reconstruction is real or fake. Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution is one example of using GANs for inpainting tasks. Note that in the case of inpainting tasks, it's typical not to train as a pure generator/discriminator, but also to provide additional supervision in the form of L2 loss or style loss, using the complete image/data as supervision.
