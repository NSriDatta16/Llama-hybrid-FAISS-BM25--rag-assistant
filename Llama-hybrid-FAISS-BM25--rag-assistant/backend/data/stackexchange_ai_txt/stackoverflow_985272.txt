Selecting text in an element (akin to highlighting with your mouse)

I would like to have users click a link, then it selects the HTML text in another element ( not an input). By "select" I mean the same way you would select text by dragging your mouse over it. This has been a bear to research because everyone talks about "select" or "highlight" in other terms. Is this possible? My code so far: HTML: Select Code Some Code here JS: function SelectText(element) { $("#" + element).select(); } Am I missing something blatantly obvious?
