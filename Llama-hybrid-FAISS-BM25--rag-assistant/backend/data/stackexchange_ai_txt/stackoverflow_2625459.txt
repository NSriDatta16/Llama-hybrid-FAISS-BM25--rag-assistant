I went through this evaluation process, and I found that Funq was a nice clean implementation that gave me enough power to do what I wanted without over complicating things (or dragging is massive dependencies). It's nice and clean, and supports lazy object initialization through lambda expressions. I evaluated 5 or 6 different containers specifically for use with MonoTouch. http://funq.codeplex.com/
