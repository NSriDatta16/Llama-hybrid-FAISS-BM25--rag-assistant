I think it comes down to the extent that you are adding different modes to a single Form. A mode that hides a single checkbox for example is far easier to maintain than a mode that swaps out the majority of controls . Only you can decide where your Form is in this spectrum. I would also try to identify and use techniques to minimize the complexity of multiple modes. Some ideas come to mind: Adopt a layered approach to separate business logic from the display Place families of related controls in a single reusable unit (such as a Panel or UserControl) Use organizing controls such as a PropertyGrid which can reflect and display properties of the selected object instead of manually hiding or showing controls in the form baesd on the object's class.
