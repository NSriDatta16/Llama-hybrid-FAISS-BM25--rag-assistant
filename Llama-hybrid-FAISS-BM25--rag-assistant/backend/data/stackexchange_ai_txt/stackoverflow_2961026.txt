are expanded war files faster?

I'm using embedded jetty to launch a web application which I have currently packaged as a war file. At first I was trying to prevent my war file from being expanded; then I began to wonder: Q: is there some advantage for jetty to expand the war file contents? And even if its slower... Q: how can I prevent jetty from expanding it (or at least expanding it every time). My setup looks like this: I have set the I/O temp dir, via the JVM setting ( -Djava.io.tmpdir=deploy/temp ) after noticing that my JSPs were being thrown into the Windows temp directory. --> I tried setting the various options on the jetty WebAppContext (they are not well documented in jettty 7 javadoc btw). They didn't seem to do anything helpful, so I commented them out.
