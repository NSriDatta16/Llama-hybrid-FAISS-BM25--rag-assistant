fastest algorithm to get average change

I have a sorted dictionary where the key is a date and the value is a integer that represents time left. i have 3 years worth of data so it would be something like Key: 2009-1-1, Value: 100 Key: 2009-1-2, Value: 97 Key: 2009-1-3, Value: 92 Key: 2009-1-4, Value: 87 ... ... Key: 2009-1-30, Value: 0 I would like to calculate average change per day and wanted to see if there way any elegant way of doing this.
