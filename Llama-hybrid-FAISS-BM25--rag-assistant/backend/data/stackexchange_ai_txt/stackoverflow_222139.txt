How far should you break up stylesheets?

I'm building a new site for my company, and I'm at the stage where I've created the html mockup of the first page. I'm going to use this as a basis for the rest of the site. I'm thinking of organising my stylesheet better now I've got the design looking consistent cross-browser, but I'm wondering how far to go when I'm breaking it up. One idea is to have the following: reset.css typography.css layout.css colors.css but where do I draw the line? theoretically I could go on and break them down into classes, ids etc, but I think thats going overboard. Does this seem a reasonable method?
