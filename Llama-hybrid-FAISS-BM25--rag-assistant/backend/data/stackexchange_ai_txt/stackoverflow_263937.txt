I would tackle this issue from another direction. Instead of, upon upload, generating the different file sizes that you need and storing them that way, I would do the following: Resize the image down to the largest size that you'll use on the website, paying attention to DPI & W&H. Upon resize, remember to sharpen your images . Only generate the smaller images upon request, but use caching to make sure that smaller images are generated only when the cache doesn't exist Once storage space becomes an option, start a task that'll nuke files which haven't been accessed within x days, determining x based on the size of the data that you want to recover per run. And once x starts to get unreasonably small, you'll know its time to increase your storage capacity.
