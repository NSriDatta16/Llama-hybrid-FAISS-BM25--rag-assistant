first of all, 1:10 ration is not bad at all. there are simple way of undoing sampling- 1) for classification problem, If you have sub-sampled any negative class by 10. the resulting probability is 10 times more what is should be. you can simple divide resulting probability by 10.(known as model re calibration) 2) Facebook also sub-samples(for click prediction in logistic regression) and do a negative down sampling. recalibartion is done by simple formula p/(p+(1-p)/w); where p is prediction in downsampling,n w is negative down sampling rate.
