I need to edit a paragraph in place, but the content will be saved to DB by clicking Save utton for the page. Actually, the content needs to be sent to the server for you to be able to save it into the database as you say you want to save it. You need a server -side language as well as database system to save that. So, it needs to be sent to the server.
