There are a couple of different questions here I think, first on what should happen to the cluster mean estimates when a mixed effects model is used, and second what should happen to the estimates for the treatment group averages. I think you might be confusing these two things which is where your problem is? First, on the shrinkage of individual cluster means: you can measure the degree of shrinkage toward the grand mean and compare this across clusters. Here I found the predictions for each cluster under each model, and compared it with the mean of the observed data. You can see the amount of shrinkage between the observed data and the partial pooled model is much larger for the smaller clusters, as you'd expect. (I used seed 824523). I couldn't reproduce your numbers, but note that your residuals.mmodel. ignores the estimated random effect, since it simply adds the group mean estimates (not the cluster means) to the residuals. I do not know if that has any meaningful interpretation. Your 'cluster specific averages' are just the group mean estimates plus some tiny amount of noise. I used predict instead to get the estimated cluster means. library(data.table) df $predictionLMER predictionLM > df2 cluster N Observed Partial pooled Completely pooled Shrinkage 1: 1 2 -1.6627715 -1.5512698 1.589832 0.111501716 2: 2 10 1.6791197 1.6728082 1.589832 -0.006311447 3: 3 10 3.9517399 3.9254377 1.589832 -0.026302204 4: 4 10 -0.2108414 -0.2005281 1.589832 0.010313308 5: 5 2 -1.8870846 -1.6663288 4.552558 0.220755812 6: 6 10 6.8700476 6.8387214 4.552558 -0.031326140 7: 7 10 3.5376612 3.5356479 4.552558 -0.002013311 8: 8 10 4.5378946 4.5270829 4.552558 -0.010811712 This corresponds to your Gelman and Hill quote. Second, on where the estimates for the treatment group means ought to be: The fixed effects (complete pooling) model will weight each observation equally. So the smallest clusters will have much less weight in the calculation. The random effects model assumes that the four clusters under each treatment are random samples from the population of clusters, and so the estimate for the group means will be closer to the average of the cluster means than the average of the observations. This means that the observations from the smaller clusters have a greater influence under the mixed effects model than they would under the fixed effects model. Since in your model the between cluster variance is very much higher than the within cluster variance (ICC is 90%), we can say the cluster means are estimated very well. The estimated cluster means are very close to the true cluster means, and the true mean within treatment groups is very close to the mean of the cluster means. So.. The fixed effect predictions are the unweighted means: > emmeans::emmeans(linear, ~predictor) predictor emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL control 1.59 0.391 62 0.808 2.37 intervention 4.55 0.391 62 3.771 5.33 > aggregate(data=df , dependent ~ predictor , mean) predictor dependent 1 control 1.589832 2 intervention 4.552558 But the mixed effects model predictions are very close to the mean of cluster means. The clusters are weighted almost equally, and so the small cluster has much more weight under this model, as it should: > emmeans::emmeans(mmodel, ~predictor) predictor emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL control 0.962 1.55 6 -2.832 4.76 intervention 3.309 1.55 6 -0.485 7.10 > aggregate(data=df , dependent ~ cluster+predictor , mean) |> aggregate(dependent ~ predictor, mean) predictor dependent 1 control 0.9393116 2 intervention 3.2646297 I hope that helps. I'll admit I don't fully understand your interpretation of the model outputs so please ask in the comments if you want to look at it further.
