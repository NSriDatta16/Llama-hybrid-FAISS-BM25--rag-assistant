It is important to read the HTML specifications to truly understand what behavior is to be expected: The HTML5 spec explicitly states what happens in implicit submissions : A form element's default button is the first submit button in tree order whose form owner is that form element. If the user agent supports letting the user submit a form implicitly (for example, on some platforms hitting the "enter" key while a text field is focused implicitly submits the form), then doing so for a form whose default button has a defined activation behavior must cause the user agent to run synthetic click activation steps on that default button. This was not made explicit in the HTML4 spec, however browsers have already been implementing what is described in the HTML5 spec (which is why it's included explicitly). Edit to add: The simplest answer I can think of is to put your submit button as the first [type="submit"] item in the form, add padding to the bottom of the form with css, and absolutely position the submit button at the bottom where you'd like it.
