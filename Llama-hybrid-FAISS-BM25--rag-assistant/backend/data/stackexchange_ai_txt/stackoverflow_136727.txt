Why doesn't a 's margin collapse with an adjacent ?

From my understanding of the CSS spec, a table above or below a paragraph should collapse vertical margins with it. However, that's not happening here: table { margin: 100px; border: solid red 2px; } p { margin: 100px } This is a one-celled table with 100px margin all around. This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around. I thought there would be 100px between the two elements, but there are 200px -- the margins aren't collapsing. Why not? Edit: It appears to be the table's fault: if I duplicate the table and duplicate the paragraph, the two paragraphs will collapse margins. The two tables won't. And, as noted above, a table won't collapse margins with a paragraph. Is this compliant behaviour? table { margin: 100px; border: solid red 2px; } This is a one-celled table with 100px margin all around. This is a one-celled table with 100px margin all around. p { margin: 100px } This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around. This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around.
