There's a great article on High Scalability about ebay. They take it to the extreme with the application doing everything and just using the dbs for "dumb" storage. The app does joins, referential integrity, etc. It's almost weird to think of things in that manner given what experience most of us have and what role databases play in our applications. Apparently it's effective, though. :) http://highscalability.com/ebay-architecture
