gamma glm to dgamma

I am modelling the average claim amount (claim amount/number of claims), so i used a gamma glm with weights=number of claims, as: > model family=Gamma(link = "log"), weights = numclaims) After this i want to find the log likelihood at each observation, but glm only return the sum, for instances: > logLik(model) >'log Lik.' -70665.26 How can i get the loglikelihood for each observation? I tried to do: > x m mu delta ll But when i sum all the loglikelihoods(to check if it is ok), i don't get the same value as in logLik(model) . My question is: what am i doing wrong? is it because i used weights in glm and i also have to use the weights in dgamma?
