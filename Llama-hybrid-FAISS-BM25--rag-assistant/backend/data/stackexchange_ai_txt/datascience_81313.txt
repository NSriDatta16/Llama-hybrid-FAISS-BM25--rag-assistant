How to use a dataset with only one category of data

I am performing a classification task, to try to detect an object. A picture of the environment is taken, candidates are generated of this possible object using vision algorithms, and once isolated, these candidates will be passed through a CNN for the final decision on whether the object has been detected or not. I am attempting to use transfer learning on InceptionV3 but am having difficulty training it, as I only have one set/class of images. The dilemma is that I only have one class of data and when I pass it through the network, I get a 100% accuracy (because there is nothing to compare it to). How should I overcome this? Should I find more categories online to add to my dataset? What should these categories be? Just to clarify, as an example, I have class "cat". Not "cat" and "dog". Not "cat" and "no cat". Just "cat". That is what my dataset consists of at the moment.
