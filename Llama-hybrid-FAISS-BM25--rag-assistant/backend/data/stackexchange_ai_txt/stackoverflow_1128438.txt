I see your code breaks out the loop at the first found XML fragment. Perhaps the larger messages divide their XML into smaller chunks inside the same multi-part MIME message? You would then return an array of bodies and concat them mail.parts[1].body[0] + mail.parts[1].body[1] (PS. It's a long shot, I haven't tried this)
