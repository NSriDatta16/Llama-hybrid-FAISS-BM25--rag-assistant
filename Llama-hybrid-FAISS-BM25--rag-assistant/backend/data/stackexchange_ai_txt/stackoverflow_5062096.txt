Use a database to persist session data. Using session_set_save_handler you can roll your own database storage backend for user sessions - a sessions that has a user_id foreign key, related to the users table. A "logout everywhere" button would trigger simple DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = 1234 and invalidate every session for the user. You can also easily add in additional columns to the session table - to store the IP address of the session, for instance, so users can see where other sessions are logged in from. Use a database for flexibility and performance.
