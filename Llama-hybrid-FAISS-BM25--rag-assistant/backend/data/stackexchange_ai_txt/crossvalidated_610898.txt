Accounting for study entry date in logistic regression for generating propensity scores

I am analyzing 30-day mortality associated with two treatments. I am planning to use IPTW. I would like to account for time in my propensity scores. The study inclusion dates span 15 years, so I would like to account for date of hospital admission (i.e. study entry date) in my score as I think medical practice changes over time could be influencing the propensity to receive one treatment vs. the other. What is the best way to account for this in my model?
