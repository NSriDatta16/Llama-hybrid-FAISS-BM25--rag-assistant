In Access 2010, to hide the ribbon, office button, and all that stuff, it one line of code in VBA: DoCmd.ShowToolbar "Ribbon", acToolbarNo Unfortunately, above does not work in 2007 (it a new feature for access 2010). In 2007, just build a custom ribbon that hides most everything (specify it at the application level). Then, for reports, you need a custom ribbon anyway if you going to deploy using runtime. I have a sample ribbons designed just for this purpose. Note that you can thus have a nice custom ribbon show just for reports. You have to specify the custom ribbon in the "other" tab of the reports property sheet, and you not even need code to have the ribbon show). What might be an slight issue is that you likely want the ribbon minimized for all running except for reports where I prefer the ribbon maxed. I have a sample here you can download that does this for you: Access 2007 Hidden interface example - click here Access 2007 Hidden interface example - click here I also have a few other ribbon examples, and one with a save as pdf and email as PDF in that ribbon, you can find that here also: http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/msaccess/DownLoad.htm
