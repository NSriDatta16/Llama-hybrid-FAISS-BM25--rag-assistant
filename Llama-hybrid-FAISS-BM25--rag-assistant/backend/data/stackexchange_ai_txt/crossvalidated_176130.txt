There are a number of approaches you could adopt. Based on your sample size I am proceeding on the assumption that your data will be normally or near-normally distributed. If such is not the case, you may have to change your approach. One method would be to simply average each participants responses by condition then perform a repeated measures t-test on those averages. This has the advantage of simplicity and may be sufficient if the expected effect size is large. However, you are sacrificing power by averaging. Mann-Whitney's U test would be the non-parametric equivalent. A more complicated, and more powerful, approach would be to use a hierarchical model, treating participant as a random factor. The following model would specify a random intercept for each participant using the R package lme4. Very roughly you can think of this as allowing the extremeness of each trial to be compared to an individual's own average value, but assuming equal slopes,i.e., change between trials, for all participants. lmer(dependentVariable ~ FactorAB + (1|participant), data=yourData) This functionality is available on other software platforms, I'm just less familiar with the process. If the assumptions I've mentioned are reasonable in your case, either one should work for you.
