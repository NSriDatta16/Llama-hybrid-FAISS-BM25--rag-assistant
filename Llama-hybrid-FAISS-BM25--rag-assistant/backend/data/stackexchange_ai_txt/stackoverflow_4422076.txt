Pack/unpack creates a copy of your data: if your maps are large, you'll want to avoid that. This also rules out your 3rd option. You can indeed define a custom datatype, but it'll be a little tricky. See the end of this answer for an example (replacing "graph" with "map" and "node" with "pair" as you read). I suggest you read up on these topics to get a firm understanding of what you need to do. That the number of elements is not known at compile time shouldn't be a real issue. You can just send a message containing the payload size before sending the map contents. This will let the receiving process allocate just enough memory for the receive buffer. You may also want to consider simply printing the contents of your maps to files, and then having the processes read each others' ouput. This is much more straightforward, but also less elegant and much slower than message passing.
