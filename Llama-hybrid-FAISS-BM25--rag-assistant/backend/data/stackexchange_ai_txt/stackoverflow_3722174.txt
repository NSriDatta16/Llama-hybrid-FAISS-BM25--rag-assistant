django template inheritance and context

I am reading the definitive guide to django and am in Chapter 4 on template inheritance. It seems that I am not doing something as elegant as should be possible as I am having to duplicate some code for the context to appear when calling the child view. Here is the code in views.py: def homepage(request): current_date = datetime.datetime.now() current_section = 'Temporary Home Page' return render_to_response("base.html", locals()) def contact(request): current_date = datetime.datetime.now() current_section = 'Contact page' return render_to_response("contact.html", locals()) It seems redundant to have to include the current_date line in each function. Here is the base html file that homepage calls: {% block title %}Home Page{% endblock %} The Site {% block content %} The Current section is {{ current_section }}. {% endblock %} {% block footer %} The current time is {{ current_date }} {% endblock %} and a child template file: {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Contact{% endblock %} {% block content %} Contact information goes here... You are in the section {{ current_section }} {% endblock %} If I don't include the current_date line when calling the child file, where that variable should appear is blank.
