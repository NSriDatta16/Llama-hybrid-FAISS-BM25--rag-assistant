I'd try a different approach. The static data class is going to get you in trouble -- this is from experience. You could have a User object (see @Robert Paulson's answer for a great way to do this) and pass that to every object as you construct it -- it might work for you but you'll get a lot template code that just repeats everywhere. You could store all your objects in a database / encrypted file with the necessary permissions and then dynamically load all of them based on your Users permissions. With a simple admin form on the database, it's pretty easy to maintain (the file is a little bit harder). You could create a RequiresAdminPermissionAttribute object to apply to all your sensitive objects and check it at run-time against your User object to conditionally load to objects. While the route you're on now has merit, I think there are some better options to try.
