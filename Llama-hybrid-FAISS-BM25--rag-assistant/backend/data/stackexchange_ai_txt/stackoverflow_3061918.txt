OverviewMapControl config

In the map I created in openlayers, OverviewMapControl is basically useless from zoom levels 0-3 - the red "extent" rectangle just fills the entire OverviewMapControl and can't actually be used to drag the map more then a very minuscule amount. ie. the draggable rectangle would not resize regardless of the zoom level. Can any one help me with this?
