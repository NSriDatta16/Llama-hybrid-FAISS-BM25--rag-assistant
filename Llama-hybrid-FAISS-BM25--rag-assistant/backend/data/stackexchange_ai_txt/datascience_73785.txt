Please look at my comment to add more information to your post. Based on the information you provided, here are my remarks: SpaCy is trained to find locations, not addresses per se If you use a "common" language, SpaCy is trained using WikiNER data, where locations aren't addresses but more like geographical places like city names, country names etc. So it's quite normal to not be able to detect full addresses. You likely need to train your own entity recognizer. They detail how to do this on their website, including code samples: https://spacy.io/usage/training#ner Don't underestimate SpaCy's rule-based matching Is it a fancy neural network? No. Does it matter? Also no. SpaCy allows you to create rules to find entities and in cases like addresses which are generally following a pattern across entities.
