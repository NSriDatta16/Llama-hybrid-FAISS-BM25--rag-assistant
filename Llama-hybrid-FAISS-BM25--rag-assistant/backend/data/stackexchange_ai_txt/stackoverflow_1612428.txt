You need to detail what you want to do a bit more. For example, what "resolution" do you need? Do you plan to record every worked hour of every day? Or just the average montly workload? Per week, maybe? Also, what do you want to do with holidays, and sick days? (EDIT - answering to the comment below) In your case I'd go with a model similar to this one: class WorkSlice The only association you need is with "employee", as far as I know. A method on employee would allow you to see, for example, how "free" that eployee is on a given date.
