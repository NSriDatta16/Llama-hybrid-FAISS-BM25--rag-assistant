The default session storage configuration will probably use a location shared between all the users on your shared hosting. To verify this, take a look at the output of phpinfo , in particular the session.save_path and session.save_handler . These settings are documented in the PHP session configuration documentation . Your shared hosting may run your PHP processes as your user, as opposed to a system user. In that case, you can change session.save_path to a directory in your home directory that is owned by you, and has permissions that prevent other users from reading that directory (700, for example). If your shared hosting runs as a system user, you basically can't get a secure way to store those files. You can then use a database-backed session storage option instead set with session_set_save_handler - although I'm not sure how you could prevent others from reading your configuration settings.
