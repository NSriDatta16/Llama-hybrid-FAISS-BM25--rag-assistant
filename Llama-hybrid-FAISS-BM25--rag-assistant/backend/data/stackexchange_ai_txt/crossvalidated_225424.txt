First thought that comes to mind is using a binary logistic regression. You can predict probability of a heart attack happening after fitting your dataset to a logistic model. Here is the formula for generating the probability of $Y_i = 1$ $ P(Y_i = 1|\, x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip}) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} }} = \pi_i $
