If your goal is to build a statistically adequate descriptive model of the conditional distribution of a time series of interest, then having autocorrelated residuals is a problem. ARIMA-GARCH model assumes i.i.d. standardized innovations, so autocorrelated residuals, and by implication non-i.i.d. standardized residuals, would be an indication that the model's assumptions are violated. You could thus reject a null hypothesis that the model has generated the data. If you want a decent model for prediction, you face a bias-variance trade-off. It is quite possible that a simpler model with mildly autocorrelated residuals will outperform a more complex model with i.i.d. standardized residuals out of sample. Update: From the edit of the original post, we get to know the time series of interest is oil price. A decent approximation might be ARIMA(0,1,0). If that yields highly autocorrelated residuals, try auto.arima for a potentially different model. ARIMA(11,0,6) makes little sense to me; I suspect this is a highly overfitted model. But if we were to examine its residuals out of curiosity, I would say the ACF and PACF plots look fairly innocuous (except that the two plots seem to be identical; that might be a mistake). Whether you should trust Ljung-Box test over eyeballing the plots is a contentious question. You probably should not; see Testing for autocorrelation: Ljung-Box versus Breusch-Godfrey or a criticism of the use of the Ljung-Box test on residuals from an ARIMA model.
