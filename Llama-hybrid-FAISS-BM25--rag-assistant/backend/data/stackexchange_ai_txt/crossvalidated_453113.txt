If you want to apply PCA, the easiest way to do this would simply be to unravel the 3rd dimension so that your array becomes (1000, 600). Then you should be able to apply the normal PCA tools in whatever coding language you are using. The only trick would then be to reshape your PCs back to the original shape once you have performed PCA.
