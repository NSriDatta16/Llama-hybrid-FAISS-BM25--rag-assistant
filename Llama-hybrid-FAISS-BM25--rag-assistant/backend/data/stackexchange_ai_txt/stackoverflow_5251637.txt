From: http://www-archive.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.7.12/known-issues.html For security reasons, Mozilla does not allow web content to link to local files. An error like:Security Error: Content at url may not load or link to file:///something will appear in the javascript console. If you need to follow links to local paths it is recommended that you drag the link to the location bar and then drop it on the webpage. If you really don't like the security check and are willing to risk all files on your system and that your system can access then you may add the following line to user.js in your personal profile directory . user_pref("security.checkloaduri", false); (Bug 84128 )
