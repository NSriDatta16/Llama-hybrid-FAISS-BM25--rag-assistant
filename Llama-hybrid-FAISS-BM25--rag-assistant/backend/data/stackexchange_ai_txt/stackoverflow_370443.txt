A 403 response indicates that the host or software you're connecting with isn't allowed to access the web service. Reasons for this might be: The remote host you are is being blocked by a firewall You've reached the limit of calls to the web service and they are blocking any further connections You are sending credentials for authentication but the account is banned/disabled The user-agent or some other header in your request is causing the service to reject the connection. Perhaps a missing header?
