Maarten Balliauw's blog covered one method extending RouteBase. I think I've also seen a custom route handler used for this. Also, this StackOverflow question covered the same question, using a more simplistic approach. I definitely recommend factoring this code out into the routing side rather than embedding the logic to get domain information in your controllers.
