Perhaps the blog below provides an answer to your question. https://www.bigdatarepublic.nl/regression-prediction-intervals-with-xgboost/ Without go through code in much detail, probably, your problem can be described as followed (from the blog): In the case that the quantile value q is relatively far apart from the observed values within the partition, then because of the Gradient and Hessian both being constant for large difference x_i-q, the score stays zero and no split occurs. Then the following solution is suggested: An interesting solution is to force a split by adding randomization to the Gradient. When the differences between the observations x_i and the old quantile estimates q within partition are large, this randomization will force a random split of this volume.
