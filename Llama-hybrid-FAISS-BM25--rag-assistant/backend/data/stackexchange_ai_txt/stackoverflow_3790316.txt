What is the object called has a name and Organization? I'll assume it's called Foo. I take it you can't say foo.getOrganization() because the database connection is closed? Can you change your FooDAO so it loads the Organization as soon as foo is read from the database? Then it will be available later when you need to do something with equals() and hashCode().
