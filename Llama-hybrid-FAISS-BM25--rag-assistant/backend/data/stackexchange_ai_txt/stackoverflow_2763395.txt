Issue with 'Hello Android' tutorial

I am brand new to Eclipse and Android, but somewhat familiar with Java. That having been said, I tried to follow the 'Hello Android' tutorial from the developer site using the latest Eclipse (Galieo) and the 2.1 Android SDK, I am on a Macintosh running Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). I have a default virtual device (though my target is actually for phones like my own HTC Incredible which has the snapdragon processor and of course all the latest accoutrement in smart phones). Everything seemed to go okay until I went to RUN>RUN and then selected 'Android Application'. My computer spins its wheels for a while and then I see two errors. I have pasted the output from Eclipse below: [2010-05-04 01:53:46 - HelloAndroid] ------------------------------ [2010-05-04 01:53:46 - HelloAndroid] Android Launch!

Apps should cease use of QuickDraw and move to Quartz. Segmentation fault iainnitro-Mac:tools iainnitro$ yields a segmentation fault(as noted above from the terminal output). So the emulator is dying on its own before anything can be shown. I have tried restarting the ADB processes. The actual code is line by line from the tutorial and I have never been able to get to the XML part yet. I am not sure what is wrong with my environment setup or if it is just an incompatibility with Snow Leopard? I would REALLY appreciate any help in resolving this as I am very interested in developing on this platform. Thank-you, Mike N Lawrence, Kansas
