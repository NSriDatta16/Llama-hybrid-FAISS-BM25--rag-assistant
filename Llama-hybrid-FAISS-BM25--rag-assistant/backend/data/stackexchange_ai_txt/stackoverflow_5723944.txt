How to force Magento to use APC cache

I just installed Magento Commerce on my hosting account and am getting fairly sluggish performance. To help speed up the site, I installed the APC cache but am having trouble getting it to work. I used these install instructions. I followed all the steps and seemed to get APC installed. No problems. When I check APC.php, it only shows 1 hit and 1 miss to the cache, which can't be right... Making me think APC isn't active or being used. I tried to ensure Magento uses APC by adding the following to /var/www/app/etc/local.xml. apc alphanumeric Any help is much appreciated.
