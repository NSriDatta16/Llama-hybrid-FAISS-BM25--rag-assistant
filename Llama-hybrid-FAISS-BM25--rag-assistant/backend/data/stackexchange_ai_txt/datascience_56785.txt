What are some key difference in functionality between ProM and Apromore?

I would like to know what are some use cases where one would use ProM and where one would use Apromore. I have traces and events from logs that I would like to use process mining on (mapping a business process from these informations, filter to isolate types of cases, estimating average time for each event, estimating the percentage of cases that go through a branch, visually, etc.), but I have a hard time choosing a tool. Also, the two seem able to interact; therefore, I have trouble understanding the key features of both. ProM seems to be a more desktop application, while Apromore web-based, distributed via a Docker image, but functionality-wise, what are some differences?
