need to display extra text inputs when selecting add button, also need to remove fields

I have a form that requires the user to input their project's outcome. They are required to input at least one outcome, and each outcome has a requirement of at least 2 measures associated with it. So I need the ability to present the user with the initial outcome field, with two measure fields associated with it, with the ability to add more measures to its related outcome. I sketched up what it would look like if the user were to have two outcomes. The dotted lines are the actions of each button. I would like to accomplish this using jQuery, but I have never done anything more than just displaying/hiding a field based on what the user clicks. Any help is appreciated. Just to sum it up, they are required to provide one outcome, each outcome has at least two measures. EDIT: Began proofing it here: http://jsfiddle.net/bkmorse/FW6s8/4/ - but the add measure button is not working properly.
