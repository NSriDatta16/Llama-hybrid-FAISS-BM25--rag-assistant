The HTTP user agent is one of the headers["User-Agent"] a browser usually sends. It is neither required nor authoritative. Some browsers have options to fake to user agent (for example the blackberry browser), and others like cfhttp can be set to whatever the user wants. If the browser does not send the header it will be blank in RAILO.
