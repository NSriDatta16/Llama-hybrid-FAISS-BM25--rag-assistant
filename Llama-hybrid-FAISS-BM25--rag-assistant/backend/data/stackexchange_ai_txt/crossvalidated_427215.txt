Interpret survival curve for multiple-event Cox proportional hazard model

I am using the bladder2 dataset, which is setup in "conditional" long format: data(bladder) > head(bladder2) id rx number size start stop event enum 1 1 1 1 3 0 1 0 1 2 2 1 2 1 0 4 0 1 3 3 1 1 1 0 7 0 1 4 4 1 5 1 0 10 0 1 5 5 1 4 1 0 6 1 1 6 5 1 4 1 6 10 0 2 I then build a simple coxph model with stratification of the recurring event (denoted by enum ): library(survminer) cox.model.cond = coxph( Surv(start, stop, event) ~ rx + number + size + strata(enum), data=bladder2 ) Then I plot the resultant survival curves: ggsurvplot(survfit(cox.model.cond), data=bladder2) How should I interpret these curves? Specifically: Even though events are sequential, does the plot indicate the average patient is at risk of 4x events at (almost) any time t ? If an average patient were currently at time t=10 and they had not experienced any events, what would we say their probabilities of experiencing the events are in the next instant? the next 10 'steps' out? Same question as above but what about a patient who has already experienced 1x event? The lines for enum=1 and enum=2 cross. How should this be interpreted, that the chance of 1x event occurring becomes less probable than the chance of the second event occurring? That seems silly; I'm sure I have it wrong :)
