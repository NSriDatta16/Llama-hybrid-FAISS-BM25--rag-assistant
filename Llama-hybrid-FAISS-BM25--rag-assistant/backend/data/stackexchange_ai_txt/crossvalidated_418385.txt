Rationale behind Q-learning

I am reading Sutton Barto on Reinforcement Learning. I understand that $TD(\lambda)$ methods propose better performance than Monte Carlo methods, with TD methods combining advantages of Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo approaches. The transition to Q-methods : SARSA, Q-Learning, Expected SARSA is unclear to me. Which gaps is filled by Q-methods, what is the rational behind their use rather than TD methods ?
