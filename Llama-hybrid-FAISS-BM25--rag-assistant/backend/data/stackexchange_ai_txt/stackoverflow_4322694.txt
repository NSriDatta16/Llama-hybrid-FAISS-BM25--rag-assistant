Anyone here have an opinion on HeapAgent?

I'm trying to track down some memory corruption going on in an app - I've heard of (but never used) Boundschecker. Rumour is that it's way to slow to use in a high performance application like a game (which is what the app I'm trying to fix is). Has anyone here used HeapAgent and have anything (good or bad) to say about it? Thanks in advance.
