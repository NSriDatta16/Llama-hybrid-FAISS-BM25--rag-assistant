Tips for improving performance of DB that is above size 40 GB (Sql Server 2005) and growing monthly by around 3GB

The current DB or our project has crossed over 40 GB this month and on an average it is growing monthly by around 3 GB. Now all the tables are best normalized and proper indexing has been used. But still as the size is growing it is taking more time to fire even basic queries like 'select count(1) from table'. So can u share some more points that will help in this front. Database is Sql Server 2005. Further if we implement Partitioning wouldn't it create a overhead ? Thanks in advance.
