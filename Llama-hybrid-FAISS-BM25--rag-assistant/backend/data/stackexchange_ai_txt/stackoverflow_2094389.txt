You seem to have nearly answered your first question, in that it is semantically not a paragraph, so the use of is -to me- wrong. The second question of whether or not to use a depends on your useage, but I don't see why not, other than the increasingly bulky code, though that'll probably not add much weight to the page. My own tendency is to nest the within the tag, though this is, again, semantically incorrect since the input is not a part of the label, being only its counterpart. Of course, both ways work and produce much the same visual effect; I've never used an alternative -speech-converter or such- to a GUI browser, so I can't say if it adds weirdness for disabled users.
