Repeated measures analysis... or not?

Not sure if dealing with repeated measures analysis...? Measuring X at 3 seasons (summer, winter, spring/fall) during a year – might be high summer/low winter, high winter/low summer, consistently high, consistently low, etc. Y (health outcome) measured at same 3 times. Time between measures not fully equal between participants. Y may or may not change within the short time frame. Main question is whether seasonal variation in X is associated with Y. ie. would someone with consistent-X in all seasons have healthier Y vs. someone with more variability in X? Might just be multiple linear/logistic regression… or is it repeated measures, or ANCOVA…? And then what if in some cases X appears to increase (or decrease) in a season but it's not due to season, ie. rather a permanent change over time... which might lead to a change in Y? But real interest is the association between seasonal variation in X and health outcome Y.
