solved it, it is the binding issue, in shadow pass fragment shader I simply checked a boolean value to disable reading the texture, but that was not enough. I should have unbind the texture before shadow pass, that is mentioned in documentation as: Quote from OpenGL Refence: Special precautions need to be taken to avoid attaching a texture image to the currently bound framebuffer while the texture object is currently bound and potentially sampled by the current vertex or fragment shader. NVIDIA ignores this, ATI behaves pretty much "undefined" as the documentation says.
