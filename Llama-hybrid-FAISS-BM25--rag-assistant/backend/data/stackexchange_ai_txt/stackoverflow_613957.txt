As MSN said the samples are in 32-bit floats. To detect a silence you would normally calculate the RMS value: Take the average of the squared sample values over some time interval (say 20-50 ms) and compare (square root of) this average to a threshold. The noise inherent in the microphone signal may let single samples reach above the threshold while the ambient sound would still be considered silence. The averaging over a short interval will result in a value that corresponds better with our perception.
