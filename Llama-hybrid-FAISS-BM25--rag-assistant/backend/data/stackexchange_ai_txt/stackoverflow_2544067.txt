Rational ClearCase + VOB Restore

We had a ClearCase Server in an other domain. We wanted to migrate a particular VOB to new ClearCase server in an other domain. I took the back up which was take yesterday night and restored the VOB in the new server(without the vob_restore utility) I used the command to describe the restored vob cleartool> describe -long vob:\samplevob versioned object base "\samplevob" created 2006-10-11T16:18:39+05:30 by Admin.CCUsers@user-b60d9d5638 VOB family feature level: 4 VOB storage host:pathname "user-b60d9d5638:e:\ClearCase_Storage\VOBs\samplevob.vbs" VOB storage global pathname "\user-b60d9d5638\ccstg_e\VOBs\samplevob.vbs" database schema version: 54 modification by remote privileged user: allowed atomic checkin: disabled vobsvr_contact call failed: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = [WINSOCK] Connection reset by peer VOB holds objects from the following views: katrina:C:\E-Services\Views\katrina\CSPOMLH\view.1.vws [uuid c471eb12.ea764350.97e2.f3:83:c4:98:33:5b] katrina:C:\E-Services\Views\katrina\csgdwau\view.2.vws [uuid d63ea3fc.fdaa4c38.b2e8.f7:e0:02:1f:dd:02] Attributes: FeatureLevel = 4 Hyperlinks: Now looking at the error, I can see it is trying to contact the view server and its not able to get the reference to the view. In the administration console, I tried removing the views but could not remove them. I tried in the command line using the rmview using the uuid. I guess I am missing something. How do I remove the references. If I do not remove the references, the files are moved to the lost and found directory. Kindly advise on how to proceed
