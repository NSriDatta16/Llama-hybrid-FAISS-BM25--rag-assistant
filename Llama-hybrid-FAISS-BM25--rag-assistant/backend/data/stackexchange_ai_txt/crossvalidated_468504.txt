The answer depends on what you mean by 'outlier' and why you want to identify outliers. In R, I generate a random sample x of size 50 from an exponential distribution with mean 1. The mean 1.11 of the sample is not a bad estimate of the population mean. set.seed(2020) x = rexp(50) mean(x) [1] 1.117136 In R, boxplot.stats with $out lists outliers. So here are the boxplot outliers in x : boxplot.stats(x)$out [1] 5.867519 4.572054 5.645287 3.238821 I decide to eliminate the outliers in x , making the new dataset x1 : x1 = x[x The mean of the truncated sample is not such a good estimate of the population mean. mean(x1) [1] 0.794198 But wait! There's more! The truncated dataset has a boxplot outlier of its own. Where do you want to terminate this process? In some sense that matters to you, is 2.6436 also an outlier? boxplot.stats(x1)$out [1] 2.643577 Boxplots of the original (left) and truncated samples. Note: Using R, I simulated $100\,000$ samples of size $n=50$ from an exponential distribution with $\mu = \sigma = 1.$ All but 977 had boxplot outliers. For the original samples, sample means averaged 1.001 and sample SDs averaged 0.991. When boxplot outliers (almost 5 per sample on average) were removed, the sample means averaged 0.849 and the sample SDs averaged 0.713. The R program for the simulation is shown below. set.seed(1234) m = 10^5; n = 100 a = s = a1 = s1 = n1 = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m){ x=rexp(n); a[i]=mean(x); s[i]=sd(x) x1 = x[x
