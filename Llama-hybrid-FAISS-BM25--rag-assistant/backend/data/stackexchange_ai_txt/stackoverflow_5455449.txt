emacs cut paste

In emacs, when I want to cut/copy and paste (kill and yank) to or from other applications, it often does not work if I do that through keyboard shortcuts, but works if I do that by using the mouse and selecting the command under the Edit Menu. Is this a bug, or intended to be like that? By the way, interestingly, drag-and-dropping into emacs works, but doing out of emacs does not work. I am using GNU emacs 23.3 under gnome on ubuntu linux 10.04. It was like this from earlier versions of emacs and ubuntu linux.
