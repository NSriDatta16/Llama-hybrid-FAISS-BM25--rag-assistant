How about this: Place a transparent UIView on top of the UIScrollView Attach two UIImageView views to that UIView, with their alphas set to somewhere less than 1. In your UIScrollView delegate's scrollViewWillBeginDragging and scrollViewDidEndDragging methods, handle the animation of the two UIImageViews. If you don't care about the preview images animating (or want to do something simpler, like just cross fading them, then it's even simpler.
