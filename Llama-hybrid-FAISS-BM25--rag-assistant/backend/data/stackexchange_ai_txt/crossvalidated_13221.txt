Finding correlations from multiple irregular time series

I have data from different sources that is currently in multiple data frames. They generally look something like: TimeStamp (MS Detail Converted with strptime), Field1, Field2, Field3 In all cases the Time Stamps are irregular, and the fields are either character data or int data. There are three types of correlations I would like to be able to do with this data (using the term loosely). In all cases these will sometimes be from the same source, and other times from different sources: Numeric to Numeric Numeric to Categorical (string). I am not sure of the proper term for this, but if field1 where to have values like A, B, and C, how might find if field2 has higher numbers than B is more likely to be the value of field1 The end goal is not only to test for correlations, but also to be able to discover them. I realize this is a pretty vague / big area. Mostly looking for basic examples, or point in the right direction of how to transform my data into format that will let me do these things.
