How do I create a dll project with Eclipse Ganymede?

Guys; How are you doing today? I have to create a dll project on Eclipse Ganymede and I donÂ´t know where to start... (I am a C# guy with VS). Can you please indicate me what type of project should I create to make a dll on Eclipse Ganymede so I can call the DLL from other Java Project?
