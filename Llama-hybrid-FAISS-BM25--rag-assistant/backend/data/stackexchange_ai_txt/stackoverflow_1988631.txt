cmd: variable of open with

When, for example, i want a batch file to 'open' a file. when i for example drag and drop the file into the batch file, it should do some stuff with that file. Now, i need to know the variable. I know there is a variable for this kind of stuff; i just forgot it. Can someone give me the variable please? Thanks.
