I can calculate the Cumulative PD* by sum of default at time(t) and divided by initial (356,335) observation and the Marginal PD** by default at time(t) divided by initial observation (356,335). Those calculations would only be correct if there were no censoring. In your situation with such a large number of cases relative to events and censored cases you might not notice the difference, but your calculations are incorrect as you have censoring. In general you need to do these calculations by working with the numbers at risk within each time interval . Using the initial numbers at risk at Time = 0 in the denominators is incorrect if there is censoring. Also, the Conditional PD** by default at time(t) divided by number of observation at time(t) with cumulative of Non-Default. Your example for time 2 is: 1,421 / (350,748 + 4,043) = 0.40% If 350,748 + 4,043 were at risk during the period between Time = 1 and Time = 2 and 1421 defaulted during that period, that is simply the hazard/probability of default during that period . (It's not clear from your question whether that corresponds precisely to the way that you have coded your data.) For me, and for Klein and Moeschberger (2nd edition, page 32, equation 2.3.8), the simplest way to estimate the cumulative hazard for discrete-time data like yours is to add up the hazards of all the time periods through the time of interest. If $h(t_j)$ is the hazard for time period $j$ , you can write: $$H(t)=\sum_{t_j \le t} h(t_j)$$ There's an alternate estimate of cumulative hazard for discrete times, Equation 2.3.9 in Klein and Moeschberger: $$ H(t)=-\sum_{t_j \le t} \ln[1-h(t_j)].$$ When you say The formula used to calculate hazard rate is -1 * [log(At Risk - Default) - log(At Risk)] and cumulative sum to get cumulative hazard rate, you are taking the difference in cumulative survival calculated that way between two adjacent time periods. With low hazard rates like yours there won't be much difference between the two estimates. These equations show how you can convert between the two types of estimates. In general it's best to choose one method, stick with it, and specify the choice that you made to your audience. *I assume that by "PD" you mean "probability of default." **I don't think that your use of the words "Marginal" and "Conditional" is standard. See Wikipedia . A "marginal" probability means some type of average over a sample; a "conditional" probability takes the values of other variables into account.
