Feature map interaction between one layer and the next in CNNs

In an arbitrary hidden layer $i$ in a neural network, let's say there are 64 feature maps and in layer $i+1$ there are 128 feature maps. Does that mean, each of the 128 kernals in layer $i+1$ was applied on each of the feature maps from layer $i$? Or are the number of kernels evenly divided so that there's something like 2 kernels being applied on every feature map to produce 128 feature maps?
