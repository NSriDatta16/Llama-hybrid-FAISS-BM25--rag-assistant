Checking Role-based permissions on all actions in centralized or clean way in .Net applications

I am trying to avoid the conventional: if(!user.HasPermission(Actions.UpdateRecord)) { // code to update record } on a large number of permissions all over my application. I am looking for a means of checking for permissions in an effective and (if possible) elegant manner. In this case there are multiple actions within each permission.
