emmeans for betareg is giving me identical arrow ranges when plotting comparisions = T

My response is a ratio (length of a discoloration disease in the plant divided by the height of the plant), so is always (0, 1). Actually, sometimes it could be [0, 1), i.e., including zeros. As I have some zeros, I transformed them accordingly with betareg vignette : a useful transformation in practice is (y · (n − 1) + 0.5)/n where n is the sample size (Smithson and Verkuilen 2006). By the way, this is the (transformed) response distribution: summary(data_nonna$tpercent_discoloration) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.0003636 0.0380720 0.1726520 0.2158268 0.3462657 0.9408556 My beta regression model is as follows: library(betareg) library(emmeans) b1 where cv is a factor of different cultivars (18 levels), zone_line is a factor of 0 or 1, and severity is another factor with levels 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, so all my predictors are factors. As one of my objectives is to compare the cultivar levels, i.e. which one has the lower percentage of discoloration, of which one has the larger percentage of discoloration etc, and check whether they differ, I started to use emmeans . Firstly I plotted the comparisons and saw that all the arrows were identical (same low and upper values for every cv ), so I changed it to plotit = F to take a look at the data being plotted. Here are the results: emm_betareg As you can see, both lcmpl and rcmpl are the same for each cv level. We also have two NAs, which, as I understood, it's because we don't need to compare the lower level to the left and the higher value to the right. Also, the results say: Results are averaged over the levels of: zone_line, severity so I thought to check the contingency table for the predictors: table(data_nonna $cv, data_nonna$ zone_line) 0 1 CPLRC5007 48 22 CPLRC5663 72 8 DK4866 67 13 DT97-4290 75 5 Exp1_Stine39LA02 67 13 Exp2_XC3810 78 2 Jack 79 1 JTN-4307 61 8 JTN-5208 79 1 JTN-5308 78 1 K07-1544 80 0 LS980358 69 10 MorsoyRT5388N 78 2 NKBrandS39-A3 74 5 Osage 74 5 Pharaoh 38 2 R01581F 79 1 Spencer 72 8 table(data_nonna $cv, data_nonna$ severity) 1 2 3 4 5 CPLRC5007 2 6 17 40 5 CPLRC5663 3 6 23 41 7 DK4866 2 5 26 34 13 DT97-4290 0 10 29 36 5 Exp1_Stine39LA02 4 5 28 40 3 Exp2_XC3810 3 1 35 31 10 Jack 0 3 14 47 16 JTN-4307 2 9 14 37 7 JTN-5208 3 15 27 30 5 JTN-5308 4 10 24 37 4 K07-1544 0 5 29 38 8 LS980358 2 5 16 35 21 MorsoyRT5388N 1 9 24 38 8 NKBrandS39-A3 3 8 24 33 11 Osage 1 6 23 39 10 Pharaoh 1 5 5 18 11 R01581F 5 8 12 28 27 Spencer 2 4 18 45 11 We have different values, so I expected to have different "arrows" for each cv . Sorry if I'm making some silly mistake, but I don't know what is going on. Any idea of what could be causing this problem?
