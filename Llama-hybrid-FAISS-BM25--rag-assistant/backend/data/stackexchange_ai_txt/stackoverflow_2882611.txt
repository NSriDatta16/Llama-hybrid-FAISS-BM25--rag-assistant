On IBM z/os mainframes, the MGMTCLAS values are defined by your systems management. Each installation may have different values. You will have to ask your site management for the values they have defined for your environment. MGMTCLAS is given when defining a new dataset on a system where the Storage Management System (SMS) feature is installed. SMS uses the assigned MGMTCLAS to guide various aspects of dataset management. Typical usages are: Manage migration of inactive datasets to archival storage Set the backup frequency Determine how often to compress partitioned datasets To delete datasets where the retention period has expired To release unused space in a dataset To enable cost accounting on datasets
