asynchronous vs synchronous training

As I understood that the difference is asynchronous vs synchronous is the following: "When a neural network is viewed as a collection of connected computation devices, the question arises whether the nodes/devices share a common clock, so that they all perform their computations ("fire") at the same time, (i.e. synchronously ) or whether they fire at different times, e.g. they may fire equally often on average, but in a random sequence (i.e. asynchronously ). {from: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/mldict.html } but I don't understand where to use each of these type. Can anyone help please? Thanks
