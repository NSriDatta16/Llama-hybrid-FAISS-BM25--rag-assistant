Reading a file and storing data in an array, then find lowest decimal value

My problem is that I cannot find a way to correctly display the correct value for the lowest population value and the province that has it. : Write a program to read in the province data file into an array called provinceName and an array called provincePopulations. You can assume that there are 10 provinces. Write a loop to: read the data into two arrays. Analyse the array to calculate the total population of all the provinces. Write another loop to find the province with the smallest population and print that the name of that province. The data is store in the following manner (provinceData.txt): Ontario 12891787 Quebec 7744530 Nova Scotia 935962 New Brunswick 751527 Manitoba 1196291 British Columbia 4428356 PEI 139407 Saskatchewan 1010146 Alberta 3512368 NF/LB 508270 Here is my Java code: import java.io.*; import java.util.Scanner; public class Slide50 { public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException { File file = new File ("C:/provinceData.txt"); Scanner in = new Scanner(file); int i = 0; String province[] = new String[10]; String lowProv = null; int pop[] = new int[10]; int totalPop = 0; int low = pop[0]; //while there is data in the file to be processed while(in.hasNext()) { province[i] = in.nextLine(); pop[i] = in.nextInt(); //discard the \n on the line in.nextLine(); //regular processing goes here i++; } System.out.printf("\n\t%-16s %20s\n", "Province", "Population"); System.out.printf("\t%-16s %20s\n", "========", "=========="); //print the province population report (which includes a total) using printf for (i = 0; i Here is my sample run based on this code: Province Population ======== ========== Ontario 12,891,787 Quebec 7,744,530 Nova Scotia 935,962 New Brunswick 751,527 Manitoba 1,196,291 British Columbia 4,428,356 PEI 139,407 Saskatchewan 1,010,146 Alberta 3,512,368 NF/LB 508,270 ================ ========== Total: 33,118,644 The province of null with a population of 0 is the least populated of all provinces.
