Why convolution output size is different using Toeplitz matrix?

From CNN, 2D Convolution output size is (Input height - Kernel height + 1) * (Input width - Kernel width + 1), where padding = 0 and stride = 1. I was trying to find how to compute a convolution operation with "matrix multiplication", and the solution was to use a doubly block circulant matrix. Reading a few posts about how to implement doubly block circulant matrix, I realize that they have used a different way in computing the convolution size: (Input height + Kernel height - 1) * (Input width + Kernel width - 1). Can you give me an insight into why they use the different computation for the convolution output size? Source: Source1 , Source2
