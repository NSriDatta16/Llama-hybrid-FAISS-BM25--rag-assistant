As for unbalanced data, glmer is able to handle unbalanced groups: that was actually the point of developing mixed-models approaches as compared to repeated-measures ANOVAs which are restricted to balanced designs. Including clients or providers with few events (even only one) is still better than omitting them, as it improves the estimation of the residual variance (see Martin et al. 2011 ). If you want to use BLUPs ( ranef(model) ) as a proxy of skills, you will indeed have to estimate the uncertainty around your point predictions. This can be done in a frequentist framework using ranef(model, postVar=TRUE) or through the posterior distribution in a Bayesian framework. You should however not use BLUPs as the response variable in further regression models: see Hadfield et al. (2010) for examples of misuses of BLUPs and different methods to adequately take into account their uncertainty. As for the correlation of skills between clients and providers, this unbalance might be problematic if it is very strong, as it would prevent correctly estimating the variance due to each random effect. There does not seem to be a mixed-models framework that would easily handle the correlation between random intercepts (see here for a formal expression of your problem). Could you maybe precise how correlated are the average successes of clients and providers?
