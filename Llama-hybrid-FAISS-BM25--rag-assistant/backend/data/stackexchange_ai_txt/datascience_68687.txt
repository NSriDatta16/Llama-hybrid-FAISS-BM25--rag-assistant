Using deep learning on graphs

I have directed graphs with each vertex has some label in "class01_01.gml" format. There are multiple such classes. I need to do multi class classification on these files using deep learning. Note that each graph in a particular class has different set of vertices. Is anyone familiar how to apply deep learning in this context? PS : I'm not that familiar in applying deep learning on graphs.
