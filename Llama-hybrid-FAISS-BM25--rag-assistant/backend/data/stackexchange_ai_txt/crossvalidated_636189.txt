Perhaps you should try testing for stationarity of the difference time series. If that is the case, then proceed to fit a model to the difference, e.g. AR(p), and examine the test results for the constant term accordingly. In other words, if you can establish that the difference is a well behaved mean-zero stochastic process, then you would have want you want. Although in this case, with such a small sample size, such analysis has little statistical power. I would recommend a resampling based approach for this situation.
