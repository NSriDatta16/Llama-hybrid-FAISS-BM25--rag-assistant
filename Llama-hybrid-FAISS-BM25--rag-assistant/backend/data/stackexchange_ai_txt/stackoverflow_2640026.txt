I need help on this data file to be edited in SOM_PAK format

I am working on Self Organizing Map (SOM) Implementation and I have a microarray dataset which I am trying to read in using some_read_data function, but I keep having an errors when I edit it to have it in SOM_PAK form which is recognise by SOM for reading such as: ??? Error using ==> somtoolbox\som_read_data.m Only 69 vector components on input file data line 1 (dimension is 70) Error in ==> SomMainFunction at 3 sD = som_read_data('B_r2.txt'); But, when I try to read the data without editing which is the original file (Editor: DEAD LINK! ), it indicates "Data read OK", but I have the following error: ??? Error using ==> unknown Out of memory. Type HELP MEMORY for your options. Error in ==> somtoolbox\som_bmus.m at 189 Bmus = zeros(dlen,length(which_bmus)); Error in ==> somvis\somvis_p_matrix.m at 41 [dummy dists] = som_bmus (dat, dat, 2:datlen); Error in ==> SomMainFunction at 16 [pheight rad_real perc] = somvis_p_matrix(sM,sD); You can get the datafile from here (Editor: DEAD LINK! ) you can also download the toolbox from here . I need someone to help me correct this data for me and put it in SOM_PAK format. I have tried getting it in SOM_PAK format, but it still giving me errors.
