Dealing with overlapping jQuery sortable lists

This is a bit of an obscure issue, but I'm using jQuery Sortables and trying to get two connected lists working together nicely when one is positioned as fixed . It all works fine until you scroll the page a bit such that the two lists end up positioned on top of each other. Then the lists seem to get confused as to which one should be receiving the item that's being dragged, meaning you get a bunch of jittering happening as it appears/disappears in each list. It looks like the issue is that both lists are handling the mouse/sort events since the item being dragged is technically over both lists, but what I want is to have the overlayed list (i.e. the position: fixed one) swallow the events so that the underlying main list doesn't try to receive the item. Here's the minimal code example: ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0; float: left; } li { margin: 5px; padding: 5px; width: 500px; border: solid 1px #F00; background-color: #FFF; } #overlayed { position: fixed; top: 0; background-color: #000; margin: 20px; padding: 10px; } #overlayed li { width: 50px; float: left; } $(function() { $("ul").sortable({ connectWith: "ul", opacity: 0.6 }).disableSelection(); }); Item X Item Y Item Z Item 01 Item 02 Item 03 Item 04 Item 05 Item 06 Item 07 Item 08 Item 09 Item 10 Item 11 Item 12 Item 13 Item 14 Item 15 Item 16 Item 17 Item 18 Item 19 Item 20 Item 21 Item 22 Item 23 Item 24 Item 25 Item 26 Item 27 Item 28 Item 29 Item 30 So the question is, how do I fix it?
