For the second question, I think you can use $D$ as an instrumental variable for your $M_{x}$ variables (one $x$ at a time) like this. \begin{align} M_{jt}^{x} &= \lambda_j + \theta_t + \pi D_{jt} + \nu_{jt} \tag{First stage}\\ y_{jt} &= \delta_j + \gamma_t + \phi M_{jt}^{x} + \epsilon_{jt} \tag{Outcome equation} \end{align} The interpretation of $\phi$ (using $M_{1}$ as an example) is the effect of an increase in the number of police officers on the street on neighborhood crime rate for those neighborhoods that have more police officers on the street because they were selected for a new crime fighting strategy (local average treatment effect). The paper I have in mind is Stephens and Yang (2014) , which is about education and schooling (and actually criticizing a commonly used approach in that literature), but anyway, that's where I got the idea from.
