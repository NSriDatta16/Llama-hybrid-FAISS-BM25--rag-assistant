Just to close this: What takes place is that the fifth axis is arbitrary given the dimensions of the sample ($5 \times 5$) generated by magic after that sample is centred (ie. the rank(X_centered) is 4 ). This is not due to the magic row-/col-sum property of magic squares but rather to their square nature. pca is intelligent enough to detect this rank-deficiency so it just returns four axes. If one replaces the line: [U, S, V] = svd(X_centered); with [U, S, V] = svds(X_centered,4); the same results will be obtained by both procedures. In general the rank of magic square matrix is a funny thought experiment. Cleve Moler has wrote an excellent series of blog posts on the matter.
