How to compare class distributions between different datasets?

Context: A machine learning model will be trained using multiple datasets, and the aim is to see if any dataset is better (more balanced, more representative etc) for training. Further context thanks to @dipetkov's suggestion: we have a costly training process. We are trying to understand if further or mixed training dataset B with dataset A can help, based on high-level summaries (plots or statistics). My assumption here is more data evenly divided across different classes will result in better downstream performance. Assume I have 5 datasets, and possibly thousands of classes. For example: datasetA, class1=10 samples,...class 5000=12777 samples datasetD, class1=5 samples,...class 5000=61 samples Importantly: sample sizes between classes as well as across datasets for the same class can vary drastically. I take the log of data to deal with this, also open to other suggestions! I am trying to compare which dataset is superior based on how many samples (more the better) it has. Some questions arise: 1) do we compare raw counts or percentage in dataset, 2) which statistic is reasonable to use? for example using mean per dataset can be very skewed due to outlier classes, and when we use median, it may come up zero because since the number of classes are huge, it is expected most of them to be zero. I tried below idea: I simply plot log counts across different classes for different datasets in each row (columns are class ids). The problem is, it's very cluttered and not very informative. The best you can make out is saying "first row seems to be the brightest across the board, so let's choose that" etc. Plot: https://i.stack.imgur.com/46T7d.jpg I'm open to any suggestions, using multiple plots, summary statistics, etc as long as I can justify it on a statistical ground :) Thank you!
