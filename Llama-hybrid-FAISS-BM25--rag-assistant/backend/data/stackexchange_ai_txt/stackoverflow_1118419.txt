How is the Protocol Attribute set for IP Fragments?

I am testing a network device driver's ability to cope with corrupted packets. The specific case I want to test is a when a large TCP packet is fragmented along the path because of smaller MTU in the way. What most interests me about the IP Fragmentation of the large TCP packet is, is the protocol attribute of the IP Fragment packet set to TCP for each packet, or just the first fragment?
