How to create PagePreview with more than one page using PDFsharp?

I am using PDFsharp to create PDF files in my C# application. It's working very good, but I did not find out how to create preview with more than one page. I have no trouble creating and saving documents with multiple pages, also embedding PagePreview into my Form is working. But how do I display (and draw on) more than one page in the Preview? Is there a way to pass another XGraphics object to associated RenderEvent function (that would be created from second page in document ( XGraphics.FromPdfPage(...) ))?
