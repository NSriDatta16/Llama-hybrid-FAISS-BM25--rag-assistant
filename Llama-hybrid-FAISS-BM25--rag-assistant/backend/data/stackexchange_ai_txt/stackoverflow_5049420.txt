The purpose of certificates [in SSL] is to prove that the host is the one it claims to be and not the fake one. To do this certificates are issued by certificate authorities, who [are supposed to properly] check the identity of the person or organization that requests a certificate. Consequently, self-signed certificate doesn't reliably identify the host (even if it's a localhost). So most applications report a validation error when they see a self-signed certificate in a chain of certificates. The only exception is [usually] when the certificate is explicitly added to the list of private certificates in the system - in this case it's accepted as valid. Consequently, if you have created your self-signed certificate for test purposes on your computer, then you can add it to trusted list. Otherwise (if you need a certificate for a public host), you will need to buy a certificate from one of certificate authorities.
