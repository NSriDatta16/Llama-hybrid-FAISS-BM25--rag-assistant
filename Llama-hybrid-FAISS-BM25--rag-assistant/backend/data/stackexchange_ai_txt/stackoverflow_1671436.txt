The ssh-agent process only provides a facility to use with ssh-add to add your passphrase. It does not automatically make your key available (your private key cannot be decrypted without your passphrase). In order to do this, you will need to create a passphraseless key and use that from the cron job. The usual safety warnings apply when using passphraseless keys.
