conecting also uses cpu time. so if you reconnect about 8 times per page, and you have somewhat about 100 visitors a day wich call up 5 pages in average you have 8*100*5=4000 reconnects in one day. and thats a small website. you should realy think about connecting only once or when the connection is getting lost. that would somehow lower your electricity bill also ;-)
