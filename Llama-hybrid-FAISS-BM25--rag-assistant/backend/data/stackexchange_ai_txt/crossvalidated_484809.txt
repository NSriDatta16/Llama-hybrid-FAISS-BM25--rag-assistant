Using Softmax activation function for multi-class classification

In the last layer of 'CNNs' it is common to use softmax activation functions for multi-class classification.I would like to know if is it necessary using a softmax activation function when creating a CNN for image classification task, and does it have nothing to do with the optimizer used to train the model ?
