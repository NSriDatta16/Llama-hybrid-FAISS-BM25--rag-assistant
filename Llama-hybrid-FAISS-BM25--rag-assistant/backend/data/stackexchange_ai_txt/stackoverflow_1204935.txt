Problem with IDropTarget when using with a VCL Form

I have a VCL gui developed in Codegear. I have created a DropTarget for the mainform and the DropTarget object implements the IDropTarget interface which allows me to drag and drop files from explorer. Now because I only want some of the child components to be drop targets (not the whole form), I only have the DragEnter method return S_OK when the POINTL coordinates are within the bounds of the component. However, if I drag the item slowly into the bounds of the form but not the component, DragEnter returns E_NOINTERFACE, therefore not allowing a drop. If I continue to drag into the dropzone, DragEnter won't fire, I understand why it isn't firing. So my question is how can I manually fire the DragEnter event ?
