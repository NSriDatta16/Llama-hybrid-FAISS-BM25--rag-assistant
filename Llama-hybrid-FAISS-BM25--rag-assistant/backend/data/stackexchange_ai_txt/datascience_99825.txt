For imbalanced data there are some techniques that you can use to compensate imbalance namely:- 1.) Random Under sampling:- remove some observation from majority class to compensate for imbalance. Perform this only with huge amount of data. 2.) Random Over sampling:- add observations with some changes to minority class. perform this only with small data. 3.) SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique):- Synthesize new observations for minority class using KNN. 4.) NearMiss:- Unser sampling technique. Using a distance this will make the majority class equal to minority. Again uses KNN. 5.) Change the metric used:- Do no use accuracy for imbalanced data as it will lead you to think your model did good when in fact it performs poorly on real world data. F1 score and AUROC are your best bets 6.) Penalized algo's:- Penalizes mistakes on minority classes by an amount proportional to how under represented the minority class is. Examples are Penalized SVM. 7.) Change the algo:- Tree based models usually perform better on imbalanced data compared to other models. Examples are RandomForest, Gradient Boosted Trees.
