After editing my question some Stackoverflow started relating the right questions to me. I knew this was a common problem, but I really couldn't find it, just couldn't come up with the right search terms, I guess. The following threads address similar problems and I'll try to apply that logic to my own design. They all propose adding a higher-level description for (in my case terms and gaps) like items. That makes sense and reflects the logic behind my application. Relation Database Design Foreign Key on multiple columns in one of several tables Foreign Key refering to primary key across multiple tables And this good person illustrates how to retrieve the data once it's broken up across tables. He also clues me to the keyword class table inheritance , so now I know what to google. I'll post back with my edited schema once I've applied this. It does seem more elegant like this.
