this works almost fine: SELECT p.idproduct, p.name, p.tax, sub.price, (sub.price * (1+tax/100)) as price_with_tax FROM product p, (SELECT s.idproduct, s.price FROM product_storage s WHERE quantity > 0 ORDER BY added ASC) sub WHERE p.idproduct=sub.idproduct but all rows from product_storage are returned for each product :/
