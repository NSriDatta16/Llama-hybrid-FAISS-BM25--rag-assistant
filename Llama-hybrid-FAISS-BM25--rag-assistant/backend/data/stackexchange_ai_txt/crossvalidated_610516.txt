Your direction of using a linear regression is appealing even though it has an obvious limitation (of not being limited to $[0,1]$ . We can change it though to fit your analysis. I want to see whether there is a relationship between the number of apples in the baskets and the number of dots on the apples across the 30 baskets So, assuming we want to estimate the apples-regression. That is, to find the relationship between the number of apples in the basket (or, the proportion of apples in each basket), and the proportion of dots assigned them (of all the dots of all the fruits in the basket). Let's specify the task at hand as if we want to estimate the total number of points, so we can use a Poisson Regression model, which is a form of GLM model. Poisson Regression models are best used for modeling events where the outcomes are counts. Or, more specifically, count data: discrete data with non-negative integer values that count something, like the number of times an event occurs during a given timeframe or the number of people in line at the grocery store. Count data can also be expressed as rate data, since the number of times an event occurs within a timeframe can be expressed as a raw count (i.e. "In a day, we eat three meals") or as a rate ("We eat at a rate of 0.125 meals per hour"). [ here ] I won't delve into Poisson Regression, as the link I attached includes a better and clearer introduction. Instead, let's discuss the modeling part. You want to specify a regression model that estimates the proportion of dots assigned to apples in the basket. Therefore, $y_i$ is this proportion, for basket $i$ , and is calculated by $\dfrac{N^{apples}_{i}}{N^{oranges}_{i}}$ , where $N$ is the number of dots. Next, you want as a predictor the number of apples in basket $i$ , $X_{i}$ . I don't think we want to add a per-basket fixed effect because we aren't interested in the average number of dots per apple within the basket, but we definitely want to adjust our error rates to allow for correlation between fruits in the basket. Luckily, the glm package is quite general, and allow for clustered regression errors, see te documentation here .
