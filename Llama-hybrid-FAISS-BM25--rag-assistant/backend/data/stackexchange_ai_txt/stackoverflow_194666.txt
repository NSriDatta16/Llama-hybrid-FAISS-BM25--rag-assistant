Is there a way to suppress warnings in Xcode?

Is there a way to suppress warnings in Xcode? For example I am calling an undocumented method and since the method is not in the header I get a warning on compile. I know I can add it to my header to stop the warning, but I am wondering if there is a way other than adding it to the header (so I can keep the headers clean and standard) to suppress the warning? A pragma or something?
