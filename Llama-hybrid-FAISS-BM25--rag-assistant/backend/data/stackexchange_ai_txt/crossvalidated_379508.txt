Is Gibbs sampling an MCMC method?

As far as I understand it, it is (at least, that is how Wikipedia defines it ). But I've found this statement by Efron* (emphasis added): Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the great success story of modern-day Bayesian statistics. MCMC, and its sister method “Gibbs sampling,” permit the numerical calculation of posterior distributions in situations far too complicated for analytic expression. and now I'm confused. Is this just a minor difference in terminology, or is Gibbs sampling something other than MCMC? [*]: Efron 2011, "The Bootstrap and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo"
