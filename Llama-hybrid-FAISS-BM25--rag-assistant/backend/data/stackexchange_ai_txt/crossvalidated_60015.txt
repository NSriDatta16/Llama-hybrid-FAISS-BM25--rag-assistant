Logistic regression vs MLE of conditional probability

I am trying to build a classification model from a large dataset (50M instances) with a categorical independent variable ( pred ) and a binary dependent variable ( class ). The dependent variable is very skewed - only 2K positive instances. What confuses me is the very low predicted probability of logistic regression model. (glm(class~pred,family=binomal)), compared to standard conditional probability estimate (prop.table(table(class,pred),2)[2,]): 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 7.898106e-03 5.133151e-03 3.332895e-03 2.162637e-03 1.402706e-03 9.095645e-04 (glm)... 1.029593e-01 1.572959e-02 4.906542e-03 1.695033e-03 7.622454e-04 5.922985e-04 (mle)... Is this expected differences? Should I use some method other than logistic regression (results are similar with non-parametric locfit)? Is it OK to report conditional probabilities only?
