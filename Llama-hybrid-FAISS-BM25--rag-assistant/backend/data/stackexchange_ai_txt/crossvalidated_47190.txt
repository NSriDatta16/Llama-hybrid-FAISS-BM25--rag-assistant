Basic Bayesian MCMC to estimate two parameters from binomial distributions given unknown number of trials

This is a very basic question about Bayesian inference. I'm not grasping one or more fundamental concepts. Let's say I have two observed outcomes, X and Y . I want to infer the probabilities ( px and py , respectively) of each occurring given X and Y . I do not know N , the total number of trials. I'm assuming that X and Y are binomially distributed. How do I calculate the likelihood without N ? What I ultimately want is to show the bivariate posterior distribution of px and py via MCMC. I do not care about estimating N --I just want to show the chain in the plane of px and py . No convergence necessary. Clarification: X and Y are drawn from the same N : X ~Binom( N , px ) and Y ~Binom( N , py ). We have no other information about px or py , although I'll use a beta prior to start. Also assume that X and Y are independent.
