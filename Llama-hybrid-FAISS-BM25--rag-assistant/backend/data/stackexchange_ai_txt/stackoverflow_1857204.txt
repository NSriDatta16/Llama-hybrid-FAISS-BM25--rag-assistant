How to pass a value from Cocoa to an SQLite query

first of all please let me say that I am quite new to objective c development. I am writing a small app for personal use for the iphone, but I have some problems executing the following code: NSString *sql = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"select color_r, color_g, color_b from Calendar where ROWID = %@", [calendarsID objectForKey:[arrayColors objectAtIndex:row]]]; sqlite3_stmt *selectstmt; if(sqlite3_prepare_v2(database, sql, -1, &selectstmt, NULL) == SQLITE_OK) The compiler tells me that I am passing argument 2 of sqlite3_prepare_v2 from an incompatible pointer type. The program gets, anyhow, compiled and runs but, when it has to execute the code that I've just shown you, it produces an error. It says that there is a syntax error in the query, and the syntax error is just in the last part of the query. Instead of having: select color_, color_g, color_b from Calendar where ROWID = 63 (for example) I get strange characters in the place of the last number (63). I guess this is a problem related to string conversion. Can please anyhone help me? Thank you very much for your attention. Alessio
