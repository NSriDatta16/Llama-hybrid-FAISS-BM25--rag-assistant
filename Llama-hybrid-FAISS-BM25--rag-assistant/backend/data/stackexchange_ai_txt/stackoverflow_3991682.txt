To handle that reliably, you need to load your Flash via Javascript... http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ and pay attention to the fact that you need to set wmode to transparent: from examples... var so = new SWFObject("movie.swf", "mymovie", "400", "100%", "8", "#336699"); so.addParam("wmode", "transparent"); so.write("flashcontent");
