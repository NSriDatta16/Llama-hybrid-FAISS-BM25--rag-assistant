Difference between newTransformer and newTemplates in Java XSLT transformations

In Java, from a TransformerFactory for creating objects to process XSLT, and it has the methods: newTransformer which creates Transformer object, which can transform XML into a result. newTemplates which creates Templates object which can create a Transformer . The documentation for Transformer explicitly states: A Transformer may be used multiple times. My application processes various different XMLs with the same XSLT. At the start of the program I use newTransformer to create a Transformer then re-use it for all the XMLs (making sure it's synchronized so I only use it from one thread; and calling its reset() method before each processing.). That way I don't incur the cost of re-compiling the XSLT for every XML I process. So what's the point of the newTemplates and the Templates object? Should I be using that instead, and creating a new Transformer object for each XML?
