Detecting statistically significant clustering of continuous values

I'm working with biological sequence data where each position in the sequence has an associated continuous value. I'm ignoring the sequence content so the data is very similar to a time series with measurements at discrete timepoints -- all values are equally spaced. I would like to be able to detect whether high values tend to cluster together (occur in runs) so I applied the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for non-random placement of values >1. There are some issues with that approach: Wald-Wolfowitz works on binary data so I have to binarise the continuous values I have (everything larger than 1 becomes 1 and the rest is 0). Ideally I would like to be able to detect features such as runs of similar values (let's say 10 values of 0.5 in a row) as well. I would imagine there are some methods that would operate on continuous values (e.g. based on autocorrelation) but couldn't find any. While I get a measure of clustering (the test p-value), I don't know which parts are actually clustered or how many clusters there are. I would also like to extend this approach to 3D (mapping of sites on the protein structure) and the test doesn't support multiple dimensions, either. I was wondering if there are more sophisticated statistical approaches that I could apply?
