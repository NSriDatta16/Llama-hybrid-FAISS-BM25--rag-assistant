Late breaking News.. at least I'm just getting it. As I was downloading the latest Java SDK for GAE I noticed on the Release Notes that "Issue 29: Expose batch gets" was fixed in the latest release (v1.2.1). Basically it seems that we (I'm looking for the same support it seems) may have a JDO based alternative rather than having to drop down to the "low-level" Datastore API. I've just downloaded the latest Java GAE SDK so I haven't had an opportunity to test anything yet, but I wanted to give you a heads-up ASAP. I'll post anything more I learn after I've had a chance to confirm this "fix". Please accept my apologies if I've broken StackOverflow etiquette by re-posting my comment as an answer, but I decided to do it for two reasons. Firstly because, even though it's me addressing the same issue again, IMHO this new information appears to provide a completely different "answer" to the problem. And secondly, I was concerned that the comment form might not get your attention before you'd spent a great deal of time looking into the first answer that I provided. Next time I'll think more carefully before acting. TL
