Is the reward r(s,a) could be continous value in Reinforcement Learning?

the reward $r(s,a)$ is given by the environment to evaluate the action taken in state s . Usually the reward r is discrete, so I wanna to know whether it can be a continous value. for example, the reward function is like that $r(s,a) = 1\quad if ... , else -1$ , so I wanna to know whether it could be like this $r(s,a) = c$ , c is any value from -1 to 1.
