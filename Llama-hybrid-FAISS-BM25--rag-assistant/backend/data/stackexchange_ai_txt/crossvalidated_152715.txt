What is meant by "weakly dependent" on p. 64 of Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning?

I'm reading Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning ( here is a free online copy). On page 64, beginning with equation (4.2.20), Barber says Our aim is to show that a distribution of the form [below] cannot satisfy the Markov property $x_1 \perp\!\!\!\perp x_3 | x_2, x_4$ $$ p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = \phi_{12}(x_1, x_2) \phi_{23}(x_2, x_3) \phi_{34}(x_3, x_4) \phi_{41}(x_4, x_1) \phi_{13}(x_1, x_3) $$ Later, in equation (4.2.23): If we assume that the potential $\phi_{13}$ is weakly dependent on $x_1$ and $x_3$, $$ \phi_{13}(x_1, x_3) = 1 + \epsilon\psi(x_1, x_3) $$ What does "weakly dependent" mean exactly in this context? And further, what object does the symbol $\psi$ represent?
