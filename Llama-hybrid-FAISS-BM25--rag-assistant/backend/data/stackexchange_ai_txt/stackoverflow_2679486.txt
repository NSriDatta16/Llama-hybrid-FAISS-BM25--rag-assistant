Telerik RadControls RadFormDecorator - Tow Problem About Positioning

i am using asp.net with c# web app in vs 2008 problem 1: i do not know why Telerik RadControls- RadFormDecorator Moves some controls (such as Buttons or chech boxes) and changes their positioning up or down in my form after viewing in browser... i put those controls in a cell of a table ... but not help i had this problem about radajaxmanager and by setting UpdatePanelsRenderMode property to inline problem solved - but here there is no property like that... what is going on here? problem2: i decorated my buttons and chechboxes with radformdecorator (telerik radcontrols) control... when i click on a checkbox to set it to true or false so my webpage positioning goes to up (like when postback occurs , but this is not postback) how can i prevent this problem ? thanks for attention
