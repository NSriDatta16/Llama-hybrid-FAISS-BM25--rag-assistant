Adding this solution with grep and basic sh builtins for those interested in a more portable solution (independent of bash version; also works with plain old sh , on non-Linux platforms etc.) # GLOB matching gg=svm-grid-ch case "$gg" in *grid*) echo $gg ;; esac # REGEXP if echo "$gg" | grep '^....grid*' >/dev/null ; then echo $gg ; fi if echo "$gg" | grep '....grid*' >/dev/null ; then echo $gg ; fi if echo "$gg" | grep 's...grid*' >/dev/null ; then echo $gg ; fi # Extended REGEXP if echo "$gg" | egrep '(^....grid*|....grid*|s...grid*)' >/dev/null ; then echo $gg fi Some grep incarnations also support the -q (quiet) option as an alternative to redirecting to /dev/null , but the redirect is again the most portable.
