Should Bayesian inference be avoided with a small sample size and weakly informative priors?

When specifying a Bayesian model, one can specify weakly-informative priors. However, such priors may represent a concern to many researchers. After all, if they are weakly-informed, one may be concerned that the imprecision of such a prior may be biasing the results. It is also my understanding that the influence of the prior diminishes as more data is introduced. However, the prior may be very influential if the N is small. Given this, if you know beforehand that your priors are weak and that you have a small sample size, should you avoid Bayesian inference?
