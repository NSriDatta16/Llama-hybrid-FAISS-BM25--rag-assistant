CAB with UltraDockWorkspace

I am using CAB and SCSF for my application and i am using CAB Extensibility Kit from Infragistics I followed this article. The sample has three projects. Shell form . common and SmartPartLib Infragistics CAB Extensibility Kit in SmartPartLib project there is class ModuleController.cs. This method is creating some Views which are going to be displayed on App start... I want to know that when this.WorkItem.Workspaces[Constants.WorkspaceNames.DockWorkspace] is Initialized. I tried to do the same in sample SCSF project but i am getting this WorkspaceObject as null.. Please tell me is anyone using Infragistics CAB Kit... private void AddViews() { //Create the Root View first, but do not show it RootView theRootView = this.WorkItem.SmartParts.AddNew (); //Here is the important part: //Whenever dynamically creating controls that will interact with the //UltraDockManager, for the best results, make sure that you //assign a unique value to the control's "Name" property. In this case, //since the dynamic nature of CAB and SmartParts brings us to the //same situation, we also add a value to the SmartPart's "Name" property: TreeView theTreeView = this.WorkItem.SmartParts.AddNew (); //1: Create theTreeView.Name = "theTreeView"; //2: Set Name this.WorkItem.Workspaces[Constants.WorkspaceNames.DockWorkspace].Show(theTreeView); //3: Show it GridView theGridView = this.WorkItem.SmartParts.AddNew (); theGridView.Name = "theGridView"; this.WorkItem.Workspaces[Constants.WorkspaceNames.DockWorkspace].Show(theGridView); ChartView theChartView = this.WorkItem.SmartParts.AddNew (); theChartView.Name = "theChartView"; this.WorkItem.Workspaces[Constants.WorkspaceNames.DockWorkspace].Show(theChartView); //Load the layout through the interface ((IRootView)theRootView).LoadDockLayout(); //Finally show the Root View this.WorkItem.Workspaces[Constants.WorkspaceNames.MainWorkspace].Show(theRootView); }
