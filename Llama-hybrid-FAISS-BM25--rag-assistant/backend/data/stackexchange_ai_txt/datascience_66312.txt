What VM should I use?

So I am starting a project that has some code in it that has to do with machine learning (for example recommender system). At the moment I am thinking that if I want to deploy this application, should I look into the VMÂ´s that are dedicated to Machine Learning applications or can a regular VM run these kinds of operations as well? What are the differences between them? Thanks for answers!
