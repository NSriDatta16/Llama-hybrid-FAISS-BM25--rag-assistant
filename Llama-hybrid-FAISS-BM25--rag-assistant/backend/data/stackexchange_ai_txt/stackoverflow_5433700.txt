Reading a MIDI file without going byte by byte

I need to read simple multi-track MIDI files using C#/F#. I began writing a binary reader, but it seems to be an overkill for this purpose. I tried several things I've found on Google, none worked (each with its own problem). The files are really simple (Bach's chorales - only chords, nothing fast, always 4 instruments). Thanks!
