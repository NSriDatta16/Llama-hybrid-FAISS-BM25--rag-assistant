If the tests are truly equivalent, then you should be able to compare standardized scores in one country with those in another. (I would want to make sure that the options leading to various Likert values are equivalent also. And that standardization was done equivalently in both countries.) Equivalent tests, overlapping populations: Suppose student A takes a college admissions test with scores distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(100, 20),$ scoring 130, and that student B takes a an equivalent college admissions test with scores distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(150, 30),$ scoring 195. To be sure that the two tests are equivalent, we would probably need data from many students who took both tests. (In the US, this might be feasible to do for two types of admissions tests, both of which have been taken by many of the same students. There is a lot of data about the equivalence of these tests. My own university accepts scores from either test, and has tables for fairly converting one kind of score to a satisfactory approximation of the other. For an example, see these equivalence tables .) The respective z-scores of students A and B are $Z_A = \frac{130 - 100}{20} = 1.50$ and $Z_B = \frac{195-150}{30} = 1.5.$ Each student scored 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on whichever test they took. Then it seems fair to conclude that A and B are equally adept at taking such tests. Same test, different populations: By contrast (against all real-world evidence), let's imagine people in country A have very different intelligence levels than people in country B. And that they take exactly the same intelligence test. Then if the data on means and standard deviations used to standardize the scores in each country came only from that country, it would be difficult to compare. If the z-scores of a person from A and a person from B are both 0, then we can only conclude that each person is of average intelligence for his/her own country, but it would not be possible to say they are are of equal intelligence to each other. Thus, if z-scores are to be compared across countries, it is important that universal data be used to standardize all scores.
