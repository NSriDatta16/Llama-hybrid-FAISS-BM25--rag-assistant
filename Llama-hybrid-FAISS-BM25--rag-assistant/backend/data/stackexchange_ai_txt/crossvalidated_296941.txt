I am not well versed in Matlab but I am confident that you can run a generalized linear model in the program. A quick Google search led me to this site with what looks like relevant code for such a model. I'll walk you through a Poisson regression using R. The basic properties and output of the analysis should be the same. First, I simulated some truncated data (I tried to give it some similar properties to your data set): > head(dat) total_clicks descrp 1 4 23 2 1 19 3 3 22 4 7 21 5 0 14 6 1 15 My goal here is to determine whether total clicks over the 7 days can be predicted by the number of words in the description. Here is the model and output from R: > fit summary(fit) Call: glm(formula = total_clicks ~ descrp, family = "poisson", data = dat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.7788 -0.7558 -0.1032 0.6439 2.5157 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.50713 0.26060 1.946 0.05165 . descrp 0.03516 0.01250 2.812 0.00492 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for poisson family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 116.82 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 108.88 on 98 degrees of freedom AIC: 402.55 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 Briefly, the model suggests there is a positive relation between the number of words in a description and the number of unique clicks received. However, this value does not have an obvious interpretation. We have to convert it back to the units of measure (instead of taking the log - which is the link function for the Poisson regression - we exponentiate this coefficient) In R code this is how you exponentiate: > exp(fit$coefficients) (Intercept) descrp 1.660519 1.035782 This gives you a value for the intercept (which is the estimated frequency of clicks when your predictor or predictors equal 0) and the slope. Some call this latter exponentiated coefficient the incident rate ratio (IRR) others refer to it as the event rate ratio (ERR). Regardless of the terminology used the interpretation is the same. For each additional word in a description the click rate increases by a factor of 1.036. Or another way of thinking of this value that may be more intuitive is that each additional word is related to a 3.6% increase in the frequency of clicks (on average).
