XMPP vs JMS as a message carrier

I'm considering using either XMPP or JMS as the transport for exchanging messages between software agents. (I'm working with the JADE agent system.) The main problem I need to solve is to be able to send or deliver messages from/to agents which may be behind firewalls. Is there any reason to consider XMPP or JMS superior for that purpose?
