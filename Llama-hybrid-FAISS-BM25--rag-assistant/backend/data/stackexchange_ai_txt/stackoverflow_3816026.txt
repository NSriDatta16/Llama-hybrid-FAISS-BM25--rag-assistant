Yes, SQL Azure charges you per database, but what you're really paying for is the size of the database. For example a 1GB DB will cost you $9.99 and month, a 10GB DB will cost you $99.99 a month. The databases in SQL Azure also currently have a maximum size of 50GB. Based on this and what you've said about your app (possibly hundreds of DBs), and making the assumption that each database is going to contain enough data to make paying for 1GB of DB worthwhile, I would continue to use one DB for each instance. If the data for each instance is actually quite small and even if you had hundreds of instances you wouldn't hit the 50GB limit then you would save money (but not time) by partitioning your data and storing it in just one database. If cost is your primary concern and you're thinking about a rewrite anyway, I would consider using Azure Table Storage (AZT) where that same 1GB of data will cost you $0.15 a month to store (but you do have to give up on little things like foreign keys and queries with more than 1 table in them)
