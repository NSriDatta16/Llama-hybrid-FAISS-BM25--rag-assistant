To quote from David Flanagan, "Javascript, The Definitive Guide" (5th edition), Section 14.4.3: "The Window object defines methods that move and resize a window. Using these methods is typically considered very poor form: the user should have exclusive control of the size and position of all windows on her desktop. Modern browsers typically have an option to prevent JavaScript from moving and resizing windows, and you shuld expect this option to be on in a sizable percentage of browsers " (emphasis added)
