I'd suggest something entirely different. Factor analysis assumes normality for the variables. But as you said, your variables are categorical, so the assumption of normality is violated. It is advisable to use optimal scaling methods like a nonlinear PCA (available in SPSS: Data Reduction > Optimal Scaling) to create composite variables when your original variables are categorical. I believe you can also do it using homals package in R. The next step is usually breaking up the composite variable into terciles, quintiles or whatever you think is appropriate to use it in future analysis. This is how you should make a composite variable categorical. Similar methods are widely used to create a categorical composite variable called wealth index. First, you retain the scores of the first component and then categorize it into quintiles. For your case, you can categorize the composite score into 7 categories if that is appropriate.
