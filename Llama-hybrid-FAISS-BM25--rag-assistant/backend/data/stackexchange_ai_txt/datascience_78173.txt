Logistic regression vs Random Forest on imbalanced data set

I have an imbalanced data set where positives are just 10% of the whole sample. I am using logistic regression and random forest for classification. While comparing the results of these models, I have found that the probability output of logistic regression ranges between [0,1] while that of random forest ranges between [0, 0.6]. I cannot share the data set but my doubt is around the working of these algorithms. How can random forest generate probability less than 0.6?
