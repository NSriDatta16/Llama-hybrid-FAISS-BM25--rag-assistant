Dynamically set value of a file input

Is there a way to set the value of a file input ( ) or is that all blocked for security? I'm trying to use google gears' openFiles to make a simple multi-uploader. Note: The answer(s) below reflect the state of legacy browsers in 2009. Now you can actually set the value of the file input element dynamically/programatically using JavaScript in 2017. See the answer in this question for details as well as a demo: How to set file input value programatically (i.e.: when drag-dropping files)?
