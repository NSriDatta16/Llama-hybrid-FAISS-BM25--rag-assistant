Did anybody have problems with migrating Xcode3.2x projects to Xcode4?

At the moment I'm in a production cycle with submitting updates to my App every 2 weeks in average. I'm thinking of migrating to Xcode4 right now. Did anybody have problems with migrating projects or archiving or submitting to store? If so, best practises in solving such issues are very welcome.
