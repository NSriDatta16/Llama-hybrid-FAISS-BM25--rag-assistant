Here is a description from The Analysis Factor article on Approaches to Repeated Measures Data: Repeated Measures ANOVA, Marginal, and Mixed Models by Karen Grace-MAartin. To quote some comments: In a marginal model (AKA, the population averaged model), the model equation is written just like any linear model. There is a single response and a single residual. The difference between the marginal model and a linear model is that the residuals are not assumed to be independent with constant variance. In a marginal model, we can directly estimate the correlations among each individual’s residuals. (We do assume the residuals across different individuals are independent of each other). We can specify that they are equally correlated, as in the RM ANOVA, but we’re not limited to that assumption. Each correlation can be unique, or measurements closer in time can have higher correlations than those farther away. There are a number of common patterns that the residuals tend to take. And, with respect to the option of employing a Linear Mixed Model: It too controls for non-independence among the repeated observations for each individual, but it does so in a conceptually different way. Rather than just estimate the correlation among an individual’s repeated observations, it actually adds one or more random effects for Individuals to the model. The model equation therefore includes extra parameters to include any random effects. They take the form of additional residual terms, each of which has its own variance to be estimated. This literally means the model is controlling for the effects of individual. The simplest mixed model, the random intercept model, controls for the fact that some individuals always have higher values than others. By controlling for this variation, we’ve taken it out of the original residual. Individual growth curve models are a specific type of mixed model that uniquely models each individual’s value of the outcome over time. They are particularly useful when the research question is about how covariates affect not only the value of the dependent variable, but its change over time. The biggest advantage of mixed models is their incredible flexibility. They can handle clustered individuals as well as repeated measures (even in the same model). They can handle crossed random effects, where there are repeated measures not only on an individual, but also on each stimulus. Time can easily be considered continuous or categorical, and covariates can be measured just once per individual or repeatedly at each observation. Unbalanced data are no problem, and even if some outcomes are missing for some individuals, they won’t be dropped from the model. The biggest disadvantage of mixed models, at least for someone new to them, is their incredible flexibility. It’s easy to mis-specify a mixed model, and this is a place where a little knowledge is definitely dangerous. In the case that your data contains individuals with say measurements of heavy metals in their blood over time, but not necessarily the same individuals (given that is a 100 years of data), I suspect that with the simplest mixed model, namely the random intercept model, one may have a model specification issue. For example, in measuring blood levels of say Lead which actually relates to water and air exposure to all individuals over time in a particular locale, the process for controlling the effects of the individual (who happen to change over time), there could be a misstatement in the individual effect (the intercept). The latter may actually be part of the time trend (from say, mining activity and associated pollution over years with a corresponding impact on the general population). In such a case, working with the marginal model may be better. Bottom line, more clarity on what is being modeled (like pollution related to a particular locale) and is the selected model appropriate and likely could provide the best fit for a time trend (or forecast, which may be of interest). On the last comment, to quote from a prior thread : "However, the problem is that so far in my experience population-level predictions based on mixed models are significantly worse than predictions based on standard regression models with fixed effects only." Supplied answers seem to suggest, it depends (hence, my call for clarity).
