How to engineer features for machine learning

Do you have some advices or reading how to engineer features for a machine learning task? Good input features are important even for a neural network. The chosen features will affect the needed number of hidden neurons and the needed number of training examples. The following is an example problem, but I'm interested in feature engineering in general. A motivation example: What would be a good input when looking at a puzzle (e.g., 15-puzzle or Sokoban )? Would it be possible to recognize which of two states is closer to the goal?
