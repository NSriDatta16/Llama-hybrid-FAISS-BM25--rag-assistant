In Metropolis Algorithm, if draws $\theta^{t-1}$ and $\theta^t$ have the same marginals, why is the target is the same as the stationary distribution?

In the Metropolis algorithm, suppose I start my algorithm at time $t-1$ with a draw $\theta^{t-1}$ from my target distribution $p(\theta|y)$. It can be shown that $\theta^t$ and $\theta^{t-1}$ are symmetric in that $$ P(\theta^t = \theta_a, \theta^{t-1} = \theta_b) = P(\theta^{t-1} = \theta_a, \theta^{t} = \theta_b) $$ Based on this, it is written in Bayesian Data Analysis 3 by Gelman that $\theta^{t}$ and $\theta^{t-1}$ have the same marginal distributions and so $p(\theta|y)$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain of $\theta.$ Could someone explain why $\theta^{t}$ and $\theta^{t-1}$ having the same marginal distributions imply $p(\theta|y)$ becomes the stationary distribution of my chain? Thanks.
