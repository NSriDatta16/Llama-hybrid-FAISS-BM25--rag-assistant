The difference is explained in: What is the difference between the various ZODB blobstorage layouts? . You don't need to worry about this; lawn is there only for backwards compatibility. If you do have a lawn layout blobstorage (you'll get a warning in the log if you do) and want to migrate to a bushy layout, use the migrateblobs script; here is a buildout part to create the script: [migrateblobs] recipe = zc.recipe.egg eggs = ZODB3 entry-points = migrateblobs=ZODB.scripts.migrateblobs:main Shut down any instances and ZEO servers, back up your blob storage and run the script on your blobstorage directory: $ mv var/blobstorage var/blobstorage-lawn $ bin/migrateblobs var/blobstorage-lawn/ var/blobstorage var/blobstorage has then been migrated to use the bushy layout.
