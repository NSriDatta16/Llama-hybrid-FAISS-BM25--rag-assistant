Is Multiple Linear Regression appropriate here?

I'm after some advice. I have done a log transformation for my DV (this normalises the distribution), which is a continuous variable. My IV is count data (but it's a 5 year moving average). The IV is strongly skewed to the right. I have added some control variables to my model. I have done some diagnostics, which I want to share with you. Everything looks pretty well, except for the QQ plot---I know it's not perfect, but do you think there's much harm? What worries me a little more is what I find when I do AvPlots for my model---these are partial regression plots, i.e. they show x and y, having accounted for other variables in the model. I would love to see the data points more spread-out. Perhaps I can achieve this by adding more variables to the model. But do you think this looks alright for a MLR? If not, what should I do/use then? Any justified advice much appreciated.
