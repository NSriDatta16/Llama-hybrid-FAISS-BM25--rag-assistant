Why dont we have load factor for HashMap ? We do - see HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor) Why is load factor 0.75 for hashtable and not some other value which is varying. The load factor for a Hashtable is a tunable parameter. The javadoc for HashMaps says this about the 0.75 value. "As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between time and space costs. Higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of the operations of the HashMap class, including get and put)." I understand that the number was determined by empirical testing rather than by theoretical analysis. (A thorough theoretical analysis would be difficult. However, a load factor of 0.75 combined with a good hash function is probably sufficient to keep hash chains down to 1 or 2 in the vast majority of cases, and that results in fast average lookup times.)
