What is a YAML file and where is it used in a machine learning context?

I am not entirely sure if this is on-topic here, so please let me know if it is not. I keep seeing the idea of YAML files pop up while reading machine learning literature. My question is, what exactly is a YAML file, and how does it relate to machine learning and data science projects?
