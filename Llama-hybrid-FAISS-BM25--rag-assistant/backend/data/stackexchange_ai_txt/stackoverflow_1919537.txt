If you want to take every element in an array and change it, the idiomatic Ruby way is to use map or collect: @new_urls = @urls.map do |url| # change url to its new value here end You don't need to manually assign it to @new_urls, just write a statement that returns the desired value, like url.upcase or whatever you want to do.
