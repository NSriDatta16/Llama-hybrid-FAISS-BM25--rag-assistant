I would simply calculate a rolling window of the number of trades (or dollar volume) per hour, day, week, or whatever time frame that makes sense. For example, you might use 1 day as the rolling window. If 1 trade per day is a low degree of clustering then 10 trades per day might be a high degree of clustering. If so, then a linear "y" scale for a "clustering plot" is probably reasonable. Here's an example: Edit 2 =========================================== Below is the updated version of the plot. Just like the previous plots, the gray line is from a "window" of 1 day where the "cluster number" is the number of trades for the previous day. The new blue line is from a "window" of 5 days where the "cluster number" is the sum of the trades for the previous 5 days divided by 5 (the divide by 5 is to scale the result so it can be directly compared to a 1 day "window"). The new purple line is from a "window" that sums the trades for 10 days and then divides by 10, and the new green line is from a "window" for 20 days, divided by 20. The last day in the plot (far right hand side) is for the day 2010-07-02 where the values are: 1 day window = 0 5 day window = 2 10 day window = 1.5 20 day window = 1.25 If you had chosen a "window" of 5 days, then before you trade on 2010-07-03 (assuming that's the next trading day), your "cluster number" would be 2 (averaging 2 trades per day for the previous 5 days). Just like any moving average, the longer the "window", the smoother the plot. However, this smoothing delays the peaks and valleys. Compare the gray peak in early April with the blue peak, then the purple peak, and then the green peak. This may not be a big issue for the current use, but I thought it was a good idea to point it out. The bottom line is, you'll have to play around with different "windows" to zero-in on your desired smoothness and timeliness.
