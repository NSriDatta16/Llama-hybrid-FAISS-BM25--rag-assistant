If storage is at a premium, have you looked into AAC audio? I believe Flash 9 and 10 on desktop browsers will play it. AAC in my experience takes only half of the size of the comparable MP3 (i.e. a 80kbps AAC will sound the same as a 160kbps MP3). As for playback quality, if I recall correctly there's audio playback settings in the Publish Settings section in the Flash editor. Wether or not the playback bitrate can be changed at runtime is something I'm not sure of.
