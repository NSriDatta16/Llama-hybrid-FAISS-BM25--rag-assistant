Gene location clustering

A friend is looking at how closely related genes cluster together on a section of DNA. In particular, he is looking at genes that code for mitochondrial phenotypes (what I will call "mitochondrial genes") vs ones that don't. He has picked a distance, say D = 500,000 base pairs, and for each branch of each chromosome, computed - The average density of genes within D base pairs of another gene. The average density of genes on the entire branch. The average density of mitochondrial genes with D base pairs of another mitochondrial gene. The average density of mitochondrial genes on the entire branch. The hypothesis is that mitochondrial genes cluster together more than non-mitochondrial genes do. What statistical test is appropriate for this?
