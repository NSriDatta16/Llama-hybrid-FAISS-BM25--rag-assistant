Moving average filter for estimating the seasonal component

I am reading the Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting Peter J. Brockwell â€¢ Richard A. Davis (Third Edition). I am having problems for understanding the estimation of seasonal component using the moving average. In section 1.5.2.1 Method S1: Estimation of Trend and Seasonal Components The authors explains Sample: . We first estimate the trend by applying a Moving Average Filter (MAF) chosen specially to eliminate seasonality and to dampen the noise. If the period d is even, i.e. , then If period is odd, then use the simple . The second step is to estimate the seasonal component. For each we compute the average $w_{k}$ of the deviations Since these average deviations do not necessarily sum to zero, we estimate the seasonal component as and My question is how I estimate $w_{k}$ ? I am not able to understand math notation in the two last paragraphs. What does $j$ represent in the equation?
