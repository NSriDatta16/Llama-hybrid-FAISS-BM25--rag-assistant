How to get probability of sample coming from a distribution?

I have a set of observations drawn from an unknown distribution. Given a new observation $x$ I would like to ascertain the probability that $x$ was drawn from the same distribution. My approach was to use kernel density estimation to estimate the pdf of the initial samples, and then use this to estimate the probability of $x$. It has now come to my attention that the $\mathrm{pdf}(x) \neq P(x)$. How can I calculate $P(x)$?
