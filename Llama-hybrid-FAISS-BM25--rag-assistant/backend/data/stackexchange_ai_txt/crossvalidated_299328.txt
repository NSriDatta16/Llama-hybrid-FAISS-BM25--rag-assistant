What is the meaning of changing the lr (learning rate) in neural networks?

I'm using Facebook's FastText algorithm to classify documents. Today I'm using the best practice method as the FastText github read me page suggest. I want to try and explore what would happen if I change the learning rate. In order to that I need to understand what does learning rate means?
