That's not possible. At least if I understood you correctly. You want to register a callback when ANY software on your machine accesses a specific website? Just imagine a browser uses SSL, there is no way to detect this by listening to the traffic or something similar. However, if you want to be notified about all connections to a specific IP, then you could use sniffing mechanisms of your kernel or even redirect all traffic to this IP to a proxy you have set up with iptables or similar. Windows has a sniffing library called WinPCap, on linux you could use tcpdump. Though, more information about your problem would be nice.
