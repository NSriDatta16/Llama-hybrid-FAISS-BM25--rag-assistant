I have this article bookmarked on setting this up for Java 5 and below. Basically run it with : -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044 For Java 5 and above , run it with: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044 If you want Java to wait for you to connect before executing the application, replace suspend=n with suspend=y .
