How to normalize slope of historical financial data?

Im trying to find a method to normalize the slope value for the historical net profits of many companies. But the problem arises when certain companies are clocking profits in thousands, and some in millions. The slope is higher for the latter. But there are chances where the growth of a lower slope company is higher than that of company with a higher slope. For example, I have the following 2 hypothetical companies and their net profits: Is there a method I can apply so that the slope is normalized and allow me to use it comparitively? After doing some search, I found a few methods: Slope / Latest Value Slope / Average Average Slope / Range Average So in my case, it would be dividing the slope with either the latest year net profits, the average of the historical net profits, or the range(max - min) of the net profits. The problem is, Im not able to identify which is a better approach. The values I get for these are as follows: PS: Im not opting to use absolute returns or CAGR because there are times when negative values come up, and it misleads my interpretation.
