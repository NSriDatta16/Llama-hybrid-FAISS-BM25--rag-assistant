I am struggling to construct an answer for question 35, part b in "Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting" 2nd edition. My idea was that if I could find the Expected Value MtW, called m, then I could compute the Variance using the following formula: Var(X) = E(X^2) â€“ m^2 Any suggestions on how to complete the problem? Thanks for all of your help!
