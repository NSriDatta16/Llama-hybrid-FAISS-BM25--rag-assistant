Flex: CursorManager does nothing when `stage.mouseChildren = false`?

I've found that if I use the CursorManager to set a cursor — CursorManager.setBusyCursor() — then set stage.mouseChildren = false , the cursor set by CursorManager is replaced by the "default" mouse cursor the next time the mouse is moved. I'm setting stage.mouseChildren = false so that, while the mouse is being dragged, other "stuff" on the stage won't get mouse events (eg, so that mouse-over affordances aren't triggered if I'm in the middle of a drag). Is there some way I can work around this?
