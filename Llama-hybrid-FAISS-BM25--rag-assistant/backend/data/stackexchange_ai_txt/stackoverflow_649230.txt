Chomsky is totally the wrong source to look to for NLP (and he'd say as much himself, emphatically)--see: " Statistical Methods and Linguistics " by Abney. Jurafsky and Martin, mentioned above, is a standard reference, but I myself prefer Manning and Sch√ºtze . If you're serious about NLP you'll probably want to read both. There are videos of one of Manning's courses available online .
