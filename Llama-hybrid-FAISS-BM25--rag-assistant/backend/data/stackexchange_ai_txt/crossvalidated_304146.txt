Explanation needed for VAE latence space cost term

I'm studying VAEs (Variational Auto Encoders) from this link after failing to understand the official paper and stumbling upon the latence variables cost term: The author seems to be trying to say that the probability distribution p(x) is equal to the max-likelihood estimation for parameters $\phi$ and $\theta$ plus the 'amount of information the approximated $q_\phi$ differs from the actual $p_\theta$).. I'm not sure what that means. Can somebody help me out with this?
