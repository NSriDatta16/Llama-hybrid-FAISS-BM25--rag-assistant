I prefer following way to check whether rows contain any NAs: row.has.na This returns logical vector with values denoting whether there is any NA in a row. You can use it to see how many rows you'll have to drop: sum(row.has.na) and eventually drop them final.filtered For filtering rows with certain part of NAs it becomes a little trickier (for example, you can feed 'final[,5:6]' to 'apply'). Generally, Joris Meys' solution seems to be more elegant.
