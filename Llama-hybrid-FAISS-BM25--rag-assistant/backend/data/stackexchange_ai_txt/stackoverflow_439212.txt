SharePoint List Pre-Population

I have two lists, each on different tabs (sub-sites) of the site. I would like users enter data on the first tab and somehow copy a portion of that data over to the second list automatically (like a pre-population of several of the fields on the second list). What would be involved in making this happen? Of the ideas I have come up with, none seem too pragmatic.
