I have data for two groups 0 and 1, for which I want to split, and validate whether the two attributes for new data fall into group 0 or 1. This isn't a clustering problem, it's a classification problem. You want to know whether or not these two attributes are correlated with your group assignments: the attributes are your features and the group assignment is the target you are trying to predict. You're more interested in performing inference on the features than on accurately predicting the target, which is perfectly fine. Classification models can sometimes be difficult to interpret: the simpler you go, the easier interpretation is. Here are a few simple models to try: Naive Bayes Decision Trees Logistic Regression (A bit harder to interpret, but still doable) If you're not even that interested in performing inference on the features and just want to know more generally "how well do the groups cluster in the attribute space?", you could bootstrap KNN to estimate the probability that a member from one group is in a region dominated by its own group.
