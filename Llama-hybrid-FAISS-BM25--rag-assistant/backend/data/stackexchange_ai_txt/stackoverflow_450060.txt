For C++, read Scott Meyer's corresponding article : Never Call Virtual Functions during Construction or Destruction ps: pay attention to this exception in the article: The problem would almost certainly become apparent before runtime, because the logTransaction function is pure virtual in Transaction. Unless it had been defined ( unlikely, but possible ) the program wouldn't link: the linker would be unable to find the necessary implementation of Transaction::logTransaction.
