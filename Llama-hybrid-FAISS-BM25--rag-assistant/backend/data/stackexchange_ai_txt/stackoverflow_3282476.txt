Yes, your favAgents collection will be empty now - you've "turned off" the bit in each element of it that made it match the query! If you iterate over favAgents twice, it will execute the query twice. favAgents represents the query itself, not the results. If you want to preserve one particular set of results, use ToList or something similar: favAgents = favAgents.ToList(); That will materialize the query - perform it once and then remember the results in a list, basically. ToArray would have the same effect, but store the results in an array instead.
