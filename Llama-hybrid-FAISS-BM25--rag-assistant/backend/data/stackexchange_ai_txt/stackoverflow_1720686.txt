I would like to say that depends on your needs. We use only Guids as primary keys (with default set to NewID) because we develop a distributed system with many Sql Server instances, so we have to be sure that every Sql Server generate unique primary key values. But when using a Guid column as PK, be sure not to use it as your clustered index (thanks to marc_s for the link) Advantage of the Guid type: You can create unique values on different locations without synchronization Disadvantage: Its a large datatype (16 Bytes) and needs significant more space It creates index fragmentation (at least when using the newid() function) Dataconsistency is not an issue with primary keys independent of the datatype because a primary key has to be unique by definition! I don't believe that an identity column has better join performance. At all, performance is a matter of the right indexes. A primary key is a constraint not an index. Is your need to have a primary key of typ int with no gaps? This should'nt be a problem normally.
