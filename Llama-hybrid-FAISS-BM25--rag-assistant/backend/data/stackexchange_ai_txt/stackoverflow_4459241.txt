int is signed so the upcast is sign-extending. Consider the binary representations. 0xAA = 10101010 char is often signed, so when you cast to the (signed by default) int , the first 1 means that it's interpreted as a negative twos-complement number: ((int) ((signed char)0xAA) ) = 11111111111111111111111110101010 To avoid this, use an unsigned char or an unsigned int .
