When doing logistic regression, the output is reported in terms of the log-odds ratio , which is just an unexponentiated odds ratio. Typically, when we interpret the results of a logistic regression, we aren't usually interested in those numbers (i.e., the numbers below Coef(b) in your output). I could tell you that a negative coefficient implies that the odds in the case when the corresponding binary variable = 1 are lesser than the odds in the case when that variable = 0, but that's beside the point, as the number itself has no real interpretation. You can more easily infer the "direction" of the odds ratio after exponentiating the coefficients, as in e^{Coef}, or e^(-0.107) = 0.899. This number has a tangible interpretation; in your case, it is the ratio of the odds of innovating radically given that the company cooperated with its suppliers, compared to the odds of innovating radically for a company that did not cooperate with its suppliers, customers, or universities. In other words, a company that cooperates with its suppliers has a 10% reduced odds of innovating radically compared to a company that does not cooperate with its suppliers, customers, or universities. It is always important to remember that the odds ratio is a ratio: it has a numerator and a denominator. When interpreting it, you have to call attention to the numerator--the case "described" by a particular combination of variables-- as well as the denominator--the "reference case" (usually when all covariates are set =0, but this is an assumption on my part).
