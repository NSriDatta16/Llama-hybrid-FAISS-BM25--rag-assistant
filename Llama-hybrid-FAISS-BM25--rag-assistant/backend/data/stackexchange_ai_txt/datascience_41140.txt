You can train multiple machine learning models with same data and based on accuracy and confusion_matrix response you can decide which one to use. In theory, you don't need to combine/merge two different ML Models (you can enhance your pre-processing) but if you still want to use different models there are two approaches: Ensemble (available with three categories - a) Bagging b) Boosting c) Stacking Hybrid (This approach allow users to create own models (or use existing) and combine them for better prediction) Note: You need to be careful with individual algorithm response before combining them together :)
