Just because a high leverage point isn't an outlier doesn't mean all is well. A single sufficiently influential point can pull the line essentially right through it (so its residual is 0). A pair of influential points can easily make each other's externally studentized residuals zero / nearly zero. So you can have a few points that behave as if they're from a completely different relationship from that you see in (say) 99% of the data, but they're sufficiently influential, they will have small residuals and even their studentized deleted residuals (/externally studentized residuals) can be small. This can happen with Cooks Distance (and a variety of other measures of influence) -- the effect of another outlier can make Cook's distance look fine for both. If you remove all the influential points - as Michael suggests in comments - and the line is little changed, then there should be little to worry about.
