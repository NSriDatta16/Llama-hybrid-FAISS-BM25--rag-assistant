Finding the median of a set of data from a cumulative frequency graph GCSE level

200 students estimate the volume, V of a classroom. The cumulative frequency diagram shows their results. You are told at GCSE level to find the median by dividing 200 by 2, finding it on the y axis and reading off the value of the estimated volume on the x axis. Why do you not find the average of the estimated volume for the 100th and 101st student?
