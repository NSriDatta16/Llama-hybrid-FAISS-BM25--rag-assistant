Logistic Regression: Variable total covid cases per 1MM is not significant but total covid cases (without population adjustment) is significant

I am working on a university paper regarding the effects of COVID severity (total cases per 1MM, total cases) on whether a party in an acquisition (company transaction) is more likely to be the Acquirer (=1) or the Target in that transaction. I am using logistic regression on data from March 2020 up to March 2021. My dependent variable is Acquirer/Target and my independent is COVID severity on the date when the acquisition was announced in the country of the acquirer. Initially I wanted to use total COVID cases per 1 million population as my independent variable. I ran the regression, but I was getting a highly insignificant p-value. Out of curiosity, I ran a regression with total cases without the correction for population. This time I got a significant p-value. Then I thought, maybe population plays a role here, so I used population as independent variable, again no significant p-value. Do you have any idea what I am missing? I am just starting with statistics in university, so I am unfortunately not an expert yet. Below you can find the R outputs.
