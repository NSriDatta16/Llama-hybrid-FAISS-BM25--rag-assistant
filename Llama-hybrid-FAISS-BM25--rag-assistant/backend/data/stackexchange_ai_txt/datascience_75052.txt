Tuning SVM C parameter

I would like to ask for help regarding my model. I have a dataset of preprocessed images and I performed a binary classification with SVM on Python. I tuned the value of the c parameter from 0.001 to 1 with 10-fold CV and I obtained the following results. My questions are: Does this mean that the optimal value of C is 0.001? The rest means that there is overfitting? The first value is not 0.000 but 0.001 Thank you.
