Write down the basic steps that you have to do to perform the task and then try to implement it in code. Here is what you have to do: 1 - Get 3 numbers from the user. 2 - You need two variables: one to hold the number of odd inputs and the other to hold the number of the even ones. Lets call these evenCnt and oddCnt. (Hint: Since you know you only have 3 numbers, once you have determined one of these, the other one is just the difference from 3) 3 - Then you need a series of tests (If evenCnt is 3 then show "3 evens", else if ....) (And Pascal and Kurosch have pretty much given you the fragments you need to fill in steps 2 and 3.) [Edit: My #2 is wooly-headed. You only need one variable.]
