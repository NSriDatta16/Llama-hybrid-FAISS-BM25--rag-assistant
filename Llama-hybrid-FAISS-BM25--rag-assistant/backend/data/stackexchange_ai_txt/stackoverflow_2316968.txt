Service availability is always something to consider when outsourcing anything at all, be it development, catering, or hosting (what would you do if you run a factory and your catering provider goes bust, leaving your company restaurant with no staff?). In the case of software, code escrow is a step to ensure minimum disruption (even if there will of course always be some disruption). Having a contract with a backup hosting provider where the application is deployed on cold standby with regular database synchronisation can sometimes be an option. For applications that require high uptime (which I assume is the case here as you state you can accept even a few days downtime) that's a necessity anyway. After all, the SAAS provider might not go bankrupt but if an aircraft crashes on the building hosting their serverfarm your application is going to be disrupted too (I've worked for a SAAS provider, and we had our own backup server farms in several locations to ensure continuity of service, plus regular code dumps sent to an escrow service and sent off to storage in a secure location to have off-site backups, no reason why a customer shouldn't want to have their own cold backup as well, or at least a contract option to take over the hosting contract in case of disruption of service due to bankruptcy of the current contract holder).
