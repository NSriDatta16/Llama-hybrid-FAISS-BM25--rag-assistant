One setup you may want to consider: Have both a username and an email. The email is used to login and is always kept private, the username is used to identify the user in any public interaction, such as posting a comment. It winds up being slightly more secure as both halves of the user login credentials are kept private, whereas if you use a username for both login and public identification, half of the login is already known. I definitely agree with you about having minimal registration for most cases, but depending on what you're doing you may want to balance that against added security for your users. Four fields isn't outrageous for registration, (username, email, password, confirm password), and if you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could cut it down to three by dropping the confirm password field, or two by emailing them a password that they can change later.
