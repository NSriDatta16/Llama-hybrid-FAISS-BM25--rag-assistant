How to handle Zeros in dependent variable in Multiple Linear regression

I am totally new to machine learning (and to this platform too) and was trying to implement Multiple linear Regression to improve my ranking algorithm. I have a data-set which have the following variables Category of the product ( Independent variable) Price of the product (Independent variable) Product sold in last N days (Independent variable) Position of the product in the list (Independent variable) CTR ( Clicks to Views ratio) ( Dependent Variable ) The data-set contains more than 1 million rows , out of which only 30,000 contains non zero value while the rest of them contains zero value. When plotting for "Non Zero CTR" data-set , I get proper Fitted vs Residual graph and Normal Q-Q graph. But when I plot the complete data-set ( including zero CTR values) , The graphs get distorted and the results are too skewed. I have researched about Negative Binomial Regression (NBR) and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) , but they work with counts. To summarize, I have more than 97% zeros in dependent variable which is skewing my results. Suggestion and help is requested. EDIT - The sample data-frame is below catalog_date
