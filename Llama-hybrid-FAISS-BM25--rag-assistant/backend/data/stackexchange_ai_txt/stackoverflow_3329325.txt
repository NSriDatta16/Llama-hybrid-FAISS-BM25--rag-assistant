Extracting Macros in a Word Document to a text file from c#

I need to extract all VBA code from a Word 2007 document in c# without using office automation. What I have done so far is to open the Word document as a structured storage file in c#, and I receive a list of the following streams: Macros VBA dir ( stream ) Module1 ( stream ) ThisDocument ( stream ) _VBA_PROJECT_ ( stream ) .... I gather that the source is stored in one of those streams, but I have no idea how to parse them. Can anyone help?
