The user agent identifies itself as gsa-crawler/Googlebot depending if a Google appliance or Google. You could write some code ( Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_USER_AGENT") ) that watches for that or analyses IIS log files. You might want to verify that the bot really is Google- that is something to watch out for . I'd choose the Web app root if you need an email to sent out ASAP and the file analyse root if you can wait a little longer.
