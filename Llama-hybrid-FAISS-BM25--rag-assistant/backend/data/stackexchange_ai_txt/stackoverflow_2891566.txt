ugh, i've done something like this a while back in ... c++ i think. that must have been in 2002 or something like that. i used a component from Borland's C++ Builder back then (or did i use delphi?) anyways, i did a quick google search and found a rather antique post from '99; if nothing else, it's perhaps a good place to start. http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip66.html you may also want to look at http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t682627-embedding-web-browser-prefer-firefox-in-java-application.html i hope this helps!
