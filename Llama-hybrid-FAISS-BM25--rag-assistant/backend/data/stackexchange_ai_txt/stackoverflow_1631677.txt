You might find the following answer to a similar question helpful: http://testing.stackexchange.com/questions/92/how-to-get-started-with-model-based-testing In it, I mention: UML Pad http://web.tiscali.it/ggbhome/umlpad/umlpad.htm A list of free UML Tools: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_UML_tools Our Pairwise and combinatorial test case generator (which generates tests for you automatically based on a model you create - even if you don't create a UML model): http://hexawise.com Incidentally, as explained in the answer I link to above, I focus my energies (research, tool development focus, passion, etc.) on the second part of your question - generating efficient and effective sets of tests that maximize coverage in a minimum number of test cases.
