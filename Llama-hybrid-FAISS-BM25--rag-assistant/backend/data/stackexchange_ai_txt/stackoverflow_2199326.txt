Good examples of architecturing a transformation application

I'm looking for suggestions, best practices, and if possible open-source examples of a transformation architecture that is flexible and decoupled. I need to change an already existent codebase that based on some analysis is able to convert some old existent apps into something newer. The ins and outs aren't that interesting, however I do want to see a good way of implementing this. Some initial thoughts would be to have scenarious defined. One scenario is composed of multiple validation steps, and actual actions on the data supplied. The workflow would start with identifying windows and containers and moving on to grouping and organizing. What are your thoughts? Any guidelines or advise?
