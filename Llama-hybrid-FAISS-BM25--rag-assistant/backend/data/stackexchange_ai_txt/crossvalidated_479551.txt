Meaning of phrases (median vs mean): Income of the average person in my city vs. The average income of people in my city

Hello Cross Validated, I have been discussing things like the average income of a person in my city, and have come to think there is a subtle but important difference in the phrases "Income of the average person in my city" and "The average income of people in my city" in that the first would be the median income in the city, while the later would be the mean income. I would guess that this difference of phrasing would be often ignored and might be confusing (especially to the average person), but is it technically correct? Thanks!
