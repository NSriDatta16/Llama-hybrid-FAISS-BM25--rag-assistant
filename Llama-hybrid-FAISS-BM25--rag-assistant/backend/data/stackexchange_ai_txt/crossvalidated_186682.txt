Is there an existing term for the percentage of values that fall within some threshold of the maximum value in a time series?

I have a time series where I would like find the peak value in the series and then determine what percentage of other values fall within some threshold of that maximum value. Mathematically trivial to calculate. But it had me wondering whether or not there was an existing term for this.
