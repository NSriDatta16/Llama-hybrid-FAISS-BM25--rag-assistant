How can I get the effect associated with a $k$-unit increase in the predictor in logistic regression?

The outcome of interest is disease yes/no (coded 1/0) and the continuous variable of interest is measured in nmol/L. The output of the regression suggests that a 1 unit change in the predictor (presumably a 1 nmol/L increase) results in a 3% reduction in disease. This is significant. However, I think it would be more meaningful to consider the reduction in disease for every 10 nmol/L increase in the continuous variable. Is this possible? Incidentally I did log transform to base 2 as per a previous suggestion and this showed that a doubling in the continuous variable resulted in a 35% reduction in disease outcome.
