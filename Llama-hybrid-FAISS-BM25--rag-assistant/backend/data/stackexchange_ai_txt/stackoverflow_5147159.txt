If you run a special goal from the cobertura plugin you can not force maven to fail the build if a test was not passed successfully. The plugin goal will succeed. You can bind the cobertura run to a lifecycle phase (e.g. test). This will make the cobertura goal run with this phase ( mvn clean test ) and fail if this phase fails. org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.4 xml html test cobertura The disadvantage of this solution is that the cobertura goal will run ich each test phase.
