The question and your self-answer touch on a wide range of machine learning concepts. I will share my opinion on a couple of these. In this particular location, I know it's windy 15% of the time (3 years of data). Therefore, a model that always predicts a 15% chance basically deserves an overall score of 0 -- because it's more or less a coin flip. On the other end, a model that always predicts 0% or 100% deserves a "perfect" score. But what about in between? So your prior probability of being windy is 0.15. You are right in your statement that you should take this prior probability of the event happening when you are evaluating the performance of your classifier. You can give the Bayesian Information Reward (BIR) a go. The intuition of BIR is as follows: a bettor is rewarded not just for identifying the ultimate winners and losers (0's and 1's), but more importantly for identifying the appropriate odds. In doing so, it compares all predictions with the prior probabilities. Let's say you have a list of 10 Arsenal (football team in England) games with possible outcomes: Win or Lose. The formula for binary classification rewarding per game is: where, p is your model's prediction for a particular Arsenal game, and p′ is the prior probability of Arsenal winning a game. The catch-point is: if I know beforehand that p′=0.6, and my predictor model produced p=0.6,even if its prediction was correct it is rewarded 0 since it is not conveying any new information. After doing a little more research, I believe what I want is either a decision tree or a multi-variate classification engine. I think a Markov network (aka Markov Random Field) would be more appropriate. The wind will not materialise of thin air but will be blowing towads your location from neighbouring ones in certain directions. So the probability of observing wind (e.g. Wind speed > 10 mph) at any square mile will be closely dependent on its neighbours (with ideally a time lag - depending on how far or close you define the neighbours).
