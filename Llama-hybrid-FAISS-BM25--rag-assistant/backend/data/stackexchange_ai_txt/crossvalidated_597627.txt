independence of observations for logistic regression

I am currently writing my bachelor thesis ans I've recently gotten into ML and logistic regression and I'm a little confused as to the assumption that the observations are independent. I found this post: https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression-clearly-explained-44d85a22b290 . It describes how the assumption is confirmed when the points are randomly distributed around the zero line. In my dataset, however, the plot looks like this: Two groups can be identified. And there are no points between dev. resid. = 0 and dev. resid. = 0.75 Can I still assume here that the observations are independent of each other? Unfortunately, the other posts in this forum and on other websites could not answer my question Thanks in advance!
