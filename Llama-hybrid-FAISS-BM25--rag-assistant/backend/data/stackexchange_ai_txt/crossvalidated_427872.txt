conversion of multivariate time series into functional data analysis

I am trying to generalize the functional auto-regressive model of order one to some order $p$ . For this, I've calculated the functional principle components and choose a particular $pc$ s which explain a given amount of variation. Then from these $Fpc$ s I calculate its scores and using the var package to predict the given data for one a head. Now I want to convert these vectors into functional form? How do I do this?
