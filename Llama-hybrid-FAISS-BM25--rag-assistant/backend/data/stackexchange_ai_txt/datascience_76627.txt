One idea is to use a shallow (a handful of layers) CNN. Deep CNN's are good at detecting objects in images. Shallow networks focus on lower-level features, such as edges and textures and colors. So, my suggestion is to train a simpler network on a larger training set by training it on image patches rather than on full cards. If the majority of your patches are classifed as blurry, then you classify your whole card as blurry.
