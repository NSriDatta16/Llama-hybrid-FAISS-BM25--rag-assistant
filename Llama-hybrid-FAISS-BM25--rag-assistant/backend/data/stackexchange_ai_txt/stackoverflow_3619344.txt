Embedding jetty server for EXT GWT in Eclipse

I am trying to create an EXT GWT project with an embedded Jetty server. I am completely new to Jetty and EXT GWT. Can anyone please point me in the right direction to get started about embedding jetty server for EXT GWT project? I have read a couple of blogs and tutorials but cannot figure it out. I have also downloaded Eclipse plugin for Jetty but the project requirement states that I have to have an embedded jetty server. Thank you.
