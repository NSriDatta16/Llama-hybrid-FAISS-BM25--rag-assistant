The hidden state of the RNN maintains the memory. To limit the memory, you can reset the hidden state after some number of time steps. This can be done manually. It could also be done by giving shorter sequences, if your software automatically resets the hidden state after hitting the end of the sequence (this won't work with a 'stateful' RNN).
