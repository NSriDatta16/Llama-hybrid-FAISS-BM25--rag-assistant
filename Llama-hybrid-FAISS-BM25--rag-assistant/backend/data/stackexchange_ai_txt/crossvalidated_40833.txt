Beta refers to a family of univariate distributions defined on the interval $[0,1]$. It is parameterized by two positive values $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The probability density function of the distribution is $$p(x;\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta) }{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta) } x^{\alpha -1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}.$$ A common use of the distribution is in Bayesian statistics as a prior for the Binomial distribution. The Beta distribution is also used in beta regression, which can be very useful when the dependent variable has a floor or ceiling effect or is bounded.
