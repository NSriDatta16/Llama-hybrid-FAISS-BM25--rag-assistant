Gaussian process regression and optimizing an RBF kernel for forecasting?

I'm using gaussian process regression with an RBF kernel to forecast a time series. I'm using GaussianProcessRegression in sci-kit learn , with a kernel: 1**2 * RBF(length_scale=1) . Target values are normalized. This does a great job of fitting to the time series training set, but on the unseen testing set, it consistently underestimates the actual values. Like this: Are there parameters in an RBF kernel, or a custom kernel, that can be used to correct this under-estimation? For example, could I utilize the ConstantKernel from sci-kit learn to create a custom kernel which scales the RBF kernel to the mean of the series. Like this: ConstantKernel(constant_value=1) + 1**2 * RBF(length_scale=1)
