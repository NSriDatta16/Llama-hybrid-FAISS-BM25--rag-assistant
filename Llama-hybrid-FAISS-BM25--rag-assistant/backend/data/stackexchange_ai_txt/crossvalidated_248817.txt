Situations where features combined effect on response are not linear. Imagine you try classifying documents as pet related or not per related. You have two features - * Number of words in the document(X1). * Number of times the word Dog appears in the document(X2). Intuitively, X2/X1 is a good way determining a document's class. This is not a linear relation, so where tree like models can use a: If X1>10: if X2>5: Pet related else: Not Pet related A logistic regression will have no such option, and will result in model described by if a X1 + b X2 > Z: Pet related else: Not Pet related For some Z.
