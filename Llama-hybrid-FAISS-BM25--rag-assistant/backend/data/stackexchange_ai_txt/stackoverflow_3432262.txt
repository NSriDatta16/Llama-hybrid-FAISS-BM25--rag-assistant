This can be achieved by declaring an Attribute named CoverageExcludeAttribute in the global (sometimes referred to as the empty) namespace and applying this Attribute on the methods you want excluded from NCover. NCover will pick up this attribute by its name only, so there's no need to reference any external assemblies. See also this post . (It doesn't mention that the CoverageExcludeAttribute must be defined in the global namespace).
