It sounds like maybe you're trying to get your visualizer to flash the screen in time with the music somehow. I don't think calculating the FFT is going to help you here. At any given instant, there will be many simultaneous frequency components, all over the audio spectrum (roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz). But you're likely to be a lot more interested in the musical tempo (beats per minute -- more like 5 Hz or below), and that's not going to show up anywhere in an FFT of the raw audio signal. You probably need something much simpler -- some sort of real-time peak detection. Whenever you see a peak greater than some threshold above the average volume, make your screen flash. Of course, more complicated visualizations might well take advantage of the FFT, but not the one you're describing.
