X,Y coordinates seem to be generated from the middle of an object instead of the top left in flash

I am converting a room editor I had made in AJAX to Flash where users can move furniture around where they want, but I am running into some issues with the x,y coordinates. With the Javascript/AJAX setup, I recorded the X,Y coordinates of the furniture image, and it worked fine from the top left corner of the image. However, now trying to make it work, and load the same setups into Flash instead of with AJAX, the placement is all off. It appears that X,Y coordinates that are returned to me are from the center of the image instead of from the top left (if I drag something to the top left corner of a "room," it shows X & Y as being half of the width and height). Any reason why this would be? I as under the impression the X,Y coordinates worked the same in both Javascript and Flash.
