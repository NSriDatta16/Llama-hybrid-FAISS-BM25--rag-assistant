Will the change of mean/variance of data impact the svm classifier?

I have seen in many areas people scale their data before passing to a classifier or learning algorithm . I noticed that by doing that classifier would be really fast. For instance in python X=preprocessing.scale(X) is used before doing svm.SVC().fit(X,y) . Does this have any effect on classifier? Edit : X=preprocessing.scale(X) is supposed to Standardize a dataset along any axis Center to the mean and component wise scale to unit variance. Does scaling to unit variance have any effect?
