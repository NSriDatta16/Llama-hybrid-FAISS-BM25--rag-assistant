ARIMA for intervention time series?

I am completely new to R, time series and ARIMA, so bear with me. I have a time series data from 2018 to 2020 that shows an intervention in early 2020. When plotted, the graph quite dramatic plummets post-intervention. I have done an ARIMA forecast (to the best of my ability) for the pre-intervention period and when comparing the ARIMA forecast with the post-intervention period (actual data), there is a massive difference. My questions are: What do I actually do with the ARIMA now? My data is stationary (0,1,1) and an Ljung box test shows a p-value of 0.2881, which I'm assuming is good. But how do I actually show that the intervention has had indeed an effect? Is there a way to plot the forecast together with the actual data? I've tried different ways and so far have had no luck. Thank you
