Qt Creator - How to write the UI?

I've just started working with Qt Creator and I want to write the UI. My question is: what is the best way to write it? By drag and drop from widget box or writing code? I've dragged some widgets and I saw that not all of build in QWidget like QIcon and QMultiLineEdit are in the widget box. How to add them? Thanks!
