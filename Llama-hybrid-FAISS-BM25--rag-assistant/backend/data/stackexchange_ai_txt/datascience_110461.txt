How to perform Grid Search on NLP CRF model

I am trying to perform hyperparameter tuning on sklearn_crfsuite.CRF model. When I try to execute below code, it doesn't give any exception but it probably fails to perform fit. And due to which, if I try to get best estimator from grid search, it doesn't work. %%time # define fixed parameters and parameters to search crf = sklearn_crfsuite.CRF( algorithm='lbfgs', max_iterations=100, all_possible_transitions=True ) params_space = { "c1": [0,0.05,0.1, 0.25,0.5,1], "c2": [0,0.05,0.1, 0.25,0.5,1] } # use the same metric for evaluation f1_scorer = make_scorer(metrics.flat_f1_score, average='weighted', labels=labels) # search grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=crf, param_grid=params_space, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1,scoring=f1_scorer) #grid_search.fit(X_train, Y_train) #above code throws exception, which seems to be a open bug in latest version of scikit-learn 0.24.0 or later. #github link for bug: https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sklearn-crfsuite/issues/60 try: grid_search.fit(X_train, Y_train) except AttributeError as e: if "'CRF' object has no attribute 'keep_tempfiles'" not in str(e): raise Any help would be appreciated, how can I perform hyperparameter tuning here? I took reference using this tutorial , but stuck in same situation.
