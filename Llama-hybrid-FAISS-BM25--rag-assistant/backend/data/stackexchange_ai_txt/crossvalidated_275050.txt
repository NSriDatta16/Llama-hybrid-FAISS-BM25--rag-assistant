What are good activation functions for this neural net architecture?

If I have this Neural network (fully connected) where the inputs are values from [0-1] (actual floats, not binary classification). And the output is a float value from [0-1] (actual float, not binary classification). Does anyone know what I should set each neuron's activation function? Is there some conventions or rules I can follow to decide? Based on the specific library I am using, I have these options https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/wiki/Activation Thanks
