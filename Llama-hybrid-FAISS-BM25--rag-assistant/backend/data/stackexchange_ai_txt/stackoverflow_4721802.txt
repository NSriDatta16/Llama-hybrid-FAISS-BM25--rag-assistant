Opera outputs a selection of errors in the built-in error console (reachable through the Opera menu, Page > Developer Tools > Error console). It's also possible to use Opera's Dragonfly debugger (similar to Firefox' Firebug) to catch all sorts of errors in the content (css, javascript, svg etc). It's also reachable via the Opera menu, Page > Developer Tools > Opera Dragonfly or by rightclicking on the content and selecting "Inspect Element". You can also view source on svg content and then edit the svg, to see the result click the "Apply changes" button (then switch back to the tab showing the svg). Not as advanced as Emacs for editing of course, but still quite handy for minor edits.
