Embedding Quick Time movies in HTML Pages

I am trying to embed QuickTime movies into my HTML/ASPX pages but somehow they work on local machine but when i deploy them on my server they dont play at all. I tried all sorts of options but still unable to find a reason for that. anybody else have been though this issue ? I did a quick research and find few resources but even though following them works on my local machine but not on production. I am wandering , do i need to setup some sort of streaming to just embed few videos files or what ? and yeah i did follow the apple article too (who put the blame on simply internet explorer) while my firefox shows the same result. I got the image (startup) but no video as i click to play. One video is of 11 MB while other is 50 MB. I renamed the files by removing all the spaces now and i can see the QuickTime plugin initiating but after a while the Question Mark is appearing on the QuickTime Logo. Mime type is also video/quicktime so which is correct.
