It looks like you are doing a version of FIREMON sampling ( https://www.frames.gov/partner-sites/firemon/sampling-methods/ ). I know little about such point smpling, and I think you would benefit from consultation with someone knowledgeable about such methods. I'll give you my best guess, but I could be wrong. I recommend a ratio estimate of the total number of trees. Larger plots are automatically represented in proportion to their size. Denote $s_i$ = area for plot $i$ and $y_i$ = the number of trees in the plot. $S$ and $Y$ are the totals in the population. You know $S$ and want to estimate $Y$. The average density in the population is: $$ R = \frac{Y}{S} $$ You know the total area in the population is $S$. So the number of trees in the population $Y$ obeys the equation: $$ Y = R\,S $$ The sample will permit you to estimate $R$, so that your estimated total will be: $$ \hat{Y}_R = \hat{R} S $$ The natural estimate of $R$ is the ratio of sample totals, which is the same as the ratio of sample means for number of trees and area: $$ \hat{R} = \frac{y}{s} = \frac{\overline{y}}{\overline{s}} $$ Calculation of estimated Standard Error Methods for estimating the standard error include: linearization, the jackknife, and the bootstrap. All are presented in standard sampling texts. I'll present the linearization method, which requires a "large" n. (Cochran, 1977, pp; 32; 160-163). The approximate standard error of $\hat{Y}_R$ under sampling with replacement is (Cochran, 1977, $v_2$, page 155): \begin{equation} SE(\hat{Y}_R) = S\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{R}s_i)^2}{n(n-1) \overline{s}^2}} \end{equation} If, in fact, the process is not "simple random sampling" of plots (see my comment), then this might still be valid. I would speculate that for the point sampling method, one could multiply the standard error above by a "finite population correction" $\sqrt{1-{\dfrac{s}{S}}}$. References Cochran, William G. 1977.
