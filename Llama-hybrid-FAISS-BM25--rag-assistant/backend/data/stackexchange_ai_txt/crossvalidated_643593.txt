Ordinal logistic regression with small cells

I have a data of around 100 observation with two dependent variables--one is ordered attitude (values encoded as '1','2', and '3') and the other is binary requirement (values encoded as '0', '1'). I have multiple predictors including binary like gender , interval like age , and 2 multinomial style (6 values) and degree (3 values) and I don't care interactions. A category of attitude has only 5 observations which means some cell value between predictor style and response attitude is very small and even 0. The other dependent variable requirement has similar issue. My major question: is this (rare event or small cell) a big problem for both of ordinal logistic and logistic regression models? If so, does it help to remove some predictors and/or combine categories in the predictors? Any other suggestions? My other minor questions: can someone help clarify whether below issues in R output are related to the small cells? When running a Pulkstenis-Robinson goodness of fit test, a warning message shows up with large p-value Warning: Less than 80% of the estimated frequencies are greater than 1, test results may be inaccurate . Coefficients for some levels of multinomial predictors ( style or degree ) in the ordinal logistic model have very small standard error (e.g., 2e^-10) which leads to very small CI of the OR. This may be related to bullet 2, the coefficient of some level of style has significant p-value but the ANOVA type III shows that overall style is not significant. Which one should I adopt as the conclusion? Thank you and any help is appreciated.
