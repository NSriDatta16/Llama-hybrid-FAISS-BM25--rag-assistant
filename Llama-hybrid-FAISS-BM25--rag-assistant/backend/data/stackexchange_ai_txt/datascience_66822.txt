The purpose of the test split is normally to evaluate the performance of your model in data it has not seen before. While the available performance measures for GAN generators have their problems, they do exist. For images, you have Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance . For text, you have quality vs. diversity plots . The evaluation measures mentioned above evaluate some aspects of the generated samples against real data. In order to evaluate the performance of a GAN generator, you should use data it has not seen before, i.e. a test set. Therefore, it does make sense to have a train/test split in order to evaluate GANs.
