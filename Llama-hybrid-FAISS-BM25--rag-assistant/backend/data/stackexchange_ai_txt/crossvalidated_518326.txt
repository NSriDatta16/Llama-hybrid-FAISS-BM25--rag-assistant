From what I have understood, and also from what the author of this book is telling here, a linear kernel is another representation of the support vector classifier. As he adds in the end, when the support vector classifier is combined with a non-linear kernel (polynomial/RBF) we have a support vector machine. SVCs and SVMs use a soft margin whereas only a Maximal Margin Classifier uses a hard margin, which is different from a support vector classifier.
