Disabling user interaction for the Google Earth plugin

I'm putting together an app that will show a news item's location in Google Earth using the javascript api. This is working great but we want to prevent users from manually dragging the globe around. I know for Google Maps there is a function disableDragging which accomplishes this, but in the Earth api I could find no similar function. I also tried placing a (nearly) transparent div over the GE container but any div with a non-solid background disappears over the container.
