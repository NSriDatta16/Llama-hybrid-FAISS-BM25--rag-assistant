"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein "Perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry I am not trying to be flippant but these quotes really are the best advice. Simplicity of design should be your goal. Not that achieving simplicity is easy! On the contrary, it is quite difficult but it is possible. Try thinking about things a bit differently. Rather than How many things can I add before this becomes bloated? try What are the fewest number of features and elements I can include while still providing a superior experience for my users?
