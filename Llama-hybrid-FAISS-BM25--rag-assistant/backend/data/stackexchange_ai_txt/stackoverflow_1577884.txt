On the iPhone platform, the only FBO that can be used directly as the backbuffer is the one that has a color buffer that has been allocated using: [myEaglContext renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER fromDrawable: eaglLayer]; If you allocate a color buffer using glRenderbufferStorageOES , then it's a normal off-screen FBO, and the best way to make it show up the screen is to bind it to a texture and render a quad.
