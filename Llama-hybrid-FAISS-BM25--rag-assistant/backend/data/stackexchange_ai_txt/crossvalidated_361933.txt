Principal component analysis and DBScan

My data has 30 dimensions and 150 observations. I want to cluster the data with DBScan. Is there a difference between: 1. Performing a PCA and clustering all 30 principal components or 2. Just clustering the raw data? DBScan works fast on my small dataset. Should I reduce the dimensions anyway? Is dimension reduction only about speed?
