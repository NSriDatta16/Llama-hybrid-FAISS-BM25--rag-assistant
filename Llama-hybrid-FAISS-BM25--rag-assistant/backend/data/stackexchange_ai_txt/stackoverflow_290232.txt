We looked into doing something like this a couple of years ago. We were thinking of having printed documents scanned in, converted with OCR, and organized digitally in a type of repository. We actually did an analysis of OCR tools and repository / collaboration tools and which would be the easiest to integrate. We checked out Kofax, OCR for AnyDoc, and a couple of others on the OCR side, and SharePoint WSS, SharePoint MOSS, Hyland OnBase, SAP Collaboration Manager, and Documentum on the repository / collaboration side. Your idea is good, and there are variants of it in use in banking and other industries. As for the integration, in my experience if you're using SharePoint, it should be pretty easy with Kofax if you leverage the API's on both sides and get creative with simple web parts and iFrames.
