Will the code i am using guarantee 100% uniqueness? Of course it's not possible to 100% guarantee uniqueness with a random GUID. It's very likely that each GUID will be unique, but there is only a finite (but very large) number of GUIDs. If you generate enough of them you will eventually run out of unused GUIDs and be forced to generate a duplicate. And the birthday paradox means that randomly choosing GUIDs will on average give you a duplicate sooner than you might think. But it's probably not worth worrying about in practice as even with the birthday paradox, it is still extremely unlikely to happen.
