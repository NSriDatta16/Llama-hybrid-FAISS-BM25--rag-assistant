How to find the percentage of values within a given range?

I am a beginner in the field of statistics and data science, so request you to treat me kindly. Problem statement - Variable X has a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of 2. What is the minimum percentage of X values that lie between 8 and 17? I know about 68-95-99.7 empirical rule. From Google I found that percentage of values within 1.5 standard deviations is 86.64%. My code so far: import scipy.stats import numpy as np X=np.random.normal(15,2) As I understood, 13-17 is within 1 standard deviation having 68% values. 9-21 will be 3 standard deviations having 99.7% values. 7-23 is 4 standard deviations. So 8 is 3.5 standard deviations below the mean. How to find the percentage of values from 8 to 17?
