Both sets of variables have weighted mean of zero. It all depends on weights . Probably OP Income has much higher weight than other variables. DCA is not suited for data that are expressed in different units, such as Married=0, Single=1 , Age 18â€“81 and OP Income in monetary units (dollars?). The sum of each variable is used as its weight (so you cannot either centre your data, or in general, to have negative data). You simply used a method that cannot be used with your data, and you should use some other method instead. PCA with equal scaling of variables is normally used for these kind of data. For DCA all variables must be expressed in same units and be commensurate and non-negative. Still one more time: do not use DCA! DCA (and CA: Correspondence Analysis) is basically a method that was developed for count data, but it has been stretched for other non-negative data where all variables are measured in same units.
