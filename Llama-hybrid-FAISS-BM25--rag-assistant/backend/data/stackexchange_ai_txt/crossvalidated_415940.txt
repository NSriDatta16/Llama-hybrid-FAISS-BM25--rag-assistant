I don't think you necessarily have to discard the entire time series from 1995 to 1999 prior to the first break point. There are several ways to handle break points, some simple, some more complicated. An easy way is to include a binomial dummy variable (0, 1) with a value of 1 for all the periods prior to the first break point. You could use another similar dummy variable to capture the time period from the 1st to the 2nd breakpoint. In essence, it will change your intercept and reflect that over those respective periods stock returns were at a different mean expected level than outside of those periods. You could also include interaction variables that will affect the slope or regression coefficients of your independent variable during the 1995 to 1999 period, and other similar periods between break points. You could also explore polynomial regressions that can "turn" and better fit the shift in trend associated with the mentioned breakpoint.
