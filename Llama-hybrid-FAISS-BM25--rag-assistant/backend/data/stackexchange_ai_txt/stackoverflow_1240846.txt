AVAudioRecorder: peak and average power

What is the difference between peakPowerForChannel and averagePowerForChannel methods of AVAudioRecorder? And why is the value returned is negative? Isn't it supposed to be 0 for no sound and go up when the amplitude of sound rises? How can I convert to a more "readable" format? Thanks.
