This is a causal inference question. "Symptomhood" is a necessarily causal concept, because the disease causes the symptom. The question amounts to "Does COVID-19 cause changes in the risk of the bone disease?" This is an important type of question for data scientists to be able to answer because many data science questions are of the form "Does X cause Y?", e.g., Does this new web interface improve engagement?, Does this new medicine reduce the risk of death?, Does this new policy increase employment?, etc. Causal inference is normally taught at the graduate level, though some argue that it should be a part of training at all levels of education. One of the challenges in answering causal questions is to distinguish association (i.e., correlation) due to a causal relationship and association due to some other reason. For example, there may be an association between attending a private college and adult earnings, but that association might be at least partly due to the fact that coming from a wealthy family improves your probability of attending a private college and would increase your adult earning whether you went to a private college or not. When variables cause both the predictor of interest and the outcome of interest, there is said to be "confounding", and the simple association between the predictor and outcome doesn't necessarily represent a causal relationship. There are a number of ways to address confounding, but many of them are taught only at the graduate level. Often, the best way to address confounding is to run an experiment: randomly assign people to the levels of the predictor and then measure their outcome. This addresses confounding because now the predictor and outcome share no common causes. In this example, unfortunately, and many others, randomly assigning some people to get COVID-19 and comparing the risk of bone disease between the exposed and unexposed is unethical. The interviewer probably wanted you to use critical thinking to think about other ways you could address confounding. There are many such ways (again, mostly taught at the graduate level), but the simplest is stratification. Create strata (i.e., groups) of people who didn't have bone disease prior to March 2020 and who, given what we know about how bone disease develops, had similar risks of bone disease (e.g., same age, same family history of bone disease, same comorbidities, etc.). Within each stratum of bone disease risk, you could see whether those in the stratum who had COVID-19 were more likely to later develop the bone disease. Within strata, you can't say that some people were just more likely to get the bone disease anyway; within strata, everyone is equally likely to get the bone disease. The only meaningful way individuals within strata differ is whether they have COVID-19 or not. So, you couldn't attribute differences in the probability of getting the bone disease to anything other than differences in COVID-19 status. Despite being the most fundamental way to address confounding without an experiment, this is fairly sophisticated, so I would be surprised if the interviewer expected you to say something like this. But they probably hoped you would say something in this direction, i.e., to address the factors that cause both COVID-19 and bone disease and would explain why the two appear correlated. By eliminating alternative explanations for the observed association, you can eventually be reasonably sure about whether the observed association is causal, i.e., whether the bone disease is caused by, and therefore is a symptom of, COVID-19.
