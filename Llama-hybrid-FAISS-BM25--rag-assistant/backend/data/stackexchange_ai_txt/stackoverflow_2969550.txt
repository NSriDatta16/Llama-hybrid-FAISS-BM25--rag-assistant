I guess I don't know too much about profilers yet, but one problem I've run into is forgetting to use the OpenMP flag and enable support. Alternatively, what if you just created a simple application to try to verify the threads? #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2) { #pragma omp critical std::cout Maybe see if that works?
