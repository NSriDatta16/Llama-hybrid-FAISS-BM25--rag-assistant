I'm not sure about SCORM or .ashx files (no experience there) but as far as getting values from ASP.NET you can do all sorts of things like var xyz = ' '; from within your ASP.NET page. There are various ways to accomplish this but the end result is that the ASP.NET page renders the values of the variable in the HTML (or JavaScript) that is sent to the browser. This is a generic ASP.NET and JavaScript answer, there may be a more elegant solution out there for you.
