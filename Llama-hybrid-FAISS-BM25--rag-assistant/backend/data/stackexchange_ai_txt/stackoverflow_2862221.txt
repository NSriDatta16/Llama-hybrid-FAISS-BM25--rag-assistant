No, that is not a representative sample. You want to know what percentage of (all) websites use JavaScript, not what percentage of the top 500 use JavaScript, so your sample should be a random sample of all websites, not a sample of the top websites. Also, what kind of HTTP headers did your script send? Did it mimic a class of browser such as Internet Explorer? A server-side script might send back different content depending on the user-agent string. Either way, write your site so that the user can still read it and use it without CSS and JavaScript, but feel free to use those tools to make it look and behave better.
