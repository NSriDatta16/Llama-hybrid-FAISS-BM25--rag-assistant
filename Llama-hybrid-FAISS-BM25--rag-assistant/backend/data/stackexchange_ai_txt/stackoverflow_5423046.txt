NSOutlineView elements remain hopelessly undraggable

I have a program with a NSOutlineView (that supports single selection only) from which I'd like to be able to drag elements. These elements should either be received as text or files: for instance, dropping the item on a TextEdit window should put text, but dropping the item on the Finder should create a file. I don't want anything to be dropped over my outline view, even it it comes from itself. This seems easy enough, but for some reason, I can't get it to work. I checked the NSOutlineView drag and drop example from Apple, and I came to implement the following methods (plus a few definitely unrelated ones): -(BOOL)outlineView:shouldSelectItem: // I don't expect to drag unselectable items -(NSArray*)outlineView:namesOfPromisedFilesDroppedAtDestination:forDraggedItems: -(BOOL)outlineView:writeItems:toPasteboard: However, when I try to drag an item from my outline view, nothing happens. Instead, it just changes the selection following the cursor. I've put breakpoints in the two last methods, and they never get called, so their implementation is not the immediate issue. I must be missing something really obvious here. Also, this is not (yet) a problem, but how am I supposed to provide contents to my promised files?
