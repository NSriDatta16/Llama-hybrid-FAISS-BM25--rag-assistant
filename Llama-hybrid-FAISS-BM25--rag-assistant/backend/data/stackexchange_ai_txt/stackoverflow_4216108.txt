Can't understand a line in a "Collective intelligence" program

I'm working through " Programming collective intelligence ". In chapter 4, Toby Segaran builds an artificial neural network. The following function appears on page of the book: def generatehiddennode(self,wordids,urls): if len(wordids)>3: return None # Check if we already created a node for this set of words sorted_words=[str(id) for id in wordids] sorted_words.sort() createkey='_'.join(sorted_words) res=self.con.execute( "select rowid from hiddennode where create_key='%s'" % createkey).fetchone() # If not, create it if res==None: cur=self.con.execute( "insert into hiddennode (create_key) values ('%s')" % createkey) hiddenid=cur.lastrowid # Put in some default weights for wordid in wordids: self.setstrength(wordid,hiddenid,0,1.0/len(wordids)) for urlid in urls: self.setstrength(hiddenid,urlid,1,0.1) self.con.commit() What I can't possibly understand is the reason of the first line in this function: 'if len(wordids>3): return None`. Is it a debug code that needs to be removed later? P.S. this is not a homework
