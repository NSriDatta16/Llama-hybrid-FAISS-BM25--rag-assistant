Easier rubygems from command line?

Normally to use Ruby libraries from command line I can do something like: ruby -rfastercsv -e 'code' Unfortunately this doesn't work with rubygems, as they're not enabled by default, and whatever rubygems does to override require doesn't seem to work with -r switch, so I'm forced to do this instead: ruby -e 'require "rubygems"; require "fastercsv"; code' Quite annoying for a one-liner - 42 characters of overhead compared with just 13 for non-rubygems libraries. Is there any way to avoid that? I wrote this script to work around the problem (it works as multiple -e "code" are allowed, and require is idempotent so it shouldn't interfere with -p / -n or anything else as far as I can tell), but it's all rather ugly, and I wouldn't mind a more elegant solution: args = [] until ARGV.empty? arg = ARGV.shift if arg =~ /\A-r(.*)\Z/ args
