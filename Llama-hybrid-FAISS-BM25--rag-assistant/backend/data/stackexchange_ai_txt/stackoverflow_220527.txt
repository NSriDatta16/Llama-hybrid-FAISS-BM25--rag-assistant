Strategy to migrate from StarTeam 5 to Subversion?

I need to migrate a large project from StarTeam 5 to Subversion, and I'd like to keep snapshots of (at least) 5-10 of the major releases. I've considered the following: Manual or scripted export/import of each snapshot. Advantages: straightforward, easy to select labeled/dated versions. Disadvantages: time-consuming, does not preserve comments. Polarion offers what seems to be the perfect tool in svnimporter, but it requires a .jar file from StarTeam 8.0 that is not present in StarTeam 5. Advantages: automated, complete. Disadvantages: requires upgrade to StarTeam 8.0 for one-time use. Migrate via some intermediate repository ( e.g. StarTeam -> CVS -> Subversion). I haven't yet found any intermediary that will cooperate with StarTeam. Migrate only the latest source. Advantages: simple, fast, encourages developers to invent new solutions rather than repeating history. Disadvantage: encourages developers to invent new solutions rather than repeating history. :-) I'd appreciate any experiences or suggestions you might offer. Thank you.
