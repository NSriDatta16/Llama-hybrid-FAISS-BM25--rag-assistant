Efficient Zoom At C#

To zoom images in and out, there is a possible way to resize the pictureBox and showing image in strechmode. Although I can not use it efficiently becauce in general over 8x it gives storage error [think that a pictureBox has the Size(32k, 32k) it needs over 1GB memory ! Is there a special method, or should I zoom only the seen part of the image by using ImageClone ? Update: Here is the project at first try to zoom at the project [impossible, storage error] than delete the 41. line in form.cs : pictureBox1.Image = youPicture; After deleting this line, the program will work, please move the zoomed image.
