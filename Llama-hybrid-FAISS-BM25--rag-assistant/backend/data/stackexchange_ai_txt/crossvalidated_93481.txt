How to compare the results of two classifiers are statistically significant different?

I am applying kNN and SVM classifiers to my classification problem. Both of the classifiers get over 95% cross-validation accuracy (leave one out cross validation used). Not sure how to tell if the results of two classifiers are statistically significant different? I did a little bit search that Discussion1 Discussion2 these posts discussed this topic; however, I am still confused how they use hypothetical test for this purpose. For example, I have two cross-validation accuracies and how to form the 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables of McNemar's test? If my performance measure is AUC of ROC curve, then how to perform the McNemar's test? Thanks a lot. A.
