If it doesn't return anything you should use the HTTP status code: 204 No Content The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. HTTP Status codes are fine for other uses as well but take care to use them only for HTTP status not application status. For application status, you should consider using a standard JSON object (or SOAP or XML or whatever format you are using). This is also how Stack Overflow does it which you can verify by running an HTTP debugger on it: { "response": true, "data" : , "message" : } The response property should ideally be true or false to keep the logic simple on the client. The message will usually typically be null unless an error occurs in which case it will contain the error message. As far as HTTP status codes are concerned, they should be used only to indicate HTTP, not application status codes. 5xx Server Error 500 Internal Server Error 501 Not Implemented 502 Bad Gateway 503 Service Unavailable 504 Gateway Timeout 505 HTTP Version Not Supported 506 Variant Also Negotiates (RFC 2295 ) 507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV) (RFC 4918 ) 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded (Apache bw/limited extension) 510 Not Extended (RFC 2774 ) 2xx Success 200 OK 201 Created 202 Accepted 203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1) 204 No Content 205 Reset Content 206 Partial Content 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)
