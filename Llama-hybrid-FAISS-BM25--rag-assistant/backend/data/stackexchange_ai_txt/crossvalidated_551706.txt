If the response conditioned on your predictive roughly follows a logistic curve then logistic regression will be superior. Despite ML hype, DL/NN do not always outperform simpler models. Have you examined the output of the logistic model? What do the residuals look like? I believe this implementation automatically includes an L2 penalty which probably helps given the number of predictors. Not sure what categorized the categorical variable means. If it's something like one-hot encoding that is not recommended for regression, the model implementation should automatically handle it.
