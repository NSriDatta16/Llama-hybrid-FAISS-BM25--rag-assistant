Adjusted risk difference and negative confidence interval

I was reading this article . The authors used mixed effects logistic regression and presented their results as adjusted risk difference. I noticed that some of the confidence interval were negative, I was wondering if it is because risk difference is not ratio like OR. If that is the case, does that mean it fails to reach statistical significance when CI crosses zero, instead of one? McDonald, E.G., Wu, P.E., Rashidi, B. (2022).
