Dont use resets. Resets are really annoying to fellow and future developers. When I add a h1 tag I expect a margin and padding on it. When I add a p tag I expect space between each paragraph. Its really annoying when people remove all of this. I end up having to go back look at their reset figure out which of the billion terrible ones out there this developer decided to use and then more then likely change.
