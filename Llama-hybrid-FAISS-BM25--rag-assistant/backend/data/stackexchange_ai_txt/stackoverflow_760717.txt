continue tracking mouse-drag event even after cursor moves out of the movie

I have few views aligned in grids in parent view (All being NSView's ) I am overriding -(void)mouseDown:(NSEvent *)event - (void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent for some custom drawing in child view subclass To be specific, I draw some rectangle boxes during mouse drag in child view's. Problem: when cursor moves out of the child view( during mouse drag ) , obviously, I am not able to track the event and hence I cannot resize the rectangle. I want to track the mouse movements even outside the application window... (for now just the drag event ) Is there any obvious or complex way to achieve this..... Thanks in Advance Rajesh
