BruceET's answer addresses a number of critical technical challenges that such an extensive colour scheme would encounter. I would add that if you want to overlay 4 different hues each with intensity graduations then it will quickly become indecipherable what is going on. You need to think more cleverly about how to combine the information in a sequence of plots that will highlight the critical information the viewer will need to be able to see. I'm working on a paper with a sequence of figures that uses hue for sample coding, shading for variable coding (the variables form a sequence) so in some plots we have intense hues (primary and secondary RGB colours) per sample, in others shaded greyscale for variables and in some cases we have sample and variable interactions that use shaded versions of the hues. However, in all plots the sample and variable lines are offset to avoid overlap and I use subplots in each figure to spread the different comparisons out. How about a sequence of plots within each group used to identify a smaller, more manageable number of interesting lines? Then a final plot overlaying the most relevant lines? If there are multiple possible ways of deciding what is an interesting trend, then pick out the ones that share common traits in each group to overlay in separate plots for each aspect. Once you have worked out a workflow to sieve down the information in a traceable way then there are lots of resources to test what your output looks like to a colorblind person for the main forms of colorblindness. Online drag and drop simulator here. Medium post on some free tools A icon tray tool that I've used extensively . It works across multiple monitors, you access it by right clicking on its icon and choosing the form of colorblindness you want to simulate. It then reverts to normal as soon as you click again.
