How about this approach: Assign all objects to one cluster. Find the two objects, a and b , that are within the same cluster, k , and that are maximum distance apart. To clarify, there should be one a and b for the whole set, not one a and b for each cluster. Split cluster k into two clusters, k1 and k2 , one with object a and one with object b . For all other objects in cluster k , add them to either k1 or k2 by determining the minimum average distance to all other objects in that cluster. Repeat steps 2-5 until N clusters are formed. I think this algorithm should give you a fairly good clustering, although the efficiency might be pretty bad. To improve the efficiency you could alter step 3 so that you find the minimum distance to only the original object that started the cluster, rather than the average distance to all objects already in the cluster.
