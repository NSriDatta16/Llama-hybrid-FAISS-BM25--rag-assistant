a4j:queue won't prevent the user from reloading the page / clicking another link while the AJAX call is in progress. Yes, we can probably trust the user not to click many different links right after each other, but what about requests not triggered by the user, for instance by a4j:poll? Note that replacing all collections with their thread-safe equivalent might not be enough to make your application thread safe. That said, depending on the degree of reliability your application needs to meet, this problem might or might not deserve your attention.
