Delphi < 2009, unicode replacement for JvAppStorage

I'm looking for the best option to store my application settings. I decided to write own class that inherits from TPersistent which would store all the config options available. Currently I'm looking for the best way to save it - and I found JvAppStorage which looked very promising (as I'm using JVCL in my project anyway...) but it doesn't handle unicode (WideStrings) properly. For XML files it stores chars as entities, for ini file it seems to be stored ok, but in both cases loading strings replaces the text with lots of question marks... Is there any good replacement that handles Unicode as well? Thanks in advance.
