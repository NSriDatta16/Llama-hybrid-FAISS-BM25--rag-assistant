Help in creating a card stack

I'm trying to develop a card game with Flex, and I was wondering if there's a way to create an horizontal list (the cards that I have in my hand) having the elements overlapped, like you can see in this example made with openflux: http://www.ryancampbell.com/flex/StackListExample/StackListExample.html the thing that's missing here is the possibility to swap the cards with drag and drop. Any ideas on what I could do to get a similar effect with an horizontallist based component?
