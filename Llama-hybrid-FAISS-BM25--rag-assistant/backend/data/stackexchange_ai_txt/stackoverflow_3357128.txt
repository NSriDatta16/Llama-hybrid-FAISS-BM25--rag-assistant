There are a few things you can do to get performance info from CF for some simple graphs, and since your on a Windows platform you can use perfmon - the built-in Windows performance metrics gathering tool. First you allow performance monitoring in CF Admin. Then you can then set up a few perfmon tasks (using Reliability and Performance Monitoring tool under Administrative Tools) on the server. These can access ColdFusion Server metrics such as average request time, hits/sec etc. as well as standard Windows metrics such as memory used and CPU utilization. It's all for free and if you write the results to a csv file, you can parse that every few minutes into a database table. Once you have that you can use native CF processing such as to graph the CF server performance. I can also tell you that this perfmon approach will have a negligible affect on server performance. I hope that helps.
