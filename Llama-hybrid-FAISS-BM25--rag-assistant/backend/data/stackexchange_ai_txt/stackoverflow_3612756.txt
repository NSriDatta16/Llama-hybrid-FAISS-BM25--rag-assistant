Perl best practices: file parser using regexes and database storage

I'm writing a log file parser in Perl, using regexes that I've stored in a database. My workflow is basically like this: Looping over the file and searching for patterns matching my regexes and then extract them Do something with these matches Store them accordingly in a database Last time I did this I explicitly wrote each regex (not looping through each regex in the database), like this . Now that I'm doing this again I was wondering if there were better solutions out there, better yet comments on what I've already done. Thanks! =)
