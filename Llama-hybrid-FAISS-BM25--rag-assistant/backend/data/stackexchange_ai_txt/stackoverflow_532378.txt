Code documentation is over-rated. CVS training is easy. A good class should reveal its purpose through its methods and properties. Documenting the model outside of the application is also easier to flow and comprehend. I would bring it to his attention, if you can't get it resolved looks like you will be losing a star developer. Edit: Oops - used CSV instead of CVS, to many imports and i use svn heh.
