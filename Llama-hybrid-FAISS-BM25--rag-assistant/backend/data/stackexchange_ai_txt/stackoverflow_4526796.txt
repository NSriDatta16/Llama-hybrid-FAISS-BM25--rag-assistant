Detect elements removing

I need to capture event, when some element was removed from the DOM. Removing can be done in following ways: with jQuery.remove() after hitting backspace in paragraph (that has "contentEditable" attr) The only way, I know, to determine second case - is to count elements and compare after each hitting of backspace key. Maybe there is a more elegant way exist ?
