Is there a Magento extension for combining/compressing javascript and css?

I thought Magento came with this feature out of the box but it doesn't appear to be working at all. I'm not sure if I haven't set it up properly, but right now I'm resorting to using cat and altering the page.xml layout file to use the combined javascript and css files. Can I make Magento do this instead or is there an extension that adds this feature?
