I remember this feeling. I was contracted to work on an application in ASP.NET and C#. Problem is, I wasn't a C# developer, and the Employer knew it! But because I had previous programming experience with them, they encouraged me to give it a shot. I was a PHP developer, stepping into a .NET world. The first week was frustrating. I remember getting angry asking why I can't just include("sideNavigation.php") to get my navigation on the page. Instead I have to make some control, add it to some other control - it didn't make any sense. But I kept reading. ASP.NET started catching on, and the markup was making a lot of sense. As I learned the markup aspect, I started becoming a bit more familiar in the code-behind. I knew what properties and methods existed for more things, and what types of values they accepted. Of course places like www.learnvisualstudio.net came in handy too, with video-tutorials on C# and VB.NET. Today I'm still a PHP Developer, but I feel comfortable enough with .NET that I could get back into VS2008 and tinker around until I get my solution(s). All things with time, my friend. Another helpful thing is to find a .NET user-group and visit regularly .
