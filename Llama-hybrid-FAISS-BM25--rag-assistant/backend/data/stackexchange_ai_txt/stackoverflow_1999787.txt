That means you shouldn't be using it in new code typically because it is dangerous, or because a better alternative exists. Compilers warn when a deprecated program element is used or overridden in non-deprecated code. In your case, you can use java.util.Calendar class instead of java.util.Date . By the way, in Java 8 and later, these old classes are supplanted by the new java.time package ( Tutorial ). Inspired by Joda-Time , defined by JSR 310 , and extended by the ThreeTen Extra project. The old classes remain in place and you may continue to use them (while avoiding their deprecated parts), but you are encouraged to transition to the new classes.
