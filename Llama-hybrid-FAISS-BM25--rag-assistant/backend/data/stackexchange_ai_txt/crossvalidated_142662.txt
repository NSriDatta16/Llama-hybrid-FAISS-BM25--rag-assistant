Regarding the first question, different equations of a VAR model need not have the same lag order. Each equation is meaningful by itself and can be treated separately (as regards estimation). If you find that one of the equations may benefit from including some more regressors, you may as well do that. Regarding the picture, I can understand why you have one full row in the lag 2 matrix, but why do you also have one full column? Based on what you have told, that seems unnecessary. Regarding lag 5, is it plausible that there could be an effect with lag 5? (This is a subject-matter question.) If yes, then consider including just lag 5; including all the lags in between 1 and 5 would not be a parsimonious solution. And you should care about parsimony since your sample is quite small. If lag 5 is quite implausible, maybe the significant autocorrelation at that lag is a false positive that is due to chance? Keep in mind that trying to fit the data very well may lead to overfitting. Using information criteria such as AIC or BIC could help decide between a few sensible candidate models. That means that you would deliberately accept ill-behaved model errors when including extra parameters is too costly due to increased estimation uncertainty. That should give some overall guidance as well as address the questions in the last paragraph.
