As signalled by bdeonovic , there seems to be some confusion in your understanding of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms . What you describe is the standard version of the algorithm where both target $f$ and proposal $q(\cdot|x)$ are densities against the same dominating measure (e.g., the Lebesgue measure). In this framework, the proposal $q(\cdot|x)$ can be absolutely anything and be chosen in terms of the target $f$ [and of the observations in a Bayesian setting] and of its mixing performances. For instance, when $q(\cdot|x)$ is a random walk, the scale of the random walk can be selected for the acceptance rate to stay around 0.234. But non-symmetric versions are also available like the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) algorithm which is asymmetric and aims at bringing the chain towards the mode(s) of the target $f$. You seem to be interested in model choice, where the measure issues are much more complicated because the target is defined on a space of varying dimension, with the measure being a direct sum of measures. thus requiring the move to be equally measurable against this sum. Green (1995) managed to formalise this requirement into a valid framework and produced the reversible jump Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which works by pairs of models and spaces and proposals. While the implementation can be brought down to a reasonable level of difficulty, the presentation of the algorithm does not fit in a forum answer. I thus suggest you read the reference by Green (1995) or a book like my book with George Casella (2004, Chap. 11). As for your question #2, if you can compare directly the models via the marginal likelihoods $p(D|M_i)$, there is no need for reversible jump as you are working on a finite or countably discrete space of model indices. Any proposal exploring this space produces a valid Markov chain on the model indices but in cases you can compute directly those probabilities $p(D|M_i)\pi(M_i)$ there is even no need for MCMC since all you have to do is select the highest value or average across models. If you cannot list (and compare) all models, you need a proposal $q$ that considers enough model indices at once to guarantee irreducibility of the resulting Markov chain: since $q$ can be asymmetric, it should appear in the ratio.
