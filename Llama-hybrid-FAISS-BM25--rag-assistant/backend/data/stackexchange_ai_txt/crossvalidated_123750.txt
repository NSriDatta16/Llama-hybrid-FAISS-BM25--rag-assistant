If I understand correctly, it appears you are asking the general about cross-validation when you have unbalanced data. In such cases, it is generally best to do stratified cross-validation. This is essentially what your option 2 is whereby the proportion of samples in each group (e.g. organization) is equal between the testing and training datasets . This is important in very unbalanced data because if you simply do random sampling, your training dataset may not contain all the different groups resulting in a much worse model. Second, regarding your concern about equal sample sizes between the training and testing dataset. That is completely normal, it is more typical to split 80:20 or even 90:10 in some settings. You should be able to split 50:50 if you really want where $n_a=n_b$.
