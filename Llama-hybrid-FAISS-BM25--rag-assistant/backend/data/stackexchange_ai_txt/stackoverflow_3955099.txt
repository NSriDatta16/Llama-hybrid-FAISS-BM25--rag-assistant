We know that, X X' ------ 0 1 1 0 Hence, X X NOR X ------------ 0 1 1 0 So we get, X' = X NOR X For your second question, suppose you have two inputs X' & Y' and you want to get to X NAND Y , X NAND Y = (X AND Y)' = X' OR Y' (by DeMorgan's Law ) Hence, the truth tables are as follows: X Y X AND Y (X AND Y)' ----------------------------- 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 X Y X' Y' X' OR Y' ----------------------------- 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
