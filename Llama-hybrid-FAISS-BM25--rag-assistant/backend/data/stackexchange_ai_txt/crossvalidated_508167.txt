Comparing the magnitude of coefficients for two different logistic regression models

I have built two logistic regression models for two different groups and I want to make comparisons between them. Both models have had their features standardized with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Is it theoretically correct to compare the magnitudes of the coefficients of both models? I have read through Allison's report ( Here ), but I do not quite understand the theory and whether it will apply to the case where the features are standardized. If I can be pointed in the right direction it will be greatly appreciated.
