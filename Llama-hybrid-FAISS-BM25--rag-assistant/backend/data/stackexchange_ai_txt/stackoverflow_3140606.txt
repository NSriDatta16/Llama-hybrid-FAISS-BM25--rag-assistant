Animation/dragging of an object in Android

I have a custom view (extends View) that is going to be a game board. What I'd like to do now is create an object (well, a bunch of them, but I can start with one) at a specific location on the board and then have the user be able to move it around by dragging it. I have the board view down, but am at a loss on how to code up the "pieces." Thanks for any help and/or pointing to the right place here.
