Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Conditions in a Biometrics Research Paper

For one of my course works I'm supposed to find a scientific paper from my field of research that involves an optimisation problem solution based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. My research field is computer vision and more specifically ocular biometrics. I've found this paper from the general field of deep learning, but haven't been able to find anything from a more specific field. Is anyone aware of any such paper from biometrics or at least CV-based identity recognition in general?
