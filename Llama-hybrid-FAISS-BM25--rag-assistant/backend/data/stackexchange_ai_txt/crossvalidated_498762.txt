Significance test to compare joint probabilities

I have a dataset $A$ that is a time series of two variables $X$ and $Y$ (let's say these represent temperature and precipitation). I am calculating the probability of joint exceedances $X$ > $x_1$ & $Y$ > $y_1$ , being $x_1$ and $y_1$ fixed threshold (e.g 30 and 3 respectively). I am using two approaches: using simple frequency counting (e.g.): $P_{A}$ ( $X$ > $x_1$ , $Y$ > $y_1$ )=(sum( $X$ > $x_1$ & $Y$ > $y_1$ )/n #n=total number of observations using copula to get the joint distribution and compute the probability (e.g.) $P_{A}$ ( $X$ > $x_1$ , $Y$ > $y_1$ ) = 1 - $F_x$ - $F_y$ + pCopula(c( $F_x$ , $F_y$ ), tCopula(0.6)) Where $F_x$ and $F_y$ are the marginals that can be assumed to be normal: Fx Now, let's say I have another dataset $B$ , which is also a time series of $X$ (temperature) and $Y$ (precipitation), but independent from $A$ (e.g. different dates). I calculated the probability in the same way as I did for $A$ , using the same fixed thresholds (30 and 0.3) with frequency counting via copula Once I have the probabilities in both datasets $P_A$ (for the dataset $A$ ) and $P_B$ (for the dataset $B$ ), I am interested in compare them, if the probabilities are significantly different. For the frequency counting, I considered to apply z-test or t-test, but I am not sure if there is another test more appropriate. And, any idea about how to compare the probabilities obtained with the copula model?
