How to submit form with data before logging someone out?

I'm using the document.form.submit() function for a rather large input form (hundreds of fields, it's an inventory application). I'm calling this after the user has been idle for a certain amount of time and I would like to save any data they've typed. When I try this the page reloads (the action is #) but any new text typed in the fields is not passed in the REQUEST, so I don't get to put it in the DB. Is there some fundamental reason why this happens or is my code just not playing nice together (I'm using the EXTJS grid view to show the form and a library for tracking idle time)? Thanks, Robert
