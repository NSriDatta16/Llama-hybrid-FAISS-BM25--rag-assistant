I'm sure someone will have a more elegant solution than this, but you can cobble it together with a simple function and dlply from the plyr package. ColTables This gets you back a list - the first "layer" of the list will be the id variable; the second the table results for each column for that id variable. For example: > results[['2']]['a'] $a 1 2 3 4 3 3 For id variable = 2, column = a, per your above example.
