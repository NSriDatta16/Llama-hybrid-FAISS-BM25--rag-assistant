What a Ruby parser would you suggest to parse Ruby sources?

A parser I'm looking for should: be Ruby parsing friendly, be elegant by rule design, produce user friendly parsing errors, user documentation should be available in volume more than a calculator example, UPD : allowing to omit optional whitespaces writing a grammar. Fast parsing is not an important feature. I tried Citrus but the lack of documentation and need to specify every space in rules just turned me away from it.
