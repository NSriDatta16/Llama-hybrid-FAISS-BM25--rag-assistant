I'd like to explore a bit more why you don't wnat to use a DB - they're GREAT at things like this! But on to your options... 1000 open file handles doesn't sound good. Forget disk fragmentation - O/S resources will suck. This is close to db-ish-ness! Also sounds like more trouble than it's worth. RAM = volatile. You spend all day accumulating data and have a power outage at 5pm. How would I approach this? DB! Because then I can query index, analyze, etc. etc. :)
