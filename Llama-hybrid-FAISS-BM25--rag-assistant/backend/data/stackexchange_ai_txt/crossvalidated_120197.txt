I'm not sure about your notation, but you should have one $\beta$ vector for each element of $X$. Each $\beta$ vector is the natural parameter of a Multinomial distribution. This model is multinomial logistic regression. The likelihood induced on the output multinomial distribution when observing the event $A$ is Dirichlet. The likelihood induced on each vector $\beta$ is not Dirichlet anymore and so if you want to do such a Bayesian update to $\beta$, you'll have to make some assumption (e.g., approximate it as Normal).
