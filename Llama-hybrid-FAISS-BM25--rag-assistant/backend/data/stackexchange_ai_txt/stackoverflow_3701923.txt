Having a look at the Android source the class we're interested in seems to be android.provider.MediaStore and in there, the getDatabaseForUri() method seems generate a different database for each external storage card and one called internal.db . So I think the file you're interested in is: /data/data/com.android.providers.media/databases/internal.db However, my copy of that database doesn't have the audio_playlists table used in the Java source so I'm not certain this is right.
