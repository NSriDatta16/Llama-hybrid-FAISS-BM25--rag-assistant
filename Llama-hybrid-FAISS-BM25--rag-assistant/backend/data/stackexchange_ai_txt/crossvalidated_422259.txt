use MCMC posterior as prior for future inference

Would you kindly let me know how to use the estimated posterior distribution as the prior of another Bayesian update? Or even use that in an iterative manner, e.g. in my case the posterior is updated according to a spatial correlated prior update? Would this be very inefficient rather than doing all at once?
