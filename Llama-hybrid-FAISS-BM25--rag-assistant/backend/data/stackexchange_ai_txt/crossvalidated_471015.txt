There's little limiting about a linear model per se . In fact, there is Cybenko's universal approximation theorem for neural networks! This has the output of a single layer network as a linear function of some constructed predictors. The problem lies in finding the right set of predictors, generalization out of sample and so forth. In practice these are hard problems.
