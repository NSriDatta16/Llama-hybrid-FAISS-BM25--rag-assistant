A/B Testing in Time Series - i.i.d.?

If you're using the difference in differences method to run an A/B test on two time series (lets say the outcome measure is clickthrough rate), is there an i.i.d. assumption? More specifically, if user_50 is in the dataset 20 times, can all of those observations be used, or should the within subject correlation be eliminated? I've seen some literature vaguely say that aggregating data into a time series removes clustering bias, and I'm not sure if that clustering bias is referring to things like within subject correlation.
