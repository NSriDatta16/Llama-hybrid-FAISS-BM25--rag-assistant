C - Storing an int pointer in an integer

I have any array of type int and need to store, within this array, a pointer to another part of the array. The problem is that, on 64bit systems, the size of the pointer is 8 bytes, and the size of the int is 4 bytes causing complier warnings (e.g. warning cast to pointer from integer of different size) I (think0 i understand why the complier is moaning, obviously trying to fit 8 bytes into 4 bytes isn't a clever idea. The problem is the array is supplied to me as is and I must use only the array for storage.
