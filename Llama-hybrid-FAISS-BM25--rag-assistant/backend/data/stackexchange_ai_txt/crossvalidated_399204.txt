(1) One possible non-informative prior for $\theta$ would be $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(\alpha =1, \beta=1),$ as you say. Based on sound theoretical arguments, some Bayesian statisticians would prefer the Jeffreys prior $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha =1/2, \beta=1/2).$ [If it's not in your text, you could google 'Jeffreys prior'.] (2) If you want a beta prior with mean $\mu = 1/2$ then you need the shape parameters to be equal: $\alpha = \beta.$ Next, you can find the value of $\alpha$ that makes the variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{\alpha^2}{4\alpha^2(2\alpha+1)}=1/16.$ Solving for $\alpha (= \beta)$ seems to give a reasonable answer. (3) You have chosen $\alpha = 29,\, \beta = 14$ . Then the respective quartiles are about 0.62, 0.67, 0.72, which are very nearly your target values. [The shape parameters of the beta distribution need not be integers, so you might be able to get a little closer to the target values.] qbeta(c(.25, .5, .75), 28, 14) [1] 0.6189876 0.6693351 0.7172090 Addendum on notation: There is no way for me to know the notation of your text, and the notation you are using does not make sense. Perhaps this will help: The success probability $\theta$ is viewed as a random variable. Its beta prior distribution has density function proportional to $\pi(\theta) \propto \theta^{1 - \alpha}(1 - \theta)^{\beta - 1}.$ If your data shows $x$ successes in $n$ trials, then the likelihood function is proportional to $\pi(x|\theta) \propto \theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x}.$ [Notation $\propto$ is read 'proportional to'.] Finally, by Bayes' Theorem, the posterior distribution is proportional to $\pi(\theta | x) \propto \theta^{\alpha + x - 1}(1-\theta)^{\beta + n - x-1}.$ This is the product of the prior and the likelihood. Because the beta prior is 'conjugate' to the binomial likelihood, we can recognize the form of the posterior distribution $\pi(\theta|x)$ as the kernel of $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha + x, \beta + n - x).$ [A 'kernel' of a density function is the density function without the norming constant that makes it integrate to $1.$ For example, the density function of a beta random variable is $\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}\theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}$ for $0 Its kernel is $\theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}.]$
