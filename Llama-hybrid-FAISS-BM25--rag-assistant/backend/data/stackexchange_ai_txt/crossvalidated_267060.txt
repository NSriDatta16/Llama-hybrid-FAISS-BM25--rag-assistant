What is the best statistics way to identify the gap of a plot?

For example, I have the following plot, where y-axis is the values and x-axis is the index of the data point. There are clearly two gaps in this plot, and I wonder what is the best way to identify these two gaps. I hope the method could be based on statistics without fancy machine learning methods with regularizers, because I won't have development data set to tune the weight of a regularizer. The one way I found can work is to calculate the mean and variance of the first fifty values (let's say we assume there are at least half of the values are in the first family), and test whether following points are five standard deviations away from this mean. This method works very well for to identify the second family, but the problem is that, since I don't know how many members will be roughly in the second family, it's hard to calculate the mean and variance for the second family. In addition, the number five seems to be very arbitrary. (A non-arbitrary choice might be 1.96, corresponding to the 5% of the Gaussian mass and 5% is more or less a standard choice of hypothesis testing, but 1.96 does not work.) Are there any suggestions for the methods to identify such a gap?
