change background position using query

on my site project I want the user to be able to change the banner image they have for their profiles. So far I am able to have them upload an image and it automatically be applied as a background to the header, I also have 3 radio inputs that lets them repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat the banner. My next step is to figure out how to let them choose the position of their image. I don't want to throw 10 radio buttons giving them predefined choices as it looks ugly. I tried to take a checkbox approach and have them seletct "Top" then a second postions say "LEFT" so that would apply as .css({'backgroundPosition' : 'top left'}); the problem with this is that I have more than two checkboxes so it would mess up the logic of jquery. Can someone give me some ideas as to how I can tackle this problem? In the end I was planing on giving up and and giving them a sample rectangle with "hot spots" and just have them select the place they want the image to go along side two inputs for a numerical value for Top Left positioning (i.e. 10px 200px) is there an elegant eye candy way to approach this? my current code to handle the radio button click $("form#frm_look_and_feel input[name='position']").each(function(){ $(this).bind('change', function(){ var position = $(this).val(); $('#topHeader').css({'backgroundPosition' : position}); }); });
