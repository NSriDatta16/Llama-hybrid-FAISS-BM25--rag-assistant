If RowEntries is a custom class, just give it a reference to the PreLoadedUserList. Then, each instance has a pointer to it and you can use it in your binding. Just a suggestion, class names like Users and RowEntries suggest that they are collections but your usage looks like they're the item not the collection. I'd use singular names to avoid any confusion. I'd do something like this public List PreLoadedUserList { get; set; } public List SomeDataRowList { get; set; } public class User { public int Age { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } public class RowEntry { public int UserAge { get; set; } public List PreLoadedUserList { get; set; } } // at the point where both PreLoadedUserList is instantiated // and SomeDataRowList is populated SomeDataRowList.ForEach(row => row.PreLoadedUserList = PreLoadedUserList);
