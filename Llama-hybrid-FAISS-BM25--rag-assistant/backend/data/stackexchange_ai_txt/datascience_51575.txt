How can I have a sequential model inside Keras' functional model?

I'm trying to build a architecture that takes in multiple inputs and has a smaller neural network inside a larger architecture. For me to keep track of of the smaller netowrk's loss, I need to compile the sub-network as a Sequential, but it still needs to be part of the functional model as a whole for the architecture. Is this possible in Keras?
