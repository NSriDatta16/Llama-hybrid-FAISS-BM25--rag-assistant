I agree with everything written this far. All solid info. I have a few addons, coming from a fellow freelancer working with BizTalk since 2002: Unit testing. It's not easy to do, but check out BizUnit. A Codeplex based toolset written and maintained by Kevin Smith. One of the early BizTalk heroes :-) http://bizunit.codeplex.com/ Deployment / getting things into production But also keep in mind that none of the day to day development stuff will prepare you for the part of the project where you have to deploy the app and make sure that it is "manageable" by operations. This can be quite complex, and is a topic in it's own right. Check out Apress Pro BizTalk 2009, it's got a decent (IMO) chapter on this. The entire development process around BizTalk. The first two chapters of the same book will give you a good impression on what a BizTalk project is about. Where to use it, and where to not use it, how to organize projects, and name your stuff. Really a good collection of info that you would only get by reading 5-6 years of blogs back in time :-) And one last thing. Depending on the roles on the project, you might be asked to optimize and tune BizTalk. And if they don't ask you. Make sure that you ask if others have done that, because you have to do it. BizTalk should always be tuned towards what it is supposed to do. Low latency vs high throughput, tuned according to hardware, correct setup and config of network around the SQL boxes, etc etc etc. This can be hairy stuff, and you should be careful not to jump into it before reading up on it all. But it's a subject we as freelancers are often expected to be able to deal with ... so thought I might bring it up. Example ... BizTalk x64 processes on an x64 box runs really bad out of the box, actually worse than on the x86 processes. The 64 bit processes need to be tuned to really use all the MEM that are availble to them. Anyways ... a bag of mixed tips and I hope you can use some of them! And good luck! It can be a tough start, but if used right, BizTalk can be a great product/toolset. And remember .... if it is ugly, or hard, or both. You are doing it wrong. And don't be afraid to dive into .net code, and bolt it onto the BizTalk box. We all do it ... some just won't admit to it :-D
