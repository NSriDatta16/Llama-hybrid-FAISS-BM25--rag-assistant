How can I understand the different types of r-squared from the felm function of the lfe package in R?

I'm interested in extracting different types of (adjusted) R^2 from a panel model with time fixed and individual fixed effects, that is: The overall $R^2$ The within $R^2$ The between $R^2$ (For an explanation, see Interpretation of $R^2$ in fixed-effects panel regression .) I'm using the felm function from the lfe package in R. The summary function gives me two values of $R^2$: The full model and the projection model, but I'm not really sure how to interpret them. Call: felm(formula = dynmes ~ treat + ban + treat.ban + log(total.assets) + market.to.book + leverage | symbol + date, data = all_200d_balanced) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.32605 -0.01682 -0.00116 0.01388 1.23264 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) treatTRUE NA NA NA NA banTRUE NA NA NA NA treat.banTRUE 9.015e-03 7.390e-04 12.199 (I found the related question, What does it mean for Multiple "R-squared(proj model)" in felm, package lfe , interesting, but the answer does not explain $R^2$.) I want to know: How I can extract the $R^2$s listed above, and how these are related to the $R^2$s given by the summary function?
