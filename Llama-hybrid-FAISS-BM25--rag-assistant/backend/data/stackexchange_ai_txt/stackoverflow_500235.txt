I ran into on issue with single quotes in some urls such as this one from Fox Sports. I made a slight adjustment that I think should take care of it. http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/9152594/Fehr :'Heightened'-concern-about-free-agent-market / \s]/i this requires that the closing quote be followed by a space or closing bracket.
