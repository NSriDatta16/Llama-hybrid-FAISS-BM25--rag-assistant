Fisher's so-called "exact" test makes the same kind of subtle assumptions that $\chi^2$ tests make. The two variables being assessed for association are truly polytomous all-or-nothing variables such as dead/alive US/Europe. If one or both of the variables is a simplification of an underlying continuum, categorical data analysis should not be undertaken at all. There are no other relevant background variables. If $Y$ is the outcome variable and $X$ is a variable being assessed for association with $Y$, the probability that $Y=y$ is identical for every subject with $X$ fixed at $x$. Contingency tables assume in effect that there is no heterogeneity in the distribution of $Y$ that is not accounted for by $X$. For example, in a randomized clinical trial studying the effect of treatment A vs. B on the probability of death, a $2\times 2$ contengency table test assumes that every subject on treatment A has the same probability of death. [One could argue that this is too stringent an assumption, but that position doesn't recognize the loss of power from doing unadjusted tests of association.] Fisher's test makes one assumption not made by unconditional tests of association such as Pearson's $\chi^2$ test: that we are interested in the "current" marginal distribution of both $X$ and $Y$, that is, we are conditioning on the frequencies of the $Y$ outcome categories. This is not reasonable for prospective studies. The use of Fisher's test leads to conservatism. Its $P$-values are on the average too large, because the test guarantees that the $P$-values are not too small. On the average, Pearson $\chi^2$ $P$-values are more acccurate than Fisher's, even with expected frequencies far lower than 5 in some of the cells.
