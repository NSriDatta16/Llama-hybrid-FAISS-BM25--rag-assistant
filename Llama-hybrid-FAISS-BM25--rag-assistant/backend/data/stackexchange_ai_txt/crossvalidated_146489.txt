Firstly, You've to assume that percentage "profiles" in the same group are hypothetically same or you can test with the use of ANOVA. after getting same individual groups are hypothetically same. Then, take population average of Group A and Group B Then, apply F-test to see whether percentage "profiles" came from same population and assume that percentages are Normally distributed(Note:- score percentages usually are Normal) Then you can test whether this percentage "profiles" differ between subjects from group A and B from t-test . OR if you want to check whether a student perform in a same way in both subject group A&B, then you can use Chi-Squared contingency table. Note:-as from your comment "raw values are generally higher in one group" so you can't use ANOVA for group A and group B together. Regards,
