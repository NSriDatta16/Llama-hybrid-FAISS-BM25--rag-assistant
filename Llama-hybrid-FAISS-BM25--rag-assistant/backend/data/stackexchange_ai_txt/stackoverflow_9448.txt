Thanks DannySmurf , your first answer made me see sense. ( Why do we always look for that magic solution? ). For reference, here's what I ended up doing: ( Warning: VB below, may not contain enough semicolons ) Case ListItemType.Footer e.Item.Cells(0).Text = "Average" For i As Integer = 3 To 8 Dim runningTotal As Integer = 0 For Each row As DataGridItem In DataGrid.Items If IsNumeric(row.Cells(i).Text) Then runningTotal += CInt(row.Cells(i).Text) End If Next e.Item.Cells(i).Text = Math.Round(runningTotal / DataGrid.Items.Count, 0) Next End Select I needed to do it for several columns (hence 3 to 8), ultimately why I was looking for the magical solution.
