GD function not working

I'm trying to create a thumbnail images for my website. I extract the files using $chapterZip = new ZipArchive(); if ($chapterZip->open($_FILES['chapterUpload']['tmp_name'])) { if($chapterZip->extractTo("Manga/".$_POST['mangaName']."/".$_POST['chapterName'])) { for($i = 0; $i numFiles; $i++) { and then loop through the images and with the first image I send the path to a this method function createthumb($source,$output,$new_w,$new_h) all the values are read in fine up until I try to use the following code if (preg_match("/jpg|jpeg/",$ext)){$src_img=imagecreatefromjpeg($source);} if (preg_match("/png/",$ext)){$src_img=imagecreatefrompng($source);} if (preg_match("/gif/",$ext)){$src_img=imagecreatefromgif($source);} the prerequisite for the regular expression is being met by the file and the code is being ran, yet the imagecreate function doesn't create the new file, I checked my phpinfo file to see if the GD library is enable and it is, so in short I don't have a clue whats wrong. http://www.neuromanga.com/phpinfo.php
