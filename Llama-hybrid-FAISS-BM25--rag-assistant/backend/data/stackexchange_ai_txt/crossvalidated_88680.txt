Adjusted logistic regression model

I want to fit logistic regression model for a binary outcome variable to see the impact of other explanatory variable on it. What are selection criteria for selecting variables in the adjusted logistic regression model? What is the basic difference between unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression model?
