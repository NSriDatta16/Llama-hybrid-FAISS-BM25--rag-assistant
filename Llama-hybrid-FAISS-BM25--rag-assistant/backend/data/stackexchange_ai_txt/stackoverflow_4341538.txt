Django - load page fragments using Ajax/Ajah

I have a complex page where some parts of the page take more time to load. I was thinking about using AJAH approach and load fragments using jQuery after initial page is loaded. Then I realized that should be quite common problem. How about some something like {% includeajax "sometemplate.html" %}? What this means is load "sometemplate.html" using AJAH/AJAX. Wouldn't that be cool tag? Any ideas? I know how to implement this, it would be nice to have reusable tag like this. Do you know about some other simple way to achieve this? Thanks
