Read Binary Data from IsolatedStorage in Silverlight

I have some bytes written to a file in isolated storage in my Silverlight application. This file is named "data.dat". I wrote it to Isolated Storage using the following code: // Store the data in isolated storage var bytes = GetData(); using (IsolatedStorageFile storage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { using (IsolatedStorageFileStream file = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("data.dat", FileMode.Create, storage)) { file.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); } } My question is, how do I retrieve the bytes from isolated storage once they're there? Everything I see returns a string. But I don't see a way to return binary data. Thanks.
