How to construct expandable website structure?

HI, I have a ASP.NET webiste I created from craft and it now look a big mess. I want to reorganize this but don't know the good way to do it. Some first look well but later cause trouble with master page, image path... Now I'm thinking of 2 ways: Using UrlWriter: but it seems lead to a bulk of path rewrite and usually lead to Resource not found or something Using a page as main entry and using Server.Tranfer to pull the right page content, despite of its location Which is better? Do you have another method? Please help!
