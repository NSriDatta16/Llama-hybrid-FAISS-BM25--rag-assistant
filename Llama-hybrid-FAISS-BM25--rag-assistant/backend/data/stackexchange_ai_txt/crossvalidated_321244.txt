AIC and BIC calculations for the brnn method

Recently I got a recommendation from a reviewer of my article to calculate AIC (or BIC) for the brnn model . However, there is no straightforward way of doing that. Could anyone suggest how to do it? alligator = data.frame( lnLength = c(3.87, 3.61, 4.33, 3.43, 3.81, 3.83, 3.46, 3.76, 3.50, 3.58, 4.19, 3.78, 3.71, 3.73, 3.78), lnWeight = c(4.87, 3.93, 6.46, 3.33, 4.38, 4.70, 3.50, 4.50, 3.58, 3.64, 5.90, 4.43, 4.38, 4.42, 4.25)) library(brnn) model_brnn = brnn(lnWeight ~ lnLength, data = alligator)
