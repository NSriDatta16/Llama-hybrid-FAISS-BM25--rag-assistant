here's a simple system. you can use case/esac instead of if/else for neatness. also, rearranged the mv commands a bit #!/bin/bash dir=$1 cd $dir while true do echo "Are you sure you want to reorganize your files?" printf "Type y or Y to continue. Anything else will stop the process: " read response case "$response" in y|Y ) mv -v *.txt text >> log.txt for vid in "*.mov" "*.wmv" "*.mpg" "*.wma" do mv $vid video >> log.txt done echo "yay" break;; *) echo "Invalid choice";; esac done
