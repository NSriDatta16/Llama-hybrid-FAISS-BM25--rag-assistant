Explicitly setting the JAVA_HOME variable in your .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc isn't actually the recommended way to do it on the mac. There are programs that I've seen get hosed up with an explicitly set JAVA_HOME to a particular version (grails 1.1 with some spring resources for example). The correct way to set the version of Java that you want to use is to use the /Application/Utilities/Java Preferences.app application. In there, you drag the version of java that you want to use to the top. This will enable that version for all applications (both those run from the command line and those launched through GUI processes). You can test the current version by running this from the command line: java -version I don't actually like the way that the mac handles the entire set of java symlinked directories and files. It's not obvious and people often screw it up. See the apple developer page on this for more details.
