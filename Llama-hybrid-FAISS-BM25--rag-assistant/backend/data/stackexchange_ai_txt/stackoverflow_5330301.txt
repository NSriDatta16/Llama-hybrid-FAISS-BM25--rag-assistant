Scoped CSS reset

I have a jQuery plugin that is going to dynamically render a decent amount of HTML to the page. I want consumers of the plugin to be able to use it as is and for it to look the same no matter what CSS styles they have in place. Hence I need a "scoped" CSS reset - i.e. the ability to say anything within my plugins div should not be affected by the owners CSS. Now obviously I can reset all the HTML elements that I use within this scope but it doesn't seem very elegant. Anyone else go any ways they handle this?
