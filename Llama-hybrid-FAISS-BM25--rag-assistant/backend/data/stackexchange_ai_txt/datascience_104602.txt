I want to answer this question with respect to my experience with scientific papers. The point is that when practitioners try to make new ideas, they should have ablation study in their work. This means that they should satisfy the readers and the reviewers that the claimed improvements are real. They should concentrate on the novelty of their work. This means that in papers, and probably their implementations, you usually do not see state-of-the-art modules. They leverage trivial modules and try to show the effectiveness of their own new-designed or manipulated module(s). This is why everyone knows there are so many optimisation approaches that are better than Adam but there are still numerous novel papers that exploit Adam for optimisation. On the other hand, if a scientist uses a typical state-of-the-art approach alongside his novel approach, he should prove that the improvement is not solely due to the state-of-the-art things he's used that are apart from his original work. This means the ablation study should be longer. Students usually avoid this.
