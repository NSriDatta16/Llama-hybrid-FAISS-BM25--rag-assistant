Securit risks of serializing from PHP to MySQL?

I'm serialising PHP arrays for storage in a MySQL TEXT field (as you do), and I'm wondering if I need to take any precautions regarding injection attacks (do I need to base64 encode it, for example). Also, can anyone offer a good way of storing an array in a MySQL DB so that a FULLTEXT search will work on it reasonably well? Serialized data might work ok-ish, but it might not. Does anyone have any experience with this? Thanks, James
