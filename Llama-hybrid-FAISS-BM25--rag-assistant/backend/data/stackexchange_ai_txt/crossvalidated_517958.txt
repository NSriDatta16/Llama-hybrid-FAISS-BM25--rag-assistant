Create composite score from categorical and binary variables

Let's say I have a dataset with a number of variables on clinical history and behaviours in the context of COVID transmission. Ultimately i'd like to create a binary variable that is an indicator of COVID risk (though I do NOT have access to any variables about whether they have/had COVID). So each person in the dataset would be classified as either High or Low risk, based upon about 6 categorical indicators. For all 6 variables we know theoretically, which direction the risk would go. For example, let's say these are our 6 variables: Diabetes (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Obesity (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Smoker (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Works in public (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Doesn't wear mask (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Doesn't wash hands (Yes/No) Yes would be higher risk Would it be a valid thing to do, to score Yes's to each question with a "1". Then add up the scores. Then say something like every one with >=4 is "High Risk"? Or is there another technique you'd use to create the Risk variable, in absence of the outcome? I'm familiar with cluster analysis, but not really sure if it would work well on only a few variables. And I might run the risk it not being clear which cluster is high vs low risk. I know PCA can't typically be used with categorical variables. Anything else I should consider?
