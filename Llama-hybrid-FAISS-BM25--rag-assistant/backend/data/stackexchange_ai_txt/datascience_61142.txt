Advice and Ideas appreciated - Machine Learning one man project

I have a project where I am supposed to start from scratch and learn how machine Learning works. So far everything is working out better than expected but I feel as I am offered to many ways to choose from. My Project: I have data with 700 rows and 108 columns as my features and I get pretty decent results when using a RandomForestClassifier . By now I was using train_test_split to split my data but I was reading a lot of articles where it was recommended to split data into 3 Sets (train, dev, test). Since I dont have that much Data I thought of using a Cross-Validation. My Problem: So I implemented it, but couldn't really find the difference between a CV and a train_test_split with shuffle. Before doing so I thought I know the difference betweeen these to model-selection strategies but now I am a bit confused. My Knowledge And Questions: 1. train_test_split has the problem that the sets can be unbalanced, so if I am unlucky I train my model only with positive or negative examples. --> can't that be solved by using stratify=True ? 2. train_test_split doesn't split the sets the same way all the time so the results aren't comparable --> setting random_state=0 solves the problem? 3. When does it make sence for me to use CV ? 4. How to understand the following picture and what benefit does it provide: What would be a good way to proceed? thanks a lot for all the help and time in advance! Cheers!
