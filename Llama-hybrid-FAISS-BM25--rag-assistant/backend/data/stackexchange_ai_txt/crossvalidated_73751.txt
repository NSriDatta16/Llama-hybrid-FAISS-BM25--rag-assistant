The relation between the autocovariance (or autocorrelation) and the spectral density (for which the periodogram is an estimator) is given by the Fourier transform. The two form a so-called Fourier-transform pair meaning the two are time(or space)-domain vs. frequency-domain representations of the same thing. Specifically, if time series $\{X_t\}$ has autovariance function $\gamma(\tau)$ at time lag $\tau$, then the spectral density is defined by \begin{equation} f(\nu)=\sum\limits_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty} \gamma(\tau)e^{-2i\pi\nu\tau}. \end{equation} In words, the spectral density partitions the autocovariance as energy-per-hertz of a signal. For example, if you have a deterministic signal with period $t=12$, then the series lagged with itself (ACF) at lag 12 will be perfectly correlated (autocorrelation=1). Subsequently, all power in the spectral density will be concentrated at frequency $1/t$.
