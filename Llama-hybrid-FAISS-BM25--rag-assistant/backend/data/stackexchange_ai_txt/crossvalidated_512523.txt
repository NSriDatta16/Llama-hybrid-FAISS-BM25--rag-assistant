Find the mean function of a moving average. Question 1.6 in Shumway Stoffer Time Series Analysis book

Consider the time series $$x_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 t + w_t$$ where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are known constants and $w_t$ is a white noise process with variance $\sigma^2_w$ . Show that the mean of the moving average $$v_t=\frac{1}{(2q+1)} \sum_{j=-q}^{q} x_{t-j}$$ is $\beta_1+\beta_2t$ , and give a simplified expression for the autocovariance function. What I have is $$\mu_{t-j} = E(x_{t-j}) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 t - \beta_2 j$$ $$E[v_t] =\frac{1}{(2q+1)} \sum_{j=-q}^{q} E(x_{t-j})=\frac{1}{(2q+1)} \left[2q (\beta_1 + \beta_2 t) + \sum_{j=-q}^{q} \beta_2 j \right]$$ seems like it should be easy from here, but I just can't see it.
