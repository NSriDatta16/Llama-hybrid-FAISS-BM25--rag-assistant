I realised I have a technical answer for you too. About 10 years ago I wrote a plug-in for Excel which leveraged their spreadsheet to surface data from my provider. It was very successful and lived for about 8 years as a viable revenue generating product. It was a key differentiator for the BI company I worked for at the time. The major headache in our code base was differences in API between versions of Excel, plus different DLL dependencies. MS like to say that they don't break their APIs between releases but this is not actually true. They may have got better at it, but it was always a real issue for us getting hold of a pre-release version of their new software to see what we had to do to keep ours working with it. Then we had to support several different Ecel versions and upgrade of our content between them. All in all it added a huge amount of complexity to our lives. Their APIs have changed significantly in style, and Office is much more open than it was, but you asked for considerations and this is certainly one.
