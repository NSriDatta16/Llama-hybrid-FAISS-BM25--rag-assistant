There is a setting in config/environment.rb that sets a time_zone. Possibly this is not set the same in your script: # Make Time.zone default to the specified zone, and make Active Record store time values # in the database in UTC, and return them converted to the specified local zone. # Run "rake -D time" for a list of tasks for finding time zone names. Uncomment to use default local time. config.time_zone = 'UTC' You can also try explicitly specifying the TZ and format: require 'active_support/core_ext/date/conversions' record.the_time.utc.to_s(:db) (or cheat and grab the code fragment from there if you're not using active_support in your standalone script)
