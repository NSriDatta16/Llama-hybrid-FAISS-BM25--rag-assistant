PS: I'm not allowed to switch to any other pdf-rendering library, or upgrade an existing one. If you can't use "arial.ttf", then you're almost certainly doomed. There's a bug in the way that version of FOP is embedding... HEY! It's entirely possible that your font isn't embedded at all: From the Apache FOP fonts page: Sadly, I don't see any mention of specifying a particular encoding anywhere in those docs. You're using "embed-file" not "embed-url="file:///". I suspect that's your problem.
