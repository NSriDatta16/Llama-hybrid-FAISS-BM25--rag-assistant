Uninstalling MAMP PRO from my mac

I tried to download and set up MAMP on my Mac. When I went to launch, it said that a version of MAMP Pro was installed, and that there may be a conflict having both. I therefore tried to run the uninstall wizard for the MAMP Pro but it gave me an error message and said it had to abort. Is there another way to get MAMP pro off my computer? I tried dragging the folder to the trash and it said it couldn't be deleted. Thanks for your help.
