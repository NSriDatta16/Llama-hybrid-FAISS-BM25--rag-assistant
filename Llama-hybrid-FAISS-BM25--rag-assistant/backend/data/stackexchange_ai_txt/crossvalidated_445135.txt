I'll add this: That the LASSO (and associated with it, ridge regression) have Bayesian interpretations is a glimmer of light in the problem of penalization and inference. However, it isn't as easy as "pick priors so that some covariates are shrunk to zero". In order for valid inferences to be made from a bayesian linear model, your priors have to actually reflect your present uncertainty about the phenomenon. Else, the uncertainty yielded in the posterior does not correspond to anything, and your just computing expectations for the sake of doing math. There is no answer to "How do I select variables for inference". Inference presupposes you have a well defined question to assess. Without that question, what are you really trying to infer?
