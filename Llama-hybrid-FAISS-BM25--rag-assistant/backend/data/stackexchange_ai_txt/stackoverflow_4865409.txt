Postgresql Manager

I have been working with Microsoft SQL Server since 6.5 along with other database like Oracle, MySQL and SQLite. I equally appreciate or hate all these DBMS for some point or the other. On our forthcoming project, we are considering Postgres in the back-end. I have already started playing with it, pretty interesting for me. I have always heard good comments on Postgres database, but I don't like the admin studio at all. While creating new a table, I hate the way of creating columns on pgAdmin by having to click add button again and again. Are there any "Studios" for Postgres database that provide more organized table creation process (spreadsheet like) graphical view designer
