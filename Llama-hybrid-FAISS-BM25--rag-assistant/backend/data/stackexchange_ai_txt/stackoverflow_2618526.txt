Problems Expanding an Array in C++

I'm writing a simulation for class, and part of it involves the reproduction of organisms. My organisms are kept in an array, and I need to increase the size of the array when they reproduce. Because I have multiple classes for multiple organisms, I used a template: template void expandarray(orgType* oldarray, int& numitems, int reproductioncount) { orgType *newarray = new orgType[numitems+reproductioncount]; for (int i=0; i However, this template seems to be somehow corrupting my data. I can run the program fine without reproduction (commenting out the calls to expandarray), but calling this function causes my program to crash. The program does not crash DURING the expandarray function, but crashes on access violation later on. I've written functions to expand an array hundreds of times, and I have no idea what I screwed up this time. Is there something blatantly wrong in my function? Does it look right to you? EDIT: Thanks for everyone's help. I can't believe I missed something so obvious. In response to using std::vector : we haven't discussed it in class yet, and as silly as it seems, I need to write code using the methods we've been taught.
