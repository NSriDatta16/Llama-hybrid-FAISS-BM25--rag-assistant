Just to follow up on Zhengze's reply: the test should work for any weighting on each side of the split since the change in impurity is zero in expectation. We've used training weights just because that's what is usually recorded when trees are built and it keeps us closer to the original variable importance measures. But we could also use test weights or average the two.
