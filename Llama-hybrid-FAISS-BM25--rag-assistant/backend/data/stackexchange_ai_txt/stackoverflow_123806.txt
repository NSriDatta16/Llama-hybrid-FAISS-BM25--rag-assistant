It is not a regexp, but it is really elegant: from itertools import groupby def paragraph(lines): for group_separator, line_iteration in groupby(lines.splitlines(True), key = str.isspace): if not group_separator: yield ''.join(line_iteration) for p in paragraph('p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t \n \n\tp'): print repr(p) 'p1\n' 'p2\t\n\tstill p2\t \n' '\tp3' It's up to you to strip the output as you need it of course. It was inspired by the famous "Python Cookbook" ;-)
