Proving that residuals from logistic regression are orthogonal to the predictions

I am stuck on proving that residuals from logistic regression are orthogonal to the predictions. However, I am able to prove that residuals are orthogonal to the predictors since score vector ( vector of first derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameter $\beta$ ) is $\nabla_\beta l(\beta;y,X)= \sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i-g(x_i\beta ))x_i$ , where $g(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ and $\hat{\beta}=\underset{\beta}{\operatorname{argmax}}l(\beta;y,X)$ (i.e. it is the value that $\nabla_\beta l(\hat{\beta};y,X) = 0$ ). Any advice on how I can proceed? Thank you in advance for your help!
