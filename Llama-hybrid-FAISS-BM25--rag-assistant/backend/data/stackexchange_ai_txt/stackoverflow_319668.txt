Class and method attributes in .NET are a form of aspect-oriented programming. You decorate your classes/methods with attributes. Behind the scenes this adds code to your class/method that performs the particular functions of the attribute. For example, marking a class serializable allows it to be serialized automatically for storage or transmission to another system. Other attributes might mark certain properties as non-serializable and these would be automatically omitted from the serialized object. Serialization is an aspect, implemented by other code in the system, and applied to your class by the application of a "configuration" attribute (decoration) .
