Before you make a decision its probably worth understanding what is going on with your JVM as well as your physical system resources. There are several factors that could be at play here: jvm heap size garbage collection algorithms how much physical memory you have how you load the data - is it from a file that is fragmented all over the disk? do you even need to load all of the data at once - can it be done it batches if you are doing it in batches you can vary the batch size and see what happens if your system has multiple cores perhaps you could look at using more than one thread at a time to process/load data if using multiple cores already and disk I/O is the bottleneck, perhaps you could try loading from different disks at the same time You should also look at http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/vmoptions.jsp if you aren't familiar with the settings for the VM.
