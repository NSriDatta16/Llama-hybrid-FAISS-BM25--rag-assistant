PCA influence of duplicates

I am using sklearn IPCA decomposition and surprised that if I delete duplicates from my dataset, the result differs from the "unclean" one. What is the reason? As I think, the variance is the same. Explained variation per principal component with duplicates: 8.08489473e-01 1.42712763e-01 3.40174443e-02 Explained variation per principal component on "clean" dataset: 5.23586790e-01 2.62231842e-01 9.43627488e-02
