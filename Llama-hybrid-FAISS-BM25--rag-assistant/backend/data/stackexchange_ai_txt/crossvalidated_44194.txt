Definition of stationary distribution in continuous time markov chains

I found the following definition: "A probabilitly distribution $\pi = \{\pi_x\}_{x \in S}$ on the state space $S$ is called a stationary distribution for the Markov chain if for every $t > 0$, $$ \pi^T P_t = \pi^T $$ What does $P_t$ mean? I thought it was the t'th step matrix of the transition matrix P but then this would be for discrete time markov chains and not continuous, right? Oh wait, is it the transition matrix at time t?
