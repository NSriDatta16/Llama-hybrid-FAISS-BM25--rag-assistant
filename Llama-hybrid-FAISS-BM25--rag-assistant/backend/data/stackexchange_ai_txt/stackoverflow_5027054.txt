So, it appears that once the item is dragged, the draggable widget calls its own destroy() function which removes any semblance of draggability from the element. With no discernible way of overriding this with options or events, I've overridden it with brute force in document.ready: $.ui.draggable.prototype.destroy = function (ul, item) { }; This now works.
