WCF Web Services and Clients

I have a few questions about WCF services that I would appreciate comments on. I have read a lot of material on how to apply WCF services to real-life scenarios, but there are a lot of contradictory opinions. We have a data service which is intended to be nothing more than an interface to a back-end data storage. There are a number of clients to this data service which should be notified when data held by the data service changes. These clients subsequently may request data from the data service based on these notifications. We would like to support up to say 2000 clients (not a web-based solution, but could be a large dispersed network). My concerns: · If the connection is lost between service and client, the client should know immediately. · The service should notify the client of data changes within a short amount of time. The notification cannot be queued and received much later on. · We do not want a heavy amount of configuration work at the client end to get it to work with the service. · We do not want a permanent connection between the service and client if it does not scale well. The approaches we have looked at: · MSMQ · Duplex Binding · Polling for events (including Silverlight 3’s new polling binding) · Subscribe/publish approach. We have found drawbacks with all of these, and there does not appear to be one optimal way of doing what we want. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Ian
