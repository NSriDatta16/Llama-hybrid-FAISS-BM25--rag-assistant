Master degree in Data Science

I am looking to change careers and would appreciate some advice. I have an undergraduate degree in English Literature and a JD. Needless to say, these were not the best decisions and I would like to change my career. I have always enjoyed math and science, and after months of research and self study, I have decided that I would like to pursue statistics. My question is basically this : would it be better to get another Bach. Degree in statistics or should I take calculus 1-3, linear algebra, probably and statistics and some computer science courses at a community college then try to get into a grad program instead? I am afraid that without the bachelors degree I will not have the required knowledge for a masters even after taking the courses at my local c.c. However, another bachelors degree may be a worthless waste of time. Please share your thoughts. Also, sorry if this is not the right place for this question.
