Wouldn't you just specify a multinomial distribution ? That is, you can just have a $p_0$, $p_1$ and $p_3$ such that $p_0+p_1+p_3=1$ and $p_i>0,i=0,1,3$, and a number of observations $n$, so that you can accommodate any set of probabilities to the three outcomes. Let the counts for each category be $\mathbf{X} = (X_0,X_1,X_3)^\prime\,,$ where (where $X_0+X_1+X_3=n$) You observe $(X_0,X_1,X_3)^\prime = (x_0,x_1,x_3)^\prime$ with probability $\qquad\frac{n!}{x_0! x_1! x_3!} p_0^{x_0} p_1^{x_1} p_3^{x_3} \:$ (with $x_0+x_1+x_3=n$). The MLEs of the $p$ parameters are just the sample proportions. You can compute an average just fine, since the category labels are integers (0,1,3), so the expectation is just $n(p_1+3p_3)$. The estimate of the mean is the sample mean $\bar{x}=(x_1+3x_3)/n$ and the variance of the sample mean is $\frac{1}{n^2}[\text{Var}(X_1)+9\text{Var}(X_3)+6\text{Cov}(X_1,X_3)]$. Note that $\text{Var}(X_i) = np_i(1-p_i)$ and $\text{Cov}(X_i,X_j)=-np_ip_j$ for $i\neq j$. So we can obtain the standard error of the mean fairly directly. Or did you want something less general?
