Principal component analysis in 3D Scatterplot

I am new to principal component analysis (PCA). I performed PCA for a dataset with 54 samples. When I project them in 3D scatterplot, I can see samples with similar characteristics are grouped together separately. The X,Y and Z axes in 3d scatterplot represent PC#1, PC#2 and PC#3 respectively. Along the axes positive and negative values are represented. What does these values convey, especially negative values ? If a sample is found along an axis with negative value, what does that imply? Also the overall variance all 3 PCs is 40% (PC#1-20%,PC#2-13% and PC#3=7%). What does that imply? Why it is not 80-90%? Is my data of good quality?
