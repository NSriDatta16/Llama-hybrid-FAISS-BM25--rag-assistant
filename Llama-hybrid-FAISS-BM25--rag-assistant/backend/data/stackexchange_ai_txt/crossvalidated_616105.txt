Other alternatives to regularization: Using ensemble methods. Oversampling and data augmentation. Combine the variables to get new ones, for example with PCA. Adding random noise at every step of the optimization. Smoothing the data. Dropout: typically used with NN, but could also be used with the covariates. Standardization always improves the results. Using a bayesian prior is equivalent to regularization. Replace categorical (with many values) fixed effects with random effects (because it reduces the number of parameters).
