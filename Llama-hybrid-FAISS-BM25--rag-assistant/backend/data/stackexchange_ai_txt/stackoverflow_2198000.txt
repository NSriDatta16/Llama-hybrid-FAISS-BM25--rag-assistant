How to debug a AVAudioPlayer play failure?

I'm using an AVAudioPlayer to play a mono AIFF file from my app's Documents directory. On the simulator, [player play] returns YES and I hear the file playing. On the device the play method returns NO and nothing happens. I grabbed the file via the Organizer - it plays back fine on my Mac and seems to be well-formed. I realize the simulator can access codecs that aren't available on the iPhone, but that shouldn't matter in this case, should it? I'm at a loss as to how to debug this. Any suggestions?
