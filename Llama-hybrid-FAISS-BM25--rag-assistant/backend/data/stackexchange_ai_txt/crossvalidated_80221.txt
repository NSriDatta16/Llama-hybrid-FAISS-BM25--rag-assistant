No. First it can easily be seen that the quantity you computed is not a probability, since it goes to $+\infty$ as $N \rightarrow +\infty$. Actually what you computed is the average number of times you'll observe your pattern. Computing the exact probability of seeing at last one time the pattern is much more difficult, since there are a lot of dependencies involved (for example, the probability to observe or not your pattern at digits 2-4 is heavily dependent on the fact that you observed or not your pattern at digits 1-3)... It is possible to derive upper or lower bounds on this probability though. PS: All this is based on the assumption that the digits are uniformly and i.i.d.
