How do you Interpret RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)?

I've been doing a machine learning competition where they use RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) to evaluate the performance predicting the sale price of a category of equipment. The problem is I'm not sure how to interpret the success of my final result. For example if I achieved a RMSLE of $1.052$ could I raise it the the exponential power $e$ and interpret it like rmse? (ie. $e^{1.052}=2.863=RMSE$)? Could I then say that my predictions were $\pm \$2.863$ on average from the the actual prices? Or is there a better way to interpret the metric? Or can the metric even be interpreted at all with the exception of comparing to the other RMSLEs of other models?
