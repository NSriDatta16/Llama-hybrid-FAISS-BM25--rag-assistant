Sounds like you're up against the maximum fill rate of the card, coupled with the fact that you're doing blending so reads as well as writes are required. If you overdraw enough of the frame buffer (particularly at high res), then you're going to drop the frame rate eventually, because of limitations in the fill rate of the card. Although modern cards can do a lot of operations, they still have a limit to how many pixels they can push. To reduce this some suggestions are: Don't draw everything every frame - if possible - render some parts to other buffers, then blend those over - at a lower resolution if possible Don't use blending if you don't have to - blending is much slower than drawing opaque stuff Use a cheaper fragment shader / fragment program - if you're using a programmable pipeline (NB: I don't know how you can really tell how expensive it is) Use as much culling as you can - avoid drawing things which can't be seen at all. If a sprite is entirely (or mostly) hidden behind others, you don't need to draw it. Scaling / interpolation is probably relatively cheap - use lower res textures and scale them - particularly if your textures are "blurry" to begin with. If you're doing this to get some funky smoke / particle effect, you probably can't use all or many of these optimisations.
