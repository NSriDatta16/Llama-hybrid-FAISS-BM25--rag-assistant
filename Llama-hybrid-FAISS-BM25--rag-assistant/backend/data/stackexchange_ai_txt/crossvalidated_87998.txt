There is a clear difference between the two problems if you model them in the Bayesian way. In some papers the first case (homogeneity) is called sampling with "one margin fixed" and the second case (independence) as "total table fixed". Have a look, for example, at Casella et al. (JASA 2009) . I am working on this topic but my paper - which also describe this distinction - is not out yet :)
