How to diff changed form file - ( .Designer InitializeComponent )

Using Suversion and WinDiff its no problem to branch / merge class-projects and web-projects. The only kind of project I can never merge are winform projects. The InitializeComponent method is always scrambled after only little changes. Is there any good way to enable diff / merge for .Designer - files? EDIT: I used a 3 way diff like Bert suggested. It made things a lot more easy. But still Winform - files (.designer and .resx ) were not mergeable.
