Solved the problem, and posting a replay to others who may do the same error that I did. Hope that is ok. The problem was in the create function of the Project bean. Before merging (updating) the Organisation entities, I had to call the create (persist) on the project first. try { getFacade().create(current); for(Organisation org : current.getOrganisationCollection()) { org.getProjectCollection().add(current); ejbOrganisationFacade.edit(org); } JsfUtil.addSuccessMessage(ResourceBundle.getBundle("/resources/Bundle").getString("ProjectCreated")); return prepareCreate(); } catch (Exception e) { Also I had a error in the create method of the project facade, which called merge instead of persist. Which cause much of the problem. Sorry for taking up space for such a trivial solution.
