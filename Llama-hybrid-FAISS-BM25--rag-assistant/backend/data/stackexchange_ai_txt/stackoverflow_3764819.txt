Can you use your own database for Facebook applications?

I am completely new to Facebook application development, but I've got a straight-forward question. I am looking to create an application that would collect a few pieces of information from a user and store it into a database. I wanted to host the database on a MySQL server, but I didn't know how Facebook works with application information and data storage. My question is - does Facebook allow off-site databases to host information in applications?
