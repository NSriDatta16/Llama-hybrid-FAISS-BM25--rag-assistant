is the best and simple or even reliable way of storing the matrix elements in the database. Moreover I need to multiply two matrices and make the operation dynamic. So will the storage of data this create any problems for the task? I'll start by saying both approaches are valid, but the second one is not sufficient as written by you. You have to have some other information, like the length of the rows or the (row, col) indexes of each element to store a matrix as a 1D array. This is commonly done for sparse matricies, where there are lots of zeros surrounding values clustered on either side of the diagonal. Persisting the matrix in a database and operating on it in memory are two separate things. Tasks like multiplying require (row, col) indexes. Storing the matrix as a 2D array means that you'll have them, so no other info is needed. The 1D array needs this info too, so you'll have to supply it. The advantage swings to the 1D array for sparse matricies. You don't have to store zero values outside the bandwidth in that case, but your operations like addition and multiplication become more complex to code.
