Since the users interacts with FTP and not with a web app, you can implement a plain Ruby script instead of a Rails web application. Every user has own FTP area to upload files to; ftp.mysite.com/user1 , ftp.mysite.com/user2 , ... Periodically a script checks if there is any new file in users' FTP folder using net/ftp standard library If there is any, uploads the file so S3 via AWS::S3 , eventually creating the folder on the S3 bucket if its missing Once uploaded to S3, the file is deleted from FTP Notes: Every user should access only to own FTP folder, while the Ruby script should access to any FTP folder If your users can use FTP, they can probably use Amazon S3 Organizer(S3Fox) , Cyberduck or other S3 client. Create a bucket, users and folders then play with S3 ACL to define their privileges.
