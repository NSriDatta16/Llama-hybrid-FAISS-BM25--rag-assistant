One common way to analyze this is to express each type of behaviour as a difference from its pre-test average and do repeated-measures ANOVA/MANOVA or its equivalent free of distributional assumptions if the data are not normally distributed. Depending on whether observational categories are dependent or independent, whether pre-test behaviour variability is of interest, and whether you expect the change in behaviours to be non-linear (also, what is the hypothesis behind 'change in the same way' - direction of response, shape of response), different approaches may be needed.
