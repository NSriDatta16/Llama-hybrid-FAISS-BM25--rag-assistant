Hypothesis testing fundamental concepts question

As long as I clearly do not know the concepts I would try to be very explicit to make my point: In the chapter 9: Hypothesis testing of the book "Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century" ( https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/hypothesis-testing.html ) the Null Hypothesis Statistical testing is presented, and then its alternative, the Bayesian hypothesis testing in the chapter 11 ( https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/bayesian-statistics.html#bayesian-hypothesis-testing ). In the book "All of statistics" (Larry Wasserman) the chapter 10: Hypothesis testing and p-values describes other methods such as the Wald Test and the Likelihood Ratio Test. My question is: If you had to do a conceptual scheme with the next elements: "Hypothesis testing", "Null Hypothesis Statistical testing", "Bayesian hypothesis testing", "Wald test" & "Likelihood Ratio Test" how would they be related/connected? Thank you in advance for any pontential help!
