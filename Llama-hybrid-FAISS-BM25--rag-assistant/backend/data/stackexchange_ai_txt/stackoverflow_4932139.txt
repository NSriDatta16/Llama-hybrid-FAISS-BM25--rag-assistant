I had a related requirement. I only wanted to process a specific job once within a few minutes, but the producer could queue several instances of the same job. I used memcache to store the job identifier and set the expiry of the key to just a few minutes. When a worker tried to add the job identifier to memcache, only the first would succeed - on failure to add the job id, the worker would delete the job. After a few minutes, the key expires from memcache and the job can be processed again. Not particularly elegant, but it works.
