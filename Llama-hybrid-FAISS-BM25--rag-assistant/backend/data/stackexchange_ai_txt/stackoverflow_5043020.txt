presence control in asp.net web applications

I've managed to implement the Name.NameCtrl.1 active x used in sharepoint in my own custom built apps for presence. All is working fine and I'm updating presence status correctly based on a users status on Office Comunication Server. However I'm not getting any other details on the user propulated in the presence control like it does in SharePoint. All I get is the sip address in the email field (rather than the real default email address in AD) and a link to schedule a meeting. Can anyone tell me how to get the control to populate with details from AD (dept, email, phone etc) like it does in sharepoint?? Also I don't get an organization tab in the control like sharepoint. Any ideas? Thanks, Keeney
