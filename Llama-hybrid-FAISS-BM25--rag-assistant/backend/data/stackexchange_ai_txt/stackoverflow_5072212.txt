Help with a jQuery scrollable plugin

I have come across an interesting code example that allows me to make DIV elements scrollable using jQuery (UI), which can be found here: http://www.simonbattersby.com/demos/vertical_scrollbar_demo.htm I have subsequently turned it into a plugin to make it easier to use and more reusable. It's working 99% but there is one small bug - for some reason when I CLICK the scrollbar it doesn't scroll the DIV element. If I use the mousewheel it works fine, but for some reason the click and drag doesn't work. The code I am working on is here: http://jsfiddle.net/mitchmalone/XRnxL/2/
