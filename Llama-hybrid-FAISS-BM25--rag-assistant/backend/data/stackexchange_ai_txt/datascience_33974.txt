Chat Bot Answering based on Data Corpus Self-Training

I have created a very simple chat bot based on RASA NLU. In this case, I manually create some sample input text and create a model for using it against unknown source of input. It's fine for now. As my next step of learning, I want to do use a big documnet as source for my chat bot. What steps should I do to make the program train automatically on the documnet text corpus and able to answer based on the user query? I want to avoid the manual training. For this NLU problem statement, what libraries can I use? Almost all internet sources talk about SQuaD models. How they are related to a custom domain training? Any blogs, tutorials, libs that can help me to do this will be useful. Some other related questions but without solid answers: Build knowledge bot using deep learning
