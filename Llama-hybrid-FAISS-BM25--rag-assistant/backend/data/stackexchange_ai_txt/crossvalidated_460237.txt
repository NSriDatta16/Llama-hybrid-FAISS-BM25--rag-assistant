Yes, it's not obvious, but this is not limited to SVMs. Assuming we have a convex primal problem, the dual problem's objective function is naturally concave. It's probably why your source takes it as granted. Reiterating page 2 of this notes , we can write the general Lagrangian equation as follows: $$L(x,\lambda,v)=f_0(x)+\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i f_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^pv_ih_i(x)$$ where $m$ is the number of inequality constraints, and $p$ is the number of equality constraints (we don't have this in SVM formulation by the way, so simplifying a bit below). The dual function is the infimum of the Lagrangian over the feasible set of $x$ , $\mathcal D$ , i.e. $$g(\lambda)=\inf_{x\in \mathcal D} L(x,\lambda)$$ The Lagrangian is an affine function of $\lambda$ , i.e. $L(x,\lambda)=A(x)\lambda+b(x)$ and we're taking the pointwise infimum (i.e. fix $\lambda$ and take the infimum of the function values wrt $x$ in the feasible set) of this function. And, pointwise infimum of affine functions is concave .
