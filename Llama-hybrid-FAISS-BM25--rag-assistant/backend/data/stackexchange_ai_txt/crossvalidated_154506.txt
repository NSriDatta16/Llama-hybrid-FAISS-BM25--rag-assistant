It seems to me that if you have a common set of exogenous inputs, you should be able to define the dependence of any time series on any input. That will only work if you have a lot of data. In econometrics that's not the case. For instance, if you have 10 variables, one lag and 15 exogenous inputs, you're talking about 10x(10+15)=250 coefficients and 10(10-1)/2=45 correlations, i.e. 295 parameters. That's a lot to estimate reliably. It's even more difficult to interpret. That's why you try to sparse the matrices as much as possible. Not using every exogenous variable for every dependent variable equation is one way to proceed.
