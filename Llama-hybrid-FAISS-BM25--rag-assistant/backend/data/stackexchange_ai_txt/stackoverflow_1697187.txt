Obstacle warning systems

Which is the best algorithm to design an obstacle avoidance system with an underlying predictive logic ? I am using a system of microwave radars which gives the coordinates and velocities of various obstacles. Based on these inputs an algorithm should identify the most critical obstacles and warn to the driver of car / aircraft. The main point of concern is the prediction part. The system should not only identify present obstacles but also look for future collisions based on the velocity components. Which are the possible strategies to explore (Kalman, extended Kalman, Neural Networks, evolutionary algorithms)
