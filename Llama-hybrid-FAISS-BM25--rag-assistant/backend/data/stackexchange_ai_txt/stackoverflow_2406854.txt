How about something along these lines? (more of an idea/suggestion than an implementation, because I don't know your object model) var parties = xmlDoc.Descendants("Party"); foreach(var party in parties) { int partyTypeCode = party.Element("PartyTypeCode").Value; if(partyTypeCode == 1) { var person = personFactory.Build(party); // do something } else if(partyTypeCode == 2) { var organization = companyFactory.Build(party); // do something } } In a perfectly polymorphic world, you'd just have a PartyFactory and no if or switch statements, but a person party and a company party are quite different.
