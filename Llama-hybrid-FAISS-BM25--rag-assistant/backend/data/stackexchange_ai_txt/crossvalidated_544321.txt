Yes. I have used both, and these days I only use R. I am going to extend the scope of my answer by providing a quick and dirty comparison of the capabilities of PRIMER v7, CANOCO5, PAST, and R for multivariate analysis: Things PRIMER v7 can do that I can do in R: calculation of distance matrices according to various metrics, ANOSIM test, SIMPER, MDS and PCA ordinations, cluster analysis, diversity curves, PERMANOVA. Things PRIMER v7 can do that I have never done in R: SIMPROF, BEST, Bio-Env, BVStep, LINKTREE, RELATE, 2STAGE, MVDISP, DIVERSE, TAXDTEST. It may be possible to perform these tests in R, I just don't know. Things CANOCO5 can do that can be done in R: all of them, as far as I can see. Multivariate analyses that PAST can do that can also be done in R: all of them, with the possible exception of seriation. Generally speaking, in the context of multivariate statistical analyses, R allows to perform all the ordination approaches you can dream of, visualisation of multivariate data, and statistical testing of the correlation between changes in multivariate biological information and environmental variables. Package vegan is the staple for this kind of analyses, but there are others. See here for further detail.
