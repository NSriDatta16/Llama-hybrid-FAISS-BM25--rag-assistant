How to know whether i have clicked the particular link in the next page

I have created certain links using a for loop in PHP. foreach($storage as $val) { if($val!="") { echo "$val"; echo " Link "; } } Page will look like content1 Link to b.html content2 Link to b.html content3 Link to b.html content4 Link to b.html ... ... In the next page I want to retrieve the correct content based on the link clicked. Example: If I click the second link the content to be retrieved is "content2". How can I accomplish this?
