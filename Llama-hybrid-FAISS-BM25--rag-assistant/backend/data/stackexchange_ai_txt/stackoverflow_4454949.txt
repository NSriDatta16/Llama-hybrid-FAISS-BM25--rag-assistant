I recommend a couple of things: You can create a copy of the HTML when it's empty - that way you save yourself having to clone something with values already in and needing to clear them. Just clone the empty one you already have. You've also set the live on the question, but it's the 'Add an answer' button that you'd want to use live for. Live will set the handlers for anything that's added to the DOM (which you're doing). This is the reason every 'Add an answer' button except your first doesn't work. var emptyQ = $("li.question").clone(), emptyA = $("li.answer").clone(); $("#addQuestion").live('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#questioncontainer').append(emptyQ.clone()); }); $(".addAnswer").live('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).parent().find(".answerContainer").append(emptyA.clone()); }); Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/jonathon/Sd9Ag/ I use $(this).parent() to get the question/answer container for the button that was clicked. This means the same handler works for all. And finally - I don't know if it makes a difference, but I use e.preventDefault() instead of return false on the click handlers. I don't know - I just think it's more elegant.
