Irregular time series with multiple sampling sites

I have a dataset of marine debris items (number of items standardized per effort: Items/(number of volunteers * Hours * Length)) taken from 2 main locations (WA and Queensland) in Australia (8 Sub Sites in total: 4 in WA and 4 in Queensland) at irregular sampling intervals over a period 15 years. I want to test if there is a change over the years on the amount of debris in these locations and more specifically a change after the implementation of a mitigation strategy (in 2013). Hereâ€™s the head of the data: Description of each one of the varables in the dataframe: eventid = each sampling (clean-up) event Location = Queensland and New South Wales Sites = all the 9 sampling beaches Date = specific dates for the clean-up events (day-month-year) Date1 = specific dates for the clean-up events (day-month-year) on the POSICXT format Year= Year of sampling event (2004 to 2018) Month= Month of the sampling event (jan to dec) nMonth= a number was determined to the respective month of the sampling event (1 to 12) Day= Day of sampling (1 to 31) Days = Days since the first date of clean up = just another way of using the dates MARPOL = before and after implementation (factor with 2 levels) DaysC = days between sampling events for the same sites = number of days since the previous clean-up event DaysI = Days since intervention, all the dates before implementation are zero, and after we count the number of days since the implementation date (1 jan 2013) DaysIa= same as DayI but instead of zero for before the intervention we have negative values (days) Items = number of fishing and shipping items counted in each clean-up event Hours = hours spent by all volunteers together at each clean up event Lenght = Lenght of beach sampled by all volunteers together at each clean up event volunteers = all volunteers at each clean up event HoursVolunteer = hours spent bt each volunteer at each clean up event (Hours/volunteers) Ieffort = the items standarized by the effort (hours, volunteers and lenght) GrossWeight = total weight of the all the items found (not just fishing and shipping debris) GrossTotal = total amount of the all the items found (not just fishing and shipping debris) Problems: My data has a few problems: I think I will need to fix the effects of seasonal variation (Monthly) and . of possible spatial correlation (probability of finding an item is higher after finding one since they can come from the same ship). How do I handle the fact that the measurements were not taken at a regular interval? I was trying to use GAMs to analyse the data and see the trends over time. The model I came across is the following: m4 How can I handle the fact that the measurements were not taken at a regular interval, the seasonality and the possible spatial correlation? Am I on the right track?
