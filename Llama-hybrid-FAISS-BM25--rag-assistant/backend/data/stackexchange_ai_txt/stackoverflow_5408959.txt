I am facing a similar problem with a JNLP program. The only way I found to debug the program is by debugging into Eclipse (I have the project and the code source) and copy-pasting all parameters passed by the JNLP file in the Arguments tab into Debug configuration in Eclipse. I don't know if this is related because my problem came from the arguments passed to the application through JNLP file. I don't understand something... Why you want to debug directly on the compiled code from the final location?
