It is well known that the distribution of $P_{\rm mid}$ more closely approximates a uniform distribution than that of $P$. $P$ is obviously always slightly larger than $P_{\rm mid}$. If $X=x$, then the difference between the two p-values is $$P-P_{\rm mid}=P(X=x)/2$$ On average this is $$E(P-P_{\rm mid})=\frac12 \sum_x P(X=x)^2.$$ In general, if $X$ can take on many possible distinct values, so that $\max_x P(X=x)$ becomes small, then $E(P-P_{\rm mid})$ will also be small. If $P(X=x)$ is a decreasing function of $x$, as it usually is for $x$ sufficiently large, then $P-P_{\rm mid}$ will also decrease with $x$.
