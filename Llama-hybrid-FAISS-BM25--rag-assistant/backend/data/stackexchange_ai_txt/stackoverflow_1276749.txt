.NET IO redirection - read output char by char

I am launching another process from by C# application, and came to a problem: is there any way to read process output char-by-char, not line-by-line? I desperately need that because the other process is a command-line engine, and I need to send a command to it, read output and somehow understand when it is done. The way it indicates that is to write a prompt WITHOUT a newline, so I have no chance to ever capture that. Using fragile timer stuff now, and looking for a better solution. C# Process API as outlined in MSDN and other places only allows for line-by-line input - even in async way.
