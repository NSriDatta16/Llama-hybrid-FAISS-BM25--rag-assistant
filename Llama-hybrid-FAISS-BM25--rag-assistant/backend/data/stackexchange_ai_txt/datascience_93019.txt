Addressing polysemy in NLP tasks

Looking for modern algorithms using NN Language Model implementations addressing polysemy in NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering and topic modeling. Transfer/Zero-short learning methods are most interesting to find. Any working solutions with BERT and Hugging Face Transformers libraries?
