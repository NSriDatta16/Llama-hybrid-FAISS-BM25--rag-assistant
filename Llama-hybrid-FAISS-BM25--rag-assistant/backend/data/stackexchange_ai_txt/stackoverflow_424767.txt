I need the most recent (as of a given date) location for an organization and name of an organization taken into consideration. Not just all prior to the date. For example, take the U.S. President Elect Obama. In this example there are 3 locations: his house, the Hay-Adams Hotel, and the White House. He also has gone by 3 titles in the past couple months: Senator Obama, President Elect Obama, and soon to be President Obama. If you were to pass in the date "1/1/2008" into this query, you should get back all 3 locations, with "Senator Obama" (the organization_name) falling within his "house" (the organization_location) and the other two locations should have no "organizations" within them using our sample. If you were to pass in the date of "12/1/2008", he was still technically living at his home but he then had the title of "President Elect Obama" so the results would reflect that. If you were to pass in today's date, his name would still be "President Elect Obama" but his location changed to the "Hay-Adams Hotel". If you pass in any date after "1/20/2009", his title will be "President Obama" and his location will be "The Whitehouse". I hope that made some sense, even if you have no interest in politics or aren't from the U.S.. I need the results to show me where everything was at and what everything was called at a given point in time.
