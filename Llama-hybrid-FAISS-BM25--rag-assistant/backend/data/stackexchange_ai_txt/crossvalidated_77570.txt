How to set $\nu$ parameter for one-class SVM?

I am trying to perform one-class SVM for novelty detection, so I use cross-validation to find the best $\nu$ parameter, but I found that usually I got a big parameter $\nu$, resulting in a big false positive rate. How to set and find the $\nu$ parameter for a one-class SVM?
