Every Statistical tool has its own limitations and we have to know them before we could start our analysis. Bayesian allow us to compute the probability of our hypothesis given data yet we need to know the prior probability and the total probability given our models are true and also the likelihood that we know our models beforehand which in most of the scientific studies we don't. So people guess prior probabilities and their likely models before they start their scientific studies which could lead to wrong results.
