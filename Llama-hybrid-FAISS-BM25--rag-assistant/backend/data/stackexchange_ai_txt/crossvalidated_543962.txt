On average what is the norm of a sample from a multivariate normal distribution?

Problem Suppose I sample a multivariate standard normal sample $x \sim N(0, I_d)$ where $d \geq 1$ is the dimension. What is the expected value of the norm of $x$ $$ \mathbb{E}[\|x\|] = ? $$ Using python, I have sampled 100k samples in $2$ and $5$ dimensions and obtained an average of $1.255$ and $2.125$ respectively. Of course this number depends on the dimensionality. Bonus Problem Futher question: how does this change for $x\sim N(\mu, \Sigma)$ ? Solution Attempt $$ \mathbb{E}[\|x\|] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \|x\| (2\pi)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2} \|x\|^2\right\} dx $$
