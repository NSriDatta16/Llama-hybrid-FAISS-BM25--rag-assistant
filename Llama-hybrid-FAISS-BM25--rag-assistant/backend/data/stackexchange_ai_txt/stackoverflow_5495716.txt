TFS Build 2010 how do I call an Ant script and/or build flash

In TFS 2010 build, I have a new build and I want to call an ant script that builds Flash. How do I call the ant script? Also How can I compile the Flash directly? I've seen the Power Tools and this question but it doesn't help me as we don't have TFS 2008. I can't find any documentation on how to use the power tools except the 1 sentence on the bottom of download page saying to create your build the old way and import it (which isn't very helpful). I've installed the power tools on the agent computer but I don't see any new options in the Toolbox when I'm designing the build flow. So yeah, i'm stumped :(
