If the state $j$ is recurrent for the Markov chain $(X_t)$, $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_{jj}^n = \infty$$is equivalent to [in the sense that the lhs is the same] $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \mathbb{P} (X_n=j|X_0=j) = \infty$$and to$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \mathbb{E} [\mathbb{I}(X_n=j)|X_0=j]= \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \mathbb{I}(X_n=j)\Big|X_0=j\right]=\infty$$which means the number of visits of state $j$ when starting from $j$ is on average infinite. (The state is Harris recurrent if the number of visits of state $j$ when starting from $j$ is almost surely infinite. The Markov chain is recurrent if there exists one recurrent state and if the chain is irreducible.) The statement in the OP question the probability of ever returning to the state j is the sum of the transition probabilities of returning to state j from j where n=1,2,......âˆž.These probabilities are the probabilities of mutually [exclusive] events. is thus incorrect. Returns at times $n$ and $m$ are not exclusive events.
