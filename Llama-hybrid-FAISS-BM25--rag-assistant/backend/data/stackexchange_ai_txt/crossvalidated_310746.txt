20 plants in 8 pots are few plants and a lot of pots. This is not likely to bring a $p If that does not work, change to Baysian for this time. In Frequentist statistics, when $p > \alpha$, nothing is gained whilst in Baysian, you at least gain some information about the true rate of dead plants in small pots. Given, that there is a handy conjugate prior for the Binomial distribution, this comes easy with no need to learn any new software: $Beta(1, 1)$ is a flat prior. If you find 3 living plants and 1 dead plant in a pot, the posterior probability distribution of the survival chance of each plant is $Beta(1+3, 1+1) = Beta(4,2)$. All these beta-Distributions will give you and your wive a good basis to argue upon data, instead of a $p$-value that is basically useless, if not smaller than $\alpha$. Here is an easy example that may take you even a bit further: https://lingpipe-blog.com/2009/10/13/bayesian-counterpart-to-fisher-exact-test-on-contingency-tables/
