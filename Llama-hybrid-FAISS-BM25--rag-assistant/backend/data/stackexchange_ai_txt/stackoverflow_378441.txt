How to speak SSL from a Windows MFC client?

I've an MFC application that currently uses CAtlHttpClient to query a web server for some information. I'd like to change this so that the query goes over securely, with server authentication, using SSL. Googling reveals that Microsoft has changed the way they support this several times, e.g., WinInet, WinHTTP, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to do the above using MFC under MSVS 2005. The application is in C++, and if at all possible, I'd like to avoid dragging .Net into the picture. Any help, hints, suggestions or pointers gratefully appreciated! Thanks, ony
