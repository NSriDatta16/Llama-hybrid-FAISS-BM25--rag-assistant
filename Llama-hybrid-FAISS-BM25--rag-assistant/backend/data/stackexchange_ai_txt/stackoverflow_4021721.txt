Facebook encourages using old REST API for Canvas app, but seems like there is no PHP SDK for it any where?

On page http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/ , it says Note: We are currently in the process upgrading our core server API from the old REST API to the more modern Graph API. Most of the methods required for canvas applications to integrate with Facebook have not yet been upgraded to the new API. For the time being, we recommend you continue using the old REST API in canvas apps instead of the new APIs for the sake of completeness. But the only available PHP SDK I have seen is http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk but it uses getSession() and api('/me') , so it looks like it is the Graph API. The REST Api I remember actually had require_login() but that SDK is no where to be found. Does someone know what is going on?
