I think it also depends on how aggressive your compression is vs how IO bound you are. For example, DB2's row compression feature is targeted for IO bound application: data warehouses, reporting systems, etc. It uses a dictionary-based algorithm and isn't very aggressive - resulting in 50-80% compression of data (tables, indexes in storage as well as when in memory). However - it also tends to speed queries up by around 10%. They could have gone with much more aggressive compression, but then would have taken a performance hit.
