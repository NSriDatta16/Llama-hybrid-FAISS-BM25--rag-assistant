Law of total expecation/tower rule: Why must both random variables come from the same probability space?

I quote (emphasis mine) from the wikipedia definition : The proposition in probability theory known as the law of total expectation, ..., states that if X is an integrable random variable (i.e., a random variable satisfying E( | X | ) on the same probability space , then $$\operatorname{E}(X) = \operatorname{E} ( \operatorname{E} ( X \mid Y))$$ I don't understand what they mean by the same probability space, and do not know why this is an important part of the definition. Take the example further down on the page: Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory X's bulbs work for an average of 5000 hours, whereas factory Y's bulbs work for an average of 4000 hours. It is known that factory X supplies 60% of the total bulbs available. What is the expected length of time that a purchased bulb will work for? The random variables here seem to be: The amount of time a light bulb lasts for. Which factory a light bulb comes from. How can these two have the same probability space?
