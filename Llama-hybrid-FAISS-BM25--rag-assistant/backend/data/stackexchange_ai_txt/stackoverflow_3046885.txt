a more elegant way of doing this exists. I do not know how BOOST implements that, but traditional way is by feeding input string character by character into a FSM which detects where tokens (words, symbols) start and end. I can do that with two loops and find_first_of(":") and ("{") One loop with std::find_first_of() should suffice. Though I'm still a huge fan of FSMs for such parsing tasks. P.S. Similar question
