Your data is white noise: rnorm(100*2,mean=123,sd=3) There is no trend, no seasonality, no autoregressive or moving average behavior, no conditional heteroskedasticity, no nothing. Under these circumstances, there are no dynamics you can model. A flat line can be shown to be the optimal forecast for typical loss functions - for instance, it will minimize the expected Mean Squared Error (MSE). More specifically, the optimal forecast is the flat line given by the overall historical mean, because this one has minimum variance, better than, say, the random walk. All your forecasts are consistent with this. Three methods (naive, mean, random walk) explicitly will give flat forecasts with different values. ARIMA could in principle give nonconstant forecasts, but it correctly decides on an ARIMA(0,0,0) model with non-zero mean, that is, the historical mean. Similarly, ETS thinks an (A,N,N) model is best: additive error, no trend, no seasonality - again a flat line. I'd encourage you to play around a bit. Simulate lots of data like you did. Then fit different models to it, and force the models to be nonconstant (e.g., by specifying nonconstant ARIMA and ETS models). Compare MSEs on holdout samples. You should find that the simple mean should outperform the more complex models. This is related, though in the context of real, not simulated, data: Is it unusual for MEAN to outperform ARIMA?
