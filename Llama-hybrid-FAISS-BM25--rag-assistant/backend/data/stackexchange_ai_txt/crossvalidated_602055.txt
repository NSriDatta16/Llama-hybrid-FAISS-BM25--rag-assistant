These questions can all be answered just by looking at the picture. The only numerical result you need to know is that the variance of a Uniform distribution of length $1/2$ is $1/48.$ This can be computed by noting the variance does not depend on the location of the distribution and therefore is the variance of a Uniform distribution on the zero-centered interval $[-1/4,1/4],$ where it equals $$\int_{-1/4}^{1/4}x^2\,\mathrm dx = \frac{x^3}{3}\bigg|_{-1/4}^{1/4} = \frac{1}{48}.$$ Computation isn't really needed: if you have committed to memory the variance of a unit Uniform distribution, which is $1/12,$ simply observe this distribution has been scaled by a factor of $1/2,$ whence its variance is $(1/2)^2$ = one-quarter of $1/12.$ a. The shaded region along with its rotation by 180 degrees (shown in orange) partition the unit square, showing the original area is half the area of the square, or $1/2.$ Therefore $c = 1/(1/2) = 2$ to make the total probability equal to $1.$ ("Partition" isn't quite correct, because there may be some overlap along the boundaries of the two pieces: but because the boundaries have no area, they have no probability and this overlap doesn't matter.) b. Consider the marginal of $y.$ This is the total probability of $x$ for each $y$ (within an infinitesimal neighborhood of $y$ : this form of reasoning is explained more generally in my post at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/584907/919 ). We may shift some of the probability horizontally without changing either $y$ or the total probability conditional on $y.$ The result upon shifting two triangular pieces, as shown, is a rectangle. Its horizontal cross-sections are all the same length, showing the total probability does not change with $y.$ Therefore the marginal is uniform. The marginal of $x$ must be uniform, too, because the original picture with $x$ and $y$ interchanged is the same. c. The conditional expectation is the average position of $x$ for any given $y.$ For $y=1/4,$ $x$ is uniformly distributed between $1/4$ and $3/4,$ as shown in the yellow region. Therefore its average position is $1/2$ and its variance is that of that uniform distribution, equal to $1/48.$ d. Finally, the conditional distribution of $x$ when $y=3/4$ is found in the same way as in (c). The picture clearly shows it is uniform on the union of the intervals $[0,1/4]\cup[3/4,1].$
