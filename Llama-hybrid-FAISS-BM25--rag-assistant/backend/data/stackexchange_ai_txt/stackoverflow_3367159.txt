From The C Book : If a declaration contains the extern storage class specifier, or is the declaration of a function with no storage class specifier (or both), then: If there is already a visible declaration of that identifier with file scope, the resulting linkage is the same as that of the visible declaration; otherwise the result is external linkage. So if this is the only time it's declared in the translation unit, it will have external linkage.
