Typically one uses sql-loader to Unload and Load the table. However, see Tom Kyte's articles on table reloading and unbalanced indexes for their side-effects. An index-organized table is a two-edged sword: yes, it puts the table data in the same block as the (primary key) index, thereby avoiding 1 disk I/O. It also means that the amount of data to be read to access that table goes up whenever it needs to be accessed in any other order. The best purposes for an IOT is as a lookup-table, or validation-table, where there is little additional information beyond the key value.
