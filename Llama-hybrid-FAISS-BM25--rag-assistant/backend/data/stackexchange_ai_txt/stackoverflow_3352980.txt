This code fragment proves that DateTime.Parse uses Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture regardless of the fact that the "InvariantCulture" is being passed in I'm not sure how this example proves that. The strings passed to DateTime.Parse are different, so it's not completely surprising that different results ensue. The first string has the time formatted as 23.59.59 , which (apparently) InvariantCulture cannot parse; the second string has the time formatted as 23:59:59 , which InvariantCulture can parse. What's the problem? edit to add, since apparently it makes a difference, I am running with .NET 2.0 and the strings produced by fo-FO and en-US are respectively 9999-12-31T23.59.59Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z
