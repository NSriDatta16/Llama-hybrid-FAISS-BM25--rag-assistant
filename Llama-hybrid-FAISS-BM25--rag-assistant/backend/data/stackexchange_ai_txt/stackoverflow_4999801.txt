Organizing a site Admin section - User section MVC

I’m building a site with ASP.NET MVC3 and would like you input on what’s the best approach to organizing the site’s sections. Is it better to have a different project for the admin part? So it could be available like admin.example.com. Or maybe just use some routing so the admin controllers go to www.example.com/admin/controller (using the Area feature)? Any thoughts? Are there any security implications to take into account? Thanks!
