PHP Sessions - checking pevious IP on every page load - To do, or alternatives?

Right now I have this implemented in my Dev environment: I store the $SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] as a session variable upon login, then recheck the page every page load for the same IP address. The more I read, I see that many people don't like this idea because of proxy's etc... So, what are some other options that can still be good practce? I was thinking about USER AGENT - but any joe-blow can fake that with a simple firefox plugin. That said, at least it would take a good guess from an attacker to successfully pick the right one on the first try... What do people think? I'd love to simply just change out the text: 'SERVER_ADDR' with something else - all the other code can remain as is. Thanks. EDIT: I guess my main goal here is to prevent hijacking/fixation. An IP check would in theory ensure that the user remains the user at all times (well, unless somebody's spoofing the IP also...) - but the session is basically saved to an IP address in this manor...
