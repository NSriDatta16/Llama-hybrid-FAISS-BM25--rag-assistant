My proceed to checkout button is missing, what steps can I take to diagnose?

When I am in the shopping cart "proceed to checkout" button is missing and I can't go any further in the checkout process. I looked at cart.phtml and $methodHtml is empty so the comparison ( if ($methodHtml = $this->getMethodHtml($method)) )to find checkout methods never shows the button. I am wondering if anyone might know how I can track down what might be wrong with Magento. Onestepcheckout is installed but even when disabled it makes no difference.
