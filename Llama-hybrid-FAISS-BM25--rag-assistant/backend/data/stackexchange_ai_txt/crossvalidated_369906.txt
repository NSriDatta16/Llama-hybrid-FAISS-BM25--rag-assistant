Confidence intervals for emmeans estimates after multilevel binary logistic regression

I ran a multilevel binary logistic regression / generalized linear mixed-effects model in R, and then ran the following code to get post-hoc tests for a significant A x B interaction where A is a binary variable and B has 4 categories. emms I got the following output: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value 0 - 1,X - 0 - 1,Y 1.2841638 0.4307531 Inf 2.981 0.0152 0 - 1,X - 0 - 1,Z 0.7205958 0.4547173 Inf 1.585 0.3873 0 - 1,X - 0 - 1,Q 0.6951286 0.4497946 Inf 1.545 0.4103 0 - 1,Y - 0 - 1,Z -0.5635680 0.3647502 Inf -1.545 0.4105 0 - 1,Y - 0 - 1,Q -0.5890352 0.3605842 Inf -1.634 0.3597 0 - 1,Z - 0 - 1,Q -0.0254672 0.3908556 Inf -0.065 0.9999 I tried to get confidence intervals for the X v Y estimate ( 1.2841638 ) but failed. Is it okay to do it this way? lower_bound Is it okay to report this? I'm reporting the confint() results for most other parameters (terms that come out of the model, and not out of emmeans post-hoc stuff) and I know that looks at slightly different confidence intervals, but I'm not sure how to get those a) manually or b) with a function out of this emmeans object.
