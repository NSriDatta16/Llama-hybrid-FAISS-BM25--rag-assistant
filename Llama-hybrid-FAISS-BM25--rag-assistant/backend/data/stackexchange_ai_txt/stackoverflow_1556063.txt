WinForms Dynamic Localization

We have CAB (Composite Application Block) based smart client winform application. One of our software requirement is to replacing the text dynamically when the user change the language option provided in our application. We support around 6 languages including east-asian(Chinese/Japanese), European Languages(Russion, spanish, English, dutch). After understanding some deep level into localization, I got to know that localization is more than just replacing the text dynamically. I found that Windows controls are created based on localized resource option. IT has formatting, validation sort of feature. Is it recommended to localize the text dynamically without closing the forms/views? Or Should be restart the application? Or close the form and reopen the form Why should not encourage dynamic language change?
