How to calculate the next year's January hourly forward prices for an asset given the historical hourly prices?

I have an exercise given to me during the recruitment process which asks to calculate the next year's January hourly forward prices for an asset given the historical hourly prices of that asset and next year's January average price (average of all hours in that period). The exercise asks to take account of the seasonality (modelling seasonality), hence there is a 9 year hourly price dataset given. I have studied statistics and econometrics at school but have forgotten most of the techniques that could be used for price estimation. Any idea how this exercise can be solved? I can provide a sample dataset on request.
