You could calculate the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to check for multicollinearity. You can do that by using linear regression instead of logistic regression. Apply Multiple Linear Regression with the same independent variables x1, x2, x3 and x123. Then, calculate the VIFs. This will give you some insight into whether your model might suffer from multicollinearity. If the VIF is high (greater than 5), your logistic regression will probably suffer from the same problem.
