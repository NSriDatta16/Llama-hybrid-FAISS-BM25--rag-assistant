How to do post-hoc contrasts on within factor depending on certain between groups in SPSS?

Here are my experimental factors: within-factor (two levels): time1, time2. between factor (four levels): 4 groups. I want to test specific post-hoc contrasts comparing: group1: time1 vs. time2 group2: time1 vs. time2 group3: time1 vs. time2 group4: time1 vs. time2 to determine if and which group the time factor affects. SPSS only provides an overall within effect for time averaging 4 groups. Moreover, SPSS only provides post-hoc contrasts for the between groups averaging time How can I do my specific contrasts?
