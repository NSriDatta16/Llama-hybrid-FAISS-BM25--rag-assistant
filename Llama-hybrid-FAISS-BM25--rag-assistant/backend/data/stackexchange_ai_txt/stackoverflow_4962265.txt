Ubuntu + PBS + Apache? How can I show a list of running jobs as a website?

Is there a plugin/package to display status information for a PBS queue? I am currently running an apache webserver on the login-node of my PBS cluster. I would like to display status info and have the ability to perform minimal queries without writing it from scratch (or modifying an age old python script, ala jobmonarch). Note, the accepted/bountied solution must work with Ubuntu. Update: In addition to ganglia as noted below, I also looked that the Rocks Cluster Toolkit , but I firmly want to stay with Ubuntu. So I've updated the question to reflect that. Update 2: I've also looked at PBSWeb as well as MyPBS neither one appears to suit my needs. The first is too out-of-date with the current system and the second is more focused on cost estimation and project budgeting. They're both nice, but I'm more interested in resource availability, job completion, and general status updates. So I'm probably just going to write my own from scratch -- starting Aug 15th.
