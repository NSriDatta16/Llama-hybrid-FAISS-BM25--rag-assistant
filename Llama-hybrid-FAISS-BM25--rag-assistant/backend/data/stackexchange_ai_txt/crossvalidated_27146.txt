Pitfalls in time series analysis

I am just starting out self-learning in time series analysis. I have noticed that there are a number of potential pitfalls that are not applicable to general statistics. So, building on What are common statistical sins? , I would like to ask: What are common pitfalls or statistical sins in time series analysis? This is intended as a community wiki, one concept per answer, and please, no repetition of more general statistical pitfalls that are (or should be) listed at What are common statistical sins?
