How to Hide Specific Part of Flash Object Using CSS?

I'm embedding a flash music player from Soundclick into my music website. I have a fixed space where the player is to be placed. The problem is that the players the site offers are too big. The bottom portion of the flash player is all I need to be shown. Is there a way hide this using the overflow:hidden; method? What I've tried so far: I placed the embed code into a div container and used the "overflow:hidden;" method, then set a fixed width and height. It works partially, but only displays the top half. Which is useless because the bottom half is where the playlist and the buttons are located.
