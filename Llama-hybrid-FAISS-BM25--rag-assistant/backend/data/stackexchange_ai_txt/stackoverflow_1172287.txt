You could always implement your text lookup on a separate thread -- it might not offer suggestions as often, but it at least wouldn't block. If you do this, make sure to "remember" the text the lookup is based on -- then, if the text in the UISearchBar no longer matches it, throw out the results you had -- the will no longer apply. Example: The user has typed "bri". Tour lookup determines that possible suggestions are "bridle", "bridge", "bride" and "brigand". If by the time your lookup returns the user has added a 'd', you don't want to suggest "brigand" any more. You don't necessarily have to throw out the whole list, but you want to at least remove the items that no longer work.
