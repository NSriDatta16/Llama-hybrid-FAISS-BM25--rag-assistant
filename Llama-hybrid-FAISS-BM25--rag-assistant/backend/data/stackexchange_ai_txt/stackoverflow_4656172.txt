I had a chance to use both. Personally I found it difficult to customize the GWT build-in component compare to Flex. I could be wrong because I didn't create any customized GWT component while I used GWT. On the other hand creating custom component in Flex is considerably easy. GWT MVP 2.0 supports browser history handling in easy way, so you can use the browser forward and backward button to navigate your visited pages which is not available in Flex. When I use Spring Roo to generate the GWT as well as Flex clients. The code for GWT is much more verbose than Flex counterpart and difficult to modified and extends. With Flex and Spring Roo for the server side, I can spend more time to decorate the UI. There are more choices for client-side framework to organize the code in Flex such as Mate, Parsely etc. Don't get me wrong, GWT MVP is also a good framework. It's up to you to decide.
