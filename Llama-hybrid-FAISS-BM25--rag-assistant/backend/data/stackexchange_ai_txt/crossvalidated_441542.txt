How to interpret the results from logistic regression?

I have a binary variable y, and categorical variables $x1$ , $x2$ , $x3$ , and $x4$ . I conducted a series of logistic regressions y ~ x1, # (getting crude OR) y ~ x1+x2, y ~ x1+x3, y ~ x1+x4, y ~ x1+x2+x3, Results are below Crude ORs monotonically increase as shown in column 2, ORs adjusted for $x2$ monotonically increase as shown in column 3, ORs adjusted for $x3$ monotonically increase as shown in column 4, But ORs adjusted for $x2$ and $x3$ monotonically increase until $x1=4$ , then had a dip for $x1=5$ , as shown in column 6, ORs adjusted for $x4$ monotonically increase until $x1=4$ , then had a dip for $x1=5$ , as shown in column 5, How to interpret why there was a dip for $x_1=5$ when adjusted for $x_4$ or adjusted for $x2+x3$ ? please see below for ORs with standard error (SE)
