Sampling from Wishart distributions with scalar degrees of freedom $(\upsilon>p-1)$

Let $\upsilon$ be the degrees of freedom of a Wishart distribution and $p$ the dimensions of its scale matrix. If the degrees of freedom is a scalar , then its range is: $$ \upsilon > pâˆ’1 $$ and if it is an integer : $$ \upsilon \geq p $$ Is there a library or some code that works for the scalar case? Libraries I have checked on : R . Neither of these packages work: library(bayesm) library(stats) library(MCMCpack) bayesm::rwishart(2.5, diag(3)) stats::rWishart(1, 2.5, diag(3)) MCMCpack::rwish(2.5, diag(3)) Python : PyMC (see rwish function) SciPy (see rwishart function) Matlab : This is a python version of the Matlab implementation (I think) which accepts this case but that can draw singular matrices. I tried, for instance, to change scipy function so that it accepts $dof>p-1$ but then it generates non positive-semidefinite matrices.
