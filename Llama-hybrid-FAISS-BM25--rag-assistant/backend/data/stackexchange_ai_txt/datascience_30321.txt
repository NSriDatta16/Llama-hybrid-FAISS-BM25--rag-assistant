Good question and welcome to Datascience Imagine you have the tree as follows. Machine Learning Models | ---------------------------------------------------- | | Supervised Unsupervised | | - -------------------- Clustering | | Regression Classification A model is indeed a trained version of the algorithm you are chosing, regardless of whether its Regression, Classification or Clustering. The above tree is ofcourse a simplified version of all ML algorithms.
