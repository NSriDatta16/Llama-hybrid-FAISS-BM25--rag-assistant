Averaging regression coefficients for 50 regression , how to report t statistic?

I am estimating a regression like Yit = a +b1 Xit +b2 Zit +b3 Rit + e where i = 1 to 100 Now I get coefficient estimates for all 100 i, i.e. 100 values of b1, 100 values of b2 and so on. For reporting purposes I have calculated a cross-sectional average of b estimates, i.e to get one value of b1 and one vane of b2 and so on. But how do I report the t statistic for these averages I have calculated. I can see in many papers they have reported the cross-sectional average as I am calculating, but with this average, they report the t statistic too, I am confused how to calculate that t statistic. should I average the individual t statistic too?? Any help would be highly appreciated
