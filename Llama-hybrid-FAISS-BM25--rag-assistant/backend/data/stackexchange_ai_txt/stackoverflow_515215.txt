Look here : http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category and pleeeeeeeeeeease don't write your own! From Aaron Digulla comment (Thank you Aaron): It takes a lawyer a long time to write a license that will actually hold in court (and why would you want a license that doesn't?) Hundreds of people all over the world worked several MONTHS on GPL v3! â€“ Aaron Digulla On the other side : When you work in a company and you will use opensource, you normally can choose among the licenses that are "approved" in the company :-). a new license is normally a NO GO :-( ATTENTION to Kodisha: From the cc-site: Creative Commons licenses should not be used for software. We strongly encourage you to use one of the very good software licenses which are already available. PS : see What Open Source License to choose?
