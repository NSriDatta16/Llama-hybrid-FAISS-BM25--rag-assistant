Metaregression on meta-analysis of proportion with metaprop and metafor

[EDITED for more clarity] I performed a meta-analysis of single proportion with logit transformation, which I made using the metaprop function, with a random intercept logistic regression model as the default option in the meta package. Let's say for example that i want to meta-analyze the proportion of asymptomatic on the total number of patients, and I have a moderator: moderator So I have defined the meta-analysis object in m1. To perform a meta-regression with the moderator, I use the TE of the meta-analysis, with the following code: model1 $TE, sei=m1$ seTE, method="ML", mods = ~ moderator) Which gave me as result: tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0.0000 (SE = 0.0224) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.0011 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 0.00% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 1.00 R^2 (amount of heterogeneity accounted for): 100.00% Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 3) = 6.5458, p-val = 0.0879 Test of Moderators (coefficient 2): QM(df = 1) = 26.2205, p-val Two question are: It is correct to conduct the meta-regression like this? it won't be better to use the transformed proportion in the meta-regression model? For example with a code like this: model2 which gave me totally different result: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 5; tau^2 estimator: ML) tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0 (SE = 0.1933) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 0.00% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 1.00 R^2 (amount of heterogeneity accounted for): 0.00% Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 3) = 0.0128, p-val = 0.9996 Test of Moderators (coefficient 2): QM(df = 1) = 0.0308, p-val = 0.8607 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub intrcpt 0.0114 0.6430 0.0177 0.9859 -1.2490 1.2717 moderator 0.0444 0.2532 0.1754 0.8607 -0.4519 0.5407 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 If I exponentiate the coefficient from the first meta-regression model, I get an OR; see for example: round(exp(coef(summary(model1))[-1,c("estimate", "ci.lb", "ci.ub")]), 2) Which gave me the OR of 1.47 [95% CI 0.02-98.71] is it correct to say that "for each unit increase of moderator, the odds of bein asymptomatic increase by 47%"? Sticking with the model 1, I may need to plot the relationship between the moderator and the prevalence of asymptomatic disease. Following the instructions reported here: https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/plots:meta_analytic_scatterplot , and with a little tuning (since I have to transform the logit transformed proportions in the plot) i used this code: preds Which gave me this plot: Is that ok to represent in the plot the relationship between the moderator and the transformed proportion, even if the meta-regression was conducted with the untransformed one?
