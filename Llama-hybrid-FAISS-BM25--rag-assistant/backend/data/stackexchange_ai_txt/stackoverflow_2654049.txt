Initialize properties of custom component before creating children in flex

Say I have the following custom component: If I add it to my application like this: The result looks like: User: Mark Greeting: Hello, null It seems Flex is setting prop on my custom component after it has already initialized the child labels, so it's reliant on the property changed event to set the user label. Is there an elegant way to make Flex wait for all of my component's properties to be set before initially evaluating bindings? Note: I realize the formatProp function is trivial and could be included inline, but this is just a simplified example.
