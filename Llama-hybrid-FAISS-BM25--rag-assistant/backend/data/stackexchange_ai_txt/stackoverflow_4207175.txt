Testing if unsorted sets are disjoint in linear time. (homework problem)

Problem: Two sets A and B have n elements each. Assume that each element is an integer in the range [0, n^100]. These sets are not necessarily sorted. Show how to check whether these two sets are disjoint in O(n) time. Your algorithm should use O(n) space. My original idea for this problem was to create a hash table of set A and search this hash table for each of the elements in B. However, I'm not aware of any way to create a hash table of a data set with this range that only takes O(n) space. Should I be considering a completely different approach? UPDATE: I contacted the professor regarding this problem asking about implementing a hash table and his response was: Please note that hashing takes O(1) time for the operations only on an average. We need a worst case O(n) time algorithm for this problem. So it seems the problem is looking for a different approach...
