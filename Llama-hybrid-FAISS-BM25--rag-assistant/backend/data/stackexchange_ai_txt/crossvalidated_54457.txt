I agree the example you give is pretty innocuous but... If the agents involved (either the person dealing out the intervention or the people getting the intervention) become aware of the assignment scheme they can take advantage of it. Such self selection should be fairly obvious why it is problematic in most experimental designs. One example I am aware of in criminology goes like this; The experiment was meant to test the deterrent effect of a night in jail after a domestic dispute vs. just asking the perpetrator to leave for the night. Officers were given a booklet of sheets, and the color of the current sheet on top was meant to identify what treatment the perp. in the particular incident was supposed to receive. What ended up happening was officers intentionally disobeyed the study design, and chose a sheet based on personal preferences for what should be done to the perp. It isn't out of the extreme to suspect similar fudging of years is at least possible in your example.
