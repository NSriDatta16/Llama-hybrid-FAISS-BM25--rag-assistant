Is the pth percentile of a mixture distribution a weighted average of the pth percentiles of it's components?

Suppose Y is a mixture distribution defined as follows: If are beta distributed random variables (making Y a mixture of three beta distributions); and are the 95th percentiles of the densities of Y and X1 respectively (similarly for X2 and X3), is it necessarily true that: And does this hold for any rv's X1, X2, X3 that are defined over a positive range? Intuitively it makes sense that it does, but there may be something I haven't considered. Thanks.
