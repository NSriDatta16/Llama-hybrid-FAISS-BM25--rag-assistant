UIPickerView getting stuck between rows?

I've noticed a problem when using UIPickerView, and I'm wondering if anyone has ever encountered it before: Sometimes when scrolling one of the wheels, it gets stuck between two rows (after touches have ended), and just stays like that indefinitely. Dragging the wheel again slightly and releasing always corrects the problem, but regardless, I'm puzzled as to why this is happening in the first place. It occurs when testing both in the simulator and on an actual device. The problem isn't so much the annoyance of having to re-adjust the wheel when it gets stuck, but rather that sometimes it gets stuck when it's extremely close to selecting a row (but hasn't actually selected it) which can give the user the impression that they have chosen a given row, when really they haven't. Has this happened to anyone else, and if so, is there a way to fix it? Thanks, Chris
