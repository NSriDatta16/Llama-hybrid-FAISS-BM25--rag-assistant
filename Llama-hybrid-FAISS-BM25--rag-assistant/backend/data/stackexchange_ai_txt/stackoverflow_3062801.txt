Hibernate mapping to manage bidirectional relationship using intermediate table

I have an object hierarchy that is as follows. Party > inherited by > Organization and Person Organization > inherited by > Customer, Vendor Person > inherited by > Contact In the database I have the following tables Party, Customer, Vendor, Contact. All of them have a corresponding row in Party table. Contact belongs to either Vendor or Customer. I have a field on the Contact table for org_party_id. However, since the organization can be either a Customer or Vendor I need to be able to look at different tables. Is there a way to map this in hibernate? Or, a better way to manage it in DB/ hibernate?
