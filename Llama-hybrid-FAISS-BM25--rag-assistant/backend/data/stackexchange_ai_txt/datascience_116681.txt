Where/how share annotated datasets (curated by humans)?

Once we have invested resources into annotating and reviewing some datasets (manually, by humans) how should we proceed to share them? How can we make them findable and accessible? Is it possible to monetize them? Is there a go-to repository for golden standard datasets that would classify, organize and make them available through their API?
