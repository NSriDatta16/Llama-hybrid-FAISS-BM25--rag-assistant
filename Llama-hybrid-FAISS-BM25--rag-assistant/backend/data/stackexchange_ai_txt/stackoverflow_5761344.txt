When in need to code a rule-based system (like the AI you are building), you can use a rule engine, like for example CLIPS (which is a tool developed at NASA for creating Expert Systems written in C). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIPS Perhaps it's an overkill for playing Tic Tac Toe, but if you are in the mood for learning cool AI stuff, Expert Systems is a very interesting area, but different (and perhaps less trickier) than Neural Networks. Have fun!
