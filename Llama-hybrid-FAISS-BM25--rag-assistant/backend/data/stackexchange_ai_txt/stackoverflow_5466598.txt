jQuery includes a method of testing for which browser you're in: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ But you're much better off testing for whatever feature you're looking to use, rather than browser. The BrowserAgent string can be forged quite easily, so you'll sometimes get Firefox users masquerading as IE users, etc.
