This is an example of Survival Analysis . In medical settings, you have a group of "patients" and you observe them over time, recording when some event occurs (e.g., death, heart attack, etc). However, since studies are often much shorter than a human's lifespan, the experimental data is "censored" since we don't know when the surviving patients will die, and how that would have affected our estimates. In your case, your "patients" are houses, and the "event" is a sale. Right now, your sample is censored, since not all houses have sold. One approach would be to calculate the Kaplan-Meier Estimator of the Survival Function. This "estimator" is a step-function that approximates the probability of a house being sold after a certain time on the market. However, it can only be calculated using the houses you've sold, so it will not go out far enough in time (e.g., it will stop at, say, $P(T>20)=0.1$). To extrapolate beyond this, you need to assume some sort of model. a natural model for your case might be to assume that home sales occur randomly, but at some average rate. In this case, you'd fit an exponential distribution to your Kaplan-Meiter estimate of the survival function (this is not too bad since the survival function is just $1-F(t)$ and $F(T)=1-e^{-\lambda*T}$, where you are fitting the function to the calculated points of the survival curve. The only wrinkle here is that you are not starting your "cohort" of homes at the same time. Now, if we assume an exponentially distributed time to sale, this will not be a problem, due to the memorylessness property of the exponential distribution. In your case, you would just use "days on market" as the variable, and then when they started is irrelevant, just how long they've been sitting.
