A pretty big question and i'm sure people prefer different things. Generally speaking, there is an index page where pages are included on request (most times using a switch for file inclusion attack prevention). The included pages also have a defined constant that is checked, in order to make sure that they cannot be executed individually. I always prefer to use a template system (a php one actually, a very very fast one) and i organize my code using an MVC type(model view controller). I create a user.php, a user.class.php and the user templates, for instance(user is the controller, class is the model, templates the view). EDIT - An example of an index page from an old project (cut down to just show the points) In this one i was using Smarty, btw.
