The closest I could get was using preg_split() instead: $string = Josh's real estate firm specializes in helping people find homes from [city][State]. Josh's real estate company is a boutique real estate firm serving clients locally. In [city][state] I am sure you know how difficult it is to find a great home, but we work closely with you to give you exactly what you need STR; print_r(preg_split(': :is', $string)); And got this output: Array ( [0] => Are you looking for a quality real estate company? [1] => Josh's real estate firm specializes in helping people find homes from [city][State]. [2] => [3] => Josh's real estate company is a boutique real estate firm serving clients locally. [4] => In [city][state] I am sure you know how difficult it is to find a great home, but we work closely with you to give you exactly what you need ) Except that produces an extra array element (index 2 ) where there's a newline between the fragments [city][State]. and Josh's real estate company . It'd be trivial to add some code to remove the whitespace matches though, but I'm not sure if you desire that.
