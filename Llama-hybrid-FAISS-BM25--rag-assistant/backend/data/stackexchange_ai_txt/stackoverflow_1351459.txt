An in memory storage is not persistent, so no. I think you mean that you only want to write to the database ever X new posts of objects. I guess this is for speedup reasons. But since you need to serialize them sooner or later anyway, you don't actually save any time that way. However, you will save time by not flushing the new objects to disk, but most databases already support that. But you also talk about caching the rendered page, which is read caching. There you can't cache the finished result you say, but you can cache the result of the database query. That means that new message will not be immediately updated, but take a minute or so to show up, but I think most people will see this as acceptable. Update: In this case not, then. But you should still easily be able to cache the query results, but invalidate that cache when new responses are added. That should help.
