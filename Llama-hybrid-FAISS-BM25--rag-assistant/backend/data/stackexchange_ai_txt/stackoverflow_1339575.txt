I am not sure, but it seems you want to do what is called a moving average. numpy provides facilities for this (the convolve function). >>> x = numpy.array(range(20)) >>> x array([ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) >>> n = 2 # moving average window >>> numpy.convolve(numpy.ones(n)/n, x)[n-1:-n+1] array([ 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, 18.5]) The nice thing is that it accomodates different weighting schemes nicely (just change numpy.ones(n) / n to something else).
