Let "$run$" be the runoff, as measured with error, so that the measured runoff ratio $rr$ is $run/pcp$. The stated model and its alternatives appear to be in the form $$rr = \frac{run}{pcp} \sim F(\beta_{pcp} (pcp) + \beta_{ant} (ant) + \beta_0)$$ where $F$ is some family of distributions (such as Beta distributions) and the $\beta_{*}$ are coefficients to be estimated. The main problem with this is that unless the dispersion of the measurement error in $run$ is directly proportional to $pcp$, the structure of $F$ will be unnecessarily complicated. Why not algebraically rewrite the relationship as $$run = \beta_{pcp} (pcp)^2 + \beta_{ant} (ant)(pcp) + \beta_0(pcp) + \varepsilon$$ where $\varepsilon$ represents the measurement error? The absence of several simple terms in this formula (such as one depending directly on $ant$ as well as a constant term) suggests that the proposed model may be artificially limited. Thus, ordinary regression (using $run$ or some re-expression thereof, such as a square or cube root, as the dependent variable) to fit a model like $$run = \alpha_0 + \alpha_{pcp}(pcp) + \alpha_{ant}(ant) + \alpha_{pcp2}(pcp)^2 + \alpha_{ant,pcp}(ant)(pcp) + \varepsilon$$ would be a good way to begin an analysis. And if indeed the variance of $\varepsilon$ depends on $pcp$, that can be modeled in various straightforward ways. This approach seems more natural, realistic, and interpretable than hoping the ratio $rr$ would satisfy the more restrictive assumptions of Beta or Logistic regression.
