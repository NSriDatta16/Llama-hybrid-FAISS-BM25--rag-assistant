create a program that can run a cmd prompt

I have a program that changes my desktop wallpaper by dragging the picture file onto it. I also have a wireless network program that can auto open programs everytime it connects to a certain network. I want to change my desktop everytime it connects to a certain network, but running the wallpaper program doesn't do anything unless I drag the picture onto it. However, I can also run a cmd prompt "c:/program.exe picture.jpg" I tried creating a batch file START C:/PROGRAM.EXE PICTURE.JPG, but it doesn't work. So basically I am trying to create a program that can run the cmd prompt "c:/program.exe picture.jpg" - can you help, please?
