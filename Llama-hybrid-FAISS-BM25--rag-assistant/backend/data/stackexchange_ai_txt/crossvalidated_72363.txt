As Peter said, the matter of becoming fluent in R vs. knowing/implementing appropriate R packages based on your needs is entirely up to what you expect to gain from using R . Like you, I also use other statistical programs (ie. SAS , Mplus , and Knowledge Studio ), but having R at my disposal allows me to perform certain analyses more easily and/or more efficiently (eg. Random Forest with randomForest and Lasso Regression with glmnet ). It is also very nice/reassuring how often packages and their documentation get updated, which is quite the opposite for the archaic procs of SAS! Personally, I began learning the basics of R by reviewing and typing through all of the topics on the website, Quick-R , which takes you through the more familiar processes of data management, descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses as well as delving into some handy concepts such as bootstrapping, factor analysis, tree-based methods, and matrix algebra (as well as countless others!). It is also helpful to watch videos on youtube, as user2337160 pointed out. Watching these videos will reinforce the basics that you learned from perusing through Quick-R and will add additional hints and tricks to further progress your R skills. Now that I have been working with R for a little over 2 years now, I have come to realize that I best learn R , as well as any other statistical program, from having the want or need of making use of a specific type of analysis. For example, the concept of Random Forest stumped me for a long time; however, I reviewed the appropriate R documentation to make use of R packages such as randomForest and Boruta , which allowed me to meet the demands of my task, while further enhancing my working R knowledge. In summation, I recommend that you learn the basics (via. Quick-R, youtube videos, and colleagues, if at all possible) and then make use of specific R packages to conquer the demands of your current and future projects, which, in turn, will result in improved R fluency over the months and years to come. I hope this helps!
