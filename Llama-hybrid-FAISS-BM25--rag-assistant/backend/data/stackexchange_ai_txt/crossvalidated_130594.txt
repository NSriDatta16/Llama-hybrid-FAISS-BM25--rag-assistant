How to remove the NA from summary of glm?

I made a regression mode: LogitModel all the variables are factor except TimeBetweenStartRegAndEndReg and Age_wn. the output summary(LogitModel) is not understood for me. there are NA for some variables. what it means that the coefficiant is NA? And the most important how to remove them NA from the summary? And another thing how can i print a model just with the significant coefficiant ?
