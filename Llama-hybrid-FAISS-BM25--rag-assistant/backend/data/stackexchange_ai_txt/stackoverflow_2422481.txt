Magento images not showing on front end

I'm using Magento 1.4. I have two website set up. If I upload images to Website A, they appear fine on both front and back end. If I upload or import images to Website B, they do not appear on the front end, only the backend. I'm completely stuck. I'm happy to provide any additional details that may be helpful, but am so frustrated I'm not sure what is necessary info to fix the problem. Thanks!
