Casting vs Converting an object toString, when object really is a string

This isn't really an issue, however I am curious. When I save a string in lets say an DataRow, it is cast to Object. When I want to use it, I have to cast it ToString. As far as I know there are several ways of doing this, first is string name = (string)DataRowObject["name"]; //valid since I know it's a string and another one is: string name = DataRowObject["name"].ToString(); I am interested in what is the difference between both? Is the first more efficient? (This is just a speculation, in my head ToString() method is implemented by some looping mechanism where just casting it "could" be faster, however this is just a "gut feeling" I have). Is there even a faster / more elegant way of doing this? Can anyone clear this up for me?
