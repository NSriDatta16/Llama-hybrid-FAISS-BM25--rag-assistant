I think the concept of Turing completeness is not intended to tell us whether a particular computer can perform a particular task. Rather, it purposes to tell whether a particular language is capable of expressing a particular task. That is, I'd say it's really about expressing an algorithm not performing it. As neural networks don't have a language, it's a question of expressing an algorithm in terms of a neural network, rather than the capability of that network. So I don't know the answer to the last bit of your question!
