Analyzing multiple, within-subjects, non-independent ordinal rankings

So I'm working with some previously collected data where participants ( N =139) were asked to rank 3 types of events (1 being best, 3 being worst) for 6 separate scenarios. The question of interest is whether, across all 6 scenarios, the 3 types differ in their rankings. Is Type A ranked higher than Type B? Is Type A ranked higher than Type C? Is Type B ranked higher than Type C? I'm not sure how best to conceptualize and analyze this data. Obviously, a participant's rankings for each event type for each scenario is non-independent, so how can I compare the rankings when they are dependent on one another? I'm mainly looking for an idea of what tests to look into. I've checked out Friedman's Test, but I'm not sure my data apply due to the non-independence of the rankings and the fact that the rankings are repeated across scenarios. I also can see how the data would fit into a multilevel model (rankings within scenarios within participants), but I'm not sure how to deal with the non-independence of the rankings. As a note, the data is really easy to present DESCRIPTIVELY and leads to clear conclusions, but I'd like to be able to back-up these conclusions up with some inferential statistics if possible. Average Rank Collapsed Across Scenario Type 1 : 1.55 (SD = .29) Ranked 1st 57%. Ranked 2nd 33%. Ranked 3rd 9%. Type 2 : 1.75 (SD = .29) Ranked 1st 38%. Ranked 2nd 53%. Ranked 3rd 10%. Type 3 : 2.70 (SD = .31) Ranked 1st 5%. Ranked 2nd 14%. Ranked 3rd 81%.
