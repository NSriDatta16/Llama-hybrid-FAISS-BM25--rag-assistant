Is the truncated normal distribution symmetric?

I am running a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC to find the distribution of a parameter that takes real, positive values. I was considering using the truncated normal distribution , and was wondering if I have to correct for asymmetry, since it is a derivation of the (symmetric) normal distribution and all. Thank you
