Why don't you use 2 sortable lists that are connected ? Then you can use the stop event You can connect 2 lists by doing: $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable' }).disableSelection(); And then use the stop event $( ".selector" ).sortable({ stop: function(event, ui) { ... } }); You can then change the dropped element by doing ui. (don't know this by heart but with the draggable plugin its ui.draggable)
