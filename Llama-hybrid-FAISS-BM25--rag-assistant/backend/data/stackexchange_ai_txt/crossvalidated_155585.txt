I avoid discussing "z-scores" and "$p$-values" because I have very little understanding of what these things, so dear to the statistical heart, actually mean. You have $n$ independent identically distributed normal random variables $X_i, 1 \leq i \leq n$ with unknown mean $\mu$ but known variance $\sigma^2$. Their average $$\bar{X} = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ is also a normal random variable with $\mu$ but smaller variance $\sigma^2/n$. Now, for a $N(\mu,\tau^2)$ random variable $Y$, $$P\{\mu-1.96 \tau \leq Y \leq \mu+1.96\tau\} = 0.95\tag{1}$$ If we knew the value of $\mu$, we could construct the interval $\mathcal I = [\mu-1.96 \tau, \leq \mu+1.96\tau]$ and be assured that when we do the experiment over and over, on $95\%$ of such trials, the value of $Y$ will lie in $\mathcal I$. We don't know $\mu$, however. But we have observed that $Y$ has taken on value $y$ in the trial just concluded. Now, if $y \in \mathcal I$, then it must be that $\mu \in [y-1.96 \tau, y + 1.96 \tau]$. We don't know whether or not the specific $y$ that we observed lies in $\mathcal I$, but we might feel some confidence, perhaps 95% confidence, that $y$ is one of the "good guys" that belongs to belongs to $\mathcal I$, and so we are 95% confident that $\mu \in [y-1.96 \tau, y + 1.96 \tau]$. The midpoint of the interval $\mathcal I$ defined by $(1)$ is $\mu$. Now, there are uncountably many real numbers $a$ such that $$P\{a \leq Y \leq b(a)\} = 0.95\tag{2}$$ (Here $b(a)$ is a number, obviously dependent on $a$ such that the equality holds in $(2)$. The function $b(a)$ has value approximately $\mu+1.65\tau$ when $a = -\infty$. It increases slowly and has value $\mu+1.96\tau$ when $a=\mu-1.96\tau$. It then increases very rapidly and approaches $\infty$ as $a$ gets close to $\mu-1.65\tau$. There are no solutions to $(2)$ if $a > \mu-1.65\tau$. So, when does the length $b(a)-a$ of the interval have a minimum? Symmetry suggests that the minimum occurs when $a$ and $b(a)$ are equally far from the mean $\mu$, and we can do a formal proof via calculus as in Christoph Hanck's answer. I have not thought about applying Lagrange multipliers to the problem.
