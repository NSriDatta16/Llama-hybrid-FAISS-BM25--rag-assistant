This is relatively simple. First, you must find the file which you will need to modify. There is a handy way of finding out which file you need to modify by turning on something called Template Path Hints. There's a handy video here: http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/template-path-hints-tutorial-video/ that shows you how to turn it on and how to use it. After that, all you need to do is find the appropriate template file, and add any code you need to it. Also, make sure that if the file that you need is not in your theme's folder, copy it from the default/default or base/default location to the relevant folder in your themes dafault/[yourthemesnamehere] location.
