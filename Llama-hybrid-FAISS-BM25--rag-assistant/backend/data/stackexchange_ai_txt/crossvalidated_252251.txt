Transition matrix calculation from text book "Introduction to information retrieval"

According to the example on page in the text book, the graph of documents is as follows: $1\rightarrow2, 3\rightarrow2, 2\rightarrow1, 2\rightarrow3$ with $\lambda = 0.5$ which would form an adjacency matrix as follows: Then if we multiply the $\lambda$ by $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 0&1 &0 \\ 1&0 &1 \\ 0&1 &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ we would get a matrix: $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 0&1/2 &0 \\ 1/2&0 &1/2 \\ 0&1/2 &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ Now if we add $\frac{1 - \lambda}{N}$ to the matrix A, we would get a transition matrix $$P = \begin{bmatrix} 1/6&2/3 &1/6 \\ 2/3&1/6 &2/3 \\ 1/6&2/3 &1/6 \end{bmatrix}$$ According to the book, the transition probability matrix of surfer's walk with teleportation is: $$P = \begin{bmatrix} 1/6&2/3 &1/6 \\ 5/12&1/6 &5/12 \\ 1/6&2/3 &1/6 \end{bmatrix}$$ I got the answer by: Dividing each 1 in A by the number of 1s in its row. Multiply the resulting matrix by $1 - \lambda$ Add $\frac{\lambda}{N}$ My transition matrix and one form book are a bit different. What are the calculations behind the books matrix?
