Is it possible to describe (draw) the relationship between input and output in Machine learning?

For example, in linear regression, we can say that the relationship between X and Y is linear. When X increases, Y also increases. On the other hand, for non-linear regression (Power model as an example), we can say that the relationship between X and Y is exponential relationship. When X increases, Y increases exponentially. Is it possible to describe (draw) the relationship between input and output in Machine learning? Is there any Algorithm, approach, etc. to describe, shape, or draw the type of relationship between X and Y in Machine learning (Supervised)? ANN, SVM, Tree, etc ...
