UIScrollView touchesBegan

So all I wanna do is play a sound when the user touches a UIScrollView. The UIScrollViewDelegate has that scrollViewWillBeginDragging: method but it only gets called on touchMoved. I want it to get called on touchBegan. Tried touchesBegan:withEvent: but it doesn't receive any touch. Anyone has a clue?
