Clarification on Notation

I'm using Andrew Gelman's 3rd edition of Bayesian Data Analysis and am going through the exercises. For one of the exercises, he supposes that if $\theta = 1$, then $y$ has a normal distribution with mean $1$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, and if $\theta = 2$, then $y$ has a normal distribution with mean $2$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 2$. He also supposes that $\text{Pr}(\theta = 1) = \text{Pr}(\theta = 2) = 0.5$. One of the problems is to solve for $\text{Pr}(\theta = 1 | y = 1)$ and the solution, according to Gelman's solution sheet on his website, is the following: $\text{Pr}(\theta = 1 | y = 1) = \frac{p(\theta = 1\ \cap \ y=1)}{p(\theta = 1 \ \cap \ y=1) + p(\theta = 2 \ \cap \ y = 1)} = \frac{0.5N(1|1,2^2)}{0.5N(1|1,2^2) + 0.5N(1|2,2^2)} = 0.53$ Conceptually, I understand what's going on, but I am really confused as to what $N(1|1,2^2)$ and $N(1|2,2^2)$ mean exactly and how he calculates these values.
