drag and drop without moving the element

Hi am using drag and drop from Jquery, and what I want to try and simulate is the drag and drop except during the drag motion I don't want the element to actually move from its place. In the example here : http://jsfiddle.net/2LN5G/ when you drag the "Drag me to target" it is moved from the possition and reverts back when it is dropped. I want to still show "Drag me to target in the current position and still show the "Drag me to target" moving with the cursor. Is this possible ?
