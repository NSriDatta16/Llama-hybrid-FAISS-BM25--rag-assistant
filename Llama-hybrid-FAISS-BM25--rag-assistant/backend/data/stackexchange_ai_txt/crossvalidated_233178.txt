How to improve my classification tree ? R

I have a database with 1200 observations and 14 variables and I'am trying to do a classification tree for my dependent nominal variable who hase 4 modality > table(testarbre2$Q99) Autres Nahdha Ne pas voter Nidaa Tounes 248 351 303 298 at firt i tried to do a multinom logistic regression but i got the mojority of my predictor variables non significant. it seems that Even with 1200 people I was trying to fit a model for which I don't have sufficient data. so i tried to do a classification tree using the package rpart from R but the problem is that the error is so high about 65% and more, and the missclassification is about 70% this is the code R that i used #preparation of the data set.seed(26) train=sample(1:nrow(testarbre2),nrow(testarbre2)*7/10) test=-train training_data=testarbre2[train,] testing_data=testarbre2[test,] testing_vote=vote[test] #fitting the model library(rpart) library(rpart.plot) Tree I don't know if i missed a step or i used a wrong approach in the construction of my classification tree or the database is causing the problem Please someone help me to understand what's wrong with my model
