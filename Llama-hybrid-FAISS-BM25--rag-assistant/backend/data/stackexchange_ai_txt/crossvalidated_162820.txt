The average calculation will be correct if the underlying distribution is symmetric and the endpoints of your interval were chosen by the same criterion. For example, the above calculation is correct if the distribution of your concentration is normal and the interval refers to the interquartile range. The calculation will not in general be true if the distribution is asymmetric such as a log-normal distribution.
