The second one has problems when it comes to format just one place differently, let's say the product price sum. It can be possible that there are other places which also have the exact same three classes assigned, but don't have anything to do with a product price. In that case one would have to use the surrounding HTML tags to somehow "address" the specific place in the HTML file. Isn't "addressing" like this the whole point of CSS rules and specificity ? I think of it less as "addressing" and more like "namespacing" ;) Personally, I prefer the second method; I tend to prefer using the id attribute to identify things ;) ... but the class attribute is nonetheless considered an element identifier . In the end though, the purpose of the class attribute is used " for general purpose processing by user agents. " I interpret this as meaning that the values you give it should cater to your application's needs. So if your application needs to identify all the product prices - be it for CSS styling or for a jQuery script or a screen reader or whatever - identify them with a class attribute of product-prices . If your application needs to describe all the numeric values - again, be it for CSS styling or for a jQuery script or a screen reader or whatever - identify them with a class attribute of numeric . PS Please don't call it the CSS class ; call it simply the " class attribute." Unless you're working in Asp.NET, there is no such thing as the CSS class , and even in Asp.NET - there shouldn't be a CSS class . Sorry for multiple shameless links to my own web site.
