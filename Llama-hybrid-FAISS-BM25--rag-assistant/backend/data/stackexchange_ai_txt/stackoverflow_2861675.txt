I think it's important to have command of a commerial database or two. In the finance world that I consult in, I often see DB/2 and Oracle on large iron and SQL Server on the distributed servers. This basically means being able to read and write SQL code. You need to be able to get data out of storage and into your analytic tool. In terms of analytical tools, I believe R is increasingly important. I also think it's very advantageous to know how to use at least one other stat package as well. That could be SAS or SPSS... it really depends on the company or client that you are working for and what they expect. Finally, you can have an incredible grasp of all these packages and still not be very valuable. It's extremely important to have a fair amount of subject matter expertise in a specific field and be able to communicate to relevant users and managers what the issues are surrounding your analysis as well as your findings.
