How to combine odds of an event happening with effects of said event

I have run an ordinal logistic regression. To keep it simple and to the point, I have found that customers with whom we perform a particular sales event are 1.5x more likely to upgrade. Of the customers who have upgraded, through linear regression I have found that they are willing to pay $10 more for said upgrade than the ones who have not had the sales event. If I wanted to say something like: for each customer on which we perform the sales event we will obtain $XX more in revenue (due to them upgrading AND paying more than the standard customers), how would I calculate it? It is more or less combining the odds ratio with the additional revenue, but I do not know how to calculate what the combined effect is here. Any pointers would be appreciated.
