Terminology for a "studentized" random variable?

Let $X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}$ be i.i.d. ramdom variables having mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . I wonder if the "studentized" $X_{i}$ , the sample version of standardized $X_{i}$ where $\mu$ is replaced with the sample average and $\sigma$ is replaced with a sample standard deviation, admits a relatively canonical terminology in literature? In my shallow opinion, the term "studentized" is informative but would cost some possibilities of confusion. So a terminology, if it exists, is sought. The following is in response to a question raised in a comment below. To avoid introducing too many symbols, I described it in plain English. If this helps: If $$ \frac{X_{i} - \mu}{\sigma} $$ is called the standardized $X_{i}$ , if $\bar{X}$ denotes the sample average, and if $s$ denotes the sample standard deviation under consideration, then I call $$ \frac{X_{i} - \bar{X}}{s} $$ the studentized $X_{i}$ above for reference ease.
