The answer to this question deals with categories. Specifically, here's some code (VB.net, but easily convertable) that will create a dark olive category: Private Shared ReadOnly CATEGORY_TEST As String = "Custom Overdue Activity" ' This method checks if our custom category exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Private Sub SetupCategories() Dim categoryList As Categories = Application.Session.Categories For i As Integer = 1 To categoryList.Count Dim c As Category = categoryList(i) If c.Name.Equals(CATEGORY_TEST) Then Return End If Next categoryList.Add(CATEGORY_TEST, Outlook.OlCategoryColor.olCategoryColorDarkOlive) End Sub Category colors are either set in Outlook, or in the code above when creating a category in code.
