You said the file is in the "headers" folder. This could either mean the headers filter or an actual headers directory on the filesystem. When including a file from your own project you need to specify the path from the file you're including into. So, if you had something like so: src/main.cpp include/my_object.h You would use #include "../include/my_object.h" in main.cpp. That's for directories. The folders you see in your project are called filters and have absolutely no relation to the directory structure of your project unless you force it to. You need to be paying attention to what the structure looks like in windows explorer to ascertain what path to use in an include statement.
