Bayesian A/B testing with uniform prior

The advantage of Bayesian A/B testing is that it considers our prior belief about the distribution. However, sometimes we do not have this, so we set prior to be uniform and work with visits and conversion counts. Why would one still use Bayesian A/B testing rather than a frequentist testing?
