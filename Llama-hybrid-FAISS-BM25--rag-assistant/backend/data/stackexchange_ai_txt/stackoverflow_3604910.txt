MVVM pattern for flowchart designer implementation

I'm new to WPF and after glancing thru this article, MVVM-Pattern for a Diagraming Application with WPF - Convert enum to xxxViewModel I like to know if MVVM could be used or encouraged to use for a simple app that I like to try: The simple app is a WPF flowchart designer that allows user to add icons to the canvas such that they are related to one another. Also, I'd like to know how developers implement the code-behind where the active node is highlighted after a short time duration in a while loop. suppose there are 3 nodes in the app after drag and drop. time active node 1st-5ths A 6th-10th B (active node moved from A to B) 11th-15th C (active node moved from B to C) 16th-20th A (active node from C to A because of while loop link) Is this a good fit for MVVM pattern use? Thanks
