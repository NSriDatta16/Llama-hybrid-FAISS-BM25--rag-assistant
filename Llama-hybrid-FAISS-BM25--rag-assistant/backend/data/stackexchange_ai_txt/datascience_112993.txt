https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/30364#169086 This kaggle user tried to something similar. I am trying to get the code myself to check out his approach. Apart from that, it would be interesting to know the scope of the problem. Are we just sticking to all addresses with one city (Bellingham, MA) or the scope is for all global street address. Narrowing down the scope of the problem, would help tremendously in finding a suitable approach, be it simple (using excel) or Deep learning methods.
