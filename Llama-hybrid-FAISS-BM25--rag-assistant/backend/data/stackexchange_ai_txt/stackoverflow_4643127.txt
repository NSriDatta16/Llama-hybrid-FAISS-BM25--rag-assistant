Alright, here's my thoughts on this… The solution's too far from ideal. To gradually show the path mean we should show it, like, dot by dot. And vector paths consist not of dots, but of curves, so it appears to me there's no ‘natural’ way to gradually ‘draw’ the path in vector graphics. (Though I'm fairly new to this and may be mistaken.) The only way would be to somehow convert a path to a number of dots and show them one by one. Currently my workaround is to draw a path, make it invisible, break it into a number of subpaths, and show that subpaths one by one. This isn't hard to do with Raphael, but it's not elegant either, and quite slow on a large paths. Not accepting my answer, hoping there's a better way…
