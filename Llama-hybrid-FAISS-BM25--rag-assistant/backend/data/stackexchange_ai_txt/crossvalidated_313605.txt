What is the statistical model behind the SVM algorithm?

I have learned that, when dealing with data using model-based approach, the first step is modeling data procedure as a statistical model. Then the next step is developing efficient/fast inference/learning algorithm based on this statistical model. So I want to ask which statistical model is behind the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm?
