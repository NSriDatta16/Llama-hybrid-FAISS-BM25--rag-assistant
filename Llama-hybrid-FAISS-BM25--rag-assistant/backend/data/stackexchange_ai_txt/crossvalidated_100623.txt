Use time series analysis. In time series data, a large number of dimensions is common, and usually not something to worry about, if you use appropriate methods. Because the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is much lower. I.e. don't use Euclidean distance. Don't use low-dimensional methods such as k-means. Use something that understands time .
