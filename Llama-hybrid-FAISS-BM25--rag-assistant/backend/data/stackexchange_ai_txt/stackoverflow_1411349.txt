Unless individual users are requesting the pages over and over again, there's no point caching this sort of thing, and I expect the overhead of caching will vastly exceed the performance benefits, simply since the cache hit ratio will be poor. You may be better off looking into caching fragments of your site that do not depend on the individual user, or fragments that will be the same for a large number of page impressions (e.g. content that is the same for a large subset of your users). For example - on this page you might want to cache the list of related questions, or the tag information, but there's probably little point caching the top-bar with reputation info too aggressively, since it will be requested relatively infrequently.
