Yes, it'll almost certainly be faster. Looping an average of 25 times (half-way through your 50) is slower than a hashmap lookup, assuming your vA contents decently hashable. However, speaking of your vA contents , you'll have to trim them as you insert them into your aMap, because aMap.get("somekey") will not find an entry whose key is "somekey ". Actually, you should do that as you insert into vA, even if you don't switch to the hashmap solution.
