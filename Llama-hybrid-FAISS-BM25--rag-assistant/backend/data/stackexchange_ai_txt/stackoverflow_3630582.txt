You should fix the problem. First step: find at check all functions you register with atexit() (not many I hope) Second step: find all global variables and check their destructors. Third Step: find all static function variables check their destructors. But otherwise you can abort. Note: abort is for Abnormal program termination. abort() The difference: (note letting an application leave the main function is the equivalent of exit()) exit() Call the functions registered with the atexit(3) function, in the reverse order of their registration. This includes the destruction of all global (static storage duration) variables. Flush all open output streams. Close all open streams. Unlink all files created with the tmpfile(3) function. abort() Flush all open output streams. Close all open streams.
