This totally depends on your time series and what effect you want to discover/proof etc. An important thing here is, what kind of periods do you have in your data. Make a spectrum of you data and see what frequencies are common in you data. Anyway, you are not lying when you decide to display aggregated values. When you are looking to effects that are occurring over weeks (like, more violence in summer when it's hot weather) it is the right thing to do. Maybe you can also take a look at the Hilbert Huang Transform. This will give you Intrinsic Mode Functions that are very handy for visual analyses.
