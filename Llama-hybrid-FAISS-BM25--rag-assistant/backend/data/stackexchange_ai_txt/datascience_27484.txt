It sounds like your dataset is going to need some work before you can start applying a model to it, for example you will have to translate customer location into something more usable, like distance from depot, or Urban/Suburb/Country labels perhaps? Andrew Ng's Coursera course is a popular starting point, many beginners seem to find it useful. You'll get a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and how to arrange your data to get the best out of the models. Good luck!
