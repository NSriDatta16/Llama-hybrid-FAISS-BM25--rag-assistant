I would consider tweaking your fill factor for sure. If it's fragmenting quickly, I'm guessing it's a write-heavy index, which can gain substantial performance benefits from a fill factor. Determing optimal fill factors is pretty much a trial-and-error process though, and more of an art than a science. From Tips for Rebuilding Indexes by Brad McGehee : So what is the ideal fill factor? It depends on the ratio of reads to writes that your application makes to your SQL Server tables. As a rule of thumb, follow these guidelines: * Low Update Tables (100-1 read to write ratio): 100% fill factor * High Update Tables (where writes exceed reads): 50%-70% fill factor * Everything In-Between: 80%-90% fill factor.
