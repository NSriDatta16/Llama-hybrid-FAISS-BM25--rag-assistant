Near-Duplicate Image Detection

What's a fast way to sort a given set of images by their similarity to each other. At the moment I have a system that does histogram analysis between two images, but this is a very expensive operation and seems too overkill. Optimally I am looking for a algorithm that would give each image a score (for example a integer score, such as the RGB Average) and I can just sort by that score. Identical Scores or scores next to each other are possible duplicates. 0299393 0599483 0499994 RGB Average per image sucks, is there something similar?
