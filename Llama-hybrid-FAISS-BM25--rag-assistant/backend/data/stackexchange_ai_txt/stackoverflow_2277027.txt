There is a Z ordering without using subviews. For one thing there are menu options for "send to front" and "send to back". Also however, if you look at the elements in your view as a tree of elements, you can re-order them there (rather than in the view itself) just by dragging. Subviews are great for grouping but not as useful for ordering (except that the whole "set" stays at the same level).
