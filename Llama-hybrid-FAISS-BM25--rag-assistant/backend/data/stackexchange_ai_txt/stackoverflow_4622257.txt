Dragging, Dropping & resizing elements

I have a web page which has three elements: Right_bar contains several layouts (nothing to do with this question) Bottom_bar contains several components e.g. calculator, logo, a group of buttons etc. each component uses a and must be resizable and draggable. And a Working Area, where all the components are dropped & resized. Also a user can resize & change the location of components anywhere in the Working Area. Once a user sets a component then the page must be saved in same style and it shouldn't be changed even after refreshing the page. My questions are: Should I use a database to save the location of component. Which one should I use: JQuery / AJAX / anyother? If you know of any tutorials please let me know although I am beginner in JavaScript, Basically a Java programmer. Note: on the server side I am using Servlet.
