Logistic regression with lasso versus PCA?

Logistic regression with lasso versus PCA? Got asked this question in an interview. I know the main difference is that Lasso is a regularization technique (adding vars to minimize effect of large coefficients) while PCA is feature selection technique (by covariance matrix decomposition). I answered PCA allows you to do feature selection outside of the fit and transform and therefore give more flexibility in the hyper parameter search. Whereas in lasso the "feature selection" is kind of done for you and therefore there is less scope of hyper parameter optimization. Does that sound right?
