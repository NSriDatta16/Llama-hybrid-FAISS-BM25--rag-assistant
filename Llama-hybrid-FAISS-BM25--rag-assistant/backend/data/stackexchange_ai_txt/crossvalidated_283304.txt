I am not clear how you count the "number of people in an treatment facility in a given state/year.", i.e., count the person as one or as 3 if that person went in the facility 3 times in that year. If counting as 3, the Poisson regression is good method, and the model can be written as: $$Y \sim \mathrm{Poisson} (\lambda N)$$ $$\log(\lambda) = X\beta$$ where $Y$ is number of people in an treatment facility, $N$ is population size and $X$ contains other covariates. $N$ is called offset in Poisson regression. If counting as 1, the logistic regression is good method, and the model can be written as: $$Y \sim \mathrm{Binomial} (\pi, N)$$ $$\log\left(\frac\pi{1-\pi}\right) = X\beta$$ The meanings of $Y$, $N$ and $X$ are the same as in Poisson regression.
