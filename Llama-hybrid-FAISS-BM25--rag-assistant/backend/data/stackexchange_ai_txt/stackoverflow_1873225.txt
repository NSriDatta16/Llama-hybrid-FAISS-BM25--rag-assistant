bayesian filter to mark duplicate items

I collect news for certain topics and then run bayesian classfier on them to mark them as interesting or non-interesting. I see that there are news which are different articles are essentially the same news. e.g. - Ben Kingsley visits Taj Mahal with wife - Kingsley romances wife in Taj's lawns How do I teach the system to mark all these as duplicates? Thanks Sanjay
