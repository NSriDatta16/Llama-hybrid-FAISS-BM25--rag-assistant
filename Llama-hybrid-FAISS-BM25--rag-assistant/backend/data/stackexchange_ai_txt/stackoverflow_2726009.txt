How to convert Excel values into buckets?

I have a set of data in Excel and in one column is a estimate (number of weeks) I want an Excel formula to bucket it into Small Medium Large where if the value is 0 - 10 then put it Small. If the value is 10 - 20 put it in Medium, etc . . . if there any elegant way of doing it besides having nested if statements all put together?
