Look up Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Honestly any unsupervised learning algorithm should work, as they will show you correlations in the data (clustering algorithms, or heck even PCA). After running the algorithms you can trace the correlations to specific points in the data, and see if the correlations can be used for your regression purposes. Meaning... if all the data vectors which you want to be class A cluster together, and class B clusters together then there is a correlation. Restricted Boltzmann Machines take an extra step by creating a (or multiple) layer of hidden nodes, if the hidden nodes can reconstruct the original data then they have found strong features and correlations in the data. I know it's a broad answer, but there are a ton of unsupervised learning algorithms out there! Which one works best, of course depends on your implementation.
