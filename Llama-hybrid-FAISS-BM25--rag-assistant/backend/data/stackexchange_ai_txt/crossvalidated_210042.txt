If I understand correctly, you are excited about MCMC in the case of multi-modal target functions. Your reasoning is that MCMC methods search the global parameter space, rather than just shooting up the closest mode and stopping. While theoretically true, in practice, MCMC often behaves somewhat similarly to hill climbing methods: once they find a local mode, they often stay around that mode. Unlike hill climbing methods, there is a positive probability that they will leave the mode, so theoretically it will explore the global space if let run long enough. However, for most samplers, this probability is so extremely small that is unreasonable to run the chain long enough to have any assurance that the sampler will properly explore the global space. Of course, there are samplers that try to remedy this by attempting to take occasional outlier steps (i.e. see if it can escape the local mode). But I don't think these samplers are going to be at all competitive, in regards to optimization, with standard optimization methods for exploring multi-modal surfaces (i.e. particle swarm, etc.).
