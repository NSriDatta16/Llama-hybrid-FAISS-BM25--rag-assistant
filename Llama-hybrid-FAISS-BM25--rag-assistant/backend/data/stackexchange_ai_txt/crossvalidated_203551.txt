You could find the relative ranking of factors using z-scores or use the IQR in order to compare those in each observation, then create a composite score. Here is an example considering average time and total buys with equal weight. I have calculated the z-score of each factor, found where they fall in the distribution (here, I am assuming normal), and created a composite (i.e. $(p_t + p_b)/ 2$). The interpretation of the composite is that an average worker will be at .5, a worker above or below that number is respectively more or less "efficient". +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |time |total|time-|buy-z|pt |pb |score| | |buys |z | | | | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |291 |22 |-0.65|-0.62|0.74 |0.27 |0.51 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |874 |4 |1.21 |-0.95|0.11 |0.17 |0.14 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |291 |10 |-0.65|-0.84|0.74 |0.20 |0.47 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |294 |160 |-0.64| 1.90|0.74 |0.97 |0.86 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |1331 |1 |2.67 |-1.01|0.00 |0.16 |0.08 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |284 |42 |-0.68|-0.26|0.75 |0.40 |0.57 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |537 |19 |0.13 |-0.68|0.45 |0.25 |0.35 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |354 |78 |-0.45|0.40 |0.67 |0.66 |0.67 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |453 |131 |-0.13|1.37 |0.55 |0.91 |0.73 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |299 |26 |-0.63|-0.55|0.73 |0.29 |0.51 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |438 |123 |-0.18|1.23 |0.57 |0.89 |0.73 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
