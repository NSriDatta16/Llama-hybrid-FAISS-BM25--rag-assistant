(previous comment as answer) As far as I understand: In the context of neural networks the architecture is the number of layers, the number of nodes per layer and activation function. The model itself is what is learned --> the weight values. I think that - with creativity - anything can be visualized. Therefore, I would not differ concepts by the ability to visualize them.
