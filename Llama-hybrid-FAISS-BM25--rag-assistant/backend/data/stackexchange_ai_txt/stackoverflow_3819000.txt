ASP.NET MVC MODEL - Passing Joins created on Models to Controllers and Views with scaffold

this is the case: ASP.NET MVC C# Model: I would like to use information defined on three tables, Product - Details - Pictures. I created a ProductRepository and defined a join of the three tables. Finally I select fields from each of these tables. public IQueryable ProductsList() { var db = new Entities(); var results = from p in db.Products join pi in db.ProductPic on p.ProductId equals pi.ProductId // first join join pv in db.ProductDetails on p.ProductId equals pv.ProductId // second join select new { p.Name, p.Description, p.PCategory, p.ProductPicture, pv.Price, pi.Picture, }; return (results); } Controller: I defined: public ActionResult Index() { var products = productrepository.ProductsList(); if (products == null) throw new NotImplementedException(); else return View("Index", products); } Views: I created a strongly typed view from model Products. When I create the view I only received the fields from Table Product, but not the fields from table Details and Picture. My main question resides in the way it has to be created a View in order to use all the fields defined on the model (in this case = productrepository.productslist(); At this moment when I scaffold directly I only receive fields from product using strongly typed with product. Thank you so much!.
