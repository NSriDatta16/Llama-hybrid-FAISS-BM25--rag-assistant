After randomly messing around with the command line args I finally got it to work. I feel a little lame answering my own question, but hopefully it will still help someone else. It turned out my confusion was the proper usage of the command line arguments. If someone has something more elegant or generally useful than what I put I'll award the answer to you. open System.Diagnostics let launchExecutable() = let proc = new Process() proc.StartInfo.FileName
