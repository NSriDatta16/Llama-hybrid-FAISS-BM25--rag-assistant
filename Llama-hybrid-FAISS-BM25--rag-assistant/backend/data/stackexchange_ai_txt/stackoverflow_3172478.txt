It's not stored with the docx, just the path to it is stored. So passing a document around will almost always break the link. VSTO can get around this by embedding the XSD as a resource in the app. But for VBA, it's trickier - you need to have a path you can rely on on each user's computer and then deploy your XSD there. One way is to synch the Document_Open (or just use the AutoOpen ) event so that when a user opens the document (warning: macro security needs to be dinked around with), you can simply "write" your XSD that is hard-coded as a string in code-behind and then write it to a file and then attach that file with a routine like: Dim objSchema As XMLNamespace Set objSchema = Application.XMLNamespaces.Add("c:\something\mynewlycreated.xsd") objSchema.AttachToDocument ActiveDocument So as you're not leaving behind artifacts, you could then delete that XSD from the user's computer on Document_Close or AutoClose .
