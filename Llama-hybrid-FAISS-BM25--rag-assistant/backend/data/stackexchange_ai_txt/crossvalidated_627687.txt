You write: Univariate logistic regression results indicate that distance has a larger effect compared to light intensity (see below). and then give ORs per unit. But this is not correct. If you change the units, you change the ORs, and can reverse the relationship. Change meters to kilometers and the OR for distance will be tiny. The very small (but highly significant) OR in the bivariate relationship for light intensity is a sign that "lux" may be too large a measure. (Two notes: First, I dislike using "univariate" here, the relationship has two variables. Second, the scale of measurement doesn't change the meaning of the model, but it makes the results easier to interpret). While the effect size of light intensity is small, it does not contribute significantly to this model (p-value > .5) First, the p value is 0.14 which is not > 0.5. Maybe this is a typo and you met 0.05? More importantly, p value is not a measure of whether a variable "contributes significantly" to a model. Your interpretation of the interaction seems right, but the size will be affected if you change the units of light intensity.
