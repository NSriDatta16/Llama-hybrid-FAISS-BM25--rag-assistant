Compare different loadings of a SEM model across different datasets

I am interested in knowing if the same phenotypic structure holds across six different datasets. First, I have done six different multivariate analyses for my six different datasets (using MCMCglmm). For each resulting multivariate analysis, I obtained the correlation matrices (as I have repeated measures for different individuals). Then, I used these matrices as an input to perform six different structural equation modeling (same model across datasets). From this, I obtained the factor loading for each path for each dataset (using lavaan). Now I am interested in comparing if the loadings of each SEM across datasets are similar. I have tried to do an invariance model to compare datasets but have not figured out the way to include each of the correlation matrices (as they test the among-individual level) for each of the datasets.
