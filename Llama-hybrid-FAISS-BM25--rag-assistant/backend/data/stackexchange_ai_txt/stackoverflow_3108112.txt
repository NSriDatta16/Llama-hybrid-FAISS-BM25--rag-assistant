The number of visible characters is dependent on the size of the input element, but also on the style of that element: a wide box put in a shallow container (e.g., a div or form ) will not show all the characters in the field. See W3Schools explanation on INPUT , paying attention to size and maxlength attributes. maxlength specifies the maximum length (in characters) of an input field for "text" or "password" types, size specifies the width of an input field.
