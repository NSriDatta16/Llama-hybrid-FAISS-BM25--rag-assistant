In ordinal logistic regression, especially with the proportional odds approach, you do not need to have more than one observation per level of Y. No harm is done, it's just that you need to combine some categories to assess the proportional odds assumption using most available methods. But note that some violation of proportional odds does not mean that the proportional odds model works less well than some other models you might use.
