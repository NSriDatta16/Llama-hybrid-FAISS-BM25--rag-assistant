Stop criterion is Infinitive in Perceptron in Sklearn

I read code in book "Hand-on Machine Learning in Sklearn and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron per_clf = Perceptron(max_iter=100, tol=-np.infty, random_state=42) As I understand in this document about Perceptron method tol argument is the stop criterion and the iteration will stop if loss > previous_loss - tol So with tol is negative infinitive(tol= -np.infty) the loss will always need so be huge to stop iteration. And the epoch will always reach the max_iter in this situation. Is my thinking right?
