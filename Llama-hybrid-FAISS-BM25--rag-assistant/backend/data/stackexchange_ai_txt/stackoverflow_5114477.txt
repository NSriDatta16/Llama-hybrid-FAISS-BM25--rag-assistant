I recommend Jolokia , which is a full featured JSON/HTTP adapter for JMX. It has several client libs, i.e. jmx4perl , which allows for programatic JMX access from within perl. For Java and Javascript there are client bindings, too. More are in the pipeline (Scala, Groovy, Python). The installation is dead easy, for a Java EE container it is as simple as deploying a standard Java EE war. Other agents (OSGi, Mule, JVM6) are available, too.
