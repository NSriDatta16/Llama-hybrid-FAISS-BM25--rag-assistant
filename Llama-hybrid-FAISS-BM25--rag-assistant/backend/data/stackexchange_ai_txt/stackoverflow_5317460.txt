A random Autonumber PK may allow you to have increased concurrency, since Jet/ACE tables are stored clustered on the PK (i.e., in PK order). With a random Autonumber, the compacted table will stored in an essentially random order, rather than with the older records at the top and the newer records clustered together at the end. However, records added after a compact will be in temporary fragmented data pages instead of in clustered PK order, so I don't actually know if this enhances concurrency in a practical sense. It may be only theoretical (i.e., you'd have to compact after every record was added).
