Is there a good reference guide for deciphering http user-agent strings?

We're getting some odd errors reported on our website, and are trying to find out some details on who is doing the looking. I'm looking at a sample user-agent strings and seeing things like: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 Now some of this is obvious, but some of it is less so ("U"?) From the pattern of the hits, I'd suspect that this was a robot, but I don't see anything that I recognize in this string to clue me in to that. I'd like to know what some of the things in this (and other different) strings mean. Is there a comprehensive reference somewhere?
