This is kind of like what Bahbar suggested, but in only 3 passes. It'd still be kind of expensive, but you could: Write the cube into the stencil buffer Render everything that doesn't hit the stencil (draws things to the sides of the cube) Apply the forward facing clip planes (the ones in the back of the cube) Render things over the stencil buffer (only draws stuff completely behind the clip-cube) Apply the rear facing clip planes (the front of the cube) Render with the stencil buffer again (things completely in-front-of the clip-cube) If there were a second depth buffer, you could write the back of the cube into the second depth buffer and only render if the fragment is less than that, but greater than the first depth buffer. Then you could render the front of the cube into the depth buffer and then make a second pass over the scene to render things in front of the cube.
