So far, this seems to be an extremely vague question. Here is an experiment that might help clarify the question. Are your histograms sufficiently different for you to make reasonable choices? Mine are sufficiently different to allow good choices in some cases. First, two histograms (made using R): par(mfrow=c(1,2)) x1 = rgamma(150000, 10, 1) hist(x1, prob=T, col="skyblue2") x2 = rexp(1000, 2) hist(x2, prob=T, col="skyblue2") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) If the new single observation is 10.17, then pick the first population. If the new value is 0.53, then pick the second population. It is possible, but very unlikely, that 10.17 came from the distribution that resulted in the second histogram. It is possible, but very unlikely, that 0.53 came from the distribution that resulted in the first histogram. So the choices in the previous paragraph are reasonable.
