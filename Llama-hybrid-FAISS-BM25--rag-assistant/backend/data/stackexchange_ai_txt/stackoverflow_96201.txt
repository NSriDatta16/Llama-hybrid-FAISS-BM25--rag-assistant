Sockets may be the best route if you're just having to do it over the network. If you use TCP, you get the reliability of communication but take an impact on speed. If you need higher performance, you could try using UDP instead. But the downside to UDP is that packet delivery and order is not guaranteed, so you would need to write all that plumbing yourself. If you are needing to transfer files over the web itself (programatically, and if you can't use FTP), then a web service approach via MTOM might fit your needs. If you are building on top of Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008 and doing internal network transfers, another option is to leverage the new Remote Differential Compression feature. This not only does a really good job at compressing a file to minimize network traffic, but is also used directly by DFS replication. Downside (as a .NET developer), it's a COM+ technology.
