Is the result of Bayesian Inference with MCMC reliable since there maybe a big variance?

I'm new to Bayesian inference and I came across a, maybe simple, question. That is, in many cases, we don't know how the posterior distribution really looks like, and we adapt the result of MCMC, or to say, the expected value as the best estimation to the parameters, but what if the posterior distribution has a very large variance, or is a distribution similar to uniform distribution? If the posterior distribution has a very large variance or it is something like a uniform distribution, many very different values can be used as the estimations to the parameters and they may be very close to each other in terms of their probabilities.
