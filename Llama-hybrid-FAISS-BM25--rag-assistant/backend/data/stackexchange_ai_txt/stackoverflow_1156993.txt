Fast, searchable dict storage for Python

Current I use SQLite (w/ SQLAlchemy ) to store about 5000 dict objects. Each dict object corresponds to an entry in PyPI with keys - (name, version, summary .. sometimes 'description' can be as big as the project documentation). Writing these entries (from JSON) back to the disk (SQLite format) takes several seconds, and it feels slow. Writing is done as frequent as once a day, but reading/searching for a particular entry based on a key (usually name or description) is done very often. Just like apt-get. Is there a storage library for use with Python that will suit my needs better than SQLite?
