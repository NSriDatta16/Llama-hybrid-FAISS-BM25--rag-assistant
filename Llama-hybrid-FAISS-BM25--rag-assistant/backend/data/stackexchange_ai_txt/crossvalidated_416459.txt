Estimating and doing inference about proportions when individual indicators are themselves estimated

I have a sample of $N$ units and $T$ observations per unit. For each of these units $i$ , I estimate a measure of dependence between two variables, $Y_{it}$ and $X_{it}$ . Call the estimated measure $\hat{\rho_i}$ At the unit level, I can use the standard error of $\hat{\rho_i}$ to carry out hypothesis tests and confidence intervals about the true dependence $\rho_i$ But how can I estimate the proportion of units with (say) a positive dependence, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i 1(\rho_i > 0)$ and construct tests/confidence intervals for that? Clearly, I can't just replace $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i 1(\rho_i > 0)$ with $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i 1(\hat{\rho_i} > 0)$ because $\hat{\rho_i}$ is never going to be exactly zero even if the true unit dependence is zero. The proportion estimator has got to take into account the (unit-varying) strength of evidence for a positive dependence at the unit level. One basic solution would be to look at the fraction of units with positive $\hat{\rho_i}$ for which the no-dependence can be rejected at confidence level $\alpha$ %, but that's not really what I want. It seems to me that if I would model $1(\rho_i > 0)$ as a Bernoulli random variable at the unit level, $\Pr(\rho_i > 0|Y_{it}, X_{it})$ , I could just use the binomial distribution with different probabilities to do inference about the proportion of units with positive dependence. But that seems to be a Bayesian approach. What's the general frequentist approach for this type of problem?
