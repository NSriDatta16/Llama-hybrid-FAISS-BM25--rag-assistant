I use Infragistics chart control. Why... because it's part of the library of controls that we already have a subscription to. That ringing endorsement aside. Their chart control is very flexible. It supports many different chart types including the ones you've mentioned. They also support composite charts (several different charts within the same chart control). I will warn you though; learning their development style is not trivial.
