heroku+s3+paperclip

Guys, I'm having a problem with s3...I'm trying to configure the s3 this way to work with the paperclip: has_attached_file :photo, :storage => :s3, :bucket => 'gallerybucket', :styles => { :small => ["150", :png], :large => ["500", :png], :very_large => ['750x500>', :png] }, :path => ":rails_root/public/images/:class/:attachment/:id/:style_:basename.png", :url => "/images/:class/:attachment/:id/:style_:basename.png", :default_url => "/images/sem_imagem.gif", :s3_credentials => { :access_key_id => ENV['ac'], :secret_access_key => ENV['sc'] } but it always shows me this error. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here. Is there some configuration missing?
