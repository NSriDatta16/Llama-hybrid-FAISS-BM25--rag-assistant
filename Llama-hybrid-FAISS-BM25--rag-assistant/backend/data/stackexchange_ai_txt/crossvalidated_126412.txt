How do you call a Markov chain with idempotent transition probability matrix?

I don't recall ever seeing a term to refer to Markov chains for which all the transition probabilities matrices are equal ($P^{(n)}=P\quad\forall\,n\in\mathbb{N}$) but I'm sure there should be one.... We statisticians like to put names to stuff.
