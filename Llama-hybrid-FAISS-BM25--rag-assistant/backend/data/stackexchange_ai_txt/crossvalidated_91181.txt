Given the stated sample size (150,000), why do you think there will be bias due to "small sample" size? You have 1500 observations of the positive case, which I wouldn't normally think of as being small . An alternative in R is the brglm package, which also implements Firth's method. However, I was recently pointed to a paper ( Gelman et al 2008 ) which showed Firth's method performing quite badly compared to other methods for bias reduction, in a Bayesian context. The authors of that paper wrote the bayesglm() function in R package arm to provide a range of priors on the model coefficients (Firth's method boils down to a particular choice of prior in the model; a Jeffreys prior). My main reason for mentioning it is that it may also work more efficiently than the options considered thus far.
