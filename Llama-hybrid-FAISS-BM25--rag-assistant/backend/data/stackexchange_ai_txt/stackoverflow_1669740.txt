The problem may be hidden in the All flash movie code part... :P Flash embedding is tricky, there is many different way to embed it leading to different result. That's why ppl use libraries instead of writing plain html/js. The most popular and standard way to embed Flash is to use swfObject . Or you use jQuery, there is flashembed from jQuery Tools . Both of them works in all major browsers, able to handle things like flashVars, embed params etc.
