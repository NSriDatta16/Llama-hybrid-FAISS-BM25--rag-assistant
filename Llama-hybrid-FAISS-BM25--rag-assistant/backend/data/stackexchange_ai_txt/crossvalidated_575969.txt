Transforming ordinal logistic regression coefficients to beta weights

Ordinal logistic regression analysis result in coefficients which are log odds, and not b or beta weights, like in a linear regression. For example: How can I compare the log odds of the DVs? Is it correct to say that DV1 effect on the IV is 11%, compared to DV2 (-0.071/-0.619)? Is there any way to convert the log odds to beta weights?
