Use ColumnTransformer, applying SelectKBest only to the continuous variables. You can apply some other feature selection/transformation to the categorical variables, or set remainder=passthrough to send the categorical features through untouched (aside from the order of the columns). To the broader question, some feature selection methods should be applicable to different feature types (model-based wrapper methods come to mind). But feature selection is particularly tricky, so experimenting with your data is probably best.
