Calculate Max value, Min value, and Average in SQL

I am running the script below. I was wondering if someone knows how to add three additional rows to the result: 1.add a new row with the MAX value 2.add a new row with the MIN value. 3.add a new row with the average. Here is my query which run on two full month of April and May of 2006 data. SELECT DATEPART(YYYY, DATEADD(MM, 3, SOLD_DATE)) AS FY, DATENAME(WEEKDAY, SOLD_DATE) AS DAY, STORE_NAME AS STORE, CONVERT (VARCHAR, SOLD_DATE, 10) DATES, SUM(ITEMS) AS ITEM, 'NUMBER' AS NOTE FROM MYTABLE WHERE SOLD_DATE >='04/1/2006' AND SOLD_DATE The query yields the following result(partial), with the desired additional rows at the bottom of the result. FY DAY STORE DATES ITEM NOTE 2006 Saturday ELEVEN 4/1/2006 14 NUMBER 2006 Sunday ELEVEN 4/2/2006 21 NUMBER 2006 Monday ELEVEN 4/3/2006 24 NUMBER -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- 2006 Monday ELEVEN 5/29/2006 37 NUMBER 2006 Tuesday ELEVEN 5/30/2006 20 NUMBER 2006 Wednesday ELEVEN 5/31/2006 25 NUMBER 2006 Saturday ELEVEN 5/13/2006 5 MINIMUM 2006 Tuesday ELEVEN 5/16/2006 61 MAXIMUM 2006 ELEVEN 25 AVERAGE
