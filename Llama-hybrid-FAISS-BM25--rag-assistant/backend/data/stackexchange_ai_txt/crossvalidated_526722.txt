You can use logistic regression to do this. Let the answer $A$ denote a positive outcome, and $B$ a negative outcome (in logistic regression, 1 and 0 respectively). We can examine how group membership changes the probability of answering $A$ adjusting for age, education, and gender. The model would be $$ \operatorname{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mbox{age} + \beta_2 \mbox{edu} + \beta_3 \mbox{gender} + \beta_4 \mbox{is in group 2} + \beta_5 \mbox{is in group3} $$ Here, the groups have been treated as a categorical variable, using group 1 as the reference group. I suspect you might also want to make education a categorical variable, but I'm not sure how you coded that. In this model, the reference group is group 1, and so the tests for coefficients 4 and 5 will tell you if there is a difference between groups 1 and 2 and groups 1 and 3. If you're interested in differences between 2 and 3, you'd need to do an adjustment to the tests to account for multiple comparisons. If you're using something like R, the emmeans package is helpful for this.
