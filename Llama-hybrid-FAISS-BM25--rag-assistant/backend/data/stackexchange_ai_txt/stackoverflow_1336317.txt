From memory, since I last used it about a year ago: Hpricot stores attributes in a fixed-size buffer, and some frameworks generate outrageously long hashes in document attributes. There's some static field you can set before parsing that lets you set the size of this buffer. I remember it being fairly prominent in the docs on the webpage, though of course it's gone now.
