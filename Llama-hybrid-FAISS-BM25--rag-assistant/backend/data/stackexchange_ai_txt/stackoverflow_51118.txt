You can leverage MySql in a number of ORMs, one of which is NHibernate. For the most part you can treat it as if you were running on SQL Server or Oracle. And with Linq2NHibernate, you can get nice LINQ syntax. You'd lose the SqlDataSource control, but some would argue that it would actually be a blessing :) And of course you'd lose Linq2SQL. EntityFramework will have 3rd party adapters MySql, Oracle and a few others soon after release.
