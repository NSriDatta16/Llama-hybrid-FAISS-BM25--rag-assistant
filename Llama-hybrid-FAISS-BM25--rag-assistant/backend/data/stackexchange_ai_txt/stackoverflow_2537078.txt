This is possible with some Javascript. I call the following algorithm Columns_Fit : First find the column with the smallest height and the column with the greatest height. Remove a word from the first paragraph of the greatest column that you found in step #1, and add that word to the smallest column that you found on step #1. Compare the height of the two columns. If their still different, repeat step #2. That's the principle of the algorithm. You should repeat that for every column by "going to the middle" approach, for example: The above columns are order from the smallest one ( col1 ) to the highest one ( col4 ). Start with col1 and col4 , and perform on them Columns_Fit algorithm. Later, perform the Columns_Fit algorithm on the next two column: col2 and col3 . This is why I call this approach "going to the middle". Note that not all columns can be exactly equal in height, there should be a deviation in the height. The deviation is equal to the line height or greater than the line height. (deviation >= line height) Interesting reference: Cross-Column Pull-Outs by Daniel M. Frommelt @ alistapart.com
