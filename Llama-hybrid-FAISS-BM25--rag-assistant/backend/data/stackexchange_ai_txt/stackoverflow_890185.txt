If you insist on making stringArray an array as oppossed to a std::vector<> (which would be the right thing to do) you have to either: Make two passes (one to count, you see) Implement a dynamic array yourself. Using a vector is easier vector::push_back() appends new stuff to the end. So: vector* explode(string s){ vector *v = new vector //... // in a loop v->push_back(string_fragment); //... return v; } Not needed after all Left in for completeness. To return the array of strings you use char ** . As in char ** explode(const char *in){ ... } BTW-- How will the calling function know how many elements are in the returned array? You'll have to solve that too. Use std::vector<> unless you are constrained by outside forces...
