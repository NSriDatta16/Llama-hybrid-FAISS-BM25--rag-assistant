@Robert, I think you've already answered your own question when you said you should trim them (before) they reach the view. So in your Business logic, as a preference over the repository, you might want to do a lamda to trim off the excess so to speak. Im my opinion I would never return any records to the view that the user wasn't allowed to see. Why increase risk and traffic? As for the bookmarks I think there you're going to need to do some business logic preventing them from going to the url when access no longer exists. I thought the controller was simply there to service the data to the page and not to have any logic as such so I'd prefer the business layer approach for this one as it does appear to be a business rule. That might not be what you had in mind but unless there is a better approach it's the one I would use.
