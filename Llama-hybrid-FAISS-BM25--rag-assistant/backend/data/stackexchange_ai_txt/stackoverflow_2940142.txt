If you're using prepared statements and SQL placeholders and never interpolating user input directly into your SQL strings, you can skip the SQL sanitization entirely. When you use placeholders, the structure of the SQL statement ( SELECT foo, bar, baz FROM my_table WHERE id = ? ) is send to the database engine separately from the data values which are (eventually) bound to the placeholders. This means that, barring major bugs in the database engine, there is absolutely no way for the data values to be misinterpreted as SQL instructions, so this provides complete protection from SQL injection attacks without requiring you to mangle your data for storage.
