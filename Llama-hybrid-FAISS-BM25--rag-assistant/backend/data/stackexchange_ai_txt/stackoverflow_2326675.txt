Wichita State’s Software Usability Research Lab has done a series of studies on font whose results can be used to select the right font and size for your purposes. For raw readability of paragraphs of text, 12 point Tahoma appears to consistently perform the best . Cambria may be better at reading individual characters (they didn’t test it for reading paragraphs, and didn’t test it directly against Tahoma). In general, 12 point is better than 10, but 14 is not better than 12 , unless you’re talking elderly users . If size is the only way you distinguish headers, then, according to MIL-STD 1472, each level should be at least 25% larger than the next lower level. So, if you use H1 through H3 and 12 point paragraphs, then H3 = 15 pt, H2 = 19 pt, and H1 = 24 pt (minimums). However, if you’re using other means to indicate the hierarchy, such as indenting, bold font, or a section number scheme (like #.#.#), then some levels may be the same size as others. Number and unnumbered lists should use 12 point since they are typically sentences. You might be able to get away with a smaller font for table content or data fields, maybe as small as 9 point, since the user is generally scanning and reading only one word or number at a time, but I don’t know of any study that actually compared the scan/scroll vs. readability tradeoff.
