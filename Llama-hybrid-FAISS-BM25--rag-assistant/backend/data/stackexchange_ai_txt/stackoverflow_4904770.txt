First, I would strongly encourage you to abandon using eval. It's very unsecure and not good to use. Second, you can accomplish this without eval like so: function openWindow(URL) { day = new Date(); id = day.getTime(); windowCol[id] = window.open(URL, id, 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=600,height=800,left = 650,top = 250'); } And just to avoid confusion, even though "window" works as a function name, I'd suggest changing it to make the code more readable as it may get confused with the global window object.
