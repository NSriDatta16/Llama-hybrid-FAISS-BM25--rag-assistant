Well you haven't defined what "error" means, so I'll just assume that you want the log loss. First, you need to create your SVC object telling it you'll want probability estimations: model = sklearn.svm.SVC(probability=True) Then you can compute the log loss given said estimation: probs = model.predict_proba(x) loss = sklearn.metrics.log_loss(y_true=y, y_pred=probs)
