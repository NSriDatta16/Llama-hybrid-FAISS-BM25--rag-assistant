Apple.com relies on the client's QuickTime plugin. They don't leverage a special version of the QT player, they build on top of (literally) the default player. This is how they customize the look of the controller and it's unique functionality; making it similar across browsers. It relies heavily on custom imagery and javascript. Check out the object's documentation , and even the source of the iPad video to see how they built the controller. After some quick Googling, I couldn't find any sort of js library/plugin to ease the QT customization process. Anyone got one?
