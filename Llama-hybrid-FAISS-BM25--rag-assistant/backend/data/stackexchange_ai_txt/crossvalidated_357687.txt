Finding the change point before a significant increase

I have the following time series: df This is the plot: Questions/Problems I would like to know, which point in the time series is the start of a significant trend. Applying a Mann-Kendall trend test for the whole time series gives a significant trend. However,by visual inspection, the time series does not have an increasing trend at least over the fisrt half. This is like a changepoint problem, but I am not sure, which detection method is appropriate for this. I just want to determine the point in the time series before the most significant increasing trend. I am thinking of a moving Mann-Kendall trend test and plotting the corresponding tau statistic. But I dont know how to set a threshold value and test the significance of the tau statistics. Any suggestions on how to do this correctly in R? I'll appreciate any help.
