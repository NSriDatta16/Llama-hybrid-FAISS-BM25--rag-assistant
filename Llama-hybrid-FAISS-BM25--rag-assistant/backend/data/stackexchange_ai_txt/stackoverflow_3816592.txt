Another approach that can work is to use the #pragma warning( ... ) modifiers. This lets you controls specific warnings as well as the overall setting. See the documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2c8f766e(v=vs.80).aspx If a library or subproject causes a problem then you might be able to turn off warnings for it in a single place. Modifying the project file for subsets of your files can get very messy very quickly, especially if you have multiple architectures and targets (debug, release, ...) I prefer to modify the project files by hand in a text editor for this type of change so I am sure that everything is happening as expected.
