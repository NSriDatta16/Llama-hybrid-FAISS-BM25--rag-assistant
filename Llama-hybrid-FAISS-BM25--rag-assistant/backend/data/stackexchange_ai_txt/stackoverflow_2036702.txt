I dont know how asp.net environments are usually set up. I am assuming i have a root path that is not available from the web, a bin/ where i may put my asp.net dll and a public where i stick in any files i want. This is wrong assumption! You have a root folder, which IS available in public. You set IIS or ASP.NEt Development Server to this folder. (optional, but always needed) You have a web.config file in this root folder for configuration You have a bin folder for your assemblies (each page or user control "include" compiles to a class) (optional) You have App_Data as default folder for file-based DBs and/or other data files (say XML storage, ..) (optional) You have an App_theme folder for styling and images. Read about ASP.NET themes. (optional) You can add App_Code folder if you want to add classes to be compiled by the server. You can create folders for scripts, etc... Normally for complex logic, etc.. you create in a separate project outside the root and reference the result assembly in the bin folder. Seriously, you cannot do ASP.NET work without an IDE or a manual. Visual Web Developer 2008 Express IDE is free and http://asp.net has tons of resources for getting started.
