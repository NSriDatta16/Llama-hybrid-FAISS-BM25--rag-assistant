You're right. If your training set contains only points $X \in [0, 1]$, and the test only $X \in [4, 5]$, then ay tree based model will not be able to generalize even a simple linear relationship like $y \approx 2x$ outside of the domain covered by the training set. Instead, the learned model will predict a constant for all $X \in (1, \infty)$, since this range is greater than the largest possible split point for any tree. This is not really an issue with the trees though. It's an often unstated, but important, assumption of any (*) machine learning model that the training and testing sets are samples from the same population . This means that joint distribution of $X, Y$ should be the same for both the training and testing data sets. The validity of most methods, for example cross validation, rests on this assumption. (*) Not really any , but most.
