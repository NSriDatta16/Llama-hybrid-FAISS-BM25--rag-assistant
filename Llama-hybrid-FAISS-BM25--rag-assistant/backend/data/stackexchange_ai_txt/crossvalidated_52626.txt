Negative logarithms are not a problem. All they mean is that your prices are less than 1 in whatever currency you are using. This is basic mathematics: e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm Thus you should not add 1 before taking logarithms. That said, I don't know how you get price elasticity out of time series because I am not an economist, but I suspect no harm would be done by your telling us more about your dataset, notably what variables you have.
