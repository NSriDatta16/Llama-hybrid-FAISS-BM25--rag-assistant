Storing values of an array in one variable

I am trying to use md5 code to calculate checksums of file. Now the given function prints out the (previously calculated) checksum on screen, but I want to store it in a variable, to be able to compare it later on. I guess the main problem is that I want to store the content of an array in one variable. How can I manage that? Probably this is a very stupid question, but maybe somone can help. Below is the function to print out the value. I want to modify it to store the result in one variable. static void MDPrint (MD5_CTX* mdContext) { int i; for (i = 0; i digest[i]); } // end of for } // end of function For reasons of completeness the used struct: /* typedef a 32 bit type */ typedef unsigned long int UINT4; /* Data structure for MD5 (Message Digest) computation */ typedef struct { UINT4 i[2]; /* number of _bits_ handled mod 2^64 */ UINT4 buf[4]; /* scratch buffer */ unsigned char in[64]; /* input buffer */ unsigned char digest[16]; /* actual digest after MD5Final call */ } MD5_CTX; and the used function to calculate the checksum: static int MDFile (char* filename) { FILE *inFile = fopen (filename, "rb"); MD5_CTX mdContext; int bytes; unsigned char data[1024]; if (inFile == NULL) { printf ("%s can't be opened.\n", filename); return -1; } // end of if MD5Init (&mdContext); while ((bytes = fread (data, 1, 1024, inFile)) != 0) MD5Update (&mdContext, data, bytes); MD5Final (&mdContext); MDPrint (&mdContext); printf (" %s\n", filename); fclose (inFile); return 0; }
