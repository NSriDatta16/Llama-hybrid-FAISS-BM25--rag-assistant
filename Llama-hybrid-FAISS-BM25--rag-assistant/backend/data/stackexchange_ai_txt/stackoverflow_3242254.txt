C# HTTPS Post. Web Server Throwing "Not Well formed" Exception

Im attempting a Https post from a C# application. I could connect to the web server and authinticate the user. The server is configured to send through some data in responce to a POST query. If tried from a browser the server does repond properly. However, when I attempt the same query from my application, the server responds with an error saying "Server exception: not well-formed" Its an Apache webserver running on Cent OS. Below is the code. Could anyone help me with this. Thanks in advance. Example of a POST link that server responds to correctly when tried from a browser: https://some.server.com/some/local_dir/abc.cgi?command=ACommand&entitytype=AnEntity My C# code: ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = delegate { return true; }; NetworkCredential nc = new NetworkCredential("User", "Password"); CredentialCache cc = new CredentialCache(); cc.Add("https://some.server.com", 443, "Basic", nc); HttpWebRequest WebRequest = (HttpWebRequest)System.Net.WebRequest.Create("https://some.server.com/some/local_dir/abc.cgi"); WebRequest.KeepAlive = true; WebRequest.Method = "POST"; WebRequest.AllowAutoRedirect = false; WebRequest.Credentials = cc; WebRequest.PreAuthenticate = true; WebRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; WebRequest.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; " + "Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; " + ".NET CLR 2.0.50215)"; byte[] AuthBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("User:Password"); string sAuth = Convert.ToBase64String(AuthBytes); WebRequest.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Basic " + sAuth); byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("command=ACommand&entitytype=AnEntity"); using (Stream requestStream = WebRequest.GetRequestStream()) { requestStream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); } try { WebResponse response = WebRequest.GetResponse(); Console.WriteLine(new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()).ReadToEnd()); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine("Exception: "+ex.Message); } Server responce: 12790618993000Server exception: not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 7
