I don't think averaging the coefficients make any sense. But why would you want to do it? If you want to build multiple logistic models, you can just build them, use the predicted probabilities to make classification and then average the classified decision. If you are talking about cross-validation, each individual model is expected to be different (otherwise CV is pointless). You would use your cross-validation results to estimate your out-of-sample errors. Again, there is no need to average the coefficients.
