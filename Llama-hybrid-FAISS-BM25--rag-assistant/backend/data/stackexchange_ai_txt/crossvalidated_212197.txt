It is fairly simple. If you want predictions of $x$ and $y$ for time $T+h$, you can simply use \begin{align} \hat x_{T+h|T}&=A^h\hat x_{T|T}\\ \hat y_{T+h|T}&=C\hat x_{T+h|T} \end{align} where $\hat x_{T|T}$ is the filtered (or smoothed, it's the same in this case) estimate of the latent variable. You'll find more details in Chapter 13.3 of Hamilton (1994) Time Series Analysis. This assumes that $A$ and $C$ are known, or at least that you have some estimates. They are likely unknown, so in a first step you'd need to estimate them by e.g. maximizing the likelihood. Then, just use your estimated $A$ and $C$ in the equations above.
