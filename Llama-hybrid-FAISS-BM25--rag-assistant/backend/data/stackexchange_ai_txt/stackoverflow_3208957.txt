PHP and Runtime Subclassing / Object reclassification

Basic setup. I have a classA instance which is a subclass of classX ... On construction (or sometime else), I want it to load another class classB which is also a subclass of classX and replace itself with classB in situ. Sort of like a factory, but one that replaces itself transparently. If need be, I can wrap classB with classA if there is a way to (at runtime) change the subclass of an object. Currently I am using classA::__call() to emulate MRO magic, but is seems very inelegant. This needs to be done transparently to the caller of classA/B so that to the outside world, it isn't aware that classA has replaced itself with classB after construction (or anywhere else for that matter). I know PHP can be a bit thin when doing things like this ... I am suspecting we can't, but it would be handy for my situation. Also, 5.3 but ideally (yuck) 5.2/x Thanks in advance (wishing I was coding in Python)
