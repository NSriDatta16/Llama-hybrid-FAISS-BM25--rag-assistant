I'm going to make a bold assumption here that you are a beginner. @Nuclear03020704 is completely right in saying that two reasons why your model did not give a significant result are that The relation is indeed insignificant. The model used is poorly designed, incorrect, or incapable of capturing the relationship. There is no way to be sure of reason 1 other than by trying to remedy reason 2. If you have a complex or messy data set, and you have not learned medium to advanced techniques for building models, then you can't remedy reason 2 without learning some new stuff. As for the ordinal scale, there is a proper model for this case called ordinal logistic regression , which is an extension of bivariate logistic regression to more levels. You can perform this test in R or other statistical software. If you are creating a composite score from multiple ordinal attributes, then I would strongly suggest you do one or both of the following: Hit the literature hard to see how previous investigators have handled their outcome variable(s). Consult an experienced statistician to help you figure out a solid, supportable approach. If your effect is real, then a poor model can easily give you a false negative. Or, perhaps worse, a "true" positive with the wrong effect. If your effect is not there, then a poor model can give you a false positive. Refine your model.
