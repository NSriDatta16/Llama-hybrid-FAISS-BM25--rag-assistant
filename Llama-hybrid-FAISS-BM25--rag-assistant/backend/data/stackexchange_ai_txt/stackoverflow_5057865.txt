Error when trying to use function composition in Haskell

I have just began recently to learn Haskell, more specifically on the topics of function composition, partial functions, maps, filters and sectioning. On one of the exercises am asked to modify the twoFilters function by using function composition. I have read a few wikis on . but am having quite a hard time getting it to work correctly. As i understand it, it works by performing the functions b . a on alphabetical order and returning the result. In other words x = foo a and then foo b of x . However after applying several "variations/possibilities" with the bellow two filters functions i cant get it to compile due to errors. greaterThanOne :: Int -> Bool greaterThanOne = (>1) lessThanTen :: Int -> Bool lessThanTen = ( [Int] twoFilters xs= filter lessThanTen (filter greaterThanOne xs) These two being the unsuccessful attempts I had most confidence on; twoFilters xs = filter (lessThanTen . greaterThanOne xs) twoFilters xs = filter (lessThanTen xs . greaterThanOne xs) Where on the reasoning am I going wrong?
