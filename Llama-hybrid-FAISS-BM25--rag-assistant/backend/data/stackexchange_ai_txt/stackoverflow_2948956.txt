Make line equation Check if your point satisfies that equation. The equation of line passing 2 arbitrary points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is: (y1-y2)x + (x2-x1)y + (x1*y2 - x2*y1) = 0 In your case the line is just vertical and its equation is x = 50 If you also want to check if point belongs to the line segment rather than to the whole line you can check that the following inequality holds (in addition to the previous condition) (may be it is not the most elegant/efficient solution): (x-x1)*(x-x2)+(y-y1)*(y-y2)
