How to use parameterize in Rails?

I want to convert the title of a page to a friendly URL and store it in the database as a permalink. My problem is I can't use the parameterize method. It's not working. Other inflections are working like upcase or downcase but parameterize is not working. Is there a special case for parameterize ? This is my code: Controller: def create params[:page][:permalink] = params[:page][:title].dup @page = Page.new(params[:page]) end Model: class Page
