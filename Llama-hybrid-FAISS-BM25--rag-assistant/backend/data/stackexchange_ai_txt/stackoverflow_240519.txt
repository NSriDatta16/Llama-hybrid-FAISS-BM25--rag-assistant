Patterns : Java class conversion from axis objects

I use a axis to auto-generate webservice artifacts which I then convert into objects used within our application. Is there a sensible pattern for doing this ? We have written transform methods to output our objects from the axis created objects, at other times we have written an intermediate set of transformer classes that transform the axis objects to our application objects? Is there a common way of approaching this?
