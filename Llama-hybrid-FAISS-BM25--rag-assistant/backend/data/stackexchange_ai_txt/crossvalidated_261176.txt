decomposition of time series into many time series

I have two time series $x_t$ represents expected default rate from one data provider $y_t$ represent expected default rate from another data provider. Correlation between $y_t$ and $x_t$ is 0.9 However, the level between $x_t$ and $y_t$ is significantly different due to the data provider. One pattern of $x_t$ is the data provider provides some components of $x_t$ as well (expected default rates for 5 different countries): $x_{t,k}$ for $k=1$ to 5 I would like to decompose $y_t$ into the 5 different countries given the information in $x_t$ (with the inclusion of noise since the coleration coefficient is not perfect). Do you know a statistical method?
