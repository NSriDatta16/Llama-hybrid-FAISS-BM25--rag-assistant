How to know when to use Kernel SVM and not Linear SVM?

If I have more than 3 features in a dataset, then I can't visualize them to see if my classes are scattered in a non linear fashion. So how do I know when is the right way to use linear model with non-linear(polynomial) basis function in logistic regression or Support Vector Machines?. I just don't want to use a kernel function in SVM without knowing why that should be used. Is there a way to know when to use Kernel functions of non linear basis functions in a linear model by looking at the data?
