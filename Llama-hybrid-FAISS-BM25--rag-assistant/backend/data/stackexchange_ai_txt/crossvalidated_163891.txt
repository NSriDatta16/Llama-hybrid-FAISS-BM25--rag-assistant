Collecting "good" features (e.g., such features that lead to maximum accuracy) in advance, is in general, not always possible. Therefore, we collect "alot" of features in the hope that "good" features are among them. After we collected alot of features we often use feature selection/extraction methods, in order to reduce them to a smaller set of features, that lead to promising results. However, this doesn't always work as there are many pitfalls. For example there are "bad" features that in combination can work much better as a single "good" feature. So we must take this also into account. Here you can find 7 techniques for data dimensionality reduction. Have a look on these...
