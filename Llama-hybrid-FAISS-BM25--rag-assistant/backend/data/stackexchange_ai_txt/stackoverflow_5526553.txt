You would probably have better luck putting the code into viewDidAppear rather than viewWillAppear . The latter tends to be called right at the start of any animation such as a modal beginning to slide off the screen; the former tends to be called when that animation has completely finished. Note that even if this strategy works, you may end up with a weird effect whereby two modals are seen to slide off, one after the other; I presume you just want one sliding off effect. What happens if you dismiss the "lower down" modal dialog (the one first pushed), and don't bother dismissing the one that is topmost? Also consider paying attention to the animated argument when dismissing your modal view controller. Different combinations of animated or not can have different effects when you have problems like yours. If you post a more complete code sample we can give a better answer!
