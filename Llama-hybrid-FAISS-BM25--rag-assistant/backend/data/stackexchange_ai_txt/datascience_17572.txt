Application of Machine learning or Neural Networks for automatic Time table scheduling

I've been trying to come up with an intelligent solution to build a Time table scheduling application with the use of Machine learning or Neural networks. What would be the algorithm or approach to build such application. I'm planing to take data from google calendar API and through the system. The system should purpose best time slots to conduct lectures considering the data taken from lecturers and students. I found some research documents where they have used some genetic algorithms but can this be done with the help of neural networks?
