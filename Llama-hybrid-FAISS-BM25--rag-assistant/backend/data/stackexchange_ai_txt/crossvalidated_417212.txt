How to superimpose rotated histograms and/or bell curves on the side of a scatterplot

Does anyone know how to superimpose a rotated density plot and/or histogram on the right-hand-side of a scatter plot? I'm agnostic about what software could be used to do this...ideally it would be R . My primary goal is to explain QQplots. In the one below, we have theoretical quantiles on the x-axis, and sample quantiles on the y-axis. I want to superimpose a bell curve on the x-axis, and show how each x-coordinate is a quantile, and then I want to show how each y-coordinate is a quantile on histogram/bell-curve as well. To do this I would place a histogram or bell curve on the right hand side of the plot, rotated counter-clockwise 45 degrees. Being able to do this would help making cooler-looking trace plots for MCMC diagnostics as well.
