I believe a more elegant solution is to simply present the user with a confirmation page (instead of an alert box), and place a link to the previous page there. That would at lease work for all users. For those users with javascript a little Ajax (jQuery) could submit the form for you, and display the confirmation nessage. All without leaving the page the user is on (negating the need for any fancy redirects).
