The biggest problem you have is that your analysis of pairwise correlations could severely limit your ability to understand the underlying issues. Seldom in biomedical research does one variable depend on exactly one other without influences from any of the rest. Yet that is all your pairwise correlations will illustrate. Also, if you have RNAseq data you presumably have information on expression of about 20,000 genes, not just 45. It might not be wise to throw out the information about the other 19,955. In terms of your intended applications, it is seldom true that a drug will affect expression of only a single gene, and altering/curing a clinical phenotype will similarly affect expression of hundreds of genes. There is a large and well developed set of methods for assessing the relations of biologic phenotypes with large-scale gene-expression data, dating back to the dark ages of microarray methods. For binary phenotypes, Gene Set Expression Analysis ( GSEA ), in the nearly 15 years since its introduction, has received a large amount of attention with respect to statistical significance testing in terms of FDR and FWER. For relations of continuous biologic variables or survival data to gene expression, LASSO, ridge regression, or their combination in elastic net can be very useful, with many questions about those approaches answered on this site. If you for some reason need to restrict analysis to these 45 genes, consider multiple-predictor rather than pairwise approaches. For example, set up a separate model for each of your 25 phenotypes with all 45 genes considered as predictors in a linear or logistic regression or another model structure appropriate to the nature of the phenotype. Apply your favorite FDR or FWER criterion to the set of 25 models and their overall p -values to restrict false-positive models/phenotypes. Then focus on validating the models of the phenotypes that pass that first testing hurdle. I understand that this doesn't address the question that you asked, but sometimes on this site the best solution to the underlying problem is to suggest a different approach rather than to answer the question as posed.
