I think the main benefit of a DVCS comes when you want to push your changes directly to other people (or machines, e.g. taking the repository home with you), without going through a central hub. If you have the need to do this, a DVCS is definitely the way to go. If, as you say, all you are doing with a DVCS is creating a central hub that everyone pushes their changes to then you’re not really taking advantage of the main purpose of a DVCS and I would say SVN is sufficient. P.S. One might also make the argument that a DVCS encourages users to commit more often since they can do so in their personal repository and only publish their changes when they’re ready — but this can be easily accomplished in SVN using branches, with the only “downside” being that “personal” commits increment the version number of the whole repository.
