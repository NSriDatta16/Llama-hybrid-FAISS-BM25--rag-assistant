On the server side you can try this if you have access to the response (you might be able to do it through filters). response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); response.setHeader("Expires", "0"); Another trick you can try on the client side is to add an superfluous argument to the url like " http://www.company.com/services/staff?id=xxx&requestTime= "+(new Date()).getTime(); This way the url being request is different every time and it can't be cached.
