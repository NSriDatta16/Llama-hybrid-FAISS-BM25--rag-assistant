How to extract semantic slots like: person=”Obama”, attribute=”birthday” for questions“what is the birthday of Obama” and “when did Obama born”. As far as I know, models like CRF, RNN can’t label sentences which don’t contain slotvalue like “birthday” in “when did Obama born?”. What kind of model can I use?
