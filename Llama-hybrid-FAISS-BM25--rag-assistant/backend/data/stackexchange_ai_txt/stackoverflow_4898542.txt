Assuming that the following code should be executed after a file has been uploaded, you are doing it wrong (Sorry, couldn't resist today). $(document).ready() should only be called once, after DOM init. $(document).ready(function(){ .... $('#upload_container').html(" ); dragme(); .... }); Also, you probably don't want to define functions after DOM initialization, which you are doing with the dragme() function. This will most likely result in unwanted behaviour that you are seeing across different browsers: Firefox still states that the dragme() function hasn't been defined even though it is there - so I believe that I am calling it incorrectly. The above behaviour is most likely a result of this. Since you are dynamically adding files by uploading them, you could do something like this: $(file).uploaded(function(result) { var img = $(' '); $('#upload_container').append(img). $(img).draggable(); });
