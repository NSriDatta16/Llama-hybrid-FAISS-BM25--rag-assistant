How can I grep a paragraph in Perl?

I have a log file which needs to be properly formatted into a readable format. However the text file has no static number of lines or fixed primary values and has random number of spaces but has only a log file header which can be used to pin point the start and end of each time the application logs. An Example of the log file: Log File header Log File header After the script has been formatted it should look something like this: Log File header Log File header Therefore I need some advice on greping out an entire paragraph everytime the Perl Script detects a "Log File header". Here is the grep perl script: #!/usr/bin/perl #use 5.010; # must be present to import the new 5.10 functions, notice #that it is 5.010 not 5.10 my $file = "/root/Desktop/Logfiles.log"; open LOG, $file or die "The file $file has the error of:\n => $!"; @lines = ; close (LOG); @array = grep(/Log File header/, @lines); print @array; Can someone please give some advice on the codes? Thanks.
