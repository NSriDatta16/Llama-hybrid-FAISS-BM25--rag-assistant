Criterion for quality of MCMC proposal in a simple discrete setting

Let's say I have a discrete distribution $p$ over n states that I want to sample from, but I only know a similar probability distribution $q$ . However, I can obtain unnormalized probabilities $c \cdot p(i), \ i \in {1, ..., n}$ at a high computational cost. To get approximate samples from $p$ I was considering using MCMC with a state-independent (so non-local) proposal $q$ . Is this a good approach? Furthermore, what would be a good criterion to measure the quality of $q$ as a proposal in this context? I considered $D_{KL}(p||q)$ , $D_{KL}(q||p)$ and $D_{JS}(p, q)$ but I'm not sure if there is a good theoretical argument for any of them.
