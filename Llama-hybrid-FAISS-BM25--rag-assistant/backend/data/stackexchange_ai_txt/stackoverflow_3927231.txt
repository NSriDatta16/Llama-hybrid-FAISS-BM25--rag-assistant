How can you tell what Tables are taking up the most space in a SQL Server 2005 Database?

How can you tell what Tables are taking up the most space in a SQL Server 2005 Database? I am sure there is some System Stored Procedure that shows this information. I have a TEST database that grew from 1tb to 23tb. We are currently doing a lot of client conversion testing in the database, which entails running the same conversion Stored Procedure multiple times. It does DELETEs which I am sure is increasing the Transaction Log. But this got me thinking to ask this question. info the big problem is the dbo.Download table, it creates massive storage that is actually not needed, I had 3GB before truncating it, then 52MB ;)
