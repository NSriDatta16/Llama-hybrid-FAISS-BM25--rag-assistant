Do Sequential Monte Carlo simulations degenerate when you chain them together?

Context: Suppose that I run a Sequential Monte Carlo simulation with likelihood tempering to perform parameter inference on a filtering problem. This takes me from my (unspecified) prior distribution to a particle approximation of the posterior distribution on the model parameters. Question: Can I use this posterior distribution as the prior for a new simulation? How? What are the pitfalls? Motivating example: Suppose that a first SMC simulation uses uniform priors to estimate credible model parameters. Suppose that a second SMC simulation then takes this parameter distribution and conditions it on a new batch of data. The marginal likelihood of the first simulation would have little value, coming from uniform priors, but the marginal likelihood of the second simulation might represent goodness-of-fit for the model. Thoughts: Generally speaking it seems valid to reuse a posterior distribution as the prior for further inference. However, the specific particle approximation produced by SMC seems problematic: once the likelihood tempering process has completed the particles seem unlikely to produce good proposals for further inference e.g. based on random-walk MCMC rejuvenation steps. The particles will be too sparsely distributed to detect changes in the distribution. If that is accurate then I wonder how one can better rejuvenate the particles? Do you need to rerun the earlier SMC simulation(s) to ensure a smooth series of bridging distributions? Or do you introduce a new proposal distribution that covers more of the parameter space in between particles from the prior simulation? Or...?
