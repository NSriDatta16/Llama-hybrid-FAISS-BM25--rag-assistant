Adding to Tim's answer, this is more of a comment than a full answer, but I disagree with the premise that it is very important to know the underlying data distribution to develop a good model You say you have noticed this ...in many textbooks Can you provide some references to textbooks that make this assertion ? Having said that, let's not forget that machine learning is very commonly used for prediction tasks, and the models, as Tim notes, are quite often black boxes and they literally do not care what the underlying data generation process / distribution(s) are. On the other hand, models are also often used for inference, rather than prediction. It is very common to form a hypothesis about what the underlying data generation process is, then to collect some data and test the hypothesis that the model (an abstraction of the real underlying data generation process / distribution) fits the data well. This doesn't prove that the hypothesis is correct. At the end of the day, never forget that all models are wrong, but some are useful .
