Anyone know of a good open source spam checker in java or c#?

I'm creating a website where users can write articles and comment on the articles. I want to automatically check to see if a new article or comment is spam. What are good libraries for doing this? I looked at bayesian classifier libraries, but it seems that I would have to gather a large amount of samples and classify them all as spam or not spam myself... I'm looking for something that can hopefully just tell me right out of the box. UPDATE: Maybe if something like this doesn't exist, does anyone know of a download of a large amount of classifications of spam vs not spam that can be fed into a bayesian classifier?
