XtraReports Null Reference Exception

Anyone who used the XtraReports, i have created a databinding on one of my LINQ to SQL objects and dragged some properties over the report, but when i set the datasource to an object i get NullReferenceException in ShowPreview() method. If i don't set the DataSource i see the preview correctly (basically only the picturebox i set as background). Could this happen because some values are null? even i don't use them? if so is true, this is so pity. The Exception does not help more.
