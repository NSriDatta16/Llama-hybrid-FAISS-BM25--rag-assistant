If you look at the docs for the war command there is no such option. The only way you'll be able to achieve this is by writing your own grails command (using GAnt) that invokes the underlying Ant task with the compress=false option. You should then put this in the scripts directoy of your app or a plugin if you want to reuse it across several apps.
