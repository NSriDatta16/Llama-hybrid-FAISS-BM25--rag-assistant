In general, this is not a great idea to log on every exception creation. The catcher should really decide what is the best handling of an exception. Also overriding the method in exception and logging to a file breaks the general contract around exception. On a side note, you may discover some horrible performance problem related to logging at later stage. Given overriding happens in a central place you will have hard time fixing this. If you still want to log while throwing the exception then the better solution is to use/create a utility class like Throwables. Call the code as Throwables.logAndThrow(new CustomerException(...)), same one line of code but flexible for the long term. logAndThrow could be as simple as, using the logger technique of previous poster: public static void logAndThrow(Throwable t) { logger.warning(t); throw t; }
