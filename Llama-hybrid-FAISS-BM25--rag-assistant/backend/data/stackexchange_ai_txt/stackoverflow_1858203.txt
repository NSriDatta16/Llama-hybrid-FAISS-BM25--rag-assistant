Have a look at this question: Differentiating Between an AJAX Call / Browser Request The best answer from the above question is to check for a requested-by or custom header. Ultimately, your web server is receiving requests (including headers) of what the client sends you - all data that can be spoofed. If a user is determined, then any request can look like an AJAX request. I can't think of an elegant method to prevent this (there are inelegant and probably non-perfect methods whereby you provide a hash of some sort of request counter between ajax and non-ajax requests). Can I ask why your application is so sensitive to "ajax" pages being called directly? Could you design around this?
