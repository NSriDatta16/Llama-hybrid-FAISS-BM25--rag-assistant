The explicit event which gives distinguisher between two distributions

I am very very new in machine learning. Suppose two distributions generate binary numbers. For the 1st distribution, 0 occurs with a probability of 0.5; for 2nd, it is 0.51. I generate data from both and train. Then I create data from both and test the accuracy. It gives some accuracy. nstead of black box, I want to find the event by which it internally distinguishes the distributions. I use tensor flow.
