It really depends on what kind of information is being protected by the password. For example, the password requirement if you have user's financial informations should be much different than if you only have their name or something like that. Also, keep in mind that dictatorial password requirements will only encourage users to create insecure passwords that meet the requirements. You should have a fairly high cap on the number of characters you allow in the password (if users want to make their passwords extra strong, let them). You should also allow for users to use both upper and lowercase, allow them to use digits, and also allow them to use symbols in the password. As for requiring that the password is sufficiently secure, you should ensure that it is not identical to previous passwords except by a digit (e.g. incrementing a date in a password), you should ensure that it is not in the top XXX list of common passwords (e.g. don't allow "password1"), you should ensure that the password does not contain the username or user's email address. On the password change form, you should advise users to not use the same password as they use for their email address (or any other account that they connect with your website) -- although obviously you shouldn't attempt login to those connected services to check this.
