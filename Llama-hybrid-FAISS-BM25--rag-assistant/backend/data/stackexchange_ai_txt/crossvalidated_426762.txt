We use PearsonÂ´s correlation in our research and it works well. In our case it is quite stable. Since it is a translation and scale invariant measure it is only useful if you want to predict shape, not precise values. Hence, it is useful if you don't know if your target is in the solution space of your model and you are only interested in the shape. On the contrary, MSE reduces the averaged distance between the prediction and the targets, so it tries to fit the data as much as possible. This is probably the reason why MSE is more widely used, because you are usually interested in predicting precise values. If you minimize the MSE, then the correlation will increase.
