If you live in the city, your nearest neighbor might be on the opposite side of the wall. If you live in the middle of a desert, they might be many kilometers away from you. In nearest neighbors, you care about the neighbors that are nearest to you, not near enough. If you could come up with a meaningful threshold like "all the points with gross amount $\pm$ 1000", then sure, you can use such a rule instead. The distance between nearest neighbors might not be interpretable, for example, say that you are looking for the nearest neighbors for humans in terms of their age, height, salary, and number of tweets they send in the previous year, the distance would be a single number describing how far away a person is in terms of all of those dimensions. There would be no easy interpretation of such a distance. There would also be no meaningful threshold, as it would "average" over all of the dimensions. How to explain it? I assume you mean explaining it to a non-technical audience, in such a case I would simply use an example to explain the equation: $$ d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{i=1}^k | p_i - q_i | $$ you consider $k$ features (e.g. age, height, salary, and the number of tweets they send in the previous year) for two persons $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ , for each feature you look at the absolute value of the difference between the two, so the magnitude of the difference, it will be small when the values are similar, big when they are different, next you sum up all the absolute differences to get a single number. No black magic here.
