With pytest-xdist there currently no kind of "per-file" or "per-test-suite" distribution. Actually, if a per-file distribution (e.g. tests in a file will be only executed by at most one worker at a time) would already help your use case i encourage you to file a feature issue with the pytest issue tracker at https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest/issues?status=new&status=open and link back to your good explanation here. cheers,holger
