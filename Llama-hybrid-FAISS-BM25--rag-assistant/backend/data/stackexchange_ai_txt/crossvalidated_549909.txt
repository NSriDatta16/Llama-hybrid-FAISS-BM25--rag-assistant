I think your model might be too complicated. A simple logistic regression handles this just fine. # Define previous location # previous_location I get $P(\text{North}\vert\text{Wall Street}) = 0.967741935483876$ , almost exactly the $90/93$ probability that you get from analyzing the numbers you posted.
