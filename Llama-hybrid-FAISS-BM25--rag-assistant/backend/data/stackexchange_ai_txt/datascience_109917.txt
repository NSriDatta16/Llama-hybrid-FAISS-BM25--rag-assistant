Output of a model as additional input of another model to solve the same task

I was wondering about whether it is possible to train a ML model for a classification task with dataset D, and then train another model to solve the same classification task, which takes as input dataset D and the output of the first model. I am worried about the data partition in this case (i.e. whether the models need to be trained and tested with different data samples). If this kind of ensemble method exists, how is it called? As further details, I have a KNN model and a random forest to predict the same label, but they are trained with different variables.
