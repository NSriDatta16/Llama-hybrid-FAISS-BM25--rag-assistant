logistic regression - Compare coefficients between categorical and numeric variables

I have category (season, Time of day...) and numeric variables (temperature, humidity). I want to compare the coefficient to find out what variable has more impact on the dependent variable. But the coefficients for the categorical variables are just against the reference category. I can't compare them with the numeric coefficients. How can I do that?
