$O(n)$ In a CNN, the number of features in each feature map is at most a constant times the number of input pixels $n$ (typically the constant is $n$ pixels takes $O(n)$ time, since each output is just the sum product between $k$ pixels in the image, and $k$ weights in the filter, and $k$ doesn't vary with $n$ . Similarly, any max or avg pooling operation doesn't take more than linear time in the input size. Therefore, the overall runtime is still linear.
