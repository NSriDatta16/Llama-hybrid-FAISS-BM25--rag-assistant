How to pragmatically create and load multiple views in a Cocoa Desktop Application?

I've been trying to create multiple custom views generating xibs and connecting controllers to them. i have tried things like [window AddSubView:view0] and [window setContentView:view0] but i still don't get the new view displayed. i think I'm doing it wrong since creating the xib file. what is the right way from creating the xib files and the controllers to displaying custom views? Thanks for your help.
