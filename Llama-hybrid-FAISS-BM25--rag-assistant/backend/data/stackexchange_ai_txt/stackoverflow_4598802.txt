Should we HTML-encode special characters before storing them in the database?

I use MySQL to store data and my web pages are all encoded as UTF-8. I have a lot of Portuguese characters such as ç and õ and I'm wondering if I should HTML-escape them before storage. Should we store & as &amp; , for example? And why (not)? What are the advantages and disadvantages / best practices?
