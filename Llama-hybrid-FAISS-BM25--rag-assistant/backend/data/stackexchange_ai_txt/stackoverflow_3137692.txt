Why can't you initialize when you declare? Which C compiler are you using? Does it support C99? If it does support C99, you can declare the variable where you need it and initialize it when you declare it. The only excuse I can think of for not doing that would be because you need to declare it but do an early exit before using it, so the initializer would be wasted. However, I suspect that any such code is not as cleanly organized as it should be and could be written so it was not a problem.
