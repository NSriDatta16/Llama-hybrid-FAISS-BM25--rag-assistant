It's fine in all current browsers. The only browser that got wrong was Netscape 4, which we stopped caring about a long, long time ago. That quirksmode page seems to be badly out of date, what with its use of language attributes, script hiding, and application/x-javascript . Its advice about avoiding in the (and putting it in instead) is at odds with today's encouraged practices. If we're talking attribute compatibility problems: defer doesn't work everywhere so don't rely on it; charset doesn't work everywhere, and neither does the charset parameter on the served script's Content-Type, so your script charset had better match the page; type should always be text/javascript and not one of the non-working alternatives the pedants who wrote RFC 4329 would like you to use.
