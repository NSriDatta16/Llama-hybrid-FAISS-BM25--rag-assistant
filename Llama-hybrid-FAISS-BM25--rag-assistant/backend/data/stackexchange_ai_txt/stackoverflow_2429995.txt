yes you can... if you save $_POST in $_SESSION in session you'll have the same array as post... You can also do the other way and save something to $_POST .. you can also do that (or, using $_SESSION ): $_POST = array('field1' => 'val1', 'field1' => 'val1', 'field1' => 'val1', 'fieldn' => 'valn'); $_SESSION=$_POST; or $test="hi"; $_SESSION['field1']="test"; echo $$_SESSION['field1']; //this print hi PHP is really flexible and let you do almost everthing, obviously pay attention on security problem...
