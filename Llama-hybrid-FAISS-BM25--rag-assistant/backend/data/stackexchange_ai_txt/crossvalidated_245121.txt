(deep learning) Is there a type of layer that can reverse the max-pooling operation?

As far as I know, we have deconvolutional layer to reverse the convolutional layer. Is there something like that for max-pooling? Also, I want to add this reverse max-pooling into an autoencoder, is there any existing example of it?
