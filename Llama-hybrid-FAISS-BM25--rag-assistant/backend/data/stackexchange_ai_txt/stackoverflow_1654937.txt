How do I make a TTreeView display a node when I select it?

If I have a TTreeView, and I call something like this: myTreeView.Select(nodeIWantSelected); it gets selected, but unless that node happens to be located within the part of the tree that's currently visible, I don't see it and I have to drag the scroll bar around until I find its position. How can I make the TTreeView scroll to the node when I select it?
