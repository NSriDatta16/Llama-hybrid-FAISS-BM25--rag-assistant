Finding the 'optimal distribution' with one unknown variable

I am trying to find the optimal distribution (of ingredients) with one unknown parameter (skillset). Example, when baking a bread the ingredients are flour,salt,yeast and water. When I ask 100 bakers to bake a bread lets asume I get 100 different distributions for the ingredients (for example baker 1 used: 25% flour, 25% salt 25% yeast and 25% water). After rating the queality of the bread and inspecting the distribution of the ingredients I will get a pretty good idea of the average distribution used. However the skillset of the baker is probably more important then the exact distribution. And the skillset is unknown to me. There are pretty hight correlations between the ingredients. Flour (.6) salt (-.2) etc and the rating of the bread. This leads me te believe that adding more flour and less salt is the 'secret' to baking the perfect bread even though a skilled baker probably made a 'better rated' bread with a less optimal distribution of ingredients. My question: are there known solutions for finding the best distribution and if so, what are they called?
