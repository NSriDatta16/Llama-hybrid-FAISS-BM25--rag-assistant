I have used UUIDs for smart client online/offline storage and data synchronization and for databases that I knew would have to be merged at some point. I have always used char(36) or char(32)(no dashes). You get a slight performance gain over varchar and almost all databases support char. I have never tried binary or bigint. One thing to be aware of, is that char will pad with spaces if you do not use 36 or 32 characters. Point being, don't write a unit test that sets the ID of an object to "test" and then try to find it in the database. ;)
