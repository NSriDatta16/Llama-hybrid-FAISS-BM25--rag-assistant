How to create a compiled, redistributable class library in Silverlight?

Is it possible to create a small library (similar to a Flash or Flex SWC component) that can be used in Silverlight apps? Since I'm a Flash and Flex developer, I'll relate it. In Flex, if I have a SWC I can add it to my build path and then immediately use its included classes and functions in my project. Similarly, in Flash if I add a SWC to the Components folder then drag that SWC into my library, I can use the classes in my Flash project. Does Silverlight have a similar concept? I just need a small code library that I can send to other developers, but it should be pre-compiled so the source is not readily available. Thanks!
