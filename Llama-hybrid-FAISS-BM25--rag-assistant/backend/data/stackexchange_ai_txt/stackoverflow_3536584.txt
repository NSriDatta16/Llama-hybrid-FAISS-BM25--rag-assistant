Merge sort using inplace merging

A[] -> 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 8 // lb=0,mid-1=3,mid+1=4,ub=7; a=3,b=7,ab=7; 1st iteration a=3,b=6,ab=6; 2nd iteration swap(A[ab],A[a]) // int t; t i'll using for temporary storage 1 3 5 6 2 4 7 8 b=5,ab=5; sort(A,lb,mid-1); // using bubble sort 3rd iteration swap(A[ab],A[a]) 1 3 5 4 2 6 7 8 b=5,ab=4 sort(A,lb,mid-1) // using bubble sort Is this correct approach for Merge sort using inplace merging. This is my first attempt about inplace merging.If it is not correct approach someone can suggest me.
