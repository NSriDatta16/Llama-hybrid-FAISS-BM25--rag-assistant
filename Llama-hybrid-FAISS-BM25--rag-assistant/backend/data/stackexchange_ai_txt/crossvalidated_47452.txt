I would have said that OLS is an optimization problem rather than an optimisation technique, as there are many optimization techniques/algorithms that can be used to solve OLS problems (e.g. analytical solutions for [ridge] regression, IRWLS for logistic regression, scaled conjugate gradients for neural nets, etc.). There is no reason why you can't fit an OLS regression model by simple gradient descent, the reason we generally don't is there are more efficient algorithms. OLS specifies what you are optimising, but you get the same solution from any suitable optimisation technique.
