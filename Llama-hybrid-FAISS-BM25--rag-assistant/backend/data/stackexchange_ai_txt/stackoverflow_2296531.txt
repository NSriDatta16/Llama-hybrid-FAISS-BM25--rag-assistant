The HTTP standard defines different semantics for get/post operations ( http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html Sec 9.1.1) In particular you can do information retrieval using data coming from a get request, but you shouldn't do anything which involves some notion of state change. One reason for this is that the user agent may prefetch pages (and doing get requests) without the user actually having clicked on a link. (Agreed that is notvery common among web browsers, but i've heard of mail clients doing that)
