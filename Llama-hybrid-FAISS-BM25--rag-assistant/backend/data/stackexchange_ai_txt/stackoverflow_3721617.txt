When people talk about "security policy", they might be referring to two different types of security policy. One of them are high level ones, usually defined by managements. This security policy's primary readers are human. It is a document defining the goal, context, expectations, and requirements of security in the management's mind. Languages used inside this policy could be vague, but it's the elementary "law" of security in the applying context. Everyone involved should follow such policy. 1) The outcome of such policy is the clearly defined security requirements from the management. With this polices, everyone involved can understand the management's expectation and make security-related judgment accordingly when necessary. 2) As the primary readers of such security policies are human, and the statements are usually very general, it may not be in machine readable form. However, there may be a couple of documents defined base on the policy, namely security guidelines, procedures, and manuals. They are in the order of increasing level of details on how security should actually be implemented. For example, the requirements defined in the security policy may be realized into hardening manuals for different OS, so that the Administrators and Engineers can perform hardening tasks efficiently without spending too much time interpretation the management's thoughts. The hardening manuals may then be turned into a set of machine readable configurations (e.g. min password length, max failure login count before locking the account, etc) automating the hardening tasks. 3) The document should be made accessible to everyone involved, and regularly reviewed by management. 4) Practically it might be hard to make such references. Security policies might be updated from time to time, and you will probably not want to recompile your program if the policy changes just affect some parameters. However, it's nice to reference the policy in development documents like design sepc. Another type of "security policies" might just refer to those sets of parameters intake be security programs. I found that some security programs really like to use the word "policy" to make their configurations more organized and structures. But anyway, these "security policies" are really just values and/or instructions for security programs to follow. For example, Windows has its own set of "security policies" for user to configure audit loggings, user rights and etc. This type of "security policies" (parameters for programs) is actually defined based on the 1st type of "security policies" (requirements from management) as mentioned above. I might be writing too much on this. Hope it helps.
