Ensemble neural network

I had run artificial neural network on Matlab. Although i used the same design structure of ANN and the same data set, the result always different. Some suggested using ensemble neural network. From my reading ensemble is combine ANN with different design structure. Do this applicable in my problem. Other than that, why is ANN produce different result every time i run it?
