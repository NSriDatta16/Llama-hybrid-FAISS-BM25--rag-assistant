EXCEL: Create/delete rows with autofilled data/functions matching to a number in a cell

My problem is that I have a small formula which have a minimum of 2 rows and should be able to be expanded to a given number from another cell. E.g. 2 rows minimum - then the cell numbering the amount of rows is set to 10. Then there will be added another 8 rows between row 1 & 2. With autofilled data that is similar to when you drag it down using the autofill option. Again when you set down the number from 10 to 4 then 6 of the rows should be deleted. Hope that you can see the idea of what I am thinking and again I'm very sorry if this is unclear or not fulfilling all requirements to a question.
