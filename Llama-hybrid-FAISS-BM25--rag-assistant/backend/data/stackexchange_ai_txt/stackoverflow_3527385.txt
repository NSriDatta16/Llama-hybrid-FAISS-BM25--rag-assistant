In previous versions of WPF the styles were available at this MSDN link. You can try changing to Older versions, to see the download links. Unfortunately, this hasn't been updated for .NET 4.0 yet. Until that happens, if ever you can use Reflector with the BamlViewer plugin. Once you have that installed, you'd open one of these assemblies using Open Cache: PresentationFramework.Aero PresentationFramework.Classic PresentationFramework.Luna PresentationFramework.Royale Make sure to select the 4.0.0.0 versions. Then expand the assembly and associated Resources nodes. Selected the resource entry and press the Space bar to view the Disassembler. Then you can see the BAML files, which you can view the XAML using BamlViewer. The only downside is you lose the original formatting. EDIT: The .NET 4 Styles can be downloaded from here . More specifically, the Default WPF Themes link in the second paragraph. Alternatively, you can drill into specific controls to see a Style example.
