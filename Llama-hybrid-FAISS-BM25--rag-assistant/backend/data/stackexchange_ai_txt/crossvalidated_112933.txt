As @Gung states, you need to modify the PCA definition since you are dealing with ordinal (categorical) outputs. In the naive case you do not have "factors" but principal components. One solution to the problem is to consider normal prior in the latent space and a logic likelihood. To be more precise $P(z) = N(z|0,I)$ $P(V|z) = Cat(V|S^{T}z)$ (In the naive probabilistic factor analysis/pca, the second step would look something like $P(V|Z) = N( Az+b, \Psi)$ In the above expression, cat is a model used to fit categorical data (typically logistic regression). The above model can be fit using EM
