FastText and CharEmbedding

i have got a question. i don't understand how to develop my DLModel. I'm working on DGA Detection with this type of dataset: 1,d o m a i n 1 0,d o m a i n 2 1,d o m a i n 3 .... 1 for dga and 0 for legit domain. so i trained fasttext that gave me vector rapresentation for every char i have got in my dataset (39 char). Than i would like to train this model model.add(layers.LSTM(128)) model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5)) model.add(layers.Dense(1)) model.add(layers.Activation('sigmoid')) model.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy",optimizer="adam",metrics=['accuracy']) model.summary() but when i try to fit my model with: model.fit(xtrain,y_train,batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,epochs=EPOCHS,callbacks=callbacks_list,verbose=1) i had always error: indices[7,1] = 39 is not [0,39] i think that depends from shape of my input and output but i can't figure out where is the problem. For example my xtrain shape is (79998, 143) --> every line is a domain, ad 143 is the max input. weight matrix is (39, 100) i'm new to this studies and i'm really glad if someone could help me! thanks!
