How can you tell if a yearly increase in population is statistically significant?

I have daily data for two years consisting of "number of sightings" each day. Is there a way for me to test whether the data for year 2 is "significantly" higher than the first year? I know the average number per day for each year, as well as the standard deviation per year. The data, however, do not appear to be normally distributed.
