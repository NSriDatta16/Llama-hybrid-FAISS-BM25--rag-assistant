To answer the question in the title: no, not a priori. For example, reflection can be extremely handy when implementing factories to create objects of different (but related) types. However, these are all implementation details and they should generally be hidden behind a general interface. Reflection also tends to be quite slow so overuse is discouraged. Basically, use it when there's no other (good) solution, and nowhere else. OOP doesn't really contest with reflection in general. But don't try to implement dynamic dispatching or listeners/callbacks using reflection when OOP would be adequate.
