By splitting your continuous variable into three groups you loose information . After splitting, the only information that is left is that low Instead, in almost all cases, you should rather use model that does not need you to do transformations that do not lead to information loss. The simple approach would be to use some kind of regression model (linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression etc., depending on your data) where the moderator variable would be centered by subtracting some kind of average from it. You could use any "average" that if meaningful for your analysis, e.g. mean, median, or some arbitrary value like the middle-point fo your scale. By doing so, values smaller then the average would lie below zero and values higher that it, would be above zero. If regression coefficient would be positive, then the "small" values of your variable would lead to decreasing your dependent variable and large ones to increasing it, so the effect would be easy to interpret. On another hand, negative coefficient would suggest that data is inconsistent with your hypothesis and shows the opposite effect. Relatively small values of coefficients would show that there is no noticeable relation between dependent and moderator variables. Moreover, the coefficient would tell you about the magnitude of the dependent variable given the moderator variable. Notice that, as informally shown by Gelman, and Park (2009), linear regression leads to equivalent (but more precise!) results as splitting into the three groups. Gelman, A., & Park, D. K. (2009).
