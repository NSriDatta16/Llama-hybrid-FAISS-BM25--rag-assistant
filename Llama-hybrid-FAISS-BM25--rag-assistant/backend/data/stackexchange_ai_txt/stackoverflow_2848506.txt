As you've noticed, this functionality is part of InternalResourceViewResolver and InternalResourceView , whereas the Tiles stuff inherits directly from UrlBasedViewResolver and AbstractUrlBasedView , so you can't make use of it. Looking at the code, there's no reason why this stuff couldn't have been put into AbstractUrlBasedView . The magic happens in InternalResourceView.getRequestToExpose , and it looks perfectly applicable to AbstractUrlBasedView too. In the short term, I suggest subclassing UrlBasedViewResolver and TilesView , copying the getRequestToExpose stuff from InternalResourceView . In the longer term, I encourage you to file a issue with SpringSource asking them to move this functionality up the class hierarchy into AbstractUrlBasedView , making it more widely available.
