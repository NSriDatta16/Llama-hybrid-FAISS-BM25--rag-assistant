How can I declare constant strings for use in both an unmanaged C++ dll and in a C# application?

Curently I'm passing my const string values up from my C++ into my C# at startup via a callback, but I'm wondering if there's a way of defining them in a C++ header file that I can then also refer to in C#. I already do this with enums as they are easy. I include a file in both my C++ library project (via a .h file with a pragma once at the top), and my C# application (as a link): #if _NET public #endif enum ETestData { First, Second }; I know it sounds messy, but it works :) But...how can I do the same with string constants - I'm initially thinking the syntax is too different between the platforms, but maybe there's a way? Using clever syntax involving #if _NET, #defines etc? Using resource files? Using a C++/CLI library? Any ideas?
