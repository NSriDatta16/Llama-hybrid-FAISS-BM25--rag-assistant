Given all the fine technical answers above, let me take it back to language: Probability quantifies anticipation (of outcome), likelihood quantifies trust (in model). Suppose somebody challenges us to a 'profitable gambling game'. Then, probabilities will serve us to compute things like the expected profile of your gains and loses (mean, mode, median, variance, information ratio, value at risk, gamblers ruin, and so on). In contrast, likelihood will serve us to quantify whether we trust those probabilities in the first place; or whether we 'smell a rat'. Incidentally -- since somebody above mentioned the religions of statistics -- I believe likelihood ratio to be an integral part of the Bayesian world as well as of the frequentist one: In the Bayesian world, Bayes formula just combines prior with likelihood to produce posterior.
