How to report the results of cross-validation for comparing two models?

I want to compare the predictive power of two models. For this, I calculated the difference in some measure of predictive performance over many cross-validation replications. Now I have a distribution of this statistic. How should I summarize it for a publication? The distribution "looks normal", the mean is very close to the median and both are positive, indicating that on the average one model outperformed the other. However, the 0.025 quantile crosses zero. Is this relevant? Should I worry about some sort of confidence or prediction interval, and if so, what kind? It is some sort of habit to want a nice interval around each statistic, but isn't the fact that over many thousand replications one model's predictions were superior evidence in itself? Side question: One model is nested within the other. This doesn't mean that the bigger model necessarily performs better on the test partition, does it?
