If your client specifically asks for a pdf sent by mail in return then no there is no better way :P If they do not have any certain specifications then perhaps storing the pdf applications in a database where they can retreive them by themself through a webpage is a better idea. You could still notify them by email that a new application have been received. This way they can organize new applications better, because lets face it.. management always makes a mess out of their mailbox.
