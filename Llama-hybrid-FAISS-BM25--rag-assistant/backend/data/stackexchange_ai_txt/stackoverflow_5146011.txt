in T-SQL, you can use turn off identity insert - this should allow you to update the identity values with sequential values. the commands are: SET IDENTITY_INSERT table ON --update records here SET IDENTITY_INSERT table OFF just replace table with the table you are working on. You should reseed the table when you are done. There are a bunch of other things to consider (like foreign keys, index fragmentation etc) when doing this, and unless you have a compelling reason, I wouldn't recommend it.
