Confusion Matrix vs AUC Confusion with Random Forest

I'm currently training a random forest classifier with 1000 trees and am receiving the following confusion matrix. I've split the training set 75/25 against the test set but am not sure why I'm seeingf such a low True Negative score? This is a binary classification problem and my dataset contains 88% of Class 0 whereas Class 1 represents 12% of the total content. I've tried experimenting with class_weights but I have not been able to get the True Negative score above 6%. What am I missing as it seems to pass most tests including Cross-Validation > .90 etc.
