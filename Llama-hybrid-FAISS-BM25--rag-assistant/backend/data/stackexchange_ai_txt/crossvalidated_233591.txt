Regression modelling is not sensitive to the normally distributed errors. The normal assumption is used for inference about your fitted model such as prediction and control. As I see from your results and based on your P-P and Q-Q plots the normal assumption is valid for your modelling. (If your fitted model shows approximately near to the theoretical line, then your normal assumption on the errors are valid.) You would use other diagnostic tests for more validation about your regression modelling, such as the constant variance assumptions of the errors and zero means behaviour of the errors. Moreover, based on machine learning approach, it is better to use k-fold cross validation approach for computing the accuracy of your fitted model.
