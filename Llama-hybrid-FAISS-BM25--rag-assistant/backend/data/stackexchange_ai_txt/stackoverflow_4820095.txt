Can the mouse wheel be used while dragging/dropping?

In WinForms, after calling a DoDragDrop to start dragging an item, controls no longer scroll with the mouse-wheel, and the control's MouseWheel event is no longer called, until the user drops whatever he is dragging. Is there a way to get the mouse wheel to work while dragging?
