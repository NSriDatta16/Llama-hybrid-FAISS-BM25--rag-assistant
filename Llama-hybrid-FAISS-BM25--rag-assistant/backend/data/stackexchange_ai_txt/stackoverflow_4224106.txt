Do you mean you want to use a CDN to host images? And you want to upload images from your website to the CDN or use the website run by the company hosting the CDN to upload the images? Ok, firstly yes you can use a CDN with images. In fact it's advised to do so. Amazon CloudFront and RackspaceCloud's Cloudfiles are the two that immediately spring to mind. Cloudfiles you can upload either by their API or through their website and CloudFront you upload to Amazon's S3 storage which then hooks into the CloudFront CDN.
