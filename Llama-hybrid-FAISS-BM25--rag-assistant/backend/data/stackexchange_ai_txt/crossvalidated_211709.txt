Plogit: Lasso logistic regression with Stata

I want to execute a Lasso logistic regression with Stata. Why? Because... 1.) I have a dummy dependant variable (=> Investment success (1) and failure (0)); samples(1/0)(28/23). 2.) I have a set of 63 possible predictors (all continuous). Unfortunately, I have to do it with Stata and there is only one user written program called plogit for that. The documentation of plogit is not very detailed and there are no examples online on how to execute it properly. My questions are: When searching via plsearch for optimal lambda, what exactly do I have specify in lambda(#)? I was not able to stick more than 15 predictors into the plogit log. regression. Is it possible to put in all 63? Why do I often get error messages like: => “observation numbers out of range” => “convergence not achieved” I know most of my questions aren't very detailed, so just ask if you need some further information.
