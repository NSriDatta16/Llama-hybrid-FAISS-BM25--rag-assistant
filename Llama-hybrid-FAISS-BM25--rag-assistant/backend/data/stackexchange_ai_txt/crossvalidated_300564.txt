There are many different measures that can be called an "average" which include (but not limited to) the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, self-weighting mean, trimmed mean, median, and sometimes the mode. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median The median is often preferred for skewed data since it is not affected by outliers, but the geometric mean also down weights outliers to the right (but has issues if any of the data is negative or 0). Which is best depends on the science behind what you are doing and what you are trying to accomplish. What are you trying to accomplish? You may still be able to use the normal if doing inference on the mean due to the Central Limit Theorem, but make sure your sample size is large enough to overcome the skewness in the data (and don't make predictions using the normal, since there is obvious skew).
