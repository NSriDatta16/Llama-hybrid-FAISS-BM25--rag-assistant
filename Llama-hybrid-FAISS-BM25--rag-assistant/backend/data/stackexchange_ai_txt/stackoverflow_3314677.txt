Incorrect Nested Module Routes

I'll preface this with the fact that I'm new to RoR. I have a class that resides in a nested module, ::Physical::Users::User . The code is organized into paths such as app\controllers\physical\users. My problem comes when I try to use form_for like this: ... I get the error ActionView::TemplateError undefined method 'physical_users_users_path' I understand that this has to do with rails expecting routes that don't match mine. In order to make my app work so that the resource :users goes directly to the correct directory (so that I don't have to use http:\myurl.com\physical\users\users\1', I put the following in my routes.rb file: map.resources :users, :controller => 'physical/users/users' When I run ">rake routes" I get the following: users GET /users(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"index"} POST /users(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"create"} new_user GET /users/new(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"new"} edit_user GET /users/:id/edit(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"edit"} user GET /users/:id(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"show"} PUT /users/:id(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"update"} DELETE /users/:id(.:format) {:controller=>"physical/users/users", :action=>"destroy"} /:controller/:action/:id /:controller/:action/:id(.:format) Is there a way to maintain the shorter url to my user resource and get form_for to look for the correct route? Again, I'm new, so if there's anything I'm missing in this explanation, let me know! -- In response to replies below, the controller resides at app/controllers/physical/users/users_controller.rb. Changing the routing to use namespaces like: map.namespace :physical do |physical| physical.namespace :users do |users| users.resources :users end end generates routes that are consistent with what form_for is looking for, but then I lose the ability to use the URL http:\mysite.com\users\1. Thanks for the help so far!
