Others have pointed out that WM_SIZE is the message you should handle and resize the child controls at that point. WM_SIZE is sent after the resize has finished. You might also want to handle the WM_SIZING message which gets sent while the resize is in progress. This will let you actively resize the child windows while the user is still dragging the mouse. Its not strictly necessary to handle WM_SIZING but it can provide a better user experience.
