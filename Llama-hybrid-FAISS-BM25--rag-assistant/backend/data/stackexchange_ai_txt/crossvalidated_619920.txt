Is it acceptable that my training accuracy is 0.99 and my test accuracy is also 0.99?

This is a multiclass classification task for a balanced dataset. I am using the Random Forest Classifier for classification, and I have calculated the evaluation metrics: Training set metrics: Accuracy: 1.0 Precision: 1.0 Recall: 1.0 F1-score: 1.0 Testing set metrics: Accuracy: 0.9995151906916613 Precision: 0.99955912143285 Recall: 0.9992709151615126 F1-score: 0.9994144032680475 Cross-validation scores: [0.99982833 0.99991416 1. 0.99974249 0.99957082 1. 0.99974247 1. 1. ] I obtained these results after filtering out the noise from the data, as shown in the image. It is important to note that I perform pre-processing before splitting the data into training and testing sets, but I am unsure if this yields realistic results. I am new to machine learning, and I'm wondering why the results are so good!
