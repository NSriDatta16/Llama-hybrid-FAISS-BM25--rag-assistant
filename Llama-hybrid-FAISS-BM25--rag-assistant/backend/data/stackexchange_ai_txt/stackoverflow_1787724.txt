you can actually pull all the rows in an array and store the array in memcache memcache_set($memcache_obj, 'var_key', $your_array); but you have to remember few things PHP will serialize/unserialize the array from memcache so if you have many rows it might be slower then actually querying the DB you cannot do any filtering ( NO SQL ), if you want to filter some items you have to implement this filter yourself and it would probably perform worst then the DB engine. memcache won't store more then 1 megabyte ... I don't know what you try to achieve but the general use of memcache is: store the result of SQL/time consuming processing but the number of resulting row should be small store some pre created (X)HTML blobs to avoid DB access. user session storage
