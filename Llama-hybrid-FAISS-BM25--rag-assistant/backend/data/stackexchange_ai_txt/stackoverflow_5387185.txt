1xx responses are informational responses and in the case of 100 Trying are optional. SIP User Agent Servers (UAS) will generally respond with a 100 Trying response immediately when they receive an INVITE request to let the User Agent Client (UAC) know they are processing the request and to avoid retransmits. At some time later they will follow the 100 Trying response with a 180 Ringing or 183 Session Progress. Once someone or something answers the call a 2xx response needs to be sent, typically 200 Ok. If your softphone software is only generating a 100 Trying response and not the subsequent 180 Ringing response then my guess is you have missed a step. At the very least if the softphone has a problem and can't generate a ringing response because there is nothing to ring it should generate a 4xx error response.
