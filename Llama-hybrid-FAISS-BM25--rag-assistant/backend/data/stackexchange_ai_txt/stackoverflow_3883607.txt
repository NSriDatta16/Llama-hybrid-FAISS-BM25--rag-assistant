Classify or cut dataframe by list of class range and summarize it with ddply

I have question about ddply and subset. I have dataframe df like this : df STEP ONE : I have a list of equal interval with cut_interval like this : myinterval So i have two levels here : [0,10) and (10,20] STEP TWO : I want each group/class is define by my two levels in v_cut ... like this : id v_idn v_seed v_time v_pop v_rank v_perco v_cut 1 15 125648 0 150 1 15 (10,20] 2 17 125648 0 120 2 5 [0,10) 3 18 125648 0 100 3 6 [0,10) 4 52 125648 0 25 4 1 [0,10) 5 17 125648 10 220 1 5 [0,10) 6 15 125648 10 160 2 15 (10,20] 7 18 125648 10 110 3 6 [0,10) 8 52 125648 10 50 4 1 [0,10) 9 56 -11152 0 250 1 17 (10,20] 10 15 -11152 0 180 2 15 (10,20] 11 18 -11152 0 110 3 6 [0,10) 12 22 -11152 0 5 4 14 (10,20] 13 56 -11152 10 250 1 17 (10,20] 14 15 -11152 10 180 2 15 (10,20] 15 22 -11152 10 125 3 14 (10,20] 16 18 -11152 10 120 4 6 [0,10) STEP 3 : I want to know the variability of v_rank for x axis, and time for y axis, for each group v_cut, so i need to compute min,mean,max,sd for v_rank value with something like ddply(df, .(v_cut,v_time), summarize ,mean = mean(v_rank), min = min(v_rank), max = max(v_rank), sd = sd(v_rank)) * RESULT WANTED : * id v_time MEAN.v_rank ... v_cut 1 0 2.25 (10,20] 2 0 2.42 [0,10) 3 10 2.25 [0,10) 4 10 2.42 (10,20] MY PROBLEM I don't know how to pass step 1 -> step 2 :/ And if it's possible to group by v_cut like my example in step 3 ? Is there a possibility to make the same things with the "subset" option of ddply ? One more time, thanks a lot for your help great R guru ! UPDATE 1 : I have an answer to go step1 to step2 : df$v_cut I'm using plyr, but there are perhaps a better answer in this case ? Answer to go to step 2 to step 3 ? UPDATE 2 : Brandon Bertelsen give me a good answer with melt + cast, but now (to understand) i want to make the same operation with plyr and ddply .. with a different result : id v_idn v_time MEAN.v_rank ... v_cut 1 15 0 2.25 (10,20] 2 15 10 2.45 (10,20] 2 17 0 1.52 [0,10) 2 17 10 2.42 [0,10) etc. I'm trying with something like this : r('sumData But i want to have v_cut in my sumData dataframe, how can i do with ddply ? is there an option to make this ? Or merging with initial df and key = v_idn to add column v_cut to sumData is the only good answer ?
