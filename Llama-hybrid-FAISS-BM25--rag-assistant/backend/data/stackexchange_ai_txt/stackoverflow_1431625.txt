I'm not sure what you're wanting to do... if the directory isn't writable it isn't writable. Throw an error for the user telling them that their SDCard needs write permission (possibly with instructions on how to fix). In a couple of apps I have code similar to like this to make sure there is an SDCard... shouldn't be difficult to modify it to make sure it's also writable: // make sure we have a mounted SDCard if (!Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(Environment.getExternalStorageState())) { // they don't have an SDCard, give them an error message and quit final AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this); builder.setMessage(R.string.welcome_dialog_sdcard_error) .setCancelable(false) .setPositiveButton(R.string.welcome_dialog_sdcard_ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() { public void onClick(final DialogInterface dialog, final int id) { finish(); } }); final AlertDialog alert = builder.create(); alert.show(); } else { // there's an SDCard available, continue }
