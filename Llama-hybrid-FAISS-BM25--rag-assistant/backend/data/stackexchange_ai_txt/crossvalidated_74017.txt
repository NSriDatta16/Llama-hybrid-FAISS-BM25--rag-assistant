You're right: in general, people don't like to put interactions into a model before putting in the primary effects. There is a recent paper that solves this problem for the lasso: "A lasso for hierarchical interactions" by Jacob Bien, Jonathan Taylor, and Robert Tibshirani. Their solution is implemented in the R package hierNet. Hope this helps!
