Can a single label be a vector/matrix in a neural network and not a scalar?

My training data consists of individual sentences and each sentence has a few labels (say 10) and each of these labels has a discrete score from 1-10 -- so in essence, a single training example has a label that is not a scalar, but rather a matrix/vector of (10,10) or (1,10*10). Can a softmax adjust the weights in accordance to a label that on its own, is a matrix/vector? I'm looking to fine-tune a model that has this capability. Thanks.
