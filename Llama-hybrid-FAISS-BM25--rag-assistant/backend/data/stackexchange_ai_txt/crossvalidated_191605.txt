It depends on if you think your data is best characterised by linear or non-linear tests. The most simple of tests is most likely a Repeated Measures ANOVA, you could also average the number of fish per location -but any linear statistical test will lose out on a lot of the variability (that I assume) exists in your data. Depending on what your data actually looks like you could probably run either RQA s (checks for self-similarity for one location) or CRQA which would check one location against another over time.
