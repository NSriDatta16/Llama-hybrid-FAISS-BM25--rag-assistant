UITableView - how to pass-through touches to parent view

I have this setup: UIView UITableView UIView The nested view is hidden initially and I want it to show up when user touches the table view anywhere, on cell, outside section - just about anywhere on the screen outside status/nav. bar. I added touchesBegan for the main view (in which I show the nested view) and when TableView is hidden this works as needed. When table view is shown, touchesBegan is not called. Thus question is - how to bubble-up the touches to the main view?
