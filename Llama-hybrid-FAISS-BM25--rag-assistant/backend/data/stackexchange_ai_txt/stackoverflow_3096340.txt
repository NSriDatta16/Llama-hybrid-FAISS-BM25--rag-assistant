I believe that the current generation developer phone is the Nexus One. It comes Sim unlocked and Bootloader unlocked and it's running Android 2.2. That said you can test your app on any device that meets the criteria of your app. The one thing that you do need to keep in mind is supporting multiple screen sizes. There are three sizes, ldpi, mdpi and hdpi. If you have a G1 / MyTouch then that's mdpi, if you get a Nexus One or Droid / Milestone that's hdpi, so you have those two covered.
