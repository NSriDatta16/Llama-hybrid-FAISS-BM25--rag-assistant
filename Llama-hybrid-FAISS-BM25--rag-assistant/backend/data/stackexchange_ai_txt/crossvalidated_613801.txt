Bayesian modeling of data at different cluster level

I have the following data: The response variable Y and the independent variable X2 were collected at state level (lowest level), while X1 are only available at country level. The general form of my mixed effect model looks like: Y = constant + x1 + x2 + random_state My challenge is that X1 is only available at country level. How can I correctly account for this, should I include X1 as random slope ? I am not sure how to handle this. Any suggestion will be very useful.
