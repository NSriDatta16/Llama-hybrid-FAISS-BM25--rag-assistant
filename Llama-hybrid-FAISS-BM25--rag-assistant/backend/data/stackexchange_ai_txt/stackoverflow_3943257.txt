Error: "Cannot parse DS in" when trying to plot graph with RRDs::graph

Hi I am new to RRD and plotting graph with it. I am trying to plot a graph with following RRDs::graph ($wwwDir."graphs\\2mtotal$rrdname.png", "-l 0", "-w 500", "-h 200", "-v Size", "-s now-5184000" , "--base", "1024", "-x", "DAY:1:WEEK:1:WEEK:1:0:%d/%m", "-e now", "--title=$rrdheading" , "DEF:DriveCap=D\:\\xampp\\htdocs\\Diskusage\\rrdResult\\POPZ.rrd:$rrdCap:AVERAGE" , "DEF:DriveSize=D\:\\xampp\\htdocs\\Diskusage\\rrdResult\\POPZ.rrd:$rrdSize:AVERAGE" , "CDEF:DriveSizeGB=DriveSize,1073741824,/" , "LINE3:DriveSize#33FF33:Total Used" , "LINE3:DriveCap#cc0033:Capacity" , "GPRINT:DriveSizeGB:LAST:Total Used Space\\: %2.0lf Gb\\j" , "COMMENT:Created\\: $hour\\:$min $mday/$mon/$year\\r"); However, I have got an error: ERROR while updating monthly total graph PopZ.rrd: Cannot parse DS in 'DEF:DriveCap=D:\xampp\htdocs\Diskusage\rrdResult\ POPZ.rrd:POPZCapacity:AVERAGE' My RRD definition is POPZCapacity GAUGE 200000 0.0000000000e+000 NaN UNKN 3.7080673019e+016 0 I am not sure where is the problem, any advice will be appreciated, thanks in advance!
