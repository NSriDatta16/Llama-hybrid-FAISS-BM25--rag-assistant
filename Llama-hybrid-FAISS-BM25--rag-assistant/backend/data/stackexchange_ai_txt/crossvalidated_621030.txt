How to do 1D interval clustering into clusters with equal number of intervals?

I am trying to analyse genomic data. They are organized in the form of records. A record looks like the following: record # start end string 1 xxx xxx xxxxxx 2 xxx xxx xxxxxx The records are arranged in a way that they are sorted based on the start column. I want to divide these records into multiple clusters because all of them dont fit into memory. But genomic data of this kind has a feature ie records tend to cluster together (either overlap or occur "close" to each other). So if I convert start and end columns into intervals it seems to me that they can be clustered together. An idea for closesness if a super cluster's mean closer to a candidate interval. The approach I've tried: Merge all intervals to form disjoint super intervals. But this lead to some many super intervals with few points and only few with large number of points. But this approach will not constrain the clusters to have equal number of points in them. An example for this: [(3, 4), (6, 7), (9, 10), (1, 2), (3, 8)] - input intervals [(1, 2, [3]), (3, 8, [0, 1, 4]), (9, 10, [2])] - super intervals with input interval's indices in the inner list.
