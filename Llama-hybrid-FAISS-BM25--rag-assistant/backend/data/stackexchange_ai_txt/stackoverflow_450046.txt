A while ago, I've experience the same problem. After some searching thtrough the web, it appeared that I was not the only one having this issue. :) So, perhaps it is a flaw in the FileSystemWatcher ... I've solved it by keeping track of the last time the eventhandler has been raised. If it has been raised less then xxx msec ago, I return from my eventhandler. If anyone knows a fix that is more elegant; plz let me know. :) This is how I've worked around it: if( e.ChangeType == WatcherChangeTypes.Changed ) { // There is a nasty bug in the FileSystemWatch which causes the // events of the FileSystemWatcher to be called twice. // There are a lot of resources about this to be found on the Internet, // but there are no real solutions. // Therefore, this workaround is necessary: // If the last time that the event has been raised is only a few msec away, // we ignore it. if( DateTime.Now.Subtract (_lastTimeFileWatcherEventRaised).TotalMilliseconds
