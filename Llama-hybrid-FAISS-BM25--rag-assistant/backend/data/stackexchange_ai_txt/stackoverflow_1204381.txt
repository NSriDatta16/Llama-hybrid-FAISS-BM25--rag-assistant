Silverlight and COM Interop

What are my options for interacting with a COM control from silverlight? In my particular project, I have a legacy ActiveX authentication control which I would like to leverage in my silverlight application. Without too many boring details, the control takes a couple of parameters, prompts the user for credentials or tokens, and raises events. I need to set the parameters from my control, and somehow get the events' data to my control. Furthermore, I would like to get the UI to seem as homogeneous as possible. What are the best ways of doing this?
