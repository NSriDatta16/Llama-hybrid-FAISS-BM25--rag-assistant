Differential Equations as Generative Models

I wonder, if we can say stochastic differential equations are generative models. I usually think about the Kalman filtering for example, we fix a discrete-time evolution equation of a certain object, which is a differential equation in continuous domain, and then use this model as a generative model to derive inference algorithms in a Bayesian setting. Then, can we say that all differential equations involving noise terms are generative models of some underlying phenomenon? PS (December 7, 2012): Although it is discussed in the comments, I push my luck once more by adding a concrete example. Consider a stochastic difference equation, $$x_{t+1} = x_t + w_t$$ where $w_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Then, we can write in the probabilistic terms, $$p(x_{t+1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(0,x_t)$$ and this is a generative model. Of course, we can write another equation, such as an observation model, and this picture completely define a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system as well as a generative model. Then I reask my question: is there a specific reference that promotes this relationship? Or is it quite trivial and obvious for researchers from both sides? Thanks.
