First of all, just to state the fact. The model is bad in the sense that it overfits and actually none of the predictors are good (significant). Correlation just reflects the amount of linear association between two objects, it does not necessarily translate into the fact that it will be useful in including the variable in logistic regression when it correlates with the output. If you plot "var1" vs "outcome" and "var2" vs "outcome", you can see that there is no linear association in var2 vs outcome case and there is some "spurious" correlation in "var1" vs "outcome" case. Given that you are predicting binary data, your model is using "var1" as the best out of the worst parameters to overfit and give the lowest error. Consider improving your model.
