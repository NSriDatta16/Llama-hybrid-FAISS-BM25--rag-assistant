How does a neural network model fractional powers for input variables?

From what I understand, a Neural Network is essentially a representation of one or more output in terms of a polynomial equations in a graphical form. That being the case, I fail to understand as to how a Neural Network models fractional powers. For example, if my true natural function is $y = a_1 * {x_1}^{1.45} + a_2 * {x_2}^{2.98} +a_3$, how does the neural network account for the .45 and .98 in the illustrated equation?
