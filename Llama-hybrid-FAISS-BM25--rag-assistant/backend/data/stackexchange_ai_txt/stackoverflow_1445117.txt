Is the class NativeMethods handled specially in .NET?

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182161.aspx Are the three classes described on this paged handled specially in the .NET Framework? (NativeMethods, SafeNativeMethods and UnsafeNativeMethods) The reason I'm asking is I'm wondering if it is alright to create categories of NativeMethods classes. For example: ComNativeMethods User32NativeMethods OleStorageNativeMethods
