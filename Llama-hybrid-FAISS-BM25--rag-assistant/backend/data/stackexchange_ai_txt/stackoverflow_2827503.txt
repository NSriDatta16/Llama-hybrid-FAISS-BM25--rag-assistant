PHP: Need a double check on an error in this small code

I have this simple Select box that is suppose to store the selected value in a hidden input, which can then be used for POST (I am doing it this way to use data from disabled drop down menus) 1Value 2Value 3Value 4Value ".$Z." "; ?> The echo call works for the last 3 options (2,3,4) but if I select the first one it doesnt output anything, and even if i change first one it still doesnt output anything. Can someone explain to me whats going on, I think it might be a syntax issue. EDIT: As mentioned in first paragraph: I am using the hidden field instead of just using the value of selected because i plan on disabling the select drop down in my actual website, and when you disable the menu the POST data is no longer accessible. By putting it into a hidden field you can still access the information
