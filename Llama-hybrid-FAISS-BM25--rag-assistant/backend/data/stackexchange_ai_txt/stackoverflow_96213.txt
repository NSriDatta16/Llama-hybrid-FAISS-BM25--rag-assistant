Using modern semantic markup is much easier when you're adding features or fixing bugs or changing the look of a data-driven web site. Adding AJAX features or any kind of interactive scripting will work much better with DIVs and CSS than with TABLEs. Moving to a content manager like Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, or the like will be much easier if you're already organized with semantic markup, too. The newer browser editions will also support modern markup more efficiently and your site will display faster. Rearranging all those tables can result in slow display times. On the other hand, tables are here to stay. Some people will continue using them and browsers will continue displaying them. There is nothing inherently wrong with non-semantic markup if that's what you want. A completely static site that will never be changed can run as well with tables as with modern markup. As for valid structural markup, there is this: Tables are a great way to display tabular data, like database or spreadsheet tables. They are not really valid markup for anything else.
