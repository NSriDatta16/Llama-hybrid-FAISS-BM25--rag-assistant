Checking if MIB object is DisplayString

I'm using java Mibble library to process MIB files and create MIB implementation for my snmp agent. And have a little problem with that: There is a DisplayString type that is the representation of OCTET_STRING but can contains only 7bit ASCII chars. There is also type like AdminString that is another represetnation of OCTET_STRING but can contains all ASCII chars. So my question is: how to distinguish DisplayString (so I can check for chars that are greater then 126 in my implementation) from Admin String? i tried to use MibTypeTag[1] but apparently I don't know HOW to use it (any hints?) and it says that "it is possible to distinguish between types using the same or a similar primitive ASN.1 type representation (such as DisplayString and IpAddress)" My written english isn't perfect so here's what I would like to do: if (MibTypeTag == DisplayString) { check for chars greater than 126 } else if (MibTypeTag == AdminString) { awesome! nothing to do! } Thanks in advance!
