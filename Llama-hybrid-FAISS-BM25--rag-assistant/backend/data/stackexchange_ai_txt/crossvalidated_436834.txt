For the first question: No, it is not likely the result of people not paying attention -- that would likely result in very low correlations and low factor loadings. It is more likely that something is wrong either with your theory or your questions. For your second question: Being reverse coded shouldn't have anything to do with the results of an ANOVA. That part is likely a coincidence. But have you checked the assumptions of the model? Colinearity seems likely, given the names of your variables.
