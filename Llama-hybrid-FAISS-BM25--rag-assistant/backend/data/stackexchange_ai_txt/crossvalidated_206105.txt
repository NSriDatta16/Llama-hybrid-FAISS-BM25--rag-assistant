How to use final svm regression model to predict new values of the dataset

I understand svm_predict function can be used to estimate or predict test output, but the arguments passed are like this svm_estimate = svmpredict(y, X, model); where y is the output_label and X is the input_data (3 columns) I wish to find new values using svm regression model for example like this new_value= f(X); Is something like this possible to be used ? If so could any ofyou help me out finding the solution. Your help is much appreciated Thanking you all.
