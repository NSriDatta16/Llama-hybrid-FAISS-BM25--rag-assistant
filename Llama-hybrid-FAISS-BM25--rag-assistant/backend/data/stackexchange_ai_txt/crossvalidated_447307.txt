Your approach, starting with ANOVA to compare total amino acid content among groups and then using PCA to illustrate underlying differences in composition, seems sound. Your reluctance to just go forward with 17 univariate ANOVAs is well founded. Besides not accounting for the possibility of correlations among the response variables, the simple fact of performing 17 univariate ANOVAs will require substantial correction for multiple comparisons . The simplest way forward might be to just do the requested 17 univariate ANOVAs anyway (after all, if the reviewer wants to know the results then other readers probably would, too). You do this, however, while highlighting the difficulties involved in interpreting the results. That would get you quickly beyond the issue raised by the reviewer, and could even give you the opportunity to demonstrate the superiority of your PCA-based approach. For MANOVA, it's not immediately clear to me why you think that it would be rank deficient, unless the analyses were done on percentages rather than raw values. (Maybe I just haven't thought that through enough.) The literature on handling necessarily rank-deficient compositional data and associated threads on CrossValidated could provide guidance. You could consider multivariate partial least squares (or "projection to latent structures"), a technique frequently used in chemometrics, which I think in your case would be closely related to your PCA approach. Note that the problem of having multiple correlated response variables is even more dramatic in gene-expression studies, which can have on the order of 20,000 response variables with only a handful of different conditions and replicates. Although it might be overkill for your application, you might consider exploring how information is pooled among observations and how the multiple comparisons problem is dealt with by packages like limma for differential expression analysis.
