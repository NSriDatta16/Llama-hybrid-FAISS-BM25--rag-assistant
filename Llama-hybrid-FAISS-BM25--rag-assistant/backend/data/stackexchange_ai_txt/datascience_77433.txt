How to make a neural network generalizes better?

I designed a neural network model with large number of output predicted by softmax function. However, I want categorize all the outputs into 5 outputs without modifying the architecture of other layers. The model performs well in the first case but when I decrease the number of output it loses accuracy and get a bad generalization. My question is: Is there a method to make my model performs well even if there is just 5 outputs? for example: adding dropout layer before output layer, using other activation function, etc.
