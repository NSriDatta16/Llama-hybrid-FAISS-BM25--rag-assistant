We are doing the exact same thing also, uploading files via email and for the front-end using Azure. The problem now is that Azure does not support smtp server. What we do is that we host our own exchange server, and write an interceptor(SmtpReceiveAgent) to process the incoming messages. If you found other solutions please let me know. Thanks!
