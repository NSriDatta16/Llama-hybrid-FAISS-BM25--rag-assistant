If having the "template nature" of things propagate widely is OK with you, templates ("compile-time duck typing") can give you blazing speed (avoiding the "level of indirection" that's implicit in a virtual-function call) though maybe at some cost in memory footprint (in theory, good C++ implementations could avoid that memory overhead related to templates, but I don't feel very confident that such high-quality compilers will necessarily be available on all platforms where you need to port;-). So, at least pragmatically, it's something of a speed/memory trade-off. If the operations you're doing are so super-slow as I/O, then maybe the relatively tiny speed gain from avoiding a virtual call isn't really material to your use case.
