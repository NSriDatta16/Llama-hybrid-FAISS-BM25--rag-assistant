Different values predicted by OLS model and Time Series model

Let us say , I have an explanatory variable X and a dependent variable Y and I use OLS and find Y = 0.5 + 3X. Now let us assume that both X and Y are time series data, so using ARIMA modelling process, I find that Y(t) = Y(t-1)*0.8 + 1.2. Let us say that at a future time t = 5, the value of X = 100. Now, the above 2 formulas will give two different values of Y(t=5). How do you reconcile these two values? The part in parentheses represents subscript notation.
