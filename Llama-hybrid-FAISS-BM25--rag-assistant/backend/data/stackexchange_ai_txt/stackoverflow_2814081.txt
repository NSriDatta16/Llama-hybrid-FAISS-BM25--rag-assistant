Mipmapping is controlled by the ratio of texels to pixels for the fragments being drawn (hopefully my terminology is correct there). How large are you drawing it on screen? If you're drawing it at (say) 128x128, you'll get mipmap level 2, hence the blur. Textures should be created at the size they'll be shown at on screen, or as close as possible to, rather than producing too many pixels and letting the GPU pick an inappropriate mipmap level...
