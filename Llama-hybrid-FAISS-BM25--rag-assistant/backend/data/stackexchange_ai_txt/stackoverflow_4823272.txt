Which Android phones have Large screen sizes

I am trying to figure out which phones have a Large screen size in terms of Android development. Going through the documentation it is a very confusing situation as the Large category also depends on the density of the pixels in the phones screen. From what I've read it looks like both the EVO and Droid X (who have big screens) are classified as Normal screens with High Density. Which phones are MDPI/HDPI but also Large Screens? My endgame here is to support only HVGA and WVGA screens but I need to make sure I'm not cutting a large portion of the market out.
