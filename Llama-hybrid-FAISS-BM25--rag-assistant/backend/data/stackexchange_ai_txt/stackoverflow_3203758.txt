What about cookies? It is accessible via javascript, it is on your client and it is a plain text file. Only issue is the size of it (4k max if I remember well). What you can do as well is use your browser localStorage / userData / globalStorage (depending on your browser version). It acts like cookies (new webStorage / HTML5 specs) but can handle bigger amounts of data. Then, using some add ons (firebug on firefox for instance) you can easily read / copy / past the value and do whatever you have to do with it!
