I think you need to better specify your game features, I'm assuming your whole game is in Quarz 2D and that it's for iPad. I have two opinions about it: 1) If you don't need UIKit ( tables, buttons, and other features ), I would go 100% OpenGL ES, if you plan to make a whole game out of Quarz 2D, and you plan real-time scaling, drag and drop, etc... I think your frame rate will suffer a lot less using OpenGL ES. 2) If you need UIKit , and your game is heavily UIKit based, Quarz2D could have a place in there, I think Quarz2D is best suited for animations/effects into UIKit rich applications ( see "Reeder" and the official "Twitter" application), those apps are empowered by Quarz2D and UIkit.
