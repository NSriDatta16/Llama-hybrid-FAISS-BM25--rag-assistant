On the Netflix tech blog there is an article on their Robust Anomaly Detection tool (RAD). http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/02/rad-outlier-detection-on-big-data.html It deals with seasonality and very high volume datasets so it may fit your requirements. The code is open source Java and Apache Pig https://github.com/Netflix/Surus/blob/master/resources/examples/pig/rad.pig The underlying algorithm is based on robust PCA - see original paper here: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/RobustPCA.pdf
