What is the difference between symmetric and non-symmetric in Procrustes/Protest analysis?

I'm basing my question off of someone else's stackoverflow post . My questions are the following: 1. A widely used R package vegan has a function called procrustes , symmetric argument is set to False. The documentation says "Use symmetric Procrustes statistic (the rotation will still be non-symmetric)" but I don't understand the following: 1a. What it means to be symmetric or non-symmetric? 1b. When to use symmetric vs. non-symmetric procrustes? 1c. How do you know if your dataset/problem is better "modeled" (this might not be the correct phrasing) using a symmetric vs. non-symmetric procrustes? 2. In the same package, there is the protest function that can assign statistical significance in how different two ordinations are via permuting several procrustes runs. The protest function is only available (applicable?) to symmetric procrustes. I don't understand the following: 2a. Why can't you run this test for symmetric procrustes? This is a great explanation for anyone interested in procrustes: https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame/other-methods/procrustes-analysis
