Please read the help file. It is very clear on this point. Here is an extract: Let y contain the time series y[1:T] . Then forecastfunction is applied successively to the time series y[1:t] , for t=1,â€¦,T-h , making predictions f[t+h] . The errors are given by e[t+h] = y[t+h]-f[t+h] . If h=1 , these are returned as a vector, e[1:T] . For h>1 , they are returned as a matrix with the h th column containing errors for forecast horizon h . The first few errors may be missing as it may not be possible to apply forecastfunction to very short time series.
