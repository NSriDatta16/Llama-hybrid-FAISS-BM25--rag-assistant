If you search around the net you'll find examples of using VBScript to manipulate Lotus Notes. Here's one example: http://haveworld.blogspot.com/2006/10/vbscript-and-lotus-notes.html You'll need to know a little about Lotus Notes to make this work, though. Start small and see if you can even get the Notes Version to appear: Set oNotesSession = CreateObject("Notes.Notessession") 'create notes session Msgbox oNotesSession.NotesVersion If that works, you know you're in good shape. If not, make sure you've installed Lotus Notes correctly and configured it on the client. The code to post a local file to a database involves connecting to Notes, creating a new Notes Document, adding a file object into the body of the document, and then saving it. You can use any kind of Notes Database to do this, but I'd suggest creating a new one based on the Document Library template, and using that to store your files. Here is some code that will create a new Notes document, set the subject field, attach a file, and then save the document. This assumes there's a local Notes database already available called "FileStorage.nsf" strFileName = "C:\Windows\Media\tada.wav" strSubject = "Your Subject Goes Here" Set oNotesSession = CreateObject("Notes.Notessession") 'create notes session Set oDb = oNotesSession.GetDatabase("", "FileStorage.nsf") 'open database on local named FileStorage.nsf Set oDoc = oDb.CreateDocument ' Filling the fields oDoc.Subject = strSubject Set oBody = oDoc.CreateRichTextItem("Body") oBody.EmbedObject 1454, "", strFileName '1454 = Embedded Attachment type oDoc.Save False, False
