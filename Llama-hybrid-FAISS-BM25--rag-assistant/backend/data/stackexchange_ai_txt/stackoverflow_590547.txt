there is no cms (no software, for that matter) so secure you never have to update. developers make mistakes, and new exploits appear. so every cms should be "subject to a constant barrage of security fixes". if it is not, you should ask yourself about the security policy of the project and the security of your site. see The Open Security Model, Drupal and ExpressionEngine on Security for a related read. so unless you don't care about the security of your site, you are asking the wrong question. i think it should actually be: is there a cms that is customizable without modifying core files so that security updates don't break my customizations? or: how can i customize a cms so that security updates don't break my customizations? security updates usually don't break a (even customized) site - unless the customizations are done the wrong way. my answer to that new question would be Drupal (including bonus points).
