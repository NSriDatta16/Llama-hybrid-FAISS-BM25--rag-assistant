Calculating Prediction Intervals/Binomial Distribution with varying probabilities

Embarrassingly simple question here and apologies if this is all over the web, I was lacking some of the vocab I needed to Google it. Let's say I have a set of samples with varying probabilities for the same event (we'll use a baseball analogy here, as that seems to be common). I have nine batters who have batting averages of: [0.250, 0.340, 0.210, 0.220, 0.300, 0.230, 0.290, 0.180, 0.110]. What I want to know is if all of these batters go up once, what is the probability of 9 hits, what is the probability of 8 hits, 7 hits, etc... How do I calculate this more generally? In my case, I have a mean and I have a bunch of probabilities, but I can't figure out how to create some kind of distribution from that. Essentially what I'm wondering is how to calculate a binomial distribution when the different trials have different probabilities of success.
