Most GUI toolkits provide suitable tree and list controls, and a splitter container the user can drag to set the sizes of the three panes. If you use C# then it should take a couple of minutes to create using drag-and-drop (using windows forms you would have a Form with two Splitter controls, a TreeView and a ListView, and whatever control type the data is shown as); the other tool kits I've used tend to require more programming. Sticking with C++, you can use MFC (CTreeCtrl, CListCtrl, CSplitterWnd), wxWindows (wxGenericDirCtrl/wxTreeCtrl,wxListCtrl,wxSplitterWindow), or QT (I don't know QT). C++ will take longer to develop for no gain (unless you're doing very intensive work, don't bother with C++ for GUIs; usually the advantages of a managed system has for multi-threaded work give a better user experience than a C++ app)
