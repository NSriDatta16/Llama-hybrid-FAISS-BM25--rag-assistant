It's not only possible, it's explicitly recommended (see Ruxton & Beauchamp 2008). First, if the omnibus-test of homogeneity across all groups is not of interest (e.g. the overall ANOVA $F$ -test), consider not paying attention to it at all or not doing it in the first place. Second, if each planned comparison tests a different specific hypothesis, it is actually controversial if a formal control of the experimentwise type 1 error rate (EER) is required or not. Some text do not consider it necessary (Kirk 1995, Quinn & Keough 2002, Rothman 1990, Rubin 2021, Sokal & Rohlf 1995). Ruxton & Beauchamp (2008) recommend not controlling EER if the set of pre-planned contrasts is orthogonal . If all possible pairwise comparisons between groups are planned, the set of contrasts is not orthogonal and so, Ruxton & Beauchamp (2008) recommend controlling EER. Rubin (2021) on the other hand argues that in the case of individual testing, no alpha adjustment should be done. He defines individual testing as tests, where each individual result must be significant in order to reject each associated individual null hypothesis. This seems to be the case here if you want to test each pairwise group difference individually. Personally, I find his arguments convincing and have subsequently changed my own opinion on the matter.
