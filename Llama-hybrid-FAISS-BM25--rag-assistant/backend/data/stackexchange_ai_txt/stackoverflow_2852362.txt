First, the module name is the same as the name of the single .py file. In Python-speak, a collection of several .py files is a package. PEP-8 discourages breaking up package names with underscores. A quick peak at my site-packages directory shows that multiword names are commonly just run together (e.g., setuptools, sqlalchemy) Module names (that is, file names) may be broken up by underscores (and I usually do this, because I hate namesthatruntogethersoyoucanhardlyreadthem). Stick with lower-case only (per PEP-8). This avoids problems when going from case-sensitive to case-insensitive filesystems and vice versa.
