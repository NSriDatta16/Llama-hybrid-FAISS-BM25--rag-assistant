First the curve you have drawn is not the bell you're looking for. Your "bell" should be more like this: Your histogram-drawn-as-a-bar-chart (yikes! Excel encourages terrible things) looks reasonably close to that. However, histograms are not a very good way to check for normality of residuals . As discussed here , on occasions - and depending on your choices for where the histogram bars go, the same set of values might look as different as these: Just to repeat - that's two different histograms of the same numbers. Kernel density estimates and better still, QQ plots (at least once you learn how to read them) are significantly more informative. If you must use histograms, use plenty of bins and do more than one.
