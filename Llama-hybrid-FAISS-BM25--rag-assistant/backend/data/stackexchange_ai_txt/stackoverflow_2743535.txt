By default, Qt is limited to darg & drop text and images but this behaviour can be extended by adding new MIME Type. You can find an interesting example of drag & drop using alternate data type at http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/draganddrop-fridgemagnets.html . This example can be extended to support drag & drop of widgets. You can find the QModelIndex of the item receiving the drop by giving the QDropEvent::pos() parameter to the QAbstractItemView::indexAt() method of the QTreeView . This gives you the opportunity to find the actual widget if that is what you want.
