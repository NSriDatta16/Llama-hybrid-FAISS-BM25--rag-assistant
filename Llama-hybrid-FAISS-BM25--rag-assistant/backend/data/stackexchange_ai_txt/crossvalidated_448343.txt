Understanding of Hypothesis testing and further actions

I know Hypothesis Testing is a statistical test, for a sample of data stands true for the entire population or not. That is, if a random sample's mean is same as that of the population mean. Here, we try to accept or reject NULL hypothesis by various tests like Z-Test/ T-Test / ANOVA / Chi-Square Test. What we do after accepting or rejecting NULL hypothesis? Do we exclude/include that sample from further process if we are building a machine learning model? What are the significance of accepting NULL Hypothesis? What are the significance of accepting Alternate Hypothesis? Or is there any other insights we make with these tests? Which test is good for the sample, to be considered in a machine learning for model building? I would like to know these in the perspective of machine learning for model building. Kindly share your thoughts.
