You are not using any more of your program's memory in the first example. The NSUserDefaults object will be stored on the heap either way, and the storage for the variable itself will either be a) a register, or b) on the stack. Registers don't take up any of your app's real memory, and the memory for the stack is already reserved. Also, pointers take up a very small amount of memory â€” 4 bytes on 32-bit and 8 bytes on 64-bit platforms. A quarter of a million of them would take less than 1 MB. Individual scalars like this are the very last place you should be looking for memory savings.
