editable div content in html 4

Wondering if there's any not-too-hard way to edit non-form text in html 4. I know there's a contentEditable property that can be set in html 5, but I want better browser support than that will give me. It seems like gmail is doing something like this in their chat status indicator. This works properly on IE6 (which I don't believe supports html 5). Has anyone seen this done? thanks, -Morgan
