Drupal - Theme a node type using CSS

Hey, I have some content I am trying to save as a node. The problem is the content i am trying to save is html and even with drupal set to "Full HTML" input format it's still not displaying correctly. Here is what I am trying to post, personal info removed. **** MIC ********* ************ **/**/2010 ****** St ******* 48602 ********************** ********* 1st***** **/**/2010 $00000 EMPLOYEE NO.

NET PAY It should look like a paystub, with everything aligned properly, the text is a little small but that is easily fixed but I cannot figure out why everything is just left aligned after i save the node. I have tried all three input formats all not giving me what I want. Any ideas? I am fairly new to this installation of Drupal is only on our intranet and pertains to pay-stubs and all that good personal info that I'm sure someone would love to get there hands on. So I'm unable to give you a live link of anything. I can tell you that its just a default installation of Drupal so I can be fairly sure nothing wonky is going on under the hood. I tried removing the head and body tags from the HTML to no avail. When "Full HTML" input mode is enabled after the save, the font sizing works correctly, and the background color is changed to grey which is in the HTML code I posted so those parts are working. What seems to be missing is the positioning of the text. Here is a screenshot. https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gsuW.png
