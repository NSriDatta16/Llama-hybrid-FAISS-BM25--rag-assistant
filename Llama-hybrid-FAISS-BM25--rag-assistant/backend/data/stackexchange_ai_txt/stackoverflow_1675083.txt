Every window opened by Javascript will have a titlebar. You only have control over whether scrollbars, statusbars, and toolbars are present in the opened window. To get a headless "pop-up" effect, look into a library like LightBox that can do these sort of effects. You're not actually opening a new window according to the user-agent, but the behaviour is similar.
