It's impossible to say how many images you'll need without knowing more details. You might be able to train a good performing model with less than a hundred images depending on the diversity in your data and complexity of your use case. In general, machine learning applications are a mix of software and data. Getting the data right is more important than the code itself, though. It's fairly easy to train a model by now. There are tons of tutorials on how to write the code or tools which you can use for free (I use hasty.ai personally) to prototype quickly. Using these tools is especially convenient when you're new to machine learning, as it reduces the complexity a lot. Creating the right dataset is something you need to do your own, though.
