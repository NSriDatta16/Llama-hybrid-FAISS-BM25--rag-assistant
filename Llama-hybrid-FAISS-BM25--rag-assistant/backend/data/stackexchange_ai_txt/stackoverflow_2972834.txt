Using an example: (this is to extract words tagged as /VBx, where x is any single character) library("openNLP") acq Ok, my regular expression needs some improvement in order to get rid of the last line in the result. EDIT An alternative could be to ignore rows containing a space character sapply(strsplit(acqTag,"[[:punct:]]*/VB.?"),function(x) {res = sub("(^.*\\s)(\\w+$)", "\\2", x); res[!grepl("\\s",res)]} )
