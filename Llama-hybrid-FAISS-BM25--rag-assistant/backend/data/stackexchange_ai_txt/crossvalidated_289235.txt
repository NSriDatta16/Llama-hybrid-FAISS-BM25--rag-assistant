I think I can be more useful RE: #2 as a frequentist who, though appreciative of the logic, is only minimally trained in Bayesian techniques. The reason for the various answers regarding the interpretation of a grand intercept in a multilevel model is that it depends entirely on what 0 represents on your level 1 and level 2 covariates. Centering decisions heavily influence the interpretation of intercepts in regression models in general and especially so in HLM/MLM models. See this brief treatment for some additional guidance that may be helpful. It was written for HLM users but perhaps is also applicable in this instance. In general, reasoning through the interpretation of an intercept in multilevel models can be one of the trickiest components of HLM/MLM. Hope that helps and good luck.
