Normalization of categorical factor variables

For supervised machine learning for prediction, if I had some feature variables that are real, and also some features that are categorical--which have been coded using dummy variables (010, 001 etc)--I have normalized the real variables so that each of them sums to one. I am wondering what kind of a preprocessing I should do for the rest of the categorical features, before I run cross-validation routines and regression methods.
