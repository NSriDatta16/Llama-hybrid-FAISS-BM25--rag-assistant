Statistical test / model to assess what category (IV) leads to highest mean (DV)

What statistical tests and e.g. regression models or similar can be done in R to asses which category (=predictor/IV, variable is called strategy 5-level factor ,e.g., "extreme", "average", mixed", ...) performs best in terms of the average correct choice (=respone/DV, variable is called hit_mean , ranges from 0 to 1. There are further IVs I need to include in a model which are numeric ( similarity_mean) & a binary dummy variable ( p_shaped ). As the categorical variable strategy cannot be turned into a numeric variable as it will lose its logic behind it, what can be done in terms of regression, etc.? Sample size = 1690) . Thank you all in advance!
