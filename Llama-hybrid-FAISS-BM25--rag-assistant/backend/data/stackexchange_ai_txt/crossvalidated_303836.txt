what's the more common name of "Three-way data splits"?

I'm using Libsvm to train the model but the result is always not so good. now I'm reading this lecture's document: http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/iss/iss_l13.pdf the lecture mentioned "Three-way data splits", when we train a model, we should have one "training data" and two "testing data", the training data form the model, the first testing data adjust the parameter, then the second testing data get the accurancy. it's reasonable for me and I want to find more information about the method (and if there is a source code of this method. it is difficult to me to modify the grid.py of libsvm to this Three-way data splits) however, all the information I can search in the internet is only the lecture's note. I'm wondering there is other name of this method. thanks for any information!
