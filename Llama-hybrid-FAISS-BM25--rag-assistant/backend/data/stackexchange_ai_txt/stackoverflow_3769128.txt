Indexing based on Peano-hilbert curve?

I have a x,y,z 3D points stored in MySQL, I would like to ask the regions, slices or point neighbours. Are there way to index the points using Peano-Hilbert curves to accelerate the queries? Or are there more efficient way to store the 3D data in the MySQL? thanks Arman.
