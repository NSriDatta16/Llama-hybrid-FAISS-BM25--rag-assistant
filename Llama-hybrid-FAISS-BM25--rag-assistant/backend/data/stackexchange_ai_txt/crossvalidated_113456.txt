Fitting a straight line to components of complex numbers

I have a strange problem that I'm not sure how to solve: I have complex data points in a time series. The amplitude of these complex numbers in the time series forms a straight line, which I have fit for. But now what I want to do is subtract this fit from the data points. Except I have no idea how to do that since I have fit in amplitude space, and I have to subtract it from (real, imaginary) space. Is there any way to do this, or am I completely misguided?
