If you just have one or a small number of points to test against, the fastest-to-render method would probably be to write a shader in GLSL that conditionally modifies fragment colors based on world-space distance to your point(s). An alternative that may be simpler if you've never done GLSL programming would be to use vertex arrays and maintain a map from your triangle vertices to coordinates indexing the vertex arrays; then you can take whatever vertices trigger the collision test and manually modify their associated color data on each frame.
