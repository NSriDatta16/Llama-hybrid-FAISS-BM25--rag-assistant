We know a few things: This looks a lot like homework and therefore you should include the "Self Study" tag. You need to read more of your textbook and pay better attention in class, this should be an easy answer. The teacher either made a calculation mistake, is really bad at math, or is using a very different definition of standard deviation from the rest of us (or made the mistake of thinking that a spreadsheet program is a reasonable tool for computing statistics). The teacher is really strict about penalizing for guessing, the usual penalties work out that the expected value for guessing is the same as for leaving the answer blank.
