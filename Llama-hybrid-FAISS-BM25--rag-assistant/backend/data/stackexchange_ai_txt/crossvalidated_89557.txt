Limit multiclassification SVM - ANN

I have some questions on the limits of SVM and ANN for multiclass problem. I know about "one vs all" and "all vs all" strategies but I only want to know the limit of a unique SVM and ANN. Is there a theoretical limit on the number of classes that an SVM can learn ? I suppose that if too many vectors are present, they could overlap and the SVM would stop working correctly. What about artificial neural networks ? Is it related to the number of output neurons ? Can we calculate the memory footprint based on the number of vectors and neurons ?
