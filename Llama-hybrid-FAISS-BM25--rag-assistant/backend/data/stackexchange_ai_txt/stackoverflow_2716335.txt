Anyone experiencing slow WPF application with RDLC reports?

I have an WPF application for 60 users tops. Some of they are cashier users, and I use RDLC reports to show customer orders. The problem is, users are telling that application is getting slow or hanging. This WPF application uses most up-to-date Enterprise Library. Connection pooling is handled by default, there's no customization. RDLC files use dataset XSD files. XSD files use database stored procedures to select data. On xsd files used by RDCL I have something like: Data Source=Junior-PC;Initial Catalog=FoodAndBeverage;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=mypass On c# code-behind, the static connection string: Data Source=Junior-PC;Initial Catalog=FoodAnBeverage;User ID=sa;Password=mypass;Connection Timeout=4 Every 30 seconds I also have a DispatcherTimer to check if Database Server IP is found. Anyone having similar problems regarding this slow WPF application issue using RDLC? Would it be a problem with WindowsFormsHost getting slow, which shows RDLC reports? What could I do to speed up?
