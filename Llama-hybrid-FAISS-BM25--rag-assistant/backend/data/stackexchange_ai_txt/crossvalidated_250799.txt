Not sure about gold standard, but have you looked at regularizarion methods such as LASSO? They are used when one is trying to fit a regression with a large number of predictors - LASSO in particular can double as a variable selection tool. The R packages gamlr and glmnet both should allow you to easily run a cross-validated LASSO with logistic regression.
