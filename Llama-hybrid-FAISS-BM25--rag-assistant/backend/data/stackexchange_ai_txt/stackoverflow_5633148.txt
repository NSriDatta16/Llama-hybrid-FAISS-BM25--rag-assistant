Is there any sense or organisation to the Umbraco .Net namespaces?

Umbraco has a variety of namespaces, however, they seem ill-organised and complicated. For instance, what's the difference between umbraco.businesslogic and umbraco.cms.businesslogic Is there anything behind the way they're organised?
