As a rule, the probability of an event is never greater than one (the pdf can take any arbitrarily high value (nonnegative), but the probability measure of any event, i.e. any member of the $\sigma$ -algebra, cannot be larger than one). It makes sense to compute $P(X | Y)$ with the Bayesian theorem, but then you need the probabilities $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ , which you don't know. You don't know the probability that both parents have AA, nor that a child has phenotype A. Your attempt to e.g. compute $P(X)$ in point (1) could be improved: You have presumed all those pairings to have the same probability (which they don't have) and you didn't consider the fact that (AO, AO) can also lead to the child being O. And even then you would have computed $P(X|Y)$ not $P(X)$ . There are some additional issues in your post, e.g. the argument with the 26 kids and the computation of the 26th power of a number less than one giving a number larger than one.
