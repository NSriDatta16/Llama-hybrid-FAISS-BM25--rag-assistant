The RList isn't a list of string s - you need to use ReceipeList objects, like below; note I'm using the fact that the list ( rcp ) has a field-initializer (you could actually remove the set and it would still work, as long as you aren't using XmlSerializer ): person[] prn = new person[] { new person { Name = "Robert", RList = { new RecipeList { NameofRecipe = "Coak" }, new RecipeList { NameofRecipe = "Pizza" } } }, new person { Name = "Rahim", RList = { new RecipeList { NameofRecipe = "Coak" }, new RecipeList { NameofRecipe = "OnionBread" } } }, }; Note that you could simplify this with a few bespoke constructors...
