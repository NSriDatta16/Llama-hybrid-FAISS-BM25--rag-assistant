See here for a basic overview of the Filestream feature. When using Filestream, you let Sql Server engine control the placement and naming of NTFS files. The physical paths are abstracted by the engine and therefore clients cannot directly manipulate/rename them. The idea is that if your scenario organizes the blobs into a hierarchy, that hierarchy needs to be implemented on the relational level. Since opening filestream data needs to happen through special API (and involves the Sql Server engine), your existing client code would have to be changed to use this API rather than opening NTFS files directly.
