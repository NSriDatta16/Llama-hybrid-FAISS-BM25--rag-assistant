The best trick I know for shortening PHP code is to not shorten PHP (or any language) code. All of the tips you've mentioned are things I would never use, because readability is much, much more important than making your file size smaller. Let's look at your first example: if(TRUE)yes();else no(); If we were to write this out in "longhand", it would look like this: if (TRUE) { yes(); } else { no(); } You're saving a grand total of 14 bytes , but at what cost? If you come back to that in two months (and you will, even if you don't think so now), which of those two code samples is going to be more obvious to you? Storage space is cheap, programmer time is not.
