Getting error code 2869 while installing an upgraded version of the same application

I have a C#.NET application having some version 1.0.0.1. I did some modifications to my application & want to release it with an upgraded version 1.0.0.2. If the older version 1.0.0.1 is already installed in client's system & if client tries to install the newer version 1.0.0.2, then it is throwing the followin error message Installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2869. Initially after changing the version no:, I had also changed the productCode of the new version. But did not modify the upgrage code in the set up project. Can any one kindly let me know how to fix this error 2869.. Thanks In advance.
