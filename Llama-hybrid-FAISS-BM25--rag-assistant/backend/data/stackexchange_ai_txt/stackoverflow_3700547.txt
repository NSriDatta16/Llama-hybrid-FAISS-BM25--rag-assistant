Working with Symfony and Git (collaboration)

Suppose we have a Project with three applications — A, B and C. Our team: Jack, Susan and Martin. And one project leader — David. Each programmer is working on their own application: A - Jack B - Susan C - Martin So, there is a problem with source code management. How to effectively organize it with Git? I have several use-cases, but I'm not really sure if they are correct and effective. Here they are: One repo for whole project. Separate repositories for A, B and C apps (within their appropriate directories in "apps" folder). I really like second idea, but I'm not if it's really effective. What do you thing and how would you organize such things? Any help will be appreciated.
