What I ended up doing was using the expando functionality built into liferay. Doing this I allow for entering a list of roles that should map to that organization. This allows me to look at the roles of my users when they login and determine what organizations they should be a member of. I then programatically add/remove the users from the organizations based upon the roles defined in the expando attribute and the roles assigned to the user.
