As has been noted, default parameters were not a prioritized feature, but is likely to be added in C# 4.0. However, I believe there were excellent reasons not to include it earlier (in 4.0, as I've understood it, it√§s mostly to support duck typing styles of programming where default parameters increases type compatibility). I believe excessive parameter lists (certainly more than 4-5 distinct parameters) is a code smell . Default parameters are not evil in themselves, but risk encouraging poor design, delaying the refactoring into more objects.
