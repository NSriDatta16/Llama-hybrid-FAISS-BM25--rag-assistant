I know it's a little late, but I can answer your first question. First, let's denote the distance between two points $a$ and $b$ as $d(a,b)$ . In your case, $d$ will be ED. Next, let's denote the "DTW distance" between $T[i]$ and $Q[j]$ as $\delta(T[i], Q[j])$ . Note that I am using different symbols to denote the two distances. In DTW, for $i>0$ and $j>0$ , $$ \delta(T[i], Q[j]) = d(T[i],Q[j]) + min(\delta(T[i-1],Q[j]), \delta(T[i],Q[j-1]), \delta(T[i-1],Q[j-1])) $$ For $i=0$ or $j=0$ , $\delta(T[i], Q[j])$ is defined a little differently, but with the same intuition.( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping#Implementation ) Finally, the distance that the algorithm returns is $\delta(T[I],Q[J])$ , where $I$ and $J$ are the endpoints of the two time series' $T$ and $Q$ . As you can see, the DTW algorithm actually computes the distance in a linear manner, very much like Manhattan Distance. The metric you defined ( $d$ =Euclidean Distance in your case) is only used to compute the pointwise distances. In short, comparing ED with DTW(with distance metric as ED) would be like comparing $ED(T,Q)$ to $\Sigma_{a,b}ED(a,b)$ , where $a$ and $b$ are optimally matched, so it's not a fair comparison. For Question 2, I don't understand what you are asking.
