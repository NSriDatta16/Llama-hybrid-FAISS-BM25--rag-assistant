What should be considered using sub-selects in queries with heavy loaded databases?

We are developing an application with a persistence layer using OpenJPA1.1 and an Oracle DB as back end storage. I will use queries with subselects (see my question at Solving JPA query finding the last entry in connected list ). Now my colleagues at work remark, that such queries can lead to performance problems as the database is filled with thousands of customer date used by a few thousand concurrent user (which will be reality in production). So, my question is: is there a "best practice" using subselects in queries under this circumstances? And what must be considered by doing this?
