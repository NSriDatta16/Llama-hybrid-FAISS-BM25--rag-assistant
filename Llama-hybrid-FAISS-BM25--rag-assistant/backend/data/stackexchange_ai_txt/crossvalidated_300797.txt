(@Gijs is right that this is just algebra, but perhaps it will help you to see it worked out.) Consider that "$\exp(b_0+b_1RS)$" is an odds of some event, and that "${\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)$" is the probability of the same event (cf., Interpretation of simple predictions to odds ratios in logistic regression ). To make it easier to see what's going on, we can replace these complicated expressions with "$o$" and "$p$", respectively. Now, recognize that: $$ p=\frac{o}{1+o} \qquad\qquad o=\frac{p}{1-p} $$ If you substitute the full expressions into the formula on the left, you will get your third equation. On the other hand, if we substitute the full expressions into the right formula, you would get this: $$ \exp(b_0+b_1RS) = \bigg(\frac{{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}{1-{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}\bigg) $$ which isn't quite the same. To get to your fourth formula, take the log of both sides, and then just switch the right hand side and the left hand side: \begin{align} \log(\exp(b_0+b_1RS)) &= \log\bigg(\frac{{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}{1-{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}\bigg) \\[8pt] \log\bigg(\frac{{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}{1-{\rm Pr}(RW_i|RS_i,b_0,b_1)}\bigg) &= b_0+b_1RS \end{align} Thus, all we need to establish is the fact that the "$o$"s in the right equation above are the same as the "$o$" in the left equation, and likewise for the "$p$"s between the two equations. What is potentially unintuitive is that you will need to take the reciprocal of both sides at a couple of points. It's a bit tedious to write out the algebra, but it doesn't take too many steps: \begin{align} p &= \frac{o}{1+o} &\text{right formula}& \\[8pt] \frac 1 p &= \frac{1+o}{o} &\text{taking reciprocals}& \\[8pt] \frac 1 p &= \frac 1 o + \frac o o &\text{separate out }\frac o o& \\[8pt] \frac 1 p &= \frac 1 o + 1 &\frac o o = 1& \\[8pt] \frac 1 p - 1 &= \frac 1 o &\text{subtracting 1}& \\[8pt] \frac 1 p - \frac p p &= \frac 1 o &1 = \frac p p& \\[8pt] \frac{1-p}{p} &= \frac 1 o &\text{simplifying}& \\[8pt] \frac{p}{1-p} &= o &\text{taking reciprocals}& \\[8pt] o &= \frac{p}{1-p} &\text{left formula}& \end{align} You might also find What is the difference between logistic and logit regression? helpful.
