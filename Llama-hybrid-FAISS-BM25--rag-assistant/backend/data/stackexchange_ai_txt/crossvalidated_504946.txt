$w=(1,1)$ and $w=(2,2)$ won't be the same line/plane because there is also the constant term $b$ . In SVM, we try to maximize the margin between the classes, and the margin is $2/||w||$ (see the figure in the wikipedia page ). Maximizing the margin is achieved by minimizing $||w||$ . SVM is sometimes also called as max-margin classifier. By maximizing the margin, you make the classifier more robust, which in turn, makes the overfitting less probable.
