Does clustering belong to the domain of data mining or to the domain of machine learning?

Question 1. Does clustering belong to the domain of data mining or to the domain of machine learning? Or to both domains? Question 2. Depending on the answer to Question 1, could you please suggest a good reference about it as well? I mean: Either a reference on "clustering belongs to the domain of data mining" Or a reference on "clustering belongs to the domain of machine learning" Or a reference on "clustering lies at the interface between data mining and machine learning" Note. If not possible to reply to both questions, I would greatly appreciate a reply to Question 1 at least.
