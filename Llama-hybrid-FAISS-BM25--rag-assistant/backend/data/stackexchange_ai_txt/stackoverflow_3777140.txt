How do you organize your business requirements and tests?

as of right now i'm working at place where's there's a lot of legacy codes and pretty much no useful documentation. and most of the time we just treat business requirements as whatever that is already implemented previously. i'm looking for any tools or useful method to keep all the requirements for future use and for regression testing mostly. i'm thinking of maybe linking them up to tests/unit test too so that the business requirements are linked directly to the coding logic. Any good tools or resources to get me started? thanks~ Updates As of now i'm making things simple on myself by writing use case and then create some simple use case diagram using this awesome tool and then convert each use case into a test plan. The test plan is meant for the end user, thus i just make it into a simple step by step flow. I had plans to automate this part using selenium but it wasn't working that well on our website and was taking too long. It's a bit TDD, but i think it create simple understandable goal for both end user and the developer, i hope. So for now it's just excel and doc file, lugged into the project doc folder and check into cvs/svn doomed to be outdated and be forgotten :P
