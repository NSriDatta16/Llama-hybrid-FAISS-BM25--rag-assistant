ANOVA with some paired and some unpaired subjects

I am a biologist rather than statistician so I might lack some insight. I have measurements on two paired groups (baseline and follow-up) along with a separate group of healthy controls. In addition the design of the study is unbalanced (n = 12 for B and F and n = 5 for HC). Question Is there an ANOVA technique that would allow me to carry out a fair ANOVA taking the inherent pairing into account for groups Baseline and follow-up? I've done some analysis already with paired t-tests for baseline versus follow-up and then unpaired tests for each group versus the healthy controls but I wondered whether I was missing a more elegant technique.
