Creating audit triggers in SQL Server

I need to implement change tracking on two tables in my SQL Server 2005 database. I need to audit additions, deletions, updates (with detail on what was updated). I was planning on using a trigger to do this, but it seams that this is easy to do this incorrectly. Can anybody post an example of an update trigger that accomplishes this successfully and in an elegant manner? I am hoping to end up with an audit table with the following structure: ID LogDate TableName TransactionType (update/insert/delete) RecordID FieldName OldValue NewValue ... thoughts?
