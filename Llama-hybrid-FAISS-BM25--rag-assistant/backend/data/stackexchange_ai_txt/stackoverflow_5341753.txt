You won't be able to catch chrome.management.onEnabled event for your own extension. If you are trying to execute some code on first extension installation then you would need to store some flag in a local storage. background.html if(!localStorage["first_run"]) { //do something at first run here localStorage["first_run"] = "done"; } (for more advanced solution see this answer ) If you want to execute some code each time extension starts (browser startup) just put in into background.html .
