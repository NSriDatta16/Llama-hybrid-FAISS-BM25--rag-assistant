Building a Tic Tac Toe game which learns by itself

Let's assume we have a huge database gathered which contains winning sequences, which each player played and won. (Both the players are programmed, to obtain random numbers and attempt playing the game). What would be the best way to use these winning sequences each player has gathered for future plays? Are we going to program one occurrence to play without using historical data and few other occurrences using historical data? What would be the best way to save the winning sequences, the entire path which both the player One and Player Two has taken or only the sequence used by the winning player? This is my first attempt to machine learning paradigm and hope some support could be taken!
