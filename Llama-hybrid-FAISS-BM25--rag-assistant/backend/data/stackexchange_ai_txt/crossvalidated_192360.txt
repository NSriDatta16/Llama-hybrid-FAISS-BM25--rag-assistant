Here's a totally different criterion I use to choose between (linear) discriminant analysis and logistic regression: Discriminant analysis primarily models your class as elliptic (Gaussian), whereas logistic regression concentrates more on the class boundaries (SVM do so even more). Cases far in the back will influence discriminant analysis model but not logistic regression. I ask myself: Will cases at the backside of the classes occur (think about data generation process), and should they influence the decision boundary or not?
