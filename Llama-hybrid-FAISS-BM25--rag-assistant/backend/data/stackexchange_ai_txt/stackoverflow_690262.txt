How can i create a soap header like this?

Doing some SOAP calls to a 3rd party application. They provide this soap header as an example of what the application expects. How can I create a SOAP header like this in PHP? XXXX XXX I do what i think is a correct call and keep getting in return that no headers were sent. Here is a sample from my code. class SOAPStruct { function __construct($user, $pass) { $this->Username = $user; $this->Password = $pass; } } $client = new SoapClient("http://www.example.com/service"); $auth = new SOAPStruct("username", "password"); $header = new SoapHeader("http://example.com/service", "TUsernameToken", $auth); $client->__setSoapHeaders(array($header)); $client->__soapCall("GetSubscriptionGroupTypes", array(), NULL, $header) And this is the SOAP header i get back. (its more but i stripped info away that might be sensitive) username password
