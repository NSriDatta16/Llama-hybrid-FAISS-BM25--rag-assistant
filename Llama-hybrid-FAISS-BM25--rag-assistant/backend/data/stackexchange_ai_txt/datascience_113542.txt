Is it possible to extract precise decision boundaries from a random forest for a multiclass classification?

I have a random forest (argmax post-processor) with 3 trees and 10 input features. The final outcome of the random forest is either true or false depending on the combination of the feature values. Is there a way to extract the precise decision boundaries for each class (True/False)? What I'm looking for: Class: True Tree 1: feature 1 2.3 Tree 2: feature 3 > 3.1 and feature 7 > 8.9 Tree 3: feature 2 > 0.9 and feature 8
