is it possible to use more than one SQLite files in CoreData?

Hello fellow stackoverflow family members? I know it is un-efficient to create one extra sqlite table in iPhone CoreData system. (X) Currently, My app has one sqlite table but there are preset data to users to no need to waste parse time. But if I adding new entity in current structure of SQLite table, it wipes up the whole preset data. I haven't tried to use immigrate method but I don't think it wouldn't be just adding a new entity on the table. I'm thinking it also wipes up previous preset data. Current Architecture of SQLite file. entity : A attributes : contains data I want to keep A with attributes still contain data but also add new entity : B. entity : A attributes : previous contained data (PLUS+) entity : B attributes : new data Do I need to create extra persistence set to separately store entity B (create another SQLite file and use as storage) or Is there possible way to add entity B in current SQLite with no changes in entity A? Thank you.
