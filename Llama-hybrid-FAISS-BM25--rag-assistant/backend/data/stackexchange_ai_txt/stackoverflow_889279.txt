Doing this well would not be a small effort at all - the open source community is on at least the third generation of open source CI servers - with lots of lessons learned along the way. I would certainly encourage you to look at one of the off-the-shelf CI servers that allows for easy extension, and build out those pieces that are missing. There is nothing in your question that isn't done (and done very well) in most of the existing CI servers. I did implement a "poor man's" internal CI system prior to moving to an open source solution, and found that the open source systems were so much better, complete, and robust that my effort was pointless. In particular, if you're looking for extensability, Hudson would be a great choice - it has a great plugin architecture, and the author is available for paid consulting work - probably a MUCH better use of your resources than rolling your own. As an aside, prior to my involvement with the build process, a product build was a 14.5 hour affair, with no automated testing, packaging, or CM. Thanks to some effort, and following the best practices laid out by the existing CI community, the same project build is down to 7.5 minutes, with automated testing, packaging, and CM. In my experience, it's definitely worth some effort to work your build to comply with the existing best practices of the experienced CI community, rather than trying to make CI bend to your existing build.
