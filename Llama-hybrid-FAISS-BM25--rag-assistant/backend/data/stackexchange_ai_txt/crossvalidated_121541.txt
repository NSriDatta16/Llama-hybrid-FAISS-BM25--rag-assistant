Nonstationary panel data, spurious regression

I would like a more detailed explanation of this quote: "Unlike the single time series spurious regression literature, the panel data spurious regression estimates give a consistent estimate of the true value of the parameter as both N and T tend to infinity. This is because, the panel estimator averages across individuals and the information in the independent cross-section data in the panel leads to a stronger overall signal than the pure time series case." (from Baltagi's Econometric Analysis of Panel Data). I find it odd. How can spurious regression provide consistent estimate of the true value (typical spurious regression yields non-zero coefficient estimates, while the true value is zero)? The quote above gives me the impression that in a panel environment, one does not need to worry about the nonstationarity of the variables. Is this correct?
