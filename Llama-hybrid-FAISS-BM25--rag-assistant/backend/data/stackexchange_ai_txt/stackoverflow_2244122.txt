jqueryui alternative

I'm looking for a javascript user interface library (or framework). I will use it with jquery. Of course jquery-ui was my first stop, but it doesn't give me even the simplest features i want. it can be very good for rich widgets like calendars, modals, sorting, dragging, but it lacks the core functions i need. for example, i want to be able to add a button like this: $('#test_div').button({ 'name': 'test_button', 'css': 'border: 1px solid #000000', 'onclick': 'button_click();', 'onmouseover': 'button_over()' }); obviously this is just an example and it's not following jquery or jquery-ui conventions, but hopefully you understand what i mean. the problem is not only buttons or simple elements. another example is jquery windows. while possible, it's a headache to try to implement jqueryui windows inline, and obviously jqueryui is not meant for that. so the questions are: is there an interface library like this, which i can use with jquery? does jquery-ui has this kind of functionality that i don't know of?
