large database file (mdb) takes time to load in vb.net so need alternative

I have 4k records in access database. And one of the field value contains ~100 lines each so and one other field has ~25 lines. So total database size reaches ~30MB and it takes lot of time 15-20 seconds to load the database in vb.net using odbc http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/net/nets12p5.html and updating of any other small fields also takes time due to database being large So as an alternative I used rtf file (txt files were not preserving all the newline characters). So these file are around 5-10kb only. But for 4k records and 2 fields I have now 8k files. And copying of these 8k rtf files is taking huge time for 5MB transfer it takes an hour or so. So is there any other alternative for storage of this data. So that it will be portable and easily loaded/accessed/updated from vb.net?
