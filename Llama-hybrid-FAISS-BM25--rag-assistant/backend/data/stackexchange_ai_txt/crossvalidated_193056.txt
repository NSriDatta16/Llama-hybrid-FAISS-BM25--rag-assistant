How to determine posterior distribution of the parameter in a binomial

Assuming that I performed n iid tests, and the total number of test is n which is a fixed value, and the observaton of 1 which corresponding to successful results is X observations yeild with probability p, I know X a random variable draw from binomial distribution B(n,p). Now, assuming the prior P(p) from an uniform distribution, I want to calculate a posterior probability P(p|n,X) with respect to different X values. From some textbooks, I know the conjugate prior for the binomial distritbution is a beta distribution. But the deta distribution is for continueous random variables. So how can I calculate the posterior P(p|n,X)? Shall I use beta-binomial distribution instead of beta distribution to calculate the posterior probabilty P(p|n,X)? I tried to calculate the posterior P(p|n,X) directly, using Bayesian rule, but I'm not sure wehther or not I can calculate P(p|n,X) in this way. Suppose n is fixed, P(p) is uniform distribution. My method is that I simply calculate the posterior P(p|n,X) from P(X|n,p)~B(n,p) with different p values. For instance, I calculated a 100X100 2D table of P(X|n,p) with different X (X as the first dimension of the table, range form 1 to n, with interval 1) and p (p as the second dimension of the table range form 0.01 to 1.0, with interval 0.01), then the posterior probability P(p|n,X) for each discretized p with respect to praticular X value from the 2D table by using Bayesian rule. Is this a correct way to calculate the P(p|n,X)?
