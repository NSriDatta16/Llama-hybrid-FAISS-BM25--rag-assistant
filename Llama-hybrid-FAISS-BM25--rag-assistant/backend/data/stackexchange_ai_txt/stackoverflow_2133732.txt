Does JAXB use bytecode instrumentation?

Someone where i work noticed (in stacktrace) that when running the jvm with -javaagent:spring-instrumentation.jar my JAXB annotated classes have strange new methods in them which we didn't write: e.g. SomeJaxbAnnotatedClass$JaxbAccessorM_getFields_setFields_java_util_Set.get Does this mean that jaxb uses bytecode instrumentation when it is available? Where can i read more about this functionality? Thanks, Yuval
