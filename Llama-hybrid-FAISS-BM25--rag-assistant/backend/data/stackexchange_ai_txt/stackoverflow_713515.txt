Generics would be the principal benefit on my list. The WinForms designer has received several usability improvements since .NET 1.1 days, text alignment guidelines being one of my favourites. However, I would ask why don't you move all the way to .NET 3.5? Edit Rationale for moving to .NET 3.5 It's the latest version! LINQ Extension Methods (less significant, but a "nice" addition) I used .NET 1.1 for several years before moving briefly to .NET 2.0 and recently to .NET 3.5. I cannot understate the profound benefits I've seen from the use of LINQ syntax when querying and processing any sort of data that exists in a list (array, collection etc). The most readable information I've found on LINQ is at Charlie Calvert's blog . If you are planning to just get your application building in a newer version of .NET and then use the Infragistics control suite then you might not be able to take advantage of the language additions in .NET 3.5, but giving yourself the opportunity to do so in the future makes sense to me.
