You can also use a MultiBinding.. Bind to the Person object, the FirstName and LastName. That way, the value gets updated as soon as FirstName or LastName throws the property changed event. Or if you only use the FirstName and LastName, strip the Person object from the binding to something like this: And the MultiValueConverter looks like this: class PersonNameConverter : IMultiValueConverter { public object Convert(object[] values, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { return values[0].ToString() + " " + values[1].ToString(); } public object ConvertBack(object[] values, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } } But of course, the selected answer works as well, but a MultiBinding works more elegantly...
