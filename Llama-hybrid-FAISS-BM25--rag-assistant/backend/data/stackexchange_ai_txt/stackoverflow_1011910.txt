What are your thoughts/opinions on this particular point? I always keep primary binaries in the Resource/Library folder of the .NET software project. Obviously this folder is versioned. Storage is cheap these days anyway, so it does not make a big difference. This serves a few purposes: Projects are atomic and they do not depend on having a specific version of some library in GAC. So it is easy to reproduce some previous revision by simply checking it out. And everything will work. It just requires a clean development machine (with all the .NET service packs and primary SDKs installed, of course), in order to start check out a project, run full integration build and start working. When there are more than 10 different projects to manage, this starts making some difference.
