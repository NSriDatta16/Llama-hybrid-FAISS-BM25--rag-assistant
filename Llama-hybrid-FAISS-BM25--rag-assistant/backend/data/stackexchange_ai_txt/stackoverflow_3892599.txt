Creating relationships between tables

My question specifically about sql-server, but probably can be answered by anyone with any database background If I want table A to have a 1:1 relationship with table B on a certain column, should I somehow modify the CREATE TABLE statement to identify this relationship or is this something that is not done at all (and rather it is handled by logic)? EDIT The second part of my question is: what is the point of embedding this into the code? why not just handle it logically on selects/updates?
