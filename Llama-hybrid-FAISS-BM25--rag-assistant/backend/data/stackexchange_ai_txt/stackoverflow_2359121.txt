I would say that Silverlight is likely to be a little more load-balancer friendly than ASP.NET. You have much more sophisticated mechanisms for maintaining state (such as isolated local storage), and pretty much, you only need to talk to the server when (a) you initially download the application, and then (b) when you make a web service call to retrieve or update data. It's analogous in this sense to an Ajax application written entirely in C#. To put it another way, so long as either (a) your server-side persistence layer knows who your client is, or (b) you pass in all relevant data on each WCF call, it doesn't matter which web server instance the call goes to. You don't have to muck about with firewall-level persistence to make sure your HTTP call goes back to the right web server.
