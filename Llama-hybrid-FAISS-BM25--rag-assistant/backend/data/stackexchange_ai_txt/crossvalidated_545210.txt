I wouldn't make too much of a distinction between Markov models and survival models. Survival analysis models times to events as functions of covariates and times. In a multi-state survival model, the events are transitions to different states. A Markov chain imposes a lack of memory about states prior to the current one. Whether that lack of memory holds in your situation depends on your understanding of the subject matter. The situation you describe seems to be quite amenable to a multi-state survival model. If you have data on "how many patients are in the hospital, how many patients are in each state and the rate at which they are transitioning," then those can be included in the model. The basic ideas are nicely outlined in the multi-state vignette of the R survival package . The complexity of this particular situation could require the more elaborate tools provided by the msm package , illustrated in its own vignette .
