You could use: Bayesian Models Comparison based on Bayes Factor. In this case, you have the relative probability between the various models; below I provide an R implementation. Also, I found an article that uses Bayes Factor for a problem similar to your: [The Bayes Factor Against Equiprobability of a Multinomial Population Assuming a Symmetric Dirichlet Prior][1] The R language code is library(stats) p1 Generate a sample from p2 n.observations Here we define prior probabilities and assign same probability to the three models prior_p1 Calculate posteriors prob_p1_given_data Calculate relative probabilities p2_relative_to_p1
