Testing a dataset returned from a database

If I am testing a database rowset, what would be the criteria to test against? Should I test that a row exists with a name of A, etc etc (What's in the database)? Is this a bad idea? This sort of test is fragile as the data can change but the query can be correct. With that in mind, would it be better to check the column names I have returned in the dataset? Like so (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/696782/retrieve-column-names-from-java-sql-resultset). Thanks
