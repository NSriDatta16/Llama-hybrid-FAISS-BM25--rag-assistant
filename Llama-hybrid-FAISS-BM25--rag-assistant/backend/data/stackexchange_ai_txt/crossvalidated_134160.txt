Is it possible to simplify linear regression if one of the variables does not have errors and is equispaced?

Specifically, I have a time series with fixed $\Delta t$ of the following form: $x_0, x_1, x_2, ... x_n$ and $t_0, t_1, t_2, ... t_n$ where $t_{i+1}-t_i =\Delta t $. I'm interested in the improved efficiency for large data sets, if it is possible to simplify linear regression in this context. Edit: I editet the title since equispaced is an important property.
