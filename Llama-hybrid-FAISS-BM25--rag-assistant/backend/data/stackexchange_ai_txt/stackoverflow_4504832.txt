jquery cookie plugin: saving positions of various elements with same class?

i have some drag and drop items, which are just draggable vertically within my body. $("ul.bars li").draggable({ containment: "body"}); so the user can drag the items wherever he wants. now i wanna save the position of each element with the jquery cookie plugin. when the page is reloaded i want to position each element again on the saved position. so whenever the drag is stopped i save the cookie: $("ul.bars li").draggable({ stop: function(event, ui) { var currentPos = $(this).position(); $.cookie('position', currentPos.top ); } }); and when the page is reloaded (dom ready) i run through each element and query the last position saved in the cookie. $(function() { $("ul.bars li").each(function() { var savedPosition = $.cookie('position'); $(this).css({ top: savedPosition }); }); }); that's my basic idea, however i have no idea how i can save a seperate cookie for each element so the position can be distinguished. currently i overwrite the same cookie every time i drag an element. how can i add some kind of a distinguishable variable to position each element at the same position where it was left before the page reload? any creative idea how to solve that? thank you
