I need a number of different full-page DOM samples for my qUnit test suite

I have a small amount of Javascript to test, but it operates on the entire page, for example, finding elements by numbered ids like "#t34". I need to create a handful of different pages to test the different possible configurations. I see that I can use qunit-fixture to create a DOM tree for the tests to access, but each page configuration needs to be a complete page, since it will find elements by id. The various qUnit tutorials out there seem focused on the simple examples of pure Javascript functions performing simple arithmetic. I need help understanding how to build a real test suite using a number of different files. Updated with more details: I'm the owner of coverage.py , the Python code coverage tool. It generates HTML reports. These reports have jQuery on them to add a little bit of interactivity. I'm adding quite a lot more, and would like to automate the testing. The HTML looks like this . There is no server involved, these are just files written to a local directory, so there is no opportunity for ajax. I would like to run my tests against a number of different page configurations, mostly to do with edge cases of red- and green-colored chunks of code. Because my code accesses source lines by number as $("#t123") (for example), I can't have more than one "page" of HTML in the same DOM, since the ids will conflict. How can I run qUnit against different pages of HTML?
