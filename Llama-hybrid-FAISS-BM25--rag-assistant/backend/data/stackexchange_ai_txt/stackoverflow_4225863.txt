You are never going to get 100%, or not with today's technology. The most reliable way is to have markup the source, but as you are web scraping you don't have this. Rather than regex, you could try some more sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. I don't know what is available for Perl, but Python's NLTK is good for getting started. It is a toolkit designed so you can pick and choose what you need to extract the info you need, plus there are a couple of good books out there - including the open sourced O'Reilly book Natural Language Processing with Python .
