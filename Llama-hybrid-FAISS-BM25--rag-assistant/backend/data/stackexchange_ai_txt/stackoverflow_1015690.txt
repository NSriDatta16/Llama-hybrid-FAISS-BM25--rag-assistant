I suggest that you first start by reading BONUS' tutorial , And then reading Real World Haskell (online for free) . Join the #Haskell IRC channel, on irc.freenode.com , and ask questions. These people are absolutely newbie friendly, and have helped me a lot over time. Also, right here on SO is a great place to get help with things you can't grasp! Try not to get discouraged, once it clicks, your mind will be blown. BONUS' tutorial will prime you up, and get you ready for the thrill ride that Real World Haskell brings. I wish you luck!
