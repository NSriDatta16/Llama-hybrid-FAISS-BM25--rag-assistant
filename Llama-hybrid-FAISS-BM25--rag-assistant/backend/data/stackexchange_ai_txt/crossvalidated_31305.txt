Instead of hearing it from me, why don't you read about it from the man[1] himself. In this paper, as the title suggests, the author points out some of the shortcomings of the probability theory and suggests the Fuzzy Theory can complement probability theory in overcoming those. In fact, he goes further and publishes [2]. You can go through these and see if his arguments are convincing enough for you. If they are not, then there is nothing I can say that is going to convince you anyways :-). [1] Discussion: Probability Theory and Fuzzy Logic Are Complementary Rather Than Competitive By Lotfi Zadeh [2] Toward a perception-based theory of probabilistic reasoning with imprecise probabilities By Lotfi Zadeh ======================================================================= Personal Opinion (written on request of the OP, others may ignore this content): A couple of years back, I was working on an Extraction Management System [3]. This system was to work along with a plethora of Information Extraction operators and extracts several entity relationships from the web. Now, for example, let us say, an operator extracts the unary relationship "Flat(Earth)". There are two things we need here : a] Correctness of extraction [What is the probability that the extraction has an error?] b] Correctness of the extracted relationship [What is the probability that the statement made in the extraction is incorrect?]. To clarify, let us say the webpage from which the relationship was extracted actually said, " ... made the trip to earth. Flat model was used ...". Clearly, the webpage is not saying, "earth is flat", so the extraction made an error (type a above). On the other hand, if the webpage actually said, "earth is flat", then the statement being made is incorrect (type b above). You can easily see cases where there is an correct extraction with an incorrect statement and incorrect extraction with an incorrect statement (an incorrect extraction with a correct statement is somewhat unlikely I presume). Downstream, we wanted to combine these two probabilities in a meaningful way and we did come up with a bayesian model to do it (along the lines of [4]), however, what I would like to point out here is that we did look at other possibilities at the time (like the imprecise probability stuff in [2]). Now, I would like to have given you numbers and so on and conclude by saying that systemA did better than systemB. But, I can't because I never got to doing those experiments :-). However, the takeaway here is that problems like these do exist in the real world applications and many different approaches to handling such cases in a generalized way is always nice. So, I welcome fuzzy models as much equally as Bayesian models. [3] Purple SOX Extraction Management System [4] Truth Discovery with Multiple Conflicting Information Providers on the Web
