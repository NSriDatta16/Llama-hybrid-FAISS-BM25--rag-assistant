Use a Timer, as mentioned by James Van Huis. That way, you will at least get the average frequency correct. Quote from the javadoc : If an execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection or other background activity), two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to "catch up." In the long run, the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified period (assuming the system clock underlying Object.wait(long) is accurate). Also, to answer your actual, but perhaps slightly misguided question: reusing an instance DatagramPacket and just setting a new output buffer shaves of a "massive" microsecond in average, on my machine... datagram.setData(out); socket.send(datagram); It reduces the load on the gc slightly so it might be a good idea if you are sending at a high rate.
