Try a radically different path to the subject: get "A History of Mathematical Statistics (From 1750 to 1930)", by Anders Hald, and learn about the history of our subject. Once you grasp the slow emergence of the concept of a statistical model , your questions will look trivial. The two pieces of a statistical model must be clearly understood: the observable data $X$ and the non-observable parameter $\Theta$. The sampling distribution of $X\mid \Theta$ is postulated, and our goal is to learn about $\Theta$ given some values of $X$. Looking at some of your questions: 1) Different models; 2) The $t$ distribution is the sampling distribution of a specific statistic (a function of data $X$) when the data are supposed to be normal; 3) The degrees of freedom characterize the sampling distribution of a statistic supposing that the values of $\Theta$ are constrained (by a so-called null hypothesis), and so on. Also, pick some simple inference problem (like normal data with known variance) and solve it in both the classical and Bayesian ways. Contrast the differences. That may be illuminating.
