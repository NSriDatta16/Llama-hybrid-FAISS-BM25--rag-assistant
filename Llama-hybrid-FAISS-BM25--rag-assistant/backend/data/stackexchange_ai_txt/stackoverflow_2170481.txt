I think this will get you what you want. As long as the file is consistent. from csv import reader with open('file') as f: listoftuples = [(float(row[0]), float(row[1])) for row in reader(f, delimiter=' ') if row and row[0] != 'FREQ'] If you want it to break at 'Y', then do this less elegant thingy: from csv import reader l = [] with open('file') as f: for row in reader(f, delimiter=' '): if row[0] == 'Y': break if row and row[0] != 'FREQ': l.append((floar(row[0]), float(row[1])))
