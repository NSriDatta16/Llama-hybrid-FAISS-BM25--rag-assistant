jQuery draggable into sortable only works after sorting

I'm experiencing problems with a simple combination of a Draggable and Sortable: initially, the dragging does not work and I do not get a receive callback. Only after I have done a sort (i.e. change the position of things in #workarea), can I drag new things into it. Somehow it seems as if the sortable needs to be 'initialized' before it accepts draggables. My code, in a simplified version: $(".element_draggable").draggable({ zIndex: 2, helper: 'clone', connectToSortable: '#workarea'}); $("#workarea").sortable({ receive: function() {alert('received');} }); Does anyone have an idea on what I could be doing wrong here?
