I hope answering one's own question is permissible here (such strict rules!): Anyway, I figured out what was going on after I took a closer look at the vector that was produced. Turns out I was mislabeling the svm-nodes in my vector. The correct code is below: /// /// Makes the prediction based on the supplied data vector. /// /// the vector /// the category prediction as a double public double Predict(double[] vector) { svm_node[] x = new svm_node[vector.Length]; for(int j = 0 ; j The loop is zero based and of course LIBSVM expects the labels to start at 1. I hope the corrected code helps someone else.
