How can I predict a 2D array over time?

I've got a rectangular region that's composed of 1024 grid cells (32x32 cells). Each of these cells has an associated value, which then builds me a 2D array. For that 2D array, I've got 8 samples (yearly samples) and I'd like to predict 2 samples ahead. In other words, the data shape is (8, 32, 32) (8 samples of the 32x32 grid) and I'd like to predict those (2, 32, 32) samples in the future. Most of the cells, individually, seems to follow an exponential trend. What I've already tried is using each cell, individually, as time-series, but this wouldn't take into account the cell's proximity and growth of neighbor cells, which I guess would improve my model. I'm aware that the number of samples is tiny, but I wonder if there's any way I could predict the whole 2D array at once. I've read in some places about Vector Autoregression and I've tried using statsmodels.tsa.vector_ar.var_model.VAR (Python), but it tells me that there are not enough observations. Besides that, I don't think that neural networks would perform well with this amount of samples. Is there anything else I could try?
