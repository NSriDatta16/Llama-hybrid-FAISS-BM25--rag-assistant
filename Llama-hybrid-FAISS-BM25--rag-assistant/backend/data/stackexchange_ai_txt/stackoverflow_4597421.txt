How do you put headers and footers each of a html printerout

I am looking for an easy way to have headers and footers on html printouts, it can even be pdf print outs. This is something that would be good to have when people are printing profiles on my platform, to be able to have a header that says, "John Doe" and a footer that says "page 1 of 2, Acme Inc, etc, etc". Any elegant easy ways to do this?
