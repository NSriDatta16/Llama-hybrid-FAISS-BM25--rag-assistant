Both are the same XG boost and GBM, both works on the same principle. In Xg boost parallel computation is possible, means in XG boost parallelly many GBM's are working. In Xgboost tunning parameters are more. Any of them can be used, I choose to go with XG boost due to some few more tuning parameters, giving slightly more accuracy.
