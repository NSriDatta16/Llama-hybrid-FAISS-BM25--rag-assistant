I would recommended not averaging over items and instead using an oridnal model with random effects. There are a bunch of problems both averaging over items and using metric models on ordinal data (e.g., Liddell & Kruschke, 2018). You can use the 'ordinal' package in R (Christensen, 2015). It can handle random effects for items and participants so that you don't have problems with pseudo-replication. If you would like a tutorial, this one was useful for me: Bürkner, P. C., & Vuorre, M. (2019). Ordinal regression models in psychology: A tutorial. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 2(1), 77-101. Other things I cited: Christensen, R. H. B. (2015). Analysis of ordinal data with cumulative link models—estimation with the R-package ordinal. R-package version, 28. Liddell, T. M., & Kruschke, J. K. (2018). Analyzing ordinal data with metric models: What could possibly go wrong?. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 79, 328-348.
