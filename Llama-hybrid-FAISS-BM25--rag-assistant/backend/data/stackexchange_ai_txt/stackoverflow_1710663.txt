UIScrollView only works if the child views aren't hit

I have a scroll view that doesn't scroll right, I've simplified the code for below. It draws the view and some horizontal buttons that i add more stuff to in the real code. If you drag the whitespace between the buttons the view scrolls. If you happen to put your finger on a button, it won't scroll. After a related suggestion, I tried to add the delaysContentTouches = YES line, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. UIScrollview with UIButtons - how to recreate springboard? What am I doing wrong? TIA, Rob Updated the code - (void)viewDidLoad { l = [self landscapeView]; [self.view addSubview:l]; [l release]; } - (UIScrollView *) landscapeView { // LANDSCAPE VIEW UIScrollView *landscapeView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 325)]; landscapeView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; landscapeView.delaysContentTouches = YES; NSInteger iMargin, runningY, n; iMargin = 3; runningY = iMargin; for (n = 1; n
