Why are things more popular? They are several reasons: because of a good user experience, fast development cycle, cheapest things, etc But sometimes the loudest or most hyped (rails, although it is great ;-)) or most arrogant (apple) or the things with the most aggressive marketing (microsoft) will win. That is called evolution. BTW: I am with Thevs. The component based frameworks will be the final winners (like GWT/Vaadin or wicket).
