Yes you can use these images. CNN's are translation invariant and don't require centered images. Convolution Neural networks are translation invariant both because they use: 1) Shared weights[Convolution Filters]: So if you learn that a particular feature is sensitive to cow's head in a particular part of the image, the shared weights ensure that the feature is sensitive to cow's head in any part of the image. However this alone does not give invariance to translation. Say you apply the same filter to six parts of the image, and supply them as features to next layer of the neural network, you can get [0 0 0 0 0 1] or [1 0 0 0 0 0 ] depending on the position of the cows head, and thus problem of learning translation in variance is still there. This just ensures that features learnt to detect cow's head in one location in training image, can be used in any part of the image during test time. 2) Pooling: This actually ensures translation in variance by choosing the maximum activation of the same filter at nearby 4 locations. Through a series of convolution and pooling operations we become insensitive to the location of the object in the original image and thus position does not matter at all.
