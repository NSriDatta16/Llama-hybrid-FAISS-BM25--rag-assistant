I use comments in the following situations: High-level API documentation comments, i.e. what is this class or function for? Commenting the "why". A short, high-level summary of what a much longer block of code does. The key word here is summary . If someone wants more detail, the code should be clear enough that they can get it from the code. The point here is to make it easy for someone browsing the code to figure out where some piece of logic is without having to wade through the details of how it's performed. Ideally these cases should be factored out into separate functions instead, but sometimes it's just not do-able because the function would have 15 parameters and/or not be nameable. Pointing out subtleties that are visible from reading the code if you're really paying attention, but don't stand out as much as they should given their importance. When I have a good reason why I need to do something in a hackish way (performance, etc.) and can't write the code more clearly instead of using a comment.
