css: outrageous change in property when put inside this fieldset

My custom drop down menu has a really large change in top and bottom padding. UPDATE Javascript, CSS & HTML included in fiddle [PHP removed] First off, I didn't realise I could share a fiddle ^^ Pretty epic site. I'ma keep debugging, but thought I'd post it here to see if anyone can spot where the problem is :)
