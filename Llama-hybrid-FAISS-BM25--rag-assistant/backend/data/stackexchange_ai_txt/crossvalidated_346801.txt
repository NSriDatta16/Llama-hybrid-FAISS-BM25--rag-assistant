Time Series Data - Scatter Plot Matrix

If I have two time series data, does it makes sense to plot a scatter plot matrix due to an dependent variable time? I'm asking this question because you cannot perform pearson's correlation without using cross correlation with time series data, and I'm wondering if the same applies to scatter plot matrix?
