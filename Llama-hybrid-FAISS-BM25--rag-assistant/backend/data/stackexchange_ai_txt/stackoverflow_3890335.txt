For IE, yes, and they are, as @Joe R notes, included via conditional comments. So at least there's no corruption, or invalidation, of the mark-up to provide specific support, which is a much improved situation than used to exist with the various css hacks. In my case I also, so long as there's no overt restriction to the contrary, include a conditional comment somewhere on the page that pops up a modal dialogue linking to various other free browsers (typically Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera) and suggesting the users might like to up-grade in order to improve their experience. Incidentally, I also don't bother trying to get pixel-perfect IE versions. If a client requests it, then fair enough, but normally explaining the cost-per-hour just to givie curvy-corners is enough of an incentive to allow for rectangular boxes in IE, and curves in FF, Chrome etc. The main reason that IE seems to be such a pain is because, following the installation of IE as a free browser on Windows it peaked at around 90%+ market penetration, Netscape more or less died and, while there were niche browsers around, the majority of the Windows market seemed disinterested in pursuing alternatives. A lack of high market-penetration coupled with low-levels of competition stymied the market, and reduced the incentive to innovate and improve. Only since, I think, Firefox began to attain adoption rates of 15%+ did the IE team, or the IE management team, pay attention, and pursue improvement. And even then, it seems to have taken 'til the IE9 development process to drive the adoption of standards.
