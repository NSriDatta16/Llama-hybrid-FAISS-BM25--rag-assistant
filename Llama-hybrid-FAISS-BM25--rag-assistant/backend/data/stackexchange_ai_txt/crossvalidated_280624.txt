I think you're confusing the the variables with each variable's levels (the values each variable it can take). Raw data with categorical variables is usually pretty concise, but usually when you transform this into data you can run a regression on, the data gets a lot "wider." Say your country variable has 16 levels. For your country variable alone, you would add 15 regressors/predictors to your logistic regression. You would pick one country to be "baseline," or in other words to not have a predictor/column in the data matrix. And then you would add 15 predictors. For each observation/row in your data matrix, you would have a $1$ in the column that corresponds to the country that observation is from. Say you want to include type of institution information into your model as well. Without loss of generality say this variable has 10 levels. Then you would add 9 more predictors. And so on and so forth. Your diagram there is better for demonstrating how to include one variable. In your case you're going to have a lot of predictors, which might be a bad thing for a few reasons. You might consider shrinking the levels of each variable (maybe make country intro continent) or combining variables (united states farming, French telecommunications, etc.) Also, it should be mentioned that a) there are many ways to code your categorical data, and b) sometimes the software takes care of this task of making a new data matrix for you.
