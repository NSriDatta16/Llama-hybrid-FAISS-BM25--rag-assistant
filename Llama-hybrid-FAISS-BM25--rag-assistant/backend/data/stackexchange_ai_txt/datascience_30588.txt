Random forests could be thought of as using a kind of dropout-esque technique as each split node only considers a random subset of the features, effectively 'dropping out' the other ones. Also, sometimes in large tree ensembles, each tree is only given a random subset of features to begin with, akin to dropout on the input layer of a neural network.
