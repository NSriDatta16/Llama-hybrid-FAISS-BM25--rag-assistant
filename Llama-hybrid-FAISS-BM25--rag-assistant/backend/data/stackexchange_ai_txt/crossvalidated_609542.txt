You are looking for a probabilistic classifier . You can feed in your predictor data for the two groups (so the predictors will presumably only differ in the group membership) and get the success probability for each group, conditional on the other predictors. Many classifiers can be taught to give probabilistic results, but unfortunately, many are implemented to yield "hard" 0-1 classifications, even though probabilistic classifications are much more useful . This earlier thread specifically discusses Random Forests as probabilistic classifiers: How to make the randomforest trees vote decimals but not binary
