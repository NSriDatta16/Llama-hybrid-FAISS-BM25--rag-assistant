Can I specify multiple possible sources for a ccnet statistic?

I have some builds that use NCover for test coverage analysis, and some that use DotCover. I merge the NCover/DotCover summary report into the ccnet log, but the item that I need to pull out into the ccnet "Coverage" statistic is different depending on the tool (because the format of the reports are different). For NCover, I use the following: For DotCover, I need this: Is there any way to specify both? If I just list both sections inside the statisticList, the second one always wins (so if I list DotCover second, builds that use NCover have their coverage stat set to zero, because the DotCover stat can't be found). What I want is for the stat to get set to the NCover stat if it exists, or to the DotCover stat if it exists. Thanks for the help!
