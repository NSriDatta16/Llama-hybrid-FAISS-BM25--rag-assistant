It can't be done. You have to either embed the credentials into the application (hard coded or whatever) or prompt the user to enter them. Locking the web services to a single application is also ineffective since it can be easily discovered and bypassed, just like embedding the credentials. Since you cant control the clients or the environment(restrict access by IP, domain, etc.), IMHO you're pretty screwed :(
