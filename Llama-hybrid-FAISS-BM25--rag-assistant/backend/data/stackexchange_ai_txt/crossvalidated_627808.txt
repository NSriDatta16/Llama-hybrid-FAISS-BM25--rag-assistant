Frank Harrell devotes a good deal of attention to formulating composite independent variables in Regression Modeling Strategies . In Section 4.7, that's discussed in the context of "data reduction": you have more predictors than you can incorporate into your model without overfitting, so you try to summarize combinations of predictors so that you have fewer "independent" variables in your model. Several of the Case Studies in that online book show the application of those principles to clinical studies. Sometimes simplicity for clinical application is considered in deciding how to proceed. What would make the most sense for your particular application would depend on knowledge of your specific subject matter, which I don't have. The recent reference provided by James Stanley in a comment on your question seems to be a good place to learn about best practices for comorbidity scores. If you have a single model including medications, comorbidities, and an interaction between them, then there isn't a big problem with multiple testing. You will have a "significance" estimate for the whole model, and the interaction coefficient will indicate how much the association of medications with outcome depends on comorbidities (and vice-versa). Sometimes people build separate models for separate predictors, an inefficient use of data that almost always leads to problems with things like omitted-variable bias . Follow instead Harrell's advice in the Preface to build a single comprehensive model: A good overall strategy is to decide how many degrees of freedom (i.e., number of regression parameters) can be "spent", where they should be spent, to spend them with no regrets. Chapter 4 explains in detail.
