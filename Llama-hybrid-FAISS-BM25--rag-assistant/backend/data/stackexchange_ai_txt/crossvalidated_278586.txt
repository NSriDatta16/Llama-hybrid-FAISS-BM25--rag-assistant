Sometimes you can interpret CI coverage in terms of significance testing, and sometimes you cannot depending on the specific test and null hypothesis. There's a literature on the issues that arise which is sometimes termed 'visual hypothesis testing', a brief bibliography of which is presented here (I might start with the article by Geoff Cumming): Afshartous, D. and Preston, R. (2010). Confidence intervals for dependent data: Equating non-overlap with statistical significance . Computational Statistics & Data Analysis , 54(10):2296–2305. Browne, R. H. (1979). On visual assessment of the significance of a mean difference . Biometrics , 35(3):657–665. Cumming, G. (2009). Inference by eye: reading the overlap of independent confidence intervals . Statistics In Medicine , 28(2):205–220. Goldstein, H. and Healy, M. J. R. (1995). The graphical presentation of a collection of means . Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
