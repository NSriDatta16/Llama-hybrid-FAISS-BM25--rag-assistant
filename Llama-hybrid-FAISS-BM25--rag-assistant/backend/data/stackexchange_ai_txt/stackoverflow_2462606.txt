Adding methods to an Objective C class interface is optional?

Coming from a C++ background, one thing that confuses me about Objective C is the fact that you can add a method to a class without actually specifying it in the class interface. So I had a barrage of questions: Why would someone choose to not add the method in the class interface? Is it simply because of visibility? Methods without a declaration in the interface are private? Is declaring methods in a class interface just optional? Is it different for overriding a base class' method?
