chaining bools in C#

int a, b, c, d, e; a = b = c = d = e = 1; if ((a==b) && (b==c) && (c==d) && (d==e)) { Console.WriteLine("that syntax is horrible"); } is there a more elegant way to test multiple equality as above? maybe an AreEqual(params obj[]) or something? I had a google but didn't find anything.
