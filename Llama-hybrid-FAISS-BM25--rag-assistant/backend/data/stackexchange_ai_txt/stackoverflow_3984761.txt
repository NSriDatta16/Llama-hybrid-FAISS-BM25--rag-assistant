If I have to purely choose between .NET and PHP, .NET wins on all accounts. I cannot think of any reason why PHP would be better, except that it's more cross-platform and doesn't require Windows Server to be deployed. In your case there might be other reasons though. Added: Sorry, I was in a hurry. Let me clarify why I think .NET is superior to PHP: it's got a far better performance - it's a compiled language with JIT that produces machine code which uses all the abilities of the current CPU; superior IDE - Visual Studio is by far the best IDE I've ever seen. And I've looked. For PHP the next best thing is NetBeans, but that doesn't come close either. For instance, Visual Studio (in .NET projects) is the only IDE in which I've seen code completion (aka Intellisense) which works 100% of time. Instantly. the language itself has more benefits than I care to describe - strong types, proper classes ( this can't be null, static methods are always static and vice versa, operators can be overloaded, etc.), delegates and events, etc; the standard library is well organized PHP's long lack of namespaces and bad choices in early versions (just see the string functions) are infamous even in the most devoted PHP developer circles; the documentation is spot on - Here actually PHP isn't so bad, as it's documentation is mostly quite adequate, but MSDN with its tight Visual Studio integration and wealth of knowledge still wins This one's subjective, but no matter how much I've tried to write good, clean PHP code, it's always been a struggle. In PHP it's easy to throw together a quick little app, but when you want to write something bigger, with frameworks and many pages, shared business layers, etc - it's difficult. Pretty quickly it gets messy. In .NET it's somehow much easier, as if the language itself would be encouraging best practices. Added 2: Diclosure - I'm primarily a .NET developer, but regularly write PHP code as well, so I'm fluent in both languages and their libraries. Added 3: Note, that this is a pure comparison of both environments. The existing PHP experience (and .NET inexperience), as already said, is a very strong factor as well, probably even stronger then all of the above combined.
