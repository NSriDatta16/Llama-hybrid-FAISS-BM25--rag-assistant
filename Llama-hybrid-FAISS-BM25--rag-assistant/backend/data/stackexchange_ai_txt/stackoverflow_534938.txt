Screencasts help me more than anything. Seeing someone actually do something is many times more instructive than reading. Watch the screencasts on http://asp.net/mvc . Scott Hanselman's preview 3 videos are still relevant, as there haven't been many huge, sweeping changes since then. They show you how to drag data around, use LINQ, and other .NET specific things. After watching and coding along with those, check out the others.
