What time series model should be used?

Given the following daily time series data I have used auto.arima in R to build a model. I used freq = 5 because the data is collected only on weekdays (Monday through Friday). tsdata return, Series: tsdata ARIMA(3,1,2)(0,0,1)[5] with drift Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 ma1 ma2 sma1 drift 1.6825 -0.6384 -0.0993 0.0151 -0.9778 -0.0063 -0.0232 s.e. 0.0494 0.0904 0.0487 0.0125 0.0123 0.0483 0.2080 sigma^2 estimated as 33.92: log likelihood=-1393.24 AIC=2806.1 AICc=2806.44 BIC=2838.78 I obtained the following forecast result: Why does Arima only give me back a straight line ? Is the ARIMA model is the correct one to use here ? How do I retain the feature of the forecast data ? I am very new to build time series model. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
