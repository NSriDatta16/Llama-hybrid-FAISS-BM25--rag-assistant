You might want to be cautious not to remove a whole lot of text just because there are more than one closing s. Below regex would be more accurate in my opinion: r' [^ ' This would prevent the 'greedy' matching. BTW: There is a great tool called The Regex Coach to analyze and test your regexes. You can find it at: http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/ edit: forgot to add code tag in the first paragraph.
