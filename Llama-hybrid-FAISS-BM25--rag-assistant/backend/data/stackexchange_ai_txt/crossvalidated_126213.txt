using a dummy to indicate zero values of a overdispersed continuous predictor variable

I have a predictor variable that has many zeros. The predictor variable is simply a count of the occurrences of some behavior. The zeros are qualitatively meaningful. I'd like to use a log transformation of the variable but am unsure what to do with the zeros - again - because they are qualitatively meaningful. I'd rather not simply add 1 to the variable before logging it. I've seen others allude to some example from Hosmer and Lemeshow where they use a dummy variable to indicate if a person smokes or not and a continuous variable accounting for the number of cigarettes smoked. I'm not sure exactly how this coding would work. Does the dummy need to be coded as 1 to indicate zero values of the other continuous variable or should 1 indicate positive values? I'd also like to log transform the continuous variable because I've got serious over dispersion. I'm guessing I'd log transform the positive values and just keep the zeros as zeros but some of those zeros are going to be 'true' zeros and others are going to be zeros only because they were '1' on the original scale. I looked through the applied logistic regression text and I'm not seeing the example that others have alluded to. Thanks for your input.
