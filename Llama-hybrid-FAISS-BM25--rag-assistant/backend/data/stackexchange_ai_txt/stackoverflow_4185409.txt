jquery ui - cant seem to drag my draggables onto an empty sortable li

I have a list which I call #gallery in which I've defined a couple of li boxes. e.g. A and a box to drop them into ... With the following js $('#conditions-box > ul').sortable(); $("#gallery > li").draggable({ connectToSortable: '#conditions-box > ul', helper: 'clone' }); When my conditions box list is empty as you see now I can drag the boxes in but they dont "stick" only when I place an existing li into the conditions box code does it actually work. However I dont want to have to do this. If you want a play you can see below. Any ideas ? ref - http://jsfiddle.net/wmitchell/zCDE7/2/
