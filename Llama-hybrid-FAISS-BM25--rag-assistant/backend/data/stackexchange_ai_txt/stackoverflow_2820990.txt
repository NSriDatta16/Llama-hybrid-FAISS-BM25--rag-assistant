dragging object from html page using (using javascript) into a flash container?

I am doing some pre-production on a project that requires drawing on a 3d canvas, which I think flash is the best way to go. But there is a chance down the line that this client might want the site to show up on the ipad, iphone or other mobile devices that don't support flash. So I was playing with the idea of doing everything in html and javascript except for the actual drawing/3D area. Almost like using flash as the element. I think html5 is too premature to start using this, but might be beneficial down the line. Chances are I will just go the entire flash route, but I thought it would be interesting to try. Anyway, my question is pretty top level. 1) how hard would it be to drag an object from an html page using javascript, and dropping it into the flashplayer. And then manipulating it from there. Are there any examples out there that have tried to do this?
