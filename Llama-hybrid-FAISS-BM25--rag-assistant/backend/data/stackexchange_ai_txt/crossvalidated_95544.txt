How to statistically analyse the survey data of the same sample taken at two points in time

I am conducting a study on a sample of 100 people in order to test whether or not education has an effect on employment status. Basically i'm running a logistic regression where education is the independent categorical variable (i.e 1= HighSchool, 2=Bachelors, 3=Masters etc...) and the dependent variable being binary response (1= employed, 0=unemployed). I also conduct this survey again 4 years later with the exact same group of people. Hence the variable that has changed is age (meaning people in my sample are 4 years older). How can I analyse this type of study? what are some of the tests I can conduct? Please be as detailed as possible, i do not have a strong statistics background and I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide :) Thanks.
