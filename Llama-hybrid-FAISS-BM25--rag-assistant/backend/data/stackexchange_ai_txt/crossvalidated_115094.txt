One way to measure the goodness of fit of both lines is using the Mean Squared Error ( MSE ) and Root Mean Squared Error ( RMSE ): $$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \centerdot \sum \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i \right)^2$$ $$RMSE = \sqrt{MSE}$$ RMSE indicates the average error and equals $0$ in the best case. Furthermore, it is suitable to compare the precision of the red and the blue line by comparing their RMSE values.
