Gonna make my comment into a proper answer. From what i see the image storage is probably trivial compared to the site traffic and application load. So you use the cloud sites from Rack Space for your PHP application and pay for extra CPU usage according to traffic, application load. If you need specialized solution for storage you can use Cloud Files as an addon and the integration should be pretty straight forward.
