Temporal train-validation-test split is generally for time series problems or in cases where an external stimulus/intervention has led to a change in user behavior or some regime change in the dynamics of the system/the experiment. When you are certain the data points are not idependent and identically distrbuted,you cannot randomly shuffle them. I am assuming based on reading the list of features in your question that neither of the above are true - you do not have a time component nor is there a reason to believe that some intervention has taken place. In this case a random split is reasonable.
