Bayesian network inference using logistic regression and mcmc

I have a small Bayesian network and I am trying to understand the results after applying some observed value / evidence. I have a net like below where $Y \in \{0,1\}$, $P(X) \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$, and $logit(p) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X$ . (Y nodes are related to X nodes by logistic regression). If I add evidence that $Y = 1$ , then I expected that $p$ would also equal one; as $p$ is the probability that $Y_{2} = 1$, and as $Y = 1$ then I expected $p$ to equal one. Why is it not please? I have added some code below to illustrate. library(rjags) mod Which gives # Mean SD Naive SE Time-series SE # y 1.0000 0.0000 0.000000 0.000000 # p 0.4185 0.1106 0.001106 0.001338 # x 0.6527 0.4784 0.004784 0.005815
