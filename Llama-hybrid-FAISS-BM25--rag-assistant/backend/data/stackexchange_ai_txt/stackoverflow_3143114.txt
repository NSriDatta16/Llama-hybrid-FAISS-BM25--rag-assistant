I am thinking of implementing something similar in my game that I am working on. I'm going to create a custom class that can be accessed like a 2D array ex. map[x][y] but the underlying datatype would be closer to a hashtable. Something like data[x.Value.ToString() + "," + y.Value.ToString()] My game is fairly basic as my tiles will only ever be walkable, deadly, or unwalkable. I'm interested in a more elegant solution though :D
