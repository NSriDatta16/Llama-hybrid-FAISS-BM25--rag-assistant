Variance of the data explained by a single variable

I’m trying to find a way to measure how much a single variable ‘summarizes’ a full set of continuous variables. For instance, in a PCA the first principal component will explain a certain percentage of the total variability in a multivariate set. So, how can I obtain a similar measurement for a pre-existing (untransformed) variable? For instance, how much does altitude (single variable) explains overall climatic variability (i.e. multiple variables: mean precipitation; mean temperature…)? I am particularly interested in a measurement that is directly comparable to the variance explained by a PCA.
