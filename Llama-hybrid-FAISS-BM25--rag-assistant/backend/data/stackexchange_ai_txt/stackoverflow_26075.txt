Resize Infragistics GanttChart task with the mouse

I loaded a custom DataTable into an UltraChart of type GanttChart . The data loads successfully. Do you know if it possible to add support for mouse resize(drag) to the tasks that show up into the chart? I have not been able to figure out if this is supported by the Infragistics control. ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
