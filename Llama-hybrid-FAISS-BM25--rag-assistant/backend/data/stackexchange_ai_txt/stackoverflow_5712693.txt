I have some experience working with Yandex (No. 1 Russian search engine) OAuth servers. This is how they do it.. OAurh server accessed only by HTTPS. Thus, token is transferred by the network in encrypted manner. As it is HTTPS - client can check servers validity via certificates checking. Also, they recommend to store received access token in encrypted way. As for me, i have my own storage implementation, which stores access token in 3DES-encrypted way in SharedPreferences. Key to 3DES encryption is a users selected "PIN-code". Each time application starts it is requesting a PIN and then trying to decrypt token. You can look at my library implementing access to one of the Yandex serices (using OAuth to grant access).
