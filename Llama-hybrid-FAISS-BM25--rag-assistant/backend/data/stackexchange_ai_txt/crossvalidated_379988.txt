The beauty of teaching is that you can use a variety of teaching methods throughout the same course. If you just pick one method and stick with it for the rest of the course, it becomes predictable and loses its effectiveness. Different students learn the same concept/skill in different ways, which is why it is crucial to switch between methods when teaching. For example, I am a visual learner and need to see concepts explained with the help of pictures, drawings or diagrams. It is extremely difficult for me to understand a concept which is explained verbally, without the help of any visual aids. My brain eventually tunes the verbal explanation out and starts thinking about something else. So what I would recommend first and foremost is that you spend your first class getting to know your students: what are they like? how much do they already know? what type of learners are they? how much guidance do they need to learn? etc. Of course, by the time your first class arrives, the teaching framework will already be in place. But even so, you can have some flexibility around that framework to make sure the course is responsive to the actual needs and strengths of the students. When I used to teach as a sessional lecturer at the university level, I designed my graduate-level course around the skills I wanted the students to acquire by the end of the course. For example, I wanted them to be able to conduct a data analysis (e.g., multiple linear regression), write a detailed report presenting the results of that analysis and prepare and offer a presentation which highlighted the main findings of the report. To this end, I would use different techniques to help my students build these skills. In one class, I would have them brainstorm together on the main components of a written report. In another class, I would have them go through a guided multiple linear regression exercise on their laptops. There would also be a class where they would present statistical findings as part of a team in front of the class and the remaining teams would provide feedback and offer suggestions for one thing they could improve on in future presentations, be it slide content or personal presentation style. This framework, driven by skills rather than concepts, was flexible enough to provide students with the opportunity to do something different in each class. Their constant participation in their own learning was key and that participation could take a series of forms. Of course, there were lectures too, but there was also room for the students to get engaged in class. The framework is something I developed at the time based on my own experience with university-level courses I had taken as a graduate student. After graduation, I found many of these courses to be unhelpful - they didn't really prepare me for the real world. So, in designing my courses, I wanted my students to acquire practical skills they could put to good use in their professional lives. It is often easier to acquire the skills first and understand the concepts later - many of us who do applied statistical work find themselves in this situation. If your course involves a big self-study component, it will still be important to provide students with deeper guidance beyond "read article x and read pages 10-90 from book y". Perhaps have them ask a few salient questions based on that reading before they come to class, or give them a heads up on the concepts they should pay attention to, why they are important, how and when they tend to be used in practice, etc. Also, for the same concept, assign readings which come at the concept from different vantage points, or assign both a text and a video explanation, etc. Or ask them to keep track of what aspects of the concept they found easy and what aspects they found challenging, so that you can focus in class primarily on the challenging aspects. Not everybody is a self-learner - the reading tasks will cater most to self-learners. To this end, you could assign concepts that are easier to comprehend for self-study but cover the more nuanced concepts in class. Using a variety of approaches is your best bet of leveraging what the students already know and what their strengths are with what your overall goals for this course are. At the end of the course, the students should be able to solve real-world problems applying the concepts and skills they have learned in class (at least in my view). Everything else will flow from this!
