The default behaviour of threads in the same process is to share global storage. If you don't want shared storage, then the environment provides thread local storage . If you do access shared storage, then you probably need to synchronize access to the storage, either using locks, atomic operations or memory fences. If you forget to do that in any part of the code, it may fail in unpredictable ways.
