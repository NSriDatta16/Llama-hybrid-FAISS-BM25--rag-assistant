The AIC should be calculated from residuals using models that control for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual model's autoregressive effect and thus miscalculates the model parameters which leads directly to an incorrect error sum of squares and ultimately an incorrect AIC. Most SE responders do not point out this assumption when they promote simple descriptive statistics such as AIC and RMSE. The quick answer is you should use neither unless you are addressing the question of identifying and remedying the effects of unspecified deterministic/exogenous structure See @AdamO's insightful response to this question Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? "The correlogram should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect."
