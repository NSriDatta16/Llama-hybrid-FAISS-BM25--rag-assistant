When is it necessary to remove seasonality from multivariate time series?

I have a complex time series dataset that I'm exploring ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data ) and I've detected some regular hourly seasonality in the data (not unexpected since it's air quality data). In particular, there's seasonality in the variable that I'm looking to predict, which in this case is PM2.5 values. The dataset also has many other covariates that I'd like to feed in as well (temp, wind, CO2/NO2, etc). What I would like to be able to do is to feed forecasted covariates to my model along with historical values for my predicted variable (e.g. PM2.5) to get predictions. Here's an image of a small section of hourly readings of the PM2.5 from one site (300 of 36000 records): I could remove the seasonality from the forecasted variable, but then I'm not sure what to do with the rest of the data in the covariates. Would I attempt to remove seasonality from those covariates as well? In a multivariate time series scenario, couldn't the seasonality be a potentially valuable covariate for the model to learn? Are there ways to establish when the seasonality does need to be removed?
