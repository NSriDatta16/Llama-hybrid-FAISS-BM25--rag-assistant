Correlation in R between categorical and boolean variables

I want to use the data attached to see i there is correlation between a bootcamp that students attended and the job they end up getting. For example, does someone who attended a software engineering bootcamp end up with a software job, or does attending a data science one lead to a job in data? I have tried doing this but I dont think its right. I have attached a screenshot of the data.Please help with correct code data $Bootcamp Bootcamp)) sapply(data,class) data I have already looked online for similar situations but they quite address this problem
