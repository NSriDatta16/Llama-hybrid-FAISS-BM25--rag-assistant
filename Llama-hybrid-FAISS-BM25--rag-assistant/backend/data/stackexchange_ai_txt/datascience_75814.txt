Daily new data for my neural network, and I want transfer(?) learning

I made my neural network, it is pre-trained for 180 days of data. It filters the fraud data of credit cards everyday and 1-days new data is comming in. And I also want after the filtering, I want to re-train my AI-model but I just want to use new 1-day data only(because training neural network is really time-consuming work). My AI model is 0(not fraud)/1(fraud) classification model. I want to change my neural net by 1/181 .... because the amount of data is just a one day How I should train the neural network? If I use just 1 day data and run many epoch(time), It will over-fitted... By early stopping, It seems the one-day data train is not.... sufficient...... I think memory like LSTM may need my neural net... What design of neural net is best for my situation??
