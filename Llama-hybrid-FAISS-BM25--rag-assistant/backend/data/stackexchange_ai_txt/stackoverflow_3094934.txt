Magento: How do I put widgets into a layout xml?

I am using Magento Enterprise Edition. It includes a widget for banners, which I want to use inside of my template, rather than from inside of a CMS-run content block. I succeeded in generating the output from inside of a content block: {{widget type="enterprise_banner/widget_banner" display_mode="fixed" rotate="series" banner_ids="4" template="banner/widget/block.phtml" unique_id="744a56c9a042cc9fa166163c12d869d9"}} Simple enough. So inside of my layout xml, I tried this: Same parameters; I just added name and as. And then, inside of my template... getChildHtml('hero_banners'); ?> But I get no output. The profiler notes that the hero_banners block is loaded, but its template file (banner/widget/block.phtml) is never run. Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong? -P
