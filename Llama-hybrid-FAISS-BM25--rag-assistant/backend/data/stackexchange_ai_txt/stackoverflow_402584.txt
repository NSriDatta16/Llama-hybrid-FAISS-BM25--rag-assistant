I started working on JavaEE without not enough knowledge of basic Java and I totally regret it! JavaEE is not just an additional set of APIs, it encompasses so many concepts from EAI, SOA and DBs. Trying to master those concepts, learn the APIs and still getting to know the foundation - Java, was a real challenge. JavaEE sounds exciting and it is, but if you are someone who wants to produce clean, easy to test and correct code, my advice: start with Java SE.
