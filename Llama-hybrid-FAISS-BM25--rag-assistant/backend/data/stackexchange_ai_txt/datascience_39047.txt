The methods mentioned in other answers work well only for large sentences as they do not preserve sentence structure. The state of the art model for learning compositionality of entire sentence using word vectors is a Recursive Neural Network. This also preserves the order of the word and can hence be used for shorter sentences also. You can see more about them in the original paper or a lecture on the same. For a tensorflow implementation of Recursive Neural Networks look here .
