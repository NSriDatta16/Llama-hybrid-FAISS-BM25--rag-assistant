If you're using nested resources, you'll need a before filter on your PhoneNumberController that sets the parent object, so you can do @parent.phone_numbers.build(...) right? At the same time (before_filter), set the @parent_path ( organization_path , household_path ...) and you'll have that available in your view to link to. If you were adding the phone number to each of these things (organization, household...) using :polymorphic => true instead of has_many :through , you could simply take the @parent that you'll be setting in the PhoneNumbersController before_filter and do polymorphic_path(@parent) instead.
