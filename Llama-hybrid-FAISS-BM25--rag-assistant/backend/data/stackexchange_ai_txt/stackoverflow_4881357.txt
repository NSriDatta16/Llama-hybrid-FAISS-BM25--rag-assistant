One cannot learn desing because it is an art. For this one has to believe in onself and let it happen. There is nothing more important for desing than a positive attitude and of course, in this case, some good Photoshop and Fireworks skills... But essentially it is an ability to visualise that matters and this is why so many games on android market just don't look good, for rare are people who are good programmers and graphics artists at the same time... yet everything can be achieved given proper attention. Basically, my answer is: if you want to do it yourself, then you must forget that you are a programmer and believe that you are an artist, desinger and producer. Only then, from that new perspective, you can create what is needed for your product.
