Is there any way to use (update) a pre-trained logistic regression model for data with new set of columns?

I am building an insurance recommendation engine. I have used some variables, like demographics, and built the model. Now I have claims data. Is there a way to include the new data without restarting the process like this? model1 = initial variables model2 = new variables model3 = x*initial variables+y*new variables
