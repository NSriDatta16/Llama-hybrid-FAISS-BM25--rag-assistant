The fragment part of the URL is used to enable navigation history (back and forward buttons) on AJAX-enabled websites. If you want to "trap" clicks on links, since you're using jQuery anyway, you could just do that: $('a').click(function() { var item = $(this); var url = item.attr('href'); // your logic here }); If you use fragments (window.location.hash) in constellation with AJAX, note that IE6 submits the fragment part of the url in AJAX requests which can lead to very hard-to-debug bugs, so be aware of that.
