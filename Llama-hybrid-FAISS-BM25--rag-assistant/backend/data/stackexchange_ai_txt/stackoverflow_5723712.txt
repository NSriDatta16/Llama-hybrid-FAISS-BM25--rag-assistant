Simplest way to strip an int out of a URL in Java?

I have a String containing a URL. I want to get just one piece of data out of it: an int that should be showing up in the query string. So if the url is: http://domain.tld/page.html?iVar=123 I want to get "123" into an int. What's the most elegant way you know to do this?
