Unfortunately the figure provided in the answer by @SmallChess still has 3 support vectors. The answer is correct - the minimum number of support vectors is 2. The best way to understand this issue is the convex hull model of SVM (for instance http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cvrg/bennett00duality.pdf ). The minimum case will have two convex hulls where the minimum distance between them is the distance between two vertices of the hull
