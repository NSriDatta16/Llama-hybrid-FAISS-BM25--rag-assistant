Emacs on Windows + SSH: subshell spurios characters?

I'm trying to connect via SSH to a remote shell, using Emacs on Windows XP. I'm currently using Putty, but I'd like to switch to Emacs. I can't find a way which works right. The best I've achieved is running Plink (command line version of Putty) as a subshell, but I'm still getting spurious characters and duplicated prompts like this: Last login: Fri Jun 18 11:09:11 2010 from XXXXX ^]0;root@XXXXX:~^[root@XXXXX ~]# ls ls file-1.cfg file-10.log file-100.pcap ^]0;root@XXXXX:~^[root@XXXXX ~]# ^]0;root@XXXXX:~^[root@XXXXX ~]# I guess those sequences with a "^" prefix are escape characters, but I can't find a way to get them translated, or to get rid of them. I've tried this: (autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on "ansi-color" nil t) (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on) (let ((explicit-shell-file-name "C:/Programmi/Putty/plink") (explicit-plink-args '("root@XXXXX"))) (shell)) Any hint? Have you got a way to run a Secure Shell inside a native Windows version of Emacs? Software: GNU Emacs 23.1.1, plink.exe version 0.60, Windows XP SP3 Thanks.
