Have you looked into the acts_as_audited plugin ? It's very simple to set up, and will record the timestamp, changes and the user id of the person who triggers a record update/save in a related table. Making retrieval of the last user to change state very simple. It can also be configured to only trigger when the state is changed. However it's probably less scalable than your current method of doing things because it will keep a record of every time the state of your model is changed.
