You can attach a debugger to (almost) any process for which you're writing .NET code by embedding a call to Debugger.Break at the appropriate point in your source. Quoting MSDN: If no debugger is attached, users are asked if they want to attach a debugger. If yes, the debugger is started. If a debugger is attached, the debugger is signaled with a user breakpoint event, and the debugger suspends execution of the process just as if a debugger breakpoint had been hit. I've used this to debug all sorts of things, including C# code embedded in SSIS. Updated : Amended wording as this is no longer a theoretical technique, but one I've used.
