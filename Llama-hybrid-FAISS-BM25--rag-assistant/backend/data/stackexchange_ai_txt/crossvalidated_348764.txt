The pre-post design is a very weak design, and the results are easily manipulated because of time trends and lack of blinding. A suitable model would be a mixed effects ordinal model such as the proportional odds ordinal logistic model. Ideally you would do this with a Bayesian hierarchical model because frequentist methods here are not very accurate. If you want a frequentist approach look at the R ordinal package.
