Why is MSE difference between LIBSVM and my codes?

Now I used LIBSVM toolbox to solve a regression problem. However, I found a question that the value of MSE calculated by the toolbox was different with the value of MSE calculated by myself. Did you meet the question? The MSE is calculated by the equation for LIBSVM. What is the meaning of "l" in the equation? In my calculation, "l" is the number of samples.
