Assuming that Person is a class Contains seems to be method of this class. An expression like Where(x => x.Contains(searchText)) or Where(x => string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchText) || x.Contains(searchText)) where x is a Person won't work at all with LINQ to Entities, even with a simple class like ... public class Person { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public bool Contains(string searchText) { return Name.Contains(searchText); } } ... it will throw an exception because LINQ to Entities can't translate this method to a storage expression. Where(x => string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchText) || x.Name.Contains(searchText)) would work though.
