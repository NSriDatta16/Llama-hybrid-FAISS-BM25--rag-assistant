Loading Dialog while rotating device

I have an activity with in which there is a async task that will do some download stuff. AT the time of downlaoding it will show a l oading dialog . My problem is, it worked fine for me when me doing it in only one orentiaon . But when i rotate at the time of download, it shows window leaked and will crash at the dialog.cancel in my post excute. From my study on it more i understood it due the change in the context when device is rotated . That is when a device is rotated the activity will be recreated so the context will be changed . But i have created the dialog with old one and that wasn't the current context . So when i cancel it it shows error What is the solution for this, any idea frnds. Me using honeycomb , me tried but with fragment but didnt get a good sample for that. Me now mainly trying that, if anyone can give me some links for that it will be great
