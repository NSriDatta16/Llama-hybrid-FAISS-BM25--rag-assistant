text.substr(lastfound,text.size()) begins somewhere in the middle of text and continues for the entire size of text . That doesn't make sense, although I suppose it works because of the wonky way these particular functions handle range errors. string::npos would state your intention better than size . Generally speaking, the manipulation members of string are less elegant than the more general algorithms in . I recommend you use those instead, such as std::search , along with string::iterator in place of integer offsets. UPDATE: The same kind of error exists in the second example. Use string::npos for the second argument to substr to get the substring through the end.
