Each session of a game involving repeated rolling of two dice will have its own eccentricities: many more 3's than 11's (theoretically, equally likely), more 4's than 6's (where 6's are expected more often), and so on ad infinitum. There is no point in assessing the the chances of details of individual outcomes; each game outcome has a small chance of occurrence. That's partly what makes games of chance interesting to play. More meaningful probability computations might be to ask for probabilites of particular kinds of occurrences for such games in general. Here are two examples: (1) What is the probability of getting no dice rolls less than 6 in 35 rolls of a pair of fair dice? (2) The theoretical mean score on one roll of two dice is $\mu=7.$ What is the probability my average score in 35 rolls is less then 6. (1) For any one roll of two dice, $P(X The probability all 35 rolls will show less than 4 spots is very small $(5/18)^35 = 9.399613e-21.$ (2) The mean score on any one roll of a pair of fair dice is $\mu = 7$ with a variance of $\sigma^2=5.8333$ and standard deviation of $\sigma=2.4152.$ p = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1)/36; x = 2:12 mu = sum(p*x); mu [1] 7 vr = sum(p*x^2) - mu^2; vr [1] 5.833333 sd = sqrt(vr); sd [1] 2.415229 Then the average score $\bar X$ on 35 rolls is $\mu_{\bar X} = 7$ with standard deviation $\sigma_{\bar X} = \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 2.415229/\sqrt{35} = 0.4082483.$ Furthermore, $\bar X$ is approximately normal with this mean and standard deviation. So the desired probability is $P(\bar X pnorm(6, 7, 0.40825) [1] 0.007153143
