The usual thing to do here would be to include "error bars" around your sample average giving a confidence interval for the true average from the sampled data each year. For binary data you can get a good confidence interval estimator from the Wilson score interval . This estimator will take account of the sample size for each year, and years with a smaller sample size will tend to have a wider interval (subject to some other factors). Your reader will then be able to see that there is more uncertainty in the true average in the earlier years than in the later years.
