Yes. There is a technique called "morphing" which is appropriate for your case. Your CalendarEvents table should have a field called "owner_type" and another field called "owner_id". "owner_type" would indicate the table to which "owner_id" is a foreign key for the particular row. If owner_type is 1, then owner_id is a user_id; if owner_type is 2, then owner_id is an organization_id. And so forth.
