I'm experimenting with cobatura for code coverage and just came across the same issue. It would be nice to have an annotation to add to the class which said don't include this class in code coverage. However it is possible to put your pojo's in a separate package and then exclude that package from the analysis. See the documentation depending on your tool, it works with Ant, Maven or command line.
