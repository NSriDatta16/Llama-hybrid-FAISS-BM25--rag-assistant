Definition of type safety from Wikipedia: In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types. E.G. if you can write a program where you treat a string like a number then you have low (or no) type safety. Now apply this to the context from which you read/heard the 'improved type safety' phrase. In relation to the definition above 'improved' means 'to a greater extent'.
