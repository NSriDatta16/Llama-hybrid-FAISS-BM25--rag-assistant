It depends on your requirements. If IPet is simple enough, I would prefer to implement that. Otherwise, if PetBase implements a ton of functionality you don't want to duplicate, then have at it. The downside to implementing a base class is the requirement to override (or new ) existing methods. This makes them virtual methods which means you have to be careful about how you use the object instance. Lastly, the single inheritance of .NET kills me. A naive example: Say you're making a user control, so you inherit UserControl . But, now you're locked out of also inheriting PetBase . This forces you to reorganize, such as to make a PetBase class member, instead.
