RAD is usually more a function of tools than of language and/or library. So the RAD-ness lays more in Visual Studio and consists of the Designers (GUI's and DataSet/Linq2Sql/L2E etc). To see what RAD means, add a DataSource to your Application and drag&drop a Table on a WinForm. VS will add and configure a Grid and some supporting Components. And on a side-note, RAD isn't always the best approach for making an App.
