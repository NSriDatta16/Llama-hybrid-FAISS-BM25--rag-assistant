It's a legitimate question, and the answers provided are good ones. But if you're using XSLT 1.0, and you can't use extension functions, it's simply not possible. XSLT templates produce result tree fragments, and XSLT can only work on node sets. Tokenizing in XSLT requires recursion, which means calling a template, which means producing a data structure that you can't process. If this limitation applies to you - and really, even if it doesn't - you should, if possible, solve this problem by finding the person who's generating XML whose content has to be parsed again after the DOM has already parsed it and make him or her stop. Putting multiple values in an attribute is just plain wrong.
