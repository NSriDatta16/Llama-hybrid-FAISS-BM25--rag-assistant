When the dropout probability is anticipated to be significant, it is best to design the study so that missing data are more likely to be missing at random. In your case this could be accomplished by having weekly visits. The continuous responses before withdrawal from treatment would be predictive of post-withdrawal values, and a full likelihood "use all available data" approach (i.e., generalized least squares, mixed effects model, or a full Bayesian model) would be very efficient and easy to interpret. It assumes that missings are missing at random given previous responses and baseline covariates, and no imputation is needed. This works a little better if the mean time-response profile is modeled as a smooth function.
