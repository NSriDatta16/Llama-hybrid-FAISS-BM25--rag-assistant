This is a huge field of research. It is referred to as statistical quality control. The literature on this field is massive. The foundation of quality control methods is based on Shewhart charts. Then some benchmark methods have been developed specifically : EWMA charts (Exponentially weighted moving average chart) and CUSUM (cumulative charts ) charts. These two were later extended to handle multivariate data. Despite of this, the $T^2$ hotelling chart remains the main benchmark in multivariate control. Looking at your data, CUSUM is a way to go. Also CUSUM will tell you exactly what time you lost control. I would like to mention that also you can handle this problem using change point detection methods. Such methods are also mostly based on control charts, but have also been tackled through regression approaches.
