Derivation of factors associated with increase in HIV DNA

I would just like to verify a statement made in the following paper: Peripheral blood HIV-1 DNA dynamics in antiretroviral-treated HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving directly-acting antivirals The authors state: "Factors associated with the increase of total HIV-1 DNA were analysed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression". They then go on to show a table, table 2, indicating the significant factors to this increase. Now my question is, is this as simple as generating a logistic regression model with two dummy variables (i.e. whether or not there was an increase in DNA), and then identifying the significant factors ? Or is there more to it given that they are only interested in the factors affecting the increase of HIV DNA ? Thanks,
