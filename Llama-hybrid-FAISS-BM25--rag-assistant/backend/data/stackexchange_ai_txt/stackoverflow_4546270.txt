I was looking for this feature in eclipse too. I know the visual studio can do that. Actually you can drag the current line marker and drop anywhere back in code. I'm not pretty sure if the changes to variables can be undone. But it is still very useful even so and saves lots of time. I've been waiting for this in eclipse for a very long.
