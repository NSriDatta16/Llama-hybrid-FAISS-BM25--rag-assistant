Is conversion a binary (yes/no) variable? If so, you essentially have a 2-by-2 contingency table (procedure being one of the variables, conversion the other), where you can test independence by for example $\chi^2$-test or Fisher exact test . Of course correlation does not imply causation , and in this example it might especially be worth considering whether the patient groups truly differed only in the fact that they recieved different treatments. (And not in their age-, sex-, disease severity etc. composition.) If you have information on such possible confounding variables , you might consider employing logistic regression .
