I had the same issue and found that System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop ignored my Form's implementation of COM's IAsyncOperation, instead using the WinForm's DataObject implementation of IDataObject internally. Unfortunately WinForm's DataObject class does not implement IAsyncOperation. So I used this project 's VirtualFileDataObject implementation of IAsyncOperation, IDataObject, calling VirtualFileDataObject.DoDragDrop instead of Control.DoDragDrop. I set a VirtualFileDataObject.FileDescriptor.StreamContents to a delegate where I Invoke onto the UI thread to report progress while downloading the file.
