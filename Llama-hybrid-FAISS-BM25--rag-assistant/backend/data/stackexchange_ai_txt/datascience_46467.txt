One option is to treat it as a "supervised learning" problem. Since a set of n data, measured every x ms You have a time series. This can be treated as a supervised problem. Say that you have observations for 10 minutes. In supervised learning, each sample would be : X : Set of last t-1 , t-2, t-3 and t-N observations (N is fixed, say 300) Y : Observation t You can train a model to predict next observation, given last 300 observations. If actual value is beyond a certain % from the prediction, it is an anomaly. Example : https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/
