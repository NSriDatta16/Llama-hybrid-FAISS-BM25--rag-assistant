CLT and Biased Estimators

A biased estimator is one for which the difference of the expected value of the estimator and the true value of a population parameter does not equal zero. If we gather a bunch of samples' averages (countably many) and take the average of that collection of samples, the mean should equal the true value of the parameter if those sample averages were unbiased. On the other hand, I've seen some resources state that the mean of a sampling distribution (i.e. a set of sample means) should equal the population parameter, regardless of the estimator used to calculate the sample means. I can't reconcile these two statements. Can y'all?
