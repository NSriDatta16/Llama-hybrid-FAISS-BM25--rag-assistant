You could put a constraint on T to only allow struct . You could use a language extension that allows you to make stronger definitions of pre/post conditions for your function (contract based programming), like SpecSharp , or Code Contracts . Code Contracts seems to leverage built-in systems from C# 4.0. I have no experience with either - only heard of them.
