Compacting an Access database (also known as a MS JET database) is a bit like defragmenting a hard drive. Access (or, more accurately, the MS JET database engine) isn't very good with re-using space - so when a record is updated, inserted, or deleted, the space is not always reclaimed - instead, new space is added to the end of the database file and used instead. A general rule of thumb is that if your [Access] database will be written to (updated, changed, or added to), you should allow for compacting - otherwise it will grow in size (much more than just the data you've added, too). So, to answer your question(s): Yes, it does matter (unless your database is read-only). You should care (unless you don't care about your user's disk space). If you don't compact an Access database, over time it will grow much, much, much larger than the data inside it would suggest, slowing down performance and increasing the possibilities of errors and corruption. (As a file-based database, Access database files are notorious for corruption, especially when accessed over a network.) This article on How to Compact Microsoft Access Database Through ADO will give you a good starting point if you decide to add this functionality to your app.
