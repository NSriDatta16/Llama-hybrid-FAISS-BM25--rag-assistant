There are a few things that I see in your code that I would check out if I were in your position. You are trying to call "stop" on a member MediaPlayer object "player" in your onDestroy, but in your onCreate you create a MediaPlayer object "player" with your line of code "MediaPlayer player = MediaPlayer.create(MyService.this, R.raw.oceanwavestest);" which i believe creates a player object that you will loose scope of outside of the function. The 1 line fix for this code is to just use "player = MediaPlayer.create(MyService.this, R.raw.oceanwavestest);", this way the member variable is used rather than a local variable If this were my code I would change the member variable to be called something like m_player or mPlayer so that you know it is a member variable in your code. (probably a typo) "returnnull;" in onBind should be "return null;" you also might want to try calling player.stop(); Toast.makeText(this, "Service Stopped", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); before you call super.onDestroy() Let me know if this helps at all
