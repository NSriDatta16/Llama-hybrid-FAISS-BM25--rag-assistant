what are the next step after ML prediction and how to proceed?

I have trained an ML model with a good accuracy but what next? I am facing difficulty in answering this question, how will you present your model. Which framework do you use How do you make sure the model is learning continuously. Where can I find definite guide for this approach? I am good at building and predicting ML, DL & NLP. But stuck to deploy further.
