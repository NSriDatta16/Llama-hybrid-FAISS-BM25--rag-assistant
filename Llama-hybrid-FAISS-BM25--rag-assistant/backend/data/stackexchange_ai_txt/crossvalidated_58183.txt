Are the posteriors "different"? How does one discuss the result?

First, I realize this may be a basic question. However, when I search the web for references on this issue, I run into the problem of wondering if the description I'm reading is applicable to the example I have in mind. So while I have an idea of what the answers to the questions below may be, I am not yet very confident in my Bayesian thinking. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you. An analysis is carried out in a Bayesian framework and yields a posterior distribution of a parameter bounded between 0 and 1. This parameter is estimated for 1 species at two points in time (two years), but under 2 very different conditions. The two years are analyzed separately. In one year the average of the posterior of the parameter might be around 30%, and in the other around 45%. My initial reaction is to carry out a hypothesis test, and to ask, "are these two estimates "significantly" different?" Given the Bayesian nature of the analysis, is it meaningful to ask this question? Is it reasonable to expect a "yes or no" answer, similar to what would be expected in a frequentist setting? Say that the question is meaningful. How does one go about finding an answer? If I compare the 95% credible intervals, and find out that the CI's of the parameter from the two years overlap, does that mean that there is no difference? A similar approach would be to introduce a new variable in the model, call it YR, and allow YR to reflect the affect of the 2nd year on the estimate of the original parameter. I could look at the estimate of YR, and ask if its 95% credible interval includes 0 or not. The parameter estimates are fairly uncertain --- if a posterior has a distribution with a mean of 30%, its 1st and 3rd quartiles could range between 20% and 40% (and the 45% year would be between 35% and 55%). Say that the parameter estimates have 95% CI's that overlap, or that YR is estimated as 15%, but its CI includes 0. Does this mean that the analysis is suggesting that the two years are "not different", or does one simply state that the years were 15% different, Â± some uncertainty? Thanks.
