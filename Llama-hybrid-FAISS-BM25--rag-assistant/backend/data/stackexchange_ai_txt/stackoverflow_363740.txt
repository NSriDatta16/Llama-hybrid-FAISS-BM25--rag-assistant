Getting PartCover to work

I want to try PartCover for code coverage. I'm running Visual Studio 2008 Professional with MSTest. The Professional Edition does not include the Team Testing tools, like Code Coverage. So, I'm trying PartCover, but I can't get it to work. In the PartCover.Browser I've selected the MSTest executable, I've pointed the working arguments to my tests.dll, and I've tried pointing my Working Directory to the TestResults folder, but I get an error: "Report is empty. Check settings and run target again." I don't know what to try next. Edit It turns out I had two problems. First, I wasn't putting my Rules right. Second, I had spaces in my working arguments. The spaces were giving an error, but not showing up anywhere.
