Robert Harvey's answer tackles the problem but I would also suggest looking at what you are saving and see if there is another approach. Perhaps the null values should be saved in another table? Perhaps the column you have as auto-increment isn't the primary key. This may not be the direction but in this case it's worth stepping back and re-examining.
