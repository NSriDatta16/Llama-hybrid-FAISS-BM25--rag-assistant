You seem to have panel (or longitudinal) data with data (time series) on failures on thousands of systems with $Y$ binary variables representing the failure (or not). There seem to be one observation per year, and a covariable $X$ counting minor incidents, cumulatively. So $X$ maybe can be seen as a measure of stress on the system, which is monotonically increasing. Here I will concentrate on the modeling of one series, then the thousands of parallel series could be seen as independent realizations, with the same distribution if the systems are exchangeable, or else with some parameters representing possible differences between systems, maybe a random effects model with random intercepts / slopes. But I will now concentrate on the model for one system. Starting with logistic regression, the simplest model would be like $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P(Y_j=1 \mid X_j=x_j)= \frac1{1+e^{-\eta(x_j)}} $$ where $\eta(x)= \beta_0 +\beta_1 x$ (or some generalization) is the linear predictor. Since we are conditioning on $X=x$ , autocorrelation in the $x$ 's is not a problem, but there could still be autocorrelation between the $Y_j$ 's. So how could we investigate that? We need a concept of residuals for logistic regression (LR). And as you say, LR do not have an error term, so there is no obvious definition. But see Family of GLM represents the distribution of the response variable or residuals? for some discussion. Residuals can be defined multiple ways, this google search gives many interesting hits. There isn't much on this site, but see Is there i.i.d. assumption on logistic regression? and its links. Also some good ideas here: Diagnostics for logistic regression? .
