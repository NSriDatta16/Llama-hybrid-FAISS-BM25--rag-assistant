I would run your simulation a whole bunch of times and then do a weighted average of the | L- R | value over all the runs. That should get you closer to the expected value. Just submitting one run as an answer is really unlikely to work. Imagine it was dice roll expected value. Roll on dice, score a 6, submit that as expected value.
