I don't think you'll need any form of JavaScript. But without a sample of what you're working with, this is my best guess: #divId { height:auto; width:900px; white-space:normal; overflow:hidden; } #divId img { height:auto!IMPORTANT; width:auto!IMPORTANT; max-width:900px; } (Replace my width values with yours) This will format the text so it displays correctly within the div, but it may come out as one blob of text, but that might be what you want. If you want formatting, you'll have to use jQuery to search the text within the div for line breaks and replace them with ... Just be sure to add opening and closing Paragraph tags.
