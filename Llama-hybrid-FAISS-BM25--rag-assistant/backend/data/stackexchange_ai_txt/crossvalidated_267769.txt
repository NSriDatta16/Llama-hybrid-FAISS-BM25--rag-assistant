Can Y-aware PCA be performed with binary independent variables?

I came across this tutorial for Y-aware PCA using the vtreat R package. In short, Y-aware PCA is PCA on variables that have been scaled to be in y-units. Is it valid to scale categorical independent variables in y-units? All of my independent variables are dichotomous. It seems inconsistent to implement this y-scaling on them and then run PCA, since, typically, a method like multiple correspondence analysis would be used on categorical variables.
