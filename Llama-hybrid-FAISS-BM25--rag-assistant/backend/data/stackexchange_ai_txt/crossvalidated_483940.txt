How to use resampling to reconstruct an obesity cohort?

In a study, the administrative data contains everyone in a population. I am using ICD-10 code E65-E68 (excluding E66.3 which is overweight) to construct the obese cohort. Conversely, the rest of the population who didn't receive these codes will be considered as non-obese. The problem is 1) the code is not completely recorded in the dataset (which leads to low sensitivity (or a lot of false negatives) but high specificity), and 2) while the ones who got the obesity code is highly accurate (high specificity), they tend to be more obese and severe than the average obese population (which cannot be directly observed in the current study). In the literature, they found that the sensitivity using this method ranges between 10% to 50%. I wonder if I can conduct a sensitivity analysis in which I reconstruct the "obesity" cohort from sampling people who are originally labelled into the non-obese cohort. For example, I can sample a certain percentage of the overweight and another percentage from non-obese and non-overweight individuals into the obese cohort to account for the potential high false negative rate. Is there a formalized way to do this? I try to find appropriate literature, but couldn't find anything directly addresses my set-up. Edited to provide more information The study objective is to compare the costs due to utilized clinical services between the obese and non-obese cohorts. The clinical utilization information is recorded in the dataset already. Because of the low sensitivity and the readily-identified obese individuals using this approach are likely more severe and using/costing more with the clinical services, my intent is to reconstruct the obese cohort in sensitivity analysis to reduce the underlying bias (towards overestimation of the higher costs amongst the initially identified obese cohort). For example, some of the overweight individuals should probably have a true obese status, so I'd like to resample some of these overweight individuals into the new "obese" cohort. Same thing goes with the non-overweight/non-obese individuals. All the variables indicative to obese status will be used to identify the obese individuals. For our discussion, we can assume there is no other information in the database that further inform/relate to the obesity status.
