From kappa - Stata "kap (second syntax) and kappa calculate the kappa-statistic measure when there are two or more (nonunique) raters and two outcomes, more than two outcomes when the number of raters is fixed, and more than two outcomes when the number of raters varies. kap (second syntax) and kappa produce the same results; they merely differ in how they expect the data to be organized." So, yes you can. Also, this other answer may help you with interpretation.
