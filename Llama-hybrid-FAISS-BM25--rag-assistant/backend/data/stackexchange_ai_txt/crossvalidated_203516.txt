Power density spectrum formula in R

I am trying to understand the formula that is used when computing the power spectrum for a time series x in R., x I thought that the formula would be f Compute lag-1 autocorrelation ( phi ) and random noise variance ( vare ) for x AR Compute spectrum S However the S that I compute like this is totally different from the one computed using the spec.ar function with order 1. Can someone help me clarifying this point? Thanks
