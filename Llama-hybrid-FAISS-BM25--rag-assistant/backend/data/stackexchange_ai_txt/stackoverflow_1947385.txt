Use a pivot table for this. Add a header row to your data ("data type", "value") Select your data Insert pivot table Drag "data type"-header to the Row Labels area Drag "value"-header to the Values area Make sure it says "Sum of value" and not "Count of value" in the Values area, if not you need to double-click it and change to use sum. You could also use the "Add subtotals" feature for this, but pivot tables are more flexible and powerful.
