The nose application may be useful for you, either directly, or to show how to implement this. http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/ seems to be the home page. Basically, what you want to do is walk the source tree ( os.walk ), use imp.load_module to load the module, use unittest.defaultTestLoader to load the tests from the module into a TestSuite , and then use that in whatever way you need to use it. Or at least that's approximately what I do in my custom TestRunner implementation ( bzr get http://code.liw.fi/coverage-test-runner/bzr/trunk ).
