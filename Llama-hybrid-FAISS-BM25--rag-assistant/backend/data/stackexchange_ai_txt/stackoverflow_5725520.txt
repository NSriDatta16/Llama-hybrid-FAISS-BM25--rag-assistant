Put the annotation on the getter method, set the @Acesss to AccessType.Property and trim the field there using String.trim() method. Or simply put the trim in the getter method and always access the field through it. It is not going to get any simpler than that. If you do not mind using pure Hibernate and deviating from the JPA standard you can use Hibernate @ColumnTransformer provided that you have a database function to do the work of You can find how to do it in the Hibernate reference: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/reference/en-US/html/mapping.html#mapping-column-read-and-write I hope that helps!
