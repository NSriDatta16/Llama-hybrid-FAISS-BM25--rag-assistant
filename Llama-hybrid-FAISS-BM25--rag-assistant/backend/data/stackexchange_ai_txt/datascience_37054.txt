Logistic Regression or regression SVM for probability of outcome

I am working on a prediction question: what's the percentage of Y = 1 using a number of features? The output Y values I have for training are in binary. In this case, should the prediction be treated as classification or regression? Would logistic regression that returns the probability be suited or the probability of SVM, e.g., this ?
