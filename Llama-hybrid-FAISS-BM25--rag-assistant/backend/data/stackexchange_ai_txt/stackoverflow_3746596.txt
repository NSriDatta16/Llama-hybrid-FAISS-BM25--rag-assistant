yes its possible. you have to split the number in your html code, so that it is not recognised as a whole. seperate it by an zero width span or an transparent image or something. it could even be enough if you wrap the routing code and the number in seperat span tags. or better floating left div tags... i have no skype installed so you have to try it out, but thats the way to go. update: you could as well see what html code is generaged and remove it with a javascript code but thats deadly inefficient and unnecessary SOLUTION: it seems to be enough to use the soft hyphen character &shy; heres an article on that: http://www.ambrosite.com/blog/hide-phone-numbers-from-skype-using-the-html-soft-hyphen
