I believe you will find several other good candidates for moderator, so please choose them. I'm not as active here as I would need to be to moderate, and I'm not particularly interested in moderating, but I will make myself available for the position if you don't see any other good options. In other words I'd visit daily or twice daily and check out the moderator flags and other notifications needing attention. You can check me out on meta if you would like to see what kind of a moderator I would likely be, but in general prefer to moderate only in those cases where the normal community moderation is failing. I live in the eastern time zone of the US, which is quite popular amongst the existing moderators, so it might be wise to choose someone in a far different time zone. Those of you who feel compelled to put a face to each name may review my self-portrait . Those interested in a better image and a more ludicrous grin will please submit an iPhone 4 to me ASAP. Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I never downvote, which is the reason for my username on Meta.
