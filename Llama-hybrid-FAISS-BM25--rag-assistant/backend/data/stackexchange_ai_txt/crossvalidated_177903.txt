Ordinal logistic regression and its interpretation

I fitted an ordinal logistic regression but I'm unable to interpret the coefficients. Can anyone assist in this regard? Here is the output generated: Call: polr(formula = factor(grade) ~ factor(Month) + Day, data = myData, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value factor(Month)4 1.405114 0.51547 2.7259 Day 0.007672 0.01944 0.3947 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value 1|2 -0.6785 0.7019 -0.9667 2|3 1.6767 0.7162 2.3412 Residual Deviance: 333.602 AIC: 341.602 The grade is factored: 1 = good 2 = very good 3 = excellent Month is factored: 3 = March 4 = April The grade is the response while month and day are my explanatory variables.
