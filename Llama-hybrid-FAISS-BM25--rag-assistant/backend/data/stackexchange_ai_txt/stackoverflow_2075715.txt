I had a similar problem with Jesse Liberty's tutorial. Like you said, it works if you run it without debugging. If you had the same problem I had then you can try my solution. The problem was that a validation check against a field with an invalid input throws a ValidationException that the debugger picks up. It shouldn't do this since it is the validation framework that should handle this exception automatically and show the result on screen. To get around this, you have to add an exception to visual studio to get it to ignore the exception. To do this, in top menu bar, select 'Debug' and then select 'Exceptions...'. In the window that appears click the 'Add...' button. Select 'Common Language Runtime Exceptions' from the 'Type' combo box and enter 'System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException' in the 'Name' field and click OK. The tutorial should work now. Hopefully it should be enough to follow on from there like I did
