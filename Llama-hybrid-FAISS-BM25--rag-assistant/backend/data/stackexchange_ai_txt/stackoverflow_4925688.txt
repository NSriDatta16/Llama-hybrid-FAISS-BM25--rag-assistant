The size in bytes of a text snippet depends on the encoding which can be arbitrary (overridden by the user agent). Measuring regular text in bytes makes sense only if the encoding is known. For example, ASCII text is 1 byte per char. Unicode UTF-16LE has 2 bytes. UTF-8 is a whole different story, things can span from 1 byte to 4 bytes.
