MATLAB - Missing fundamental from an FFT

I am currently working on my fourth year project (computer science) which involves the automatic transcription of music -> sheet music. I am doing it in Matlab at the moment but will have to be converted to java at some stage. My problem: I have my program returning the correct notes for pure sine tones, I have now encountered a problem when it comes to the retrieval of the fundamental frequency from a note played by a natural instrument. With certain notes, the peak representing the fundamental of the note seems to be missing entirely. For example when I play a G3 note from garageband, it is shown as a G4, as only the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th harmonics are appearing in my plot. I tried to add the image but as this is my first post it wouldn't allow me. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.
