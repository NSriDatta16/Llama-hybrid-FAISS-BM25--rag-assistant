Bayesian Multiple Regression with Interaction

I want to perform a Bayesian analysis (multivariate regression with an interaction term) using this model: DEP ~ beta0 + beta1 X1 + beta2 X2 + beta3 (X1 X2)** DEP = Dependent variable (continuous) X1 = continuous independent variable X2 = categorical independent variable (levels: -1 and 1) X1*X2 = interaction term, which is meant to examine the different effects of X1 between the two groups (X2, levels: -1 and 1) After reading a book about bayesian modelling, I was able to create some results. However, I still get divergent results from my frequentist analyses. I've been using this model for MCMC in JAGS: # THE MODEL. modelString = " # Standardize the data: data { ym From my frequentist approach, the estimate of the interaction term is -.12. The posterior distribution for the interaction term, however, has a mode of .17 (see picture). Could someone please help me in figuring out why this discrepancy exists? I would be highly thankful for any help or suggestions!
