The android documentation should show which methods have been deprecated and what to replace their use with. For example, Context.clearWallpaper() . SQLLite Database documentation If you look at the documentation, in the upper right hand side of each method name it states the API level that the method was introduced in. eg. openOrCreateDatabase (String path, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory) is since API level 1 . If you want help with specific methods then you will need to either give us the link to the tutorial or (more preferably) post some code. EDIT At the very top of the tutorial you linked to it says: :warning: Compatible for SDK version m3-xxx or older It's now out of date. You should check the data storage page, then review the examples in the post by @TheCottonSilk
