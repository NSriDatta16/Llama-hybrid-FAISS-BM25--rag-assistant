Please read this: http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryFile "Return a file-like object that can be used as a temporary storage area. The file is created using mkstemp(). It will be destroyed as soon as it is closed (including an implicit close when the object is garbage collected)." It's all handled for you. Do nothing and it already works.
