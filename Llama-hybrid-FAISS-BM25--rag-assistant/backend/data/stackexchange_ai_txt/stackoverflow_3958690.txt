You'd need to get a count of how many games have been played, and a count of the number of players, join them together, and divide appropriately; something like SELECT GAMES_PLAYED, PLAYERS, GAMES_PLAYED / PLAYERS AS AVERAGE_GAMES_PER_PLAYER FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS GAMES_PLAYED FROM 'ifa_scores') g, (SELECT COUNT(*) AS PLAYERS FROM (SELECT DISTINCT 'fb_id' FROM 'ifa_scores')) p; should work. Alternatively you could use SELECT AVG(GAMES_PLAYED) AS AVERAGE_GAMES_PER_PLAYER FROM (SELECT FB_ID, COUNT(*) AS GAMES_PLAYED FROM 'ifa_scores' GROUP BY 'fb_id'); Share and enjoy.
