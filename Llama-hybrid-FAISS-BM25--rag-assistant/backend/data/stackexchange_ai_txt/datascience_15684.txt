How to test People similarity measure?

I am doing a project on finding famous people who are similar to each other. For this, I am extracting a bunch of features and applying a distance function on them to evaluate who is closer to whom. Is there a way to test this out quantitatively? Take the example of actors for easy reference. Say, one model predicts Robert Downey Jr. to be most similar to Christian Bale. While after applying more weights to the 'heights' feature, George Clooney is found to be most similar to Christian Bale. Now how do I quantitatively assert that one is better than the other? One might say that Robert Downey is a better result because both Christian Bale and Robert Downey have starred in cult superhero movies (albeit different ones), while someone else might say that since George Clooney and Christian Bale were both batmans at one point, George Clooney is the better result. Is there a way to test this other than intuition?
