C++ unit test framework again

I have been looking for specific properties from a unit test framework in c++ but I have struggled find all of the following properties in a framework: Creation of Stubs (only in c++test). Has Code-Coverage tool (only in c++test). VS integration (Common enough) Fixtures (very common in most c++ frame works) Integration with a continuous build system (unable to find it at all in any Framework) Predicate support (Very rare, only able to find that boost has this) Anyone know of any frameworks which have all these properties (or most of them)?
