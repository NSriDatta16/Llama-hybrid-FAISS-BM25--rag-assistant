Keras Custom Loss Function

I am looking to design a custom loss function for Keras model. The model itself is neural network that accepts a set of images and is supposed to run a regression to get an output, which is a value. Due to the physical conditions of the problem, I need to add a regularization term which would calculate the $cos(y_{pred})*f(X_i)$ , where $y_{pred}$ is the output of the neural network, $X_i$ is the training example used to calculate $y_{pred}$ , $f$ is some function which would calculate a value based on the image. My problem is how to get the $X_i$ from the model? Loss function is supposed to accept just two inputs: $y_{pred}$ and $y_{true}$ which are tensors.
