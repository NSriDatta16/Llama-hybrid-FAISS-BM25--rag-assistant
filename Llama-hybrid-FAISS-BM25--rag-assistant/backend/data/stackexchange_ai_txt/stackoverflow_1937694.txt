While building your own parser may be "fun" there is already a package out there that can parse BLAST xml files ... it can even do the intermediate calling of a local BLAST instance for you if you so desire. The main site is here: http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython and the XML BLAST parser is here: http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#htoc82 Something like: from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML with open('xml/results/file') as handle: all_records = NCBIXML.parse(handle) first_record = all_records.next() Should work. I generally love the BioPython parsers and writers but I do not like the class-structure organization. So I generally just use the parser and extract the info I need into my own structure. YMMV Hope that helps.
