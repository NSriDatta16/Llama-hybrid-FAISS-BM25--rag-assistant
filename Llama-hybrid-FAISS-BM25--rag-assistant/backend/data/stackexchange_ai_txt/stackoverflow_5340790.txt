Easiest way to replay commits on new git repository

I've been using git-svn, and recently, I've been getting errors when trying to commit (I think this is due to a bug in libneon, but this is beyond the scope of this question). The solution has been to re-clone my git repository using git svn clone . However, I have changes on the master branch in my old git repository that I was not able to commit to svn using git svn dcommit . I'd like to replay these changes on the new repository cloned with git svn. I think I could probably export a patch-set using git format-patch , and then replay these changes on the new repository but I'm not entirely sure how to do this, and I wonder if there's an even easier or more elegant way to accomplish this.
