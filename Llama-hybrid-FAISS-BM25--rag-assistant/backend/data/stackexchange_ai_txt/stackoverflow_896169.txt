Does .h need to be included when using header search path?

I'm referencing a static library . I've dragged the library project into my app project and reference it relatively . The .a file from the library is linked into my app target. I've added a reference to the librarys .h files' folder via Header Search Paths in the app project. Then I add an import in my apps .pch file to a particular .h file from the library. I build and get this error: some.h: No such file or directory The project is given info on where to find .h files for the library. Why can't it see them?
