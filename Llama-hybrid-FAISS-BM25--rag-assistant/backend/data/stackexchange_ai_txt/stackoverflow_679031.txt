Copy array of objects to array of different type

Previously, I ran into a problem trying to share a type definition between my ASMX webservice and my .aspx page (webclient) Confused on C# Array of objects and implicit type conversion As I understand the advice, the "problem" this creates can be solved by copying the array of objects created in the client to a new array of objects as defined by the ASMX proxy class. Being a rookie in C# I am still struggling with this simple task. Here are more parts of my code (the other fragments in the previous post remain unchanged): ... here is where I populate the "test data" I want to pass to the web service: // create an array of MetaData objects MetaData[] nvPairs = new MetaData[20]; // arbitrary length of 20 pairs // create arbitrary MetaData objects in the array nvPairs[0] = new MetaData("Grant Number", "2577-9912"); nvPairs[1] = new MetaData("OPEAnalyst", "Simpson"); ... here I attempt a function to "copy" from "real" type defined in my TRIMBrokerUtil namespace (which I can't use completely because of the proxy) to the proxy version of that type: protected TRIMBrokerASMXProxy.ASMXProxy.MetaData[] CopyMetaData( MetaData utilArray) { TRIMBrokerASMXProxy.ASMXProxy.MetaData[] outArray = new TRIMBrokerASMXProxy.ASMXProxy.MetaData[utilArray.Name.Length]; int i; for (i = 0; i ... and then here is where I try to call that function (compiler flags 2 errors on this line: TRIMBrokerASMXProxy.ASMXProxy.MetaData[] kvData = CopyMetaData(metaDataArray); Both of the compile errors below point to the same line: Error 1 The best overloaded method match for '_Default.CopyMetaData(TRIMBrokerUtil.MetaData)' has some invalid arguments Error 2 Argument '1': cannot convert from 'TRIMBrokerUtil.MetaData[]' to 'TRIMBrokerUtil.MetaData' Am I close ?
