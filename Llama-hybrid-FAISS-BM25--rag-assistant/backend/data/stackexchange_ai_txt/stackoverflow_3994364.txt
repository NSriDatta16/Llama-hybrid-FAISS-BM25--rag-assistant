resize and draggable the group of the SVG element

I am working on a SVG application and now want to let a user resize an object using draggable corners, very much like in SVG-edit (http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html). The functionality should work as follows: The user selects an SVG object, drags it to the main ‘canvas’ and once on the ‘canvas’, four corners on the outside of the object appear, the user can drag on each of the corner points & drag to enlarge the object. The objects will be rectangular in shape and created using paths, not using the SVG ‘rect’ function. Would anyone have any suggestions as to how this should be implemented? Thanks in Advance
