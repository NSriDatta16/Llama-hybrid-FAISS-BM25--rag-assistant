What you want is a feature called connection testing provided by connection pools - the connection pool should run a quick query to verify that the connection it is about to hand out is not stale. Unfortunately DriverManagerConnectionProvider , Hibernate's default connection pooling class, does not support this feature. Hibernate team strongly discourages the use of this connection pool in production code. Hibernate's own connection pooling algorithm is, however, quite rudimentary. It is intended to help you get started and is not intended for use in a production system, or even for performance testing. You should use a third party pool for best performance and stability. My recommendation is that you switch to some other connection pool implementation. If you switch to C3P0 (which is shipped with Hibernate), connection testing can be configured as explained here . If you use Apache DBCP, it lets you set a validationQuery as explained here .
