It seems to defeat the purpose of generics , but here it goes: Stack s = new Stack (); s.add("hello"); s.add(1); // int is autoboxed to Integer The catch will be that when retrieving the Object s from the Stack , it's going to take some effort to find out what type of each element is -- it will require using instanceof and typecasts: while (!s.isEmpty()) { Object e = s.pop(); if (e instanceof String) System.out.println("String: " + (String)e); else if (e instanceof Integer) System.out.println("Integer: " + (Integer)e); else System.out.println("Other type: " + e); } And now, we have something resembling the fragile code of the pre-Java 5 days before generics was added to the language.
