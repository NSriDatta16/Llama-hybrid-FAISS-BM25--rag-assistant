What character can be used to parse for paragraphs with Java?

I'm sure folks will get a good laugh out of this one, but for the life of me I cannot find a seperator that will indicate when a new paragraph has begun in a string of text. Word, and line? Easy peasy, but paragraph seems to be much harder to find. I've tried two line breaks in a row, the Unicode representation of paragraph break and line break, with no luck. EDIT: I apologize for the vagueness of my original question. To answer some of the questions, it is a basic text file originally created on windows. I'm testing some code for opening and analyzing it's contents with the Blackberry JDE 4.5 using the RIM eclipse plugin. While the source of the file will be windows (at least for the foreseeable future) and be basic text, I have no control over how they are created (it's a third party source that I dont' have access to the way it is created)
