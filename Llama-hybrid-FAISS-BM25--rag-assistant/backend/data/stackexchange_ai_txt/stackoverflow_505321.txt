Here's an example using a nested ItemsControl. Unfortunately, it will make one TextBlock per Inline instead of putting the whole Paragraph into one TextBlock: This is the first paragraph. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is the second paragraph. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. This is the third paragraph. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow! If you want one Paragraph per element you should probably do as suggested and use a read-only RichTextBox, or do what this person did and derive from TextBlock so that the Inlines property can be bound.
