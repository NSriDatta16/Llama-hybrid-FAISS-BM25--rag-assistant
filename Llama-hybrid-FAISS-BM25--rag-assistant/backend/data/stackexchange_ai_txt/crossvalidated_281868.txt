Auto.Arima and Arima Output Differences

I am studying a time series using ARIMA . Initially, I used the function auto.arima from the package forecast to identify the best possible fit, however I successively moved to Arima (from the same package) because I am interested in the data trends, i.e. if I record a drift. Therefore, what I did was to find the best ARIMA order according to auto.arima and use it in Arima to get the drift. However, while I was reviewing the results, I noticed some differences between the parameters recorded with auto.arima and with Arima . Below you find a MWE of my code (I just started to use R coming from Matlab , so I think you will notice the code is not very elegant) #INITIALIZE rm(list=ls()) require(xlsx) require(forecast) graphics.off() cat("\014") Fit2 I see my experimental dataset is poor in the first half, so it may not be a wise move to use such a high order ARIMA, however I trusted what auto.arima suggested me. Is this a mistake? If not, why do I record this difference between outputs coming from auto.arima and Arima ? I am particularly surprised because I thought Arima and auto.arima worked with the same algorithm.
