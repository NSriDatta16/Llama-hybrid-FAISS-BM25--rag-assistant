How does FeedJack fetches historical feeds

I am building a news aggregation website and I am looking for a way to fetch old feeds(of any particular website ) into the system. During this course, I stumbled on to Feedjack . It is said that it handles what I needed. So I started diving into the source code. (I dont want to plugit in my django project directly.) All I see is this line: self.fpf = parse_feed(self.feed.feed_url, agent=USER_AGENT, etag=self.feed.etag) # in bin/feedjack_update.py I am not sure how this handles historical feed parsing. May I know what I am missing. One more question I have is, let alone feedjack, how can I access historical feeds of any website?
