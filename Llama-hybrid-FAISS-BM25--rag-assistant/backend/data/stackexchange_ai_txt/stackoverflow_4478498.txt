It really depends what you want to do with the resulting XML. If you want to save information entered by users, then you'll need to use a server side technology for the save operation. Examples of server side technology include ASP.NET, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Java and Node.js. If you have no experience with any of these technologies, this will be your biggest learning curve. Microsoft provide a fantastic free application called WebMatrix which will help you get started with a number of different frameworks, but excels at ASP.NET. If you're only interested in persisting information for the use of an individual user, you'll not be looking at an actual XML file. @BobTodd's answer gives a list of most of your options, but I would say the choice comes down to Cookie vs. local storage. The choice will be made based on the volume of information you would like to save. Cookies are a lot simpler, but only allow a small amount of data to be saved.
