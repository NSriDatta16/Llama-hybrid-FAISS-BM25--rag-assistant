How to find dates in the sentence using NLP, RegEx in Python

Can anyone suggest me some way of finding and parsing dates (in any format, "Aug06", "Aug2006", "August 2 2008", "19th August 2006", "08-06", "01-08-06") in the python. I came across this question, but it is in perl... Extract inconsistently formatted date from string (date parsing, NLP) Any suggestion would be helpful.
