In brief, just my opinions ... Risks & Troubles (I found) : Routes can be a bit of a sticking point, IMHO until you get a complete handle on them, they're just a little awkward! Mocking of the Http objects is not as easy as I'd hoped, because of dependencies I'd guess the biggest risk is developing an applicaiton before the dev tem is completely up to speed with all the MVC features etc. Main points to pay attention to Make sure that your domain design is correct from the outset. Choose a good mocking framework for your unit tests Take a look at The microsoft blog engine code: Oxite (downloadable from codeplex) excellent place to see how things should be done Get a good book! I've looked at a couple but found this one the best : http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430210079 There are other MVC frameworks. Wikipedia has a list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller As a UI developer my preference would be to use MVC over Webforms now.
