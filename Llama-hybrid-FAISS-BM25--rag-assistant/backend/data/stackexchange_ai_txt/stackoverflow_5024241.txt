You should take a look at http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php from the PHP manual. There are a lot of user contributions at the bottom of the page regarding forcing the browser to show a download prompt rather than printing to screen. Here is one from that page ( By phpnet at holodyn dot com 31-Jan-2011 09:01 ) which I have edited slightly. I think it answers both questions A and B. Just send the textbox's contents to the PHP file through an iframe, allow it to format the text appropriately and send it back to the browser with the following headers. $contents = ' etc.... '; header("Pragma: public"); // required header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: private", false); // required for certain browsers header("Content-Type: audio/x-mpegurl"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"playlist.m3u\";" ); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: " . strlen($contents)); ob_clean(); flush(); echo $contents; Edit: If what you want is an all Javascript solution, then I personally don't know, and after a little google-ing, it looks like others don't either. Most seem to solve this with an invisible iframe that directs to a server-side file. Edit 2: I've changed the content type so that it matches the m3u file type.
