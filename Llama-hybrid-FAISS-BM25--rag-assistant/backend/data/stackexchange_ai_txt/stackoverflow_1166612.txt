To get to 100% for each thread, you will need to: (in each thread): Eliminate all secondary storage I/O (disk read/writes) Eliminate all display I/O (screen writes/prints) Eliminate all locking mechanisms (mutexs, semaphores) Eliminate all Primary storage I/O (operate strictly out of registers and cache, not DRAM). Good luck on your rewrite!
