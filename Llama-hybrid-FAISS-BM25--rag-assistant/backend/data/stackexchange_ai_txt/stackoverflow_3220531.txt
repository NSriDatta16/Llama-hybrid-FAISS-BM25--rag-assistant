Magento - Help Specifying the Page Layout

Here’s what’s going on: I have a page content for a module rendering in my 3 column layout (which I believe is the default) and I want it to render in 1 column, but I don’t know how. The longer version: I’m using Unirgy’s Dropship Microsite and I’m trying to get the vendor landing page to render in the 1 column layout. My layout xml file looks like this: Register New Account Register New Account 20 [..removed unrelated xml..] What’s interesting is that umicrosite_vendor_register renders in 1 column, but umicrosite_index_index renders in the default 3 column layout. I’ve tried changing its block type to directory/data to match umicrosite_vendor_register, but that didn’t work. My IndexController is very simple: $this->loadLayout()->renderLayout(); I guess what I’m missing is where the Magneto tells the register page to render in 1 column and the index page to render in 3 columns. I’ve spent all day trying to figure out where this happens, but to no avail. Any suggestions as to where I should look?
