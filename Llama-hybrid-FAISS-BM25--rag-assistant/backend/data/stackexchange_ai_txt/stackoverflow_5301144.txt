I have also have been using ObjectDB for many years (I think 7 years) in a commercial capacity. Our company has two products that use the database (both embedded version). One of our products displays information about the signals sent between mobile devices (ie mobile phones) and a simulated network. Although we in effect create a separate database for each test that we run we can often save up to 1GB of equivalent XML data into the database. The speeds for saving the data are very quick (normally faster than asking Windows to make a copy the equivalent XML file). The retrieval speed is excellent allowing us to scroll through thousands (even tens of thousands) of graphically represented items as if scrolling through a Windows explorer file directory. ObjectDB is an excellent product and one I hope to continue to work with. When we were developing our products we encountered the odd problem (although we've not had to report a single thing for as long as I can remember) but the speed with which we have had a resolution to every problem has been the best I've ever encountered. To answer you question of "Is this production ready" well, in my opinion, it most certainly is.
