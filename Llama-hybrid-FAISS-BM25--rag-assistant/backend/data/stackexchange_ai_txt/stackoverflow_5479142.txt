How to periodically extract data from a CSV file?

I'm currently working in some Q&A projects. I am running tests (which can vary from a couple of minutes to 2-3 days) in an applications that is generating some csv files and updates them periodically, with a new row added with each update (once every couple of seconds or so). Each CSV file is structured like this: Header1,Header2,Header3,.................,HeaderN numerical_value11,numerical_value12,numerical_value13,......,numerical_value1N, numerical_value21,numerical_value22,numerical_value23,......,numerical_value1N, etc The number of columns may vary from csv file to csv file. I am running in a windows environment. I also have cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed. Is there a way I can do a script that runs periodically (once per hour or so), extracts data (a single/multiple values from a row, or the average of the the values from specific rows added in the csv between interrogations) and sends some email alerts if, for example, the data from one column is out of a range? Thx
