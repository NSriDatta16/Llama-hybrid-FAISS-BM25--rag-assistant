Is linear regression the best method for getting the relationship among 3 variables?

I have two independent variables, let's call them $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and one dependent variable, $y$ . I don't have some exogenous shock or some natural experiment to capture the causality among theses variables, so I'm appealing to some sort of regression (which I guess is better than just Pearson coefficient). Is multiple linear regression the best approach to get how much $x_1$ and $x_2$ affects $y$ ? Does lasso regression, ridge, or even random forest be better here?
