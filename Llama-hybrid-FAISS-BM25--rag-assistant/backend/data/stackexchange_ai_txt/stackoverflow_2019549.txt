Good projects to learn OCaml and F#

After learning the basic syntax, reading some non-trivial code is a fast way to learn a language. We can also learn how to design a library/software during reading others' code. I have following lists. A Chess program in OCaml by Tomek Czajka . Hal Daum√© has written several machine learning libraries in Ocaml. Including decision trees, logistic regression and SVM. All of them are near-production-quality code. A Chess Game Analysis program in F# in Microsoft Research. The above three are my favorites. Will you suggest some other sources? General purpose open source software are good, specialized open source like the three I list here are even more welcome .
