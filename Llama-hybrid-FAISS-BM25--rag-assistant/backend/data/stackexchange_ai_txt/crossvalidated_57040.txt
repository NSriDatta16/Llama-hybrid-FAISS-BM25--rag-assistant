In multinomial logistic regression, can I compare the categories that are not the reference category with each other?

I am conducting multinomial log. regression, my DV has three categories, therefore my output gives me the comparison between the reference category and the other two. I would also like to compare those two which are not reference with each other. I know I can do this by changing the reference category in a second analysis, but are there problems associated with this? Thanks
