If I'm adding content in page through JavaScript will it be crawlable by Search engine spider

If I'm adding content in page through JavaScript will it be crawl-able by Search engine spider and accessible by screen reader. For example this var tip = " Most computers will open PDF documents "; tip += "automatically, but you may"; tip += "need to download Adobe Reader . "; $(document).ready(function(){ //IF NUMBER OF PDF LINKS IS MORE THAN ZERO INSIDE DIV WITH ID maincontent //THEN THIS WILL PUT TIP PARAGRAPH AS LAST CHILD OF DIV if($("div#maincontent a[href*='/pdf']").length>0){ $("div#maincontent").children(":last-child").after(tip); } }); Edit: I want to hide this from Search engine but at the same time keep accessible by screen reader is it possible?
