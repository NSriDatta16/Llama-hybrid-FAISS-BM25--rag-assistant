Android 1.5 Menu Inflator didn't find Image

In Android 1.6 and higher, this menu XML inflates and runs fine. But when run in 1.5 I get an error about a resource not found. I find that when I remove the @drawable/menu_preferences from the XML in 1.5 it works fine. Is there a 1.5 work around I can do to get the image to work? EDIT: The image is in the drawable-mdpi folder.
