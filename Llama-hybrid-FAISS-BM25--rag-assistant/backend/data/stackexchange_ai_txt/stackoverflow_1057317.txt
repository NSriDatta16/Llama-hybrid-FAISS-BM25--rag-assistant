you mean, you'll store the votes seperately in a table and then update the respective ranking of product in product's table with a defined strategy? That seems like an inefficient way of storing it. Maybe there is a background to that reason; but why would you not want to store all votes in one table and keep making references of those votes to respective product. This gives you a real time count. On UI you'll calculate a average of all the votings to a near integer to show. That would suffice, isn't it? Or am I missing something?
