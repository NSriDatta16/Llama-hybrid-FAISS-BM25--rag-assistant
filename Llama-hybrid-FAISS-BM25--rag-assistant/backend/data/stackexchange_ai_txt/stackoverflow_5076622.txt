iPhone smooth sketch drawing algorithm

I am working on a sketching app on the iPhone. I got it working but not pretty as seen here And I am looking for any suggestion to smooth the drawing Basically, what I did is when user places a finger on the screen I called - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event then I collect a single touch in an array with - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event and when the user lefts a finger from the screen, I called - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event then I draw all the points in the array using NSMutableArray *points = [collectedArray points]; CGPoint firstPoint; [[points objectAtIndex:0] getValue:&firstPoint]; CGContextMoveToPoint(context, firstPoint.x, firstPoint.y); CGContextSetLineCap(context, kCGLineCapRound); CGContextSetLineJoin(context, kCGLineJoinRound); for (int i=1; i And now I want to improve the drawing tobe more like "Sketch Book" App I think there is something to do with signal processing algorithm to rearrange all the points in the array but I am not sure. Any Help would be much appreciated. Thankz in advance :)
