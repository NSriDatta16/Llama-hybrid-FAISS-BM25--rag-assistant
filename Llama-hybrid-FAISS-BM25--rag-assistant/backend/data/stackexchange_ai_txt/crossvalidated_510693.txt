One important thing to note is that both PCA and k-means clustering rely on similar algorithms. PCA essentially finds the main axis of variance in high-dimensional data, while k-mean minimizes and maximizes within and between variance. Both of these algorithms are in some way "simplifying" the full variance into a simplified problem space. So all that being said, I doubt the order is going to make much difference. I'd try both and see what happens. If your principal components capture a large percentage of the variance, then the clustering should be almost identical. It looks like you have essentially three clusters, mostly defined by PC1. If your principal components aren't capturing a large degree of variance, then you may see differences, and then it really depends on the context of your PCA. Sometimes PCA is theoretically viewed as "de-noising" your data, and allowing you to focus on the most important factors. This is particularly true when your variables are truly imperfect representations of latent variables. However, if your variables are not truly representative of some latent variables, then really PCA is just a visualization trick. Both numeric and theoretical concerns need to be taken into account in addressing this issue.
