I seems i have been misunderstood. For those who think that a classic database is design for even processing real-time statistic with queries on billions datas, they might need to read articles on the origin of OLAP & why some people bother to design products around if the answer for performance was just a design question. "I would blame bad design of the software you are using before I would blame the core technology." By the way, im not using any software (or pgadmin counts ?). I have two basic tables, you cant make it more simple,and the problem comes when you have billions datas to retreve for statistics. For those who think it is just a design problm, im glad to hear their clever answer (no trigger i know this one) to a simple problem : Imagine you have 2 tables: employees & phones. An employee may have 0 to N phones. Now let say that you have 10 000 000 employees & 30 000 000 phones. You final users want to know in real time : 1- the average number of phones per user 2-the avegarde age of user who have more than 3 phones 3-the averagae numbers of phones for employees who are in the company for more than 10 years You have potentially 100 users that want those real time statistics at anytime. Of course, any queries dont have to take more than 1/4 sec.
