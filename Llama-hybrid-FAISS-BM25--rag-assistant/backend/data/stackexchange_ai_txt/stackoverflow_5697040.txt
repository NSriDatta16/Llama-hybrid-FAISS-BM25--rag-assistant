You could keep errors in log and get any information you need with using debug_backtrace() to see which file and code line is causing error. You could also get ref. url, or current url or any other kind of information which you might find useful. Imagine this; You could keep, user IP / logged in user ID You could keep, date, ref. url / current url. You could keep, which included file and which line caused the error. You could create a log file with dates. Such as 04.18.2011.txt easier and organized. You could block let's say logs/ folder with .htaccess so it will be private if you want. You don't get to push users to send you bug reports. Don't forget many visitors are lazy. They will not even want to do few clicks. This way you will keep track of each errors in your system without having a need to wait for someone to report it. If you still would like users to post some data it is a different story (for example clicked link (or anything on the page) didn't return the value (or did what user wanted) as expected. If you want report of this then you could keep store them as well as just simply mail yourself which would save you time for coding. If you need help with Javascript part, I could help you with it since I worked on something similar on my own project. I hope this helps.
