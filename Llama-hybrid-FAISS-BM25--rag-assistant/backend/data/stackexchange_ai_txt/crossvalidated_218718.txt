Go to Autobox.com and review the discussion about transfer functions. The is a question about elasticities. Review any principles of economics text. A new version of Autobox calculates elasticities. If your data is time series, it is inappropriate to use classical regression analysis. Applying classical regression analysis to summarize time series data will result in a violation of one or more of the underlying assumptions about the error terms. Use time series techniques to summarize time series data, and classical regression to summarize cross sectional data. If you focus on R, then you will spend an inordinate amount to time learning how to program rather than on analysis. Investigate the advantages of Autobox.
