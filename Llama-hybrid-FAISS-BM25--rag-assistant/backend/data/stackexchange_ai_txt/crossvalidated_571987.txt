If it's precision in the sense of "could be any value between a and b" (and the ends of the intervals aren't necessarily less likely than the middle) with a and b different for each observation, then over could treat this as interval censored data. If you'd like to treat this as measurements e.g. with a normally distributed error that's sometimes wider or narrower, then a normal likelihood with known for SD works. There's specialized software for all of these (e.g. survival analysis tools for the first, meta regression for the second). Alternatively, the brms R package covers both. Within these you uses a regression with suitable terms such as group (plus the assignment mechanism to group, e.g. randomisation strata or propensity scores). Thereafter, you just use a likelihood ratio test or the like based on the likelihood, or in a Bayesian setting look at the posterior for the group coefficient.
