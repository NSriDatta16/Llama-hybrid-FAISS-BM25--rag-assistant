Check out NSOutlineView . Basically, what you're going to want is two different Core Data entities: Group and Child . Group would have a to-many relationship, children , to Child objects, and Child would have a to-one relationship, parent , to one Group entity. That's enough to get the basic model defined. Past that, you need to break your question down more. For example, how do I implement drag & drop using Core Data? That's been answered many times. How do I mix two different entity types in a single outline view? Also answered before. Break the question down into each individual sub-task and look for an answer â€“ I'd bet most of them of them have an answer on Stack Overflow.
