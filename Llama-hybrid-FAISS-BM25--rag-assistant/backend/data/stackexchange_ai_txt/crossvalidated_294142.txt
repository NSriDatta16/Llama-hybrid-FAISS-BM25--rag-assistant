What reasons could cause variance to be underestimated to a large degree?

I ran a simulation from probabilities estimated in some survival models (i.e., Cox regression with 2 causes). $n$ samples of size $m$ were simulated, and sample means and sample variances were calculated. When I use the average of sample variances divided by $m$ to estimate the variance of the sample mean, the two numbers don't match. The former is only 2% of the latter. What could cause this underestimation?
