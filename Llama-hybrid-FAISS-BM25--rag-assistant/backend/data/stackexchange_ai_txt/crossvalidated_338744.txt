"Pick 3 out of 12 statements" - is linear regression possible in this case?

Suppose I'm trying to figure out what makes people shop at a particular store. I conduct a survey where they are asked: how often they shop there to pick 3 out of a list of 12 characteristics that they most associate with the store, e.g. "well-known brand", "good quality", "good loyalty programs", etc. I was thinking of doing a linear regression of Q1 on Q2. in order to figure out which of these factors are significant when making a decision. Denote by $Y$ the frequency and by $X_i$ a binary variable indicating whether the respondent associated factor $i$ with the store: $$Y \sim 1 + X_1 + ... + X_{12}$$ The problem with this seems to be perfect multicollinearity: $\sum_i X_i = 3$. Curiously, when I ran the regression in R, I checked the model with car::vif and didn't get alarmingly large values (mostly around 2 for each coefficient). Apart from that, it's difficult to interpret the results... the values of the coefficients don't really correspond to anything, they only give a rough idea of the factors' relative importance. For example, if the average value of $Y$ is 4.5, I get an intercept of 4.0 and the coefficients all approximately 0.1-0.2, so that picking three of them would roughly correspond to the average. In a sense, the regression compares the respondents to a hypothetical person who "didn't select anything", even though that's impossible. Is this model even appropriate at all, given the collinearity problem? If not, what might be a good alternative? I was wondering if forcibly removing the intercept from the model might be a good idea here to try and salvage it?
