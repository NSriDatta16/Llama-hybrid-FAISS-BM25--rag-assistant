How-to map process to an Hypercube using MPI_CART

I am trying to implement bitonic sorting using MPI for 2^n processors. I would like to use an n-dimensional hypercube to do so for convenience. Using MPI_Cart_Create I can create self-organising dimensions. Doing so will maximize efficiency of my process and also reduce the number of LOC I have to spit to get it done.. Googling AND the litterature always tell the same thing: Note that an n -dimensional hypercube is an n -dimensional torus with 2 processes per coordinate direction. Thus, special support for hypercube structures is not necessary. I havenâ€™t seen any single example + n -dimensional torus with 2 processes per coordinate direction seems nothing but mystery to me. Would anyone have to suggest? Thanks,
