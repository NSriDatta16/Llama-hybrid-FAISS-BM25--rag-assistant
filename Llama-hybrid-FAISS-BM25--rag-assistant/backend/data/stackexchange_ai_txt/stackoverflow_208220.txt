You could use the rename(1) command: rename 's/(.*)$/new.$1/' original.filename Edit: If rename isn't available and you have to rename more than one file, shell scripting can really be short and simple for this. For example, to rename all *.jpg to prefix_*.jpg in the current directory: for filename in *.jpg; do mv "$filename" "prefix_${filename}"; done; or also, leveraging from Dave Webb's answer and using brace expansion: for filename in *.jpg; do mv {,prefix_}"$filename"; done;
