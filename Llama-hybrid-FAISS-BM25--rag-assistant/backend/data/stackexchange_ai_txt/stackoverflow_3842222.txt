You can create a file named ".profile" in your home directory, for me that's C:\Users\[user] Inside that file, put the following line of code: GIT_SSH="/usr/bin/ssh.exe" This will set the GIT_SSH environment variable to use the ssh client included with git. The .profile script gets executed when you start your Git Bash command line. Edit: This is my .profile. It will ask you for your password the first time you start the git command prompt, then will remember it from then on, until you reboot your computer. Very handy so you don't have to keep entering your password each time you want to do something. SSH_ENV="$HOME/.ssh/environment" GIT_SSH="/usr/bin/ssh.exe" function start_agent { echo "Initializing new SSH agent..." /usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > "${SSH_ENV}" echo succeeded chmod 600 "${SSH_ENV}" . "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null /usr/bin/ssh-add; } # Source SSH settings, if applicable if [ -f "${SSH_ENV}" ]; then . "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null #ps ${SSH_AGENT_PID} doesn't work under cygwin ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || { start_agent; } else start_agent; fi
