You should read up on the external storage chapter on the Android development guide. By calling getExternalFilesDir() you will get a filepath to your SD card. As a strategy, if you navigate to the folder containing the images and just pass in the ID of your contact to locate the file, you can load this into a data structure. You can then create a custom adapter passing in the data structure containing your images. This will result in your ListView to contain only the images of your contacts. This is just to give you a head start!
