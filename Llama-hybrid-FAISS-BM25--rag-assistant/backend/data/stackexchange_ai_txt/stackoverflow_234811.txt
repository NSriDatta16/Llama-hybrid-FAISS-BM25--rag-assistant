After taking (quite) a few compilers classes, I've used both The Dragon Book and C&T . I think C&T does a far better job of making compiler construction digestible. Not to take anything away from The Dragon Book, but I think C&T is a far more practical book. Also, if you like writing in Java, I recommend using JFlex and BYACC/J for your lexing and parsing needs.
