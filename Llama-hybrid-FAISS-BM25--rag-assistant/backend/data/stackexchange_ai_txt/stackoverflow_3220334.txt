Coming up with wacky architectural hacks that you can employ to keep your view model elegant and simple is missing the point. The view model is the wacky architectural hack. The only reason - seriously, the only reason - that the view model exists is to model the view. Does the view have buttons that trigger commands? The commands belong in the view model. Thinking, "it's really the Record's responsibility to move Components" seems sensible on its face, but it's actually an indication that you're losing track of why you even created a view model in the first place. Does the Component view have a "Move Up" button? Then the Component view model needs a "Move Up" command that you can bind the button to. Because that's what the Component view model is for . I'm being emphatic about this because this is the third or fourth question I've seen this week from WPF developers who seem to have gone down so deeply down the rabbit hole of the MVVM pattern that they've forgotten why it exists.
