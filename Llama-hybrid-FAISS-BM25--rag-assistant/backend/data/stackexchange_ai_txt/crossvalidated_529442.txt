Statistical analysis for questionnaire with levels and how to do it in r?

I have this questionnaire. Where people are asked about the importance of eating vegetables in their life, using a likert scale for level questions, and cathegorical questions coded with numbers. A quick summary of the questionnaire would be like this: Q1: Consuming vegetables in your diet is a priority for you? 1– Not a priority 2– Low priority 3– Medium priority 4– High priority 5– Essential Q2:What kind of area do you live? 1- Rural area 2- Urban area Q3:What education have you completed? 1- None 2- elementary 3- middle 4- High 5- University Q4: Is eating organic vegetables a priority for you? 1– It is not a priority 2– Low priority 3– Medium priority 4– High priority 5– Essential There are more questions obviously but in essence the questionnaire is this way So a few lines of the dataframe of questions looks like this: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 1 1 1 1 5 2 4 4 2 2 2 2 and i have another dataframe coded with words and numbers Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 1 rural none 1 5 urban high 4 2 urban elementary 2 So... The idea is to find an association between the level of response and different categories that exist in the questions. But I can't think of what statistic to use and how to do it in, specially in R.(correlation?, fisher exact test?how to manage dataframe in r and stuff) I would appreciate a lot if you guide me please 'cause i really need help
