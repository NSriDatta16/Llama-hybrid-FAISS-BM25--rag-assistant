How to Set a Different List and View Template for a Magento Category?

Let's say I have two categories. I want first category to use template/catalog/list_a.phtml, but I want second category use template/catalog/list_b.phtml for their product listing template. I also like first category to use template/catalog/view_a.phtml and second category to use template/catalog/view_b.phtml. I found a solution to use a different layout for each category. Here is the solution How to display category custom design layout in product view page? so..in order to use different listing and view template, I ended up with the following code. page/cashandcarry.phtml empty 6 one_column 5 two_columns_left 4 two_columns_right 4 three_columns 3 product_list_toolbar The problem is that my product listing template displays the default template as well. I mean, both default and my custom listing template are displayed. How do I display my custom listing template only?
