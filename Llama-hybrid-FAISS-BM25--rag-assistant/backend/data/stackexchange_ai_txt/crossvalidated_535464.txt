When to use Simple Linear Regression over Multiple Linear Regression

I am fairly new to the world of statistics and approaching it as I learn more about machine learning. I have a fairly firm grasp on regression analysis so far but not necessarily on nuances and best practices of application. For example; assume I have 5 predictor variables—a clear case for consideration of multiple regression as I understand it. I'm curious as to any conditions in which it would be beneficial to draw primary conclusions based on simple linear regression modeling from these data vs. using multiple regression. The one situation I can imagine is where all five of the explanatory variables are realized to have a high degree of collinearity and can be combined into a single feature. The only other case I've been able to imagine is where, after initial analyzes for correlation between predictors and the response variable, it's concluded that only a single predictor has any significant correlation such that a linear relationship exists between it and the response variable. In this case, however, it's really a conclusion that only one predictor variable is suited for inclusion anyway—kind of sidestepping the issue. So the question is: under what conditions would one choose simple linear regression over multiple linear regression when multiple predictor variables are available for analysis. As a caveat, assume more than 1 exists where there exists a significant linear correlation between that variable and the response variable.
