Getting the distribution of a model accuracy metric using the Posterior of the Model Parameters

Say I compute the posterior via MCMC of a classification model's hyper-parameters $\theta$ given my observed data: $\pi(\theta|D)$ . Would it be at all useful to take a look at, for example, the distribution of the Area Under (ROC) Curve as a function of $\theta\sim\pi(\theta|D)$ ? I was thinking this could give insight on the generalization of the model if $AUC(\theta)$ is computed on a set different from that used to train the model and get the posterior. Is this correct? Edit: I was using simulated annealing to optimize the hyper-parameters using python's hyperopt library and got the idea to do this via an MCMC method like Metropolis-Hastings which is very similar. The histogram looks nice, but I am wondering if it is meaningful.
