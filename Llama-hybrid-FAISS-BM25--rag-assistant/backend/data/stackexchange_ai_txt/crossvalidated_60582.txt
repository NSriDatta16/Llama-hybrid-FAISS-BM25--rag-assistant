When you have a time series with a number of cycles (e.g. multiple years with each 12 months) then the seasonality indicates for each month how the trend should be adjusted. In this context it would mean that for a specific period you need to adjust your trend with 1 to get the right forecast. That said, I find this a bit of a weird question and it offers too little context to write any meaningful answer. I would suggest that you have a look at the following text as the authors of this text offer a good insight into time series and the associated forecasting techniques.
