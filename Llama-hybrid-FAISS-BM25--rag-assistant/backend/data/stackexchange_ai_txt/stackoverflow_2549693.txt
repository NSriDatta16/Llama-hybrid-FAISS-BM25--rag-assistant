Studies have been done showing that certain practices reduce defect rates in software. For instance, a study found a strong correlation between cyclomatic complexity and the probability of being fault-prone. Other studies show the average effectiveness of design and code inspections are 55 and 60 percent. So it appears to be in our best interests to favor simplicity, check metrics, and do code reviews. We're talking probabilities here, though. If I review your code, I'm not guaranteed to find 60% of your bugs. There are also few absolutes in software development; experienced developers know that the correct answer is generally "it depends." That said, there are a number of practices with objective data in their favor.
