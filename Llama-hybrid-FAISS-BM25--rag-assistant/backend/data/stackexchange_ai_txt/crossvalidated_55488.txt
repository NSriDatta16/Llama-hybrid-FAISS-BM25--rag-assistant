Well, it's simply that clear seasonal correlations don't always imply that you need seasonal differencing ; the seasonal effect can be modelled fine with seasonal moving average & autoregressive terms. It's the same in non-seasonal models; just because you see a strong autocorrelation doesn't necessarily mean you need to difference the series. Sounds like you solved the 'puzzle' by fitting a good model to the undifferenced series that still incorporated seasonal effects.
