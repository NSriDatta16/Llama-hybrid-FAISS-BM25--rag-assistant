Fitting random slopes with the population-level slope fixed to zero is not out of the question - it's not mathematically or statistically ill-posed - but it's a rather weird model that would require some extra justification. Why would you expect that the average slope across cities would be exactly zero (which is what is implied by the model that omits the fixed effect)? The only cases where I've seen fitting such models make sense are as a(n) (admittedly silly) null model, for doing a likelihood-ratio test of the significance of the population-level slope [not relevant in your case as you're using Bayesian methods] in cases where the effect is zero based on the experimental design, e.g. when samples are randomly assigned to test and treatment conditions in a pre-treatment condition (this would be eliminating a fixed effect of treatment in the "before" period, not a fixed slope, but the idea is similar). If you have a fixed-effect slope and among-city variation in the slope, you do indeed need to add the population-level slope to the individual-city slope deviation, and use the posterior distribution of the sum for inference - I don't know exactly how this is done in rstanarm ( related ) ... the tidybayes package might help.
