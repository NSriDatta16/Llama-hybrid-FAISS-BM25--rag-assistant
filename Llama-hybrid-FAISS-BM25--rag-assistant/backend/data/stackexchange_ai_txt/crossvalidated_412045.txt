Are there specific classifiers or ways to tune commonly used classifiers such that they minimize the number of false positives?

I have a dataset with which I want to train a binary classifier. I have been experimenting with various approaches including SVM, NN, Logistic Regression and in each case have used the classifier to calculate a probability of a positive result. It is important to me to minimize the number of false positives as much as possible. Are there any classifiers that are designed in such a way as to minimize false positives or are there ways of adapting any of the most common classifiers such that they minimize false positives? Approximately 1/2 of the samples in the training set have a positive dependent variable. Likewise, a typical set of samples for which I want to make predictions will also have an approx. even split between dependent variables with a value of 0 or 1. Perhaps another way of saying what I would like to achieve â€¦ I would be happy to sacrifice accuracy for lower probability positive predictions if I could achieve higher accuracy for the higher probability positive predictions.
