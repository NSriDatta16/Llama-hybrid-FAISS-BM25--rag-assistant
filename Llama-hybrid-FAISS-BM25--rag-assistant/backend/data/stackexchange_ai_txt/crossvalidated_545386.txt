Frank's answer mentions stratification, and that was the route I was pursuing when I suggested you move your earlier closed question to CV.com. As I suggested in a comment you did get an answer from a smarter respondent than I am. If you ran separate models on each country (simple to do in R) you might get a better idea of the distribution of estimates. I would also think that using age as a covariate would be essential. Frank's text "Regression Modeling Strategies" has a wealth of material on dealing with non-linear effects of covariates. Your question had been how to build a model with weighting in a manner that might recognize the heterogeneity. Here is a stratified model build based on the tiny test set you offered library(survival) gender The usual assumptions about Cox models with a simple continuous covariate apply, but here two separate models have been constructed and a weighted "average" of their coefficients have been returned. This will not account for all forms of non-proportionality. For testing you might also need to assess whether the effect is constant over time as the model assumes using the cox.zph function. Therneau & Gambsch's text "Modeling Survival Data" has an excellent chapter.
