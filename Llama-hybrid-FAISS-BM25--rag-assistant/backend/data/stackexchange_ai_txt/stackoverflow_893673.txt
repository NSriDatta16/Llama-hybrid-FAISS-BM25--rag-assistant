The slope is just slope = y(n)-y(n-1) Or if you have units on the x-axis, divide this by one x-axis step (i.e. x(n)-x(n-1)). This formula is sort-of the definition, and it doesn't matter which side of the x-axis your are on. (I say "sort-of" here, since the slope is a limit of this equation as you sample bins get very close together, so this equation is an approximation, and other approximations can be used.) Keep in mind that the slope of noisy data will look even more noisy. I suspect the first few paragraphs of the slope page on wikipedia will help you out with this.
