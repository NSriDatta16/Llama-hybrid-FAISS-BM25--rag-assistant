Cross Browser Issue

My background is in WinForms programming and I'm trying to branch out a bit. I'm finding cross-browser issues a frustrating barrier in general, but have a specific one that I just can't seem to work through. I want to display an image and place a semi-transparent bar across the top and bottom. This isn't my ultimate goal, of course, but it demonstrates the problem I'm having in a relatively short, self-contained, code fragment so let's go with it. The sample code below displays as intended in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. In IE8, the bar at the bottom doesn't appear at all. I've researched it for hours but just can't seem to come up with the solution. I'm sure this is some dumb rookie mistake, but gotta start somewhere. Code snippet... .workarea { position: relative; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #ccc; overflow: hidden; cursor: move; -moz-user-focus: normal; -moz-user-select: none; unselectable: on; } .semitransparent { filter: alpha(opacity=70); -moz-opacity: 0.7; -khtml-opacity: 0.7; opacity: 0.7; background-color: Gray; }
