It's a heat map, where "hotter" means "higher values". They are very useful for studying CNNs, since they let you see what each convolutional filters see in each image. Some filters are activated with vertical lines, other with diagonal or with round shapes... the deeper you go into the network, the more complex are the things each layer is looking for. Heatmaps of activations let you do that.
