How to model which fixed effect is most responsible for variation in the DV?

Let's say I have data on firm revenue among multinational firms. I want to test the question of what explains more variation in revenue: firm culture or country-culture. A bit confused as to the best way to model this. Should I run a mixed effects model with random intercepts for firm and country? Should I simply add fixed effects for firm and country and compare the average sum of squares for each model?
