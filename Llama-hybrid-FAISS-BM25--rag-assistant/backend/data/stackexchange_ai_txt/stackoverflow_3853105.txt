Assuming that the LEFT OUTER joins are necessary (of which I'm not convinced), then you want the list of agents not in the list you obtained above. Hence: SELECT agents.agentid, agents.firstname, agents.lastname FROM agents WHERE agentid NOT IN (SELECT agents.agentid FROM agents LEFT JOIN schedule USING (agentid) LEFT JOIN projects USING (projectid) WHERE (projects.locationid = 51) ) ORDER BY agentid; Clearly, if you want to know which projects these agents have been involved in, then you reinstate the joins into the FROM clause of the outer query.
