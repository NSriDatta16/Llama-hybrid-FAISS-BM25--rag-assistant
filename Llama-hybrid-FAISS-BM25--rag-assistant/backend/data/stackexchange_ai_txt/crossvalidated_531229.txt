Decomposition of a time series based on another time series

I have a general question about decomposition of time series. I have a time series for electricity consumption of one building in hourly resolution for 1 year. This building also has an air conditioner. As you can imagine the electricity consumption of the air conditioner strongly depends on the outside temperature while other electrical appliances in the household (like TV or washing machine) might not depend (or just to a lesser degree) on the temperature. Now my question is whether it is generally possible to decompose the time series of the electricity consumption into a time series that is dependant on the outside temperature (of course the 'external' time series of the outside temperature is given) and into another time series that in independant from the outside temperature? So at the end I would like to have 2 time series instead of 1. One of those should have a high correlation with the outside temperature whereas the other should not. Do you have any idea if this is possible and what kind of methods are suitable for such a task. Reminder : Does anyone have an idea. I'd appreciate every comment and would be quite thankful for your help.
