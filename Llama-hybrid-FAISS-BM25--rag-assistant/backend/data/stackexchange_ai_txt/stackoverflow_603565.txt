What I discovered is that it can be done since the people at http://www.aspnetflash.com/ when you drag and drop to the website area it doesn't add a separate swf file. I decided to use their tool instead. I tried JW Player and FlowPlayer and there was another SWF stand alone. When I used them in an ASP webpage it always came out blank, every path set up correctly. I also added the mime types to the IIS Server and Default Website. I tried the HTTP handler FlashSomething that is mentioned on some sites but no luck.
