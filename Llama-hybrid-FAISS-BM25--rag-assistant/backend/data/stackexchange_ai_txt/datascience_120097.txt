Since PGN is longer and possible harder to process, you should wonder whether it transports more information than FEN. In this case, the question is: does it matter in which way you reached the current board positions? Does it influence the next move? There are only two situation that come to my mind: Castling: (neither king nor rook may have moved, previously) Threefold repetition At least the first one could easily be covered by an additional flag. In general, existing notions might not be best suited for neural networks. If you just want to cover the current board position, I would decide for a fixed-size input, e.g. store for each field, what figure is placed on it. You might then for example encode the figure with one-hot-encoding. that would give you 8x8x(#figures) as input. An approach like this will make live easier for you. If you aim to store history then PGN (or something similar but in a numeric format) would be a suitable input. But then you might have to deal with input of dynamic length.
