Signal classification with convolution neural network

I want to classify 8 noisy signals with trainNetwork () function that is available in Matlab. All Matlab examples were for image classification. The arguments are the data and its label, the CNN layers, in which the first layer is imageInputLayer([32 32 3]) . My question is can this function be used to classify 1-D signals? if yes, how can we create such a layer?
