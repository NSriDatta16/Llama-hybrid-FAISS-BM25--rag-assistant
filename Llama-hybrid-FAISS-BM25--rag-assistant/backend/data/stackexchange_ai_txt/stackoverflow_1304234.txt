The rect passed to drawRect is the rect that the system is asking you to draw (dirtyRect) in your view's coordinate system. It can be self.bounds, or it can be a different rect. Generally, you should simply ignore the parameter and draw yourself in self.bounds, unless your drawing is very complex. Paying attention to the dirtyRect parameter passed in is an optimisation which should be ignored until you've profiled your app and determined it is a hot spot.
