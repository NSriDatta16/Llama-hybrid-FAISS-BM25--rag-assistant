What would be my features?

I was thinking of training a neural network that would be able to classify twitter users according to their followers. For example, I would like to know if a user is "gamer" or not by the people he follows. Have a dataset of people who are gamers or not and train them based on that. The problem that I find is that the number of followers of each person will vary ... One person could follow thousands of users while another could only follow hundreds, so how can I determine my feature there? Any suggestion? How could I do this? This is in the way I am representing the data, so you can understand the problem of the features I was referring to I did not know very well if asking this on StackOverflow, I have finally come here, it is the first time I post here, I hope it is the right place. Thank you.
