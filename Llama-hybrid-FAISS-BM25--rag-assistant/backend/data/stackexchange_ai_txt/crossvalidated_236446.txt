How to Calculate Expected Value While Accounting for Historical Skill Level

Let's say there is a skill based contest that has 1,000 people competing in it. No one player can manipulate another players outcome. You competed in this contest type 10,000 times and your historical average is that you finish in the top 40%. How would you calculate the "expected value" of competing in this contest if the parameters were as follows: 1st through 300th place receive a prize amount of \$10. The cost to enter the contest is $5. I know the way to calculate the expected value without taking into account the fact that you historically finish in the top 40% would be: (30% chance of winning X \$10 prize) + (70% chance of losing X -\$5 loss) = -$0.05 expected value However , how do you calculate the expected value of this contest when taking into account that you historically finish in the top 40% because of your skill level?
