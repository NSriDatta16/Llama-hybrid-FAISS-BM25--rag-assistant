Updating non-entity data via stored procedure and LINQ to SQL is very straightforward. Just drag the stored procedure from Server Explorer onto empty space in the DBML designer (so it won't try to return entity objects) and call the associated generated method in your code like this: myDataContext.MyStoredProcedureMethod(); The action is performed immediately, so you don't need to call SubmitChanges(). To wrap this call (or loop, or whatever) in a LINQ to SQL transaction, see the instructions and examples here for how to use LINQ to SQL transactions.
