What you want is a space-filling-curve for example a hilbert curve. It fills your grid with a continous line separating each square by only 1 bit. Because the nature of a sfc is to recursivley fill the space and maintain a neighborhood you can exploit this and place the picture along the line. If you don't want to place the same picture in the direct neighboorhood you can use a depth-seach on the sfc on each node eliminates copies.
