Testing User Controls that utilize a presenter which in turn utilizes wcf services

I have basic WinForm user controls (view) whose intilization includes a presenter and model. The presenter includes calls to a wcf service. Recently an error has croped up that is very trying. Whenever I drag and drop one of these controls onto my design surface I am presented with an error that the endpoint with name "yadda" could not be found. This same behavior occurs if I try to run the usercontrol test container. If however, I comment out the intialization, add the control to my form, save the form, go to the control and uncomment the intialization, build, and then run my app evrything works fine. All my controls are in a Presentation project which has a reference to anothe rproject that containts the presenters and the models as well as a servic reference to my wcf service. I am hoping someone out that encountered similar difficulties and will have some advise. Thanks
