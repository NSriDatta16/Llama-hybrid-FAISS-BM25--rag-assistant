I'll treat this as self-study , and I'd encourage you to read its wiki and add the tag. Your argument is already very good. Here are a few pointers. Feel free to write a comment so we can discuss and work towards a good answer. I assume you are looking at Pearson's correlation, right? (Does your argument work for other measures of correlation?) What does a perfect correlation mean graphically ? What will $X+Y$ and $X-Y$ look like graphically if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly Pearson-correlated?
