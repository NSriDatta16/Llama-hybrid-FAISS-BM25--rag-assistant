Average treatment effect using relative risk difference?

So I'm designing a RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention. For my analysis I've decided to look at three different things. 1) the point prevalence of smoking cessation at each follow-up time-point 2) The relative risks of smoking cessation in the intervention and control arm respectively (estimated through Odds ratios from logistic regression) 3) I want to estimate the average treatment effect and this is were my question comes in, am I right to assume that if I take the risk difference (from the RR I get from my logistic regression) than this is essentially the average treatment effect?
