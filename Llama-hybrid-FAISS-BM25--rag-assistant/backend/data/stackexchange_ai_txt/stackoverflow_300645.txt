I don't know about code coverage tools, but ruby has a mutation tester called heckle. Mutation testing involves changing the code being tested and seeing if those mutations cause the unit tests to fail. Unfortunately, the latest official gem (version 1.4.1) has some bugs in it, so you may wish to build a gem using code from the development branch. It can only mutate instance methods. I'm not sure how reliable the development branch version is either. Mutation testing should be avoided if the code being tested may potentially destroy the system (eg deleting files). You may want to read a FAQ about heckle and a FAQ question mentioning rcov versus heckle .
