What does it mean to freeze or unfreeze a model?

I'm going over the fast.ai course on deep learning now, and there's frequent calls to freeze / unfreeze methods in the lesson notebooks. The docs are a little sparse on details of what this means, though. The docstrings just read Freeze up to last layer. and Unfreeze entire model. Based on my current programming knowledge, my educated guess is that it makes the model im/mutable, so it can be used with the learning rate finder without changing it. But that is still a guess. Very grateful to anyone who can clarify this for me!
