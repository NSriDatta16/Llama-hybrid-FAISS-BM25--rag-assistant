Also check out Michael Stonebraker's C-store: C-store (includes links to source code and research paper) The paper contains an excellent viewpoint on column oriented databases, that should answer most of your questions. To quote the paper, "Most major DBMS vendors implement record-oriented storage systems, where the attributes of a record (or tuple) are placed contiguously in storage. With this row store architecture, a single disk write suffices to push all of the fields of a single record out to disk. Hence, high performance writes are achieved, and we call a DBMS with a row store architecture a write-optimized system. In contrast, systems oriented toward ad-hoc querying of large amounts of data should be read-optimized. Data warehouses represent one class of read-optimized system, in which periodically a bulk load of new data is performed, followed by a relatively long period of ad-hoc queries. Other read-mostly applications include customer relationship management (CRM) systems, electronic library card catalogs, and other ad-hoc inquiry systems. In such environments, a column store architecture, in which the values for each single column (or attribute) are stored contiguously, should be more efficient. This efficiency has been demonstrated in the warehouse marketplace by products like Sybase IQ [FREN95, SYBA04], Addamark [ADDA04], and KDB [KDB04]. In this paper, we discuss the design of a column store called C-Store that includes a number of novel features relative to existing systems."
