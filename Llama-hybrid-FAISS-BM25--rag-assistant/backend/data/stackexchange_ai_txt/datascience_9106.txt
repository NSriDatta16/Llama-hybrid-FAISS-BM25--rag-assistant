Given multivariate data split into several subsamples (classes) the analysis finds linear combinations of variables, called discriminant functions, which discriminate between classes and are uncorrelated. The functions are applied then to assign old or new observations to the classes. Discriminant analysis is both dimensionality reduction and classification technique.
