From wiki "Given a data set, several candidate models may be ranked according to their AIC values. From the AIC values one may also infer that e.g. the top two models are roughly in a tie and the rest are far worse. Thus, AIC provides a means for comparison among modelsâ€”a tool for model selection. AIC does not provide a test of a model in the usual sense of testing a null hypothesis; i.e. AIC can tell nothing about how well a model fits the data in an absolute sense. Ergo, if all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that." Thus the AIC should bot be used to do model selection. After reading up on DLM it appears to me that this approach is MODEL-BASED rather than DATA-BASED. One is assuming a model when using DLM. A DLM model uses a mixture of high order polynomials in time and fixed trigonometric structures which might be useful for certain physical time series. This approach does not lend itself to generating a set of residuals free of structure which meet the Gaussian requirements. A useful alternative is to form the model empirically detecting as needed any auto-projective structure, any deterministic structure (Pulses, level Shifts, Seasonal Pulses and.or Local Time Trends via INTERVENTION DETECTION also referred to as OUTLIER DETECTION.
