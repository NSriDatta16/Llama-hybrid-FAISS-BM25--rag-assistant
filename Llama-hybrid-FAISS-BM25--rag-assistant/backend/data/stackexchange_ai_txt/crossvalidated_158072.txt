It depends on your model / views. For a given time series with a timespan $T$ , you can consider that you observe $T$ realizations of a given random variable $X$ , or you can consider that you observe one realization of a stochastic process that is one path among many others. If you consider an independent identically distributed random process, these are the same. It is not clear whether $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n$ represents the $n$ variables of your random process and thus a single time series, or $n$ time series each represented by a single random variable $Y_i$ , and therefore your time series data is a matrix $n \times T$ , i.e. a time series for each $Y_i$ with $T$ realizations. As long as you are consistent, it is up to you to choose your model.
