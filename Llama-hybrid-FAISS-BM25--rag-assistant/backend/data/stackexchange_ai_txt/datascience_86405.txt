NLP CounterVectorizer (sklearn), not able to get it to fit my code

I was starting an NLP project and simply get a "CountVectorizer()" output anytime I try to run CountVectorizer.fit on the list. I've had the same issue across multiple IDE's, and different code. I've looked online, and even copy and pasted other codes with their lists and I receive the same CountVectorizer() output. My code is as follows: cv = CountVectorizer() messages = ['This is a good product', 'It was a bit pricey for what it does', 'I found good value here'] cv.fit(messages) **output -----> CountVectorizer()** I'm really stumped on this issue. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Update: This seems to be a local issue as I am able to get it to fit on Colab. If anyone can suggest what might be going on I'd be estatic.
