Windows Azure role is state full or not

According to MSDN, an azure service can conatins any number of worker roles. According to my knowledge a worker role can be recycled at any time by Windows Azure Fabric. If it is the true, then: Worker role should be state less OR Worker role should persist its state to Windows Azure storage services. But i want to make a service which conatains client data and do not want to use Azure storage service. How I can accomplish this?
