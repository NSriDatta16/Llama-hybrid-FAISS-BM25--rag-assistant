If you're talking about building a web application with rich interactive features on the client, there are 3 mainstream options: Flash-based - but your app won't run on an iPad. Silverlight - the plugin needed is not as widely adopted as Flash, even Microsoft has been deprecating this recently for web apps. HTML - Web 2.0 was all about using native HTML + JavaScript to build rich applications in a web browser. For my money, HTML is far and away the most interesting platform. It has the most activity and is rapidly becoming more standardized across browsers. HTML5 adds support for features like local storage and background processing. Google Chrome now even has a 3D graphics library (WebGL) - Firefox soon to come. If I were you, I'd be focusing on learning the HTML(5) stack - HTML, CSS, CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, and looking at open source frameworks like backbone.js, jQuery mobile, JQTouch, angular.js, etc. I follow many of these projects on GitHub - you can see the larger list here: https://github.com/mckoss/following Your rich web app likely needs some sort of server-side infrastructure to support it. Ruby on Rails is probably the most popular framework and super easy to get started. Heroku can host your app for you very easily and in a scalable manner. If you have a lot of Java code already (I'm not a Java fan, myself) - Google's GWT is a very nice framework for building apps in pure Java, and it cross-compiles the client-side bits to JavaScript. I personally like Python on the server side - Google App Engine provides a very nice option that is scalable and simple to program against (using the Django framework on Google App Engine is the best option here for non-trivial apps). And, if I might suggest something new that I've been working on - Pageforest.com provides a pure JavaScript web-app platform. You write ALL your code in client-side JavaScript, and use AJAX/REST to sign-in users and save data to the Pageforest server (this service is open and free for developers). Good luck!
