Reloading Data in a UITableView when pressing a UITabBarItem

I have a UITabBarController as part of my app delegate and I want to trap when the user touches a specific tab (the favourites) and force the table within it to reload the data. What would be best practice in this instance? I have added the UITabBarDelegate protocol to my app delegate and implemented the didSelectViewController method. So far so good. Within the method I get a viewController, so I can check its title, etc. to determine which tab is selected. How can I then send a reloadData message to the UITableView in the viewController? I tried creating a method in my FavouritesViewController class and calling that but it does not work. Example code: #pragma mark UITabBarController delegate methods - (void)tabBarController:(UITabBarController *)tabBarController didSelectViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController { // If the favourites tab is pressed then reload the data if (viewController.title = @"Favourites") { if ([viewController respondsToSelector:@selector(reloadFavourites:)]) { [viewController reloadFavourites]; } } }
