Charles Ragin has created a statistical procedure (QCA, or Qualitative Comparative Analysis) for the analysis of necessity and sufficiency in his 2008 book, 'Redesigning Social Inquiry'. But it relies on set relationships, not regression. Roughly put, it uses two parameters to identify sufficient causes: consistency (the proportion of cases that have the purported causal condition that also have the outcome); and coverage (the proportion of cases that have the outcome that also have the purported causal condition). This can be applied to datasets with continuous variables through calibrating these variables into fuzzy set scores and following the procedure that Ragin describes. He has also provided software to carry out this type of analysis, while others have written a QCA package for use in R. See http://www.compasss.org/ for more information.
