Its hard to give a definitive answer.. apart from trying out somethings and hope that some of them stick Avoid local islands of knowledge - PairProgramming might work. If A signs up for a Task in an area where X has some expertise or clock-time, he could ask X to pair with him. The process of implementing the task spreads things in X's head, is a real-time code review and helps raise average team skill/expertise/code familiarity. It also encourages people to talk to each other instead of holing up.. Dynamic pace of tech evolution - Fact of Life... need to get used to it. Using Developer Forums, Lunchbox forums, Brown Bag Sessions, Wikis, Book Clubs, Online forums, etc could work. Depends on what the individuals in your team pick as their preferred means of ingestion. Work on feedback... if the team feels that they are benefiting from the developer forums, they will sustain it. If it dies out, think about why it didn't stick.. try something else with lessons learned.. Slack - an often missed aspect. Ensure that people have time to help someone out.. not perenially running behind a deadline. Create an environment that encourages and facilitates people speaking out.. helping out others.. and then leave it to the individuals to gel together. Good Luck.
