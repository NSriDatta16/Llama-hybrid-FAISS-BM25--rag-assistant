When adding a string to the database, I'm escaping it with mysql_real_escape_string() and the following gets stored in the database: underline No it's not. When you escape strings in a sql query, it is only to transport the data in the query. The database parses the query and stores the data in the database, without any extra slashes. Thus, when you retrieve data from the database, you should not unescape anything. It's a common misconception. If you find that there are excess slashes in the output, you probably have magic quotes turned on. Turn them off . Edit: mysql> create table foo (bar text) ; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec) mysql> INSERT INTO foo (bar) VALUES (" underline "); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) mysql> SELECT * FROM foo; +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | bar | +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | underline | +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) As you can see, the query has one more level of escaping than the data appears within the database and consequently how it comes out when querying for it. In your case, what is probably going on, is that you have magic quotes turned on and then you escape strings before embedding them in a query. This leads to double-escaping, tampering your data. The proper solution is to keep escaping strings as you do, but turn off magic quotes. And don't do anything on the data as it comes out of the database. Beware that data already in the system needs to be cleaned up first.
