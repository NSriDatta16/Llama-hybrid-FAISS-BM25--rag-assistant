Measuring latency

I'm working on a multiplayer project in Java and I am trying to refine how I gather my latency measurement results. My current setup is to send a batch of UDP packets at regular intervals that get timestamped by the server and returned, then latency is calculated and recorded. I take number of samples then work out the average to get the latency. Does this seem like a reasonable solution to work out the latency on the client side?
