Just for clarity, setting mtry=nvar means that you're Bagging trees, and no longer using Random Forests. Also, both Bagging and RF should be used with very deep trees (in the original version, fully grown unpruned trees), so requesting 4 terminal nodes does not really make sense. To make this work I also wanted mtry=# variables, so all variables would have a chance at being the child of the root variable. If you want to give all variables a chance to play a role in tree structure, you want to set a rather low value of mtry . Otherwise, from the way the CART algorithm works, the splits of all trees will be made on the exact same variables (this is even more true if your trees are shallow). In Bagging trees, the extreme case where mtry=nvar , a major issue is that all trees resemble each other so much that their predictions are very correlated. This is for this very reason that Breiman introduced Random Forests.
