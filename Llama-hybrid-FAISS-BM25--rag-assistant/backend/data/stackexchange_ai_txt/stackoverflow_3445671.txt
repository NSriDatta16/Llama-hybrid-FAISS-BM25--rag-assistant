How do I get unit tests to run continuously in Visual Studio

Maybe I'm using unit tests in the wrong way, but I have a very large database with a lot of data. Each set of data presents a different scenario and the number of scenarios is too large to individually test. Therefore, I've decided the best way to get adequate coverage is to run the unit test against the data as many times as I could, and see if it will break and if it does, work out why it's happening. The problem is in Visual Studio 2008, I can't figure out how to run a unit test more than once. Is that possible? Is it possible to tell VS2008 to run and re-run my unit tests continuously over the course of a period of time.
