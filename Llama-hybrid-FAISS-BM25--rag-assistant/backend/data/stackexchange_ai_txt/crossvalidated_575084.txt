You need to calculate the payout ratio. From this case you 1 in 100 chance of drawing the \$100 bill so that average payout ratio is \$1. (win once, lose 99 times). So in this case with multiple different payouts: \$100 * 1% = \$1 \$20 * 5% = \$1 \$10 * 10% = \$1 \$1 * 84% = \$0.84 So summing up all of these values equals \$3.84. This is the predictive long term average of every play. Since the payout is less than the investment, it is not a very good game. Note this payout ratio is better than most lotteries.
