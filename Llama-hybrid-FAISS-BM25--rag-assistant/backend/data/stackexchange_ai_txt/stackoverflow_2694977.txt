Best practices for packaging resources (jpg's, sound, video) in an iPhone app?

I'm a newb iPhone developer writing an app that has several large JPGs and sound files. Everything works ok if I drag these non-code resources into my project. But I am wondering if this is the right way to package my app. In Windows development, I would create a "resource DLL" that keeps the .exe size small. What is the equivalent for iPhone? I think I should be creating a "bundle" - can someone please give me some pointers to using these and how to link them into my main project? Thanks!
