I think the best example of what JavaFX can do is in the examples on JavaFX.com. However, it's still early in the JavaFX days thus you will be in pioneer days. Which means there are potential rich rewards to be had, but also - many unknowns. What I think JavaFX "sweet-spots" are: 1 - If you either have Photoshop skills or are collaborating with someone who is - JavaFX provides the only real platform that lets you take Photoshop and generate a UI. Normally you mock-up in Photoshop and try your best to replicate, JavaFX can leverage it natively. 2 - You get all of the goodies from Java libraries "for free". 3 - Can leverage the UI skills to mobile (those that JavaFX will run on anyway). However, if you are just wanting to have a Java GUI but would rather wait for more polish on JavaFX - I would recommend grabbing MigLayout & go with Swing on Java 6u10 or later.
