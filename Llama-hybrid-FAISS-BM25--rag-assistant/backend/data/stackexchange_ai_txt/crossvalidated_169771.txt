In my experience, this depends entirely on your data. If you have little data, then logistic regression may be the best you can do (since you don't have enough data to detect interaction and similar effects). If you have a lot of data, I personally would rather look at a Random Forest, which should find interactions, nonlinearities etc. However, if the underlying data generating process is actually rather simple, then a logistic regression may be more parsimonious and better in predicting than an RF, even for a large dataset. The problem is that you don't know in advance what the DGP is (because if you knew, you wouldn't be modeling). So: it all depends on the data. Finally, combining classifiers often improves accuracy over single classifiers, even over the most accurate single ones. So think about combining logistical regression, RFs, SVM and so forth and see whether that helps.
