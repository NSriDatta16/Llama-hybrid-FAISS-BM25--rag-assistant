How to interpret rank bar plot of a MCMC trace?

I am learning how to use PyMC for Bayesian inference. I coded up a random intercept $Y = \gamma + \sum_{j=1}^3 \beta_j \mathbb{I}_j + \epsilon$ and looked at the trace plots. Here is a graphviz visualization of the model's structure. Out of curiosity I tried kind="rank_bars" in arviz.plot_trace . Here is the output. And here is a closer look at the beta params' rank bar plot. What diagnostic information about the MCMC simulation do these plots tell me about the simulation? What would it look like if something was working/not working?
