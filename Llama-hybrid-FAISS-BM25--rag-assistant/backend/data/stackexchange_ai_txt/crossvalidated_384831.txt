Seeking origin of variance equation

In my data science textbook, it says that the variance of a variable $Y$ can be written as: $v_y = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^{n} y_k^{T} y_k$ , I have never seen variance defined like this before. Could someone provide some insights into this definition (i.e., why it is valid to define variance like this?)
