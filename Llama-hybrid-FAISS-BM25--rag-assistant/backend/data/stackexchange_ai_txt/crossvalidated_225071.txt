Statistics has been around and has much more concrete definition and math theory than "data science". I am in the data science market myself. But data science doesn't have a concrete definition yet. It is a cocktail of statistics and computer science. I am a bit irked by the notion of a more sophisticated approach than a t-test. 1) A t-test is very sophisticated, and I would suggest you employ it for your websites 2) When you make a model of the previous data and predict what could have been with what is, you are effectively comparing whether or not your real value falls inside the variance of your predicted values. Falling within variance, is... t-test. And I think it is an overkill, as you might be making more assumptions than necessary, leading to more errors. 3) If you want to assess the effects of multiple factors, try ANOVA and f-statistics, learn about them here .
