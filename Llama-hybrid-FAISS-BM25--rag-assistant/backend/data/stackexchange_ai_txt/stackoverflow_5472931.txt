Hi there I did some modifications in your code Here . I only did modify the first 4 or 5 options, you'll have to modify the remaining code yourself. The major problem is that when you clone, the class and name remain the same for each element. Then you only initialized values and operand object one time in ( $(document).ready ), so that's why you kept modifying the same element. In my code, I did look for the next element of the clicked arg. But I think you should organize a little bit more your code, using for examples would allow you to be more precise using the request. Instead of using next you could use a search in div children for example. Well I hope you see the way it should work.
