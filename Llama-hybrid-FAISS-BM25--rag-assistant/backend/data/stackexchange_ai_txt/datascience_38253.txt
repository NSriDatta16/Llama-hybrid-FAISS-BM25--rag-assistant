A classification machine learning flow chart implimenting dimentionality reduction, upsampling, and cross validation

I would like to make a flow chart for an ML classifier and make sure that my thinking is correct. Here is a little about my sample: I have 3 classes and about 160 features. I suspect that some of those features are redundant. My classes are imbalanced. Please let me know if I should provide more info about the sample. This is my first try on tackling a machine learning problem. Based on checking the functionality of each of the options I use below, I chose it in that specific order, but i might be wrong. Could someone just let me know if this flow chart is logical, and if there was a problem in any of the step, could you possible tell me why it is not supposed to be there? Flow chart Get the data Make it in a readable format and import it Split the data into train/test Standardize with StandardScalar Perform PCA on train data Perform K-fold cross-validation on train data Apply SMOTE Predict (Using SVC) Make a confusion matrix Perform GridSearchCV Perform PermutationImportance
