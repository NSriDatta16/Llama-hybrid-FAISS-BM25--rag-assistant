A colleague working in Economic History and I addressed precisely this problem, except we did not have time alignment problems (we did have a missing data problem, instead). We wrote a paper that you might want to peruse in case something seems applicable to your problem: Castroviejo, P. and Tusell, F. (2007) Using redundant and incomplete time series for the estimation of cost of living indices, Review of Income and Wealth , vol. 53 , p. 673-691. Essentially, we considered the true unobserved price as an element of the state vector in a suitable state-space model.
