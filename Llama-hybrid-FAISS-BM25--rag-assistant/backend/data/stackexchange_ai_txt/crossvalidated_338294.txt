An ARIMA model is simply a weighted average of the past. It answers the double question: How many period (k)should I use to compute a weighted average and precisely what are the k weights. It answers the maiden's prayer to determine how to adjust to previous values (and previous values ALONE) in order to come up with a "best guess" for future periods.
