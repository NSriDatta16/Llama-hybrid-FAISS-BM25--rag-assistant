While I haven't encountered a dedicated deep learning library for R, I have run into a similar discussion out on r-bloggers. The discussion centers on using RBM (Restricted Boltzman Machines). Take a look at the following link-- http://www.r-bloggers.com/restricted-boltzmann-machines-in-r/ (reposted from 'alandgraf.blogspot.com') The author actually does a really good job of encapsulating a self-implemented algorithm in R. It must be said that I have not yet vetted the validity of the code but at least there is a glint of deep learning starting to show in R. I hope this helps.
