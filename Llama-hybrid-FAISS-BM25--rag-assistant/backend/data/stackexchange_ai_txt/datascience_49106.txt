Problems with class embedding in keras

I am doing a toy example with mushroom dataset to learn class embedding with keras: I am trying to embed a single feature: inputs = Input(shape=[1]) emb = Embedding(input_dim=cap_shape_dummy.shape[1], output_dim=3)(inputs) output = Dense(units=1,activation='sigmoid')(emb) model = Model(inputs=inputs,outputs=output) However I always receive the same error when I try to fit the model: Error when checking target: expected dense_2 to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (8124, 1) Am I doing anything wrong? Did I miss anything with category embedding? Thanks.
