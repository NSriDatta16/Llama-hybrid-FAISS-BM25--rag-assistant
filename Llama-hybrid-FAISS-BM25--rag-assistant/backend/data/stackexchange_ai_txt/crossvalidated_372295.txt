Distribution of *conditional* frequencies when frequencies follow a Dirichlet distribution

Context : we have a large number of individuals characterized by two binary traits; call these $T$ with values $\{0,1\}$ , and $T'$ with values $\{0',1'\}$ . So there are four types of individuals: $00'$ , $01'$ , $10'$ , $11'$ , which appear in the population with unknown relative frequencies $f_{00'}$ , $f_{01'}$ , $f_{10'}$ , $f_{11'}$ summing up to one. Suppose that our degree of belief about these frequencies (assumed continuous) is expressed by a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $(Aa_{00'}, Aa_{01'}, Aa_{10'}, Aa_{11'})$ , the $a$ s summing up to one: $$\mathrm{p}[f_{00'}, f_{01'}, f_{10'}, f_{11'} \mid A, (a_{00'}, a_{01'}, a_{10'}, a_{11'})] \propto \prod_{i=0}^1\prod_{j'=0'}^{1'} f_{ij'}^{A a_{ij'}-1}\;\delta\bigl({\textstyle\sum_{ij'}}f_{ij'}-1\bigr).$$ We can also consider the marginal frequencies of individuals having trait $T'$ only, for example: $f_{0'} \equiv f_{00'} + f_{10'}$ and $f_{1'} \equiv f_{01'} + f_{11'}$ . Owing to the "aggregation" property of the Dirichlet distribution (Kotz & al 2000, also Basu & al 1982), these marginal frequencies also have a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\bigl(A(a_{00'} + a_{10'}), A(a_{01'} + a_{11'})\bigr)$ (a Beta distribution). Question : Consider now the conditional frequencies of trait $T$ given $T'$ , for example $$f_{1\mid 0'} \equiv \frac{f_{10'}}{f_{00'}+f_{10'}}.$$ What distribution expresses our degree of belief about such a conditional frequency, given the context above? While I sit down and calculate (or sample), I'd be grateful for any literature or calculation hints on this. Thank you! Additional motivation : For inference about sequential data, like for example text, speech, genes, some literature express the degree of belief about conditional frequencies $f_{i\mid j}$ (of, say, one word given the previous one) with a Dirichlet distribution (e.g. MacKay & al 1995): $$\mathrm{p}[f_{i \mid j} \mid A, (a_{i\mid j})] \propto \prod_{i} f_{i\mid j}^{A a_{i\mid j}-1}\;\delta\bigl({\textstyle\sum_{i}}f_{i\mid j}-1\bigr), \qquad\text{for every }j.$$ This approach is different from using a Dirichlet distribution for the joint frequencies $f_{ij}$ , and I wonder how different is the distribution for the conditional frequencies that we obtain by assuming Dirichlet for the joint frequencies instead, as in my question above.
