There are several ways to determine correlation between a categorical and a continuous variable. However, I found only one way to calculate a 'correlation coefficient', and that only works if your categorical variable is dichotomous. If your categorical variable is dichotomous (only two values), then you can use the point-biserial correlation . There is a function to do this in the ltm package. library(ltm) # weakly correlated example set.seed(123) x You could do a logistic regression and use various evaluations of it (accuracy, etc.) in place of a correlation coefficient. Again, this works best if your categorical variable is dichotomous. # weakly correlated set.seed(123) x Again, if your categorical data is dichotomous, you could do the two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test . The wilcox.test() function is available in base R. This is a non-parametric variation on the ANOVA. # weakly correlated set.seed(123) x You could also just do an ANOVA on your logit model from earlier. # weakly correlated anova(logit) Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: y Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid.

Dev NULL 31 43.230 mpg 1 13.555 30 29.675 If your categorical variable is not dichotomous, you can use the Kruskal-Wallis test . # weakly correlated set.seed(123) x Finally, you can just inspect your data visually using some boxplots. If your data are weakly correlated, there will be a lot of overlap between the boxes. library(ggplot2) # weakly correlated set.seed(123) y # strongly correlated ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg))
