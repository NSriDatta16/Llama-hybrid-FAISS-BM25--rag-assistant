Running integration tests with Cobertura Maven plugin

I am having trouble getting the Cobertura plugin to run integration tests in Maven. The closest answer to this question I have found is http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCOBERTURA-86 . However, the issue remains an open bug. I tried the configuration suggested by Stevo on 03/Apr/09, it didn't work. My POM org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.3-SNAPSHOT cobertura-integration which is by the way exactly the same as the configuration fragment provided by Stevo.
