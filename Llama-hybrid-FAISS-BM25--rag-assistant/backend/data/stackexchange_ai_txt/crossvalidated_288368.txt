Just to be clear you don't know how many samples were used to calculate the slope, correct? The first thing you need to do it calculate the degrees of freedom of the slope calculation (in simple linear regression this is the number of samples minus 2) The formula for the t-value for the high level of A is $t=\frac{A}{s_E\sqrt{df}}$ From your information $A=-0.2437579$, $s_E=2.197419$, $t=-0.1109292$ Therefore $-0.1109292=\frac{-0.2437579}{2.197419\sqrt{df}}$ Rearranging you get $df=1$ so the slope was calculated from 3 samples. Now to calculate the confidence interval of $A$ use the t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. I trust you know how to use tables to find a t value. For a two tailed distribution with $df=1$ the t-value for 95% coverage is $12.7$ The 95% confidence interval is $\hat{A}\pm t\times s_E= -0.2437579 \pm 12.7\times 2.197419=[-27.66,28.15]$ The confidence interval is very large because there sample size for the regression was 3.
