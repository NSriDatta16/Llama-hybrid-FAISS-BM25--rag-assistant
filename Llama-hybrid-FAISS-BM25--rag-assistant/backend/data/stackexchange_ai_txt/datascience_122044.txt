How to get the relationship between a result and a data

I have big data (at least 10 variables each row and millions of lines) and result (for example if y=0.2 and x=0.4 and z=0.9 so there is a system failure). I need to find the relationship between the data to result (let the system alone learn the connections that led to the result) with machine learning. Where should I start, which models should be studied? Is it deep learning?
