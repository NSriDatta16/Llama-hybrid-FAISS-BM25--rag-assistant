To make the data amenable to machine learning, each row should be an instance and each column should be a feature. You state that you have 68 samples/instances, those are the rows. It is unclear from your description how to structure the 1298 x 4 dimensions. One brute force method is to take the Cartesian product which would result in 5,192 columns/features. The result is a matrix that is 68x5192 and ready for classification. The number of columns/features may be reduced through feature engineering and/or feature selection.
