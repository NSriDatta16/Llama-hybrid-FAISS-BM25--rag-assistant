Deep Learning Variation of NNMF

I'm aware that there are different variations of non negative matrix factorization based on the optimization function and I have read about graph regularized NMF. Is there any method to use deep learning to enhance the NMF results. Why have so many approaches been developed? What makes NMF so difficult?
