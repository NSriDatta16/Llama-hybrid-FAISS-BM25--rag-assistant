Coefficients of dummy variables in a logistic regression

I wanted to know what is the difference between running a multinomial logit regression and a logit regression on a model in which the dependent variable is a dummy with just two levels. My database looks like this Firm Event Year Info Dummy14 Dummy15 Dummy16 1 0 2014 x 1 0 0 1 0 2015 x 0 1 0 1 1 2016 x 0 0 1 2 0 2014 x 1 0 0 2 1 2015 x 0 1 0 3 0 2014 x 1 0 0 3 0 2015 x 0 1 0 3 0 2016 x 0 0 1 4 1 2014 x 1 0 0 Basically, I have analysed some firms for the years 2014-2016, eliminating them if an event happens. I have also added some dummies (equal to 1 if we are in a specific year) to implement a year fixed effects model. The logistic regression is the following: Event ~ Info + Dummy14 + Dummy15 + Dummy16 (I want to check if the info in the year previous to the event are different from the other years) I want to understand the coefficients of the dummies. If Dummy16 is equal to +20, does it mean that the event is more likely to happen in 2016? Is it a percentage? I don't understand the fact that it can be equal to a high number, since both the dependent variable and the dummies can only be equal to 0 and 1. Side note: I don't know if it is relevant, but I invented the coefficient of Dummy16, and, maybe, in this simplified case it can't be equal to +20. So, for the sake of clarity, I will specify that, in my actual database, I have 9 dummies for the years from 2013 to 2021 and the actual coefficients are: Dummy13 = +13 Dummy14 = +23 Dummy15 = +13 Dummy16 = +6 Dummy17 = +0.6 Dummy18 = -25.4 Dummy19 = -51 Dummy20 = -65.8 Dummy21 = -23
