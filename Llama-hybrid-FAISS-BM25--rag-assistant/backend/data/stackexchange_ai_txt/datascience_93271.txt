This is not a data science question and you should try programming stack-exchange instead. But this is happening because of an API mismatch in Python, specifically the type of the GET method of the requests object. It's likely the code snippet you got is from a version that is not python 3.2 or a requests module that is not up to date. I would try to install a compatible version of the requests module from PyPI or make your python version compatible with the snippet.
