I am much more experienced with Cappuccino than GWT, but from the looks of it GWT looks blazingly fast and fairly robust. It is after all backed by a fairly large player in the internet field. The demonstration at Google IO was impressive. Although this might change, GWT apps totally leave Cappuccino in the dust when it comes to load times and deployment size today. That said, I went with Cappuccino for two reasons: first, while GWT is a classical 'good enough' engineering solution, Cappuccino is squarely targeted at 'only the best is good enough' crowd. I believe that with Cappuccino you can achieve a standard rarely seen on the web before. Not only in pretty pixels, but in raw functionality and power where everything just works at a 'desktop quality' level. Drag and drop, undo stack, fluid scrolling and resizing, split panes, and on and on. GWT is catching up, as seen in Google Wave, but it has a long way to go and Google has not traditionally cared much about polish. This is visible, for instance, in Gmail which is still not only drab looking but clunky in the user interaction after this many years. The second reason I went with Cappuccino is that Java drives me insane with its inflexible, ridiculously verbose and unreadable style. But that might only be me.
