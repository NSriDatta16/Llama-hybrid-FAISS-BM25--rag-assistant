As others have noted, this is most likely due to mismatched include guards. If the files you are including are under your control (i.e. not part of a 3rd party closed source library), you could consider replacing the #ifndef et. al. guards (which are used to prevent multiple inclusion) with #pragma once. This will eliminate the possibility of having mismatched preprocessor directives. One caveat of this is that pragma once is non-standard, so it will only work if your compiler supports it.
