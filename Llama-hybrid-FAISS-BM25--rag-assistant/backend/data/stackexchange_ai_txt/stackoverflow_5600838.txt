ContentProvider without SQL

I have two pieces of data that need to be accessed from outside applications and stored. According to documentation ContentProviders are the only possible way, but it also mentions external storage. ContentProviders implement a database-like "interface" and using a database would be extremely unnecessary for two pieces of data. I would rather save them to a file, but using a ContentProvider by implementing the abstract methods is problematic because the methods are structured as database queries. I know that there is nothing specifying that ContentProviders must use a database underneath to store data, but is there any other way to store minimal amount of data that has to be shared to the file system?
