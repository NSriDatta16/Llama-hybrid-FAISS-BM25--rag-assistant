You can get the selection from within your handler, and then you can decide what to do with it: ISelection sel = HandlerUtil.getCurrentSelection(event); if (sel instanceof IStructuredSelection) { // check to see if it's empty first, though Object obj = ((IStructuredSelection)sel).getFirstElement(); // then have a look and see what your selection is. } If you have an IJavaElement, you can walk about the model until you find the point you are looking for. If you have an IFile/IResource, you can use some of the JavaCore methods to get to the java model.
