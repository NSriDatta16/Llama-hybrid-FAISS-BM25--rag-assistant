If I were to reinterpret your description of "deterministic," it sounds more like a longitudinal, "confirmatory" cluster analysis to me -- with the important exception that you haven't explicitly integrated time series considerations into your model. Confirmatory clustering methods are deployed once it is felt that the "space" they are meant to describe has been sufficiently well understood as to obviate the need for exploratory approaches. Speciation-based cladistics is one example of this. Longitudinal cluster solutions are finally getting the attention they deserve in the literature. To the best of my knowledge, the earliest work dates back to the 80s with Pieter Kroonenberg's three-mode algorithms. But there is lots of interesting recent research that involves hidden markov chains, e.g., Steve Scott's papers or Oded Netzer's dissertation article both using HMMs, hierarchical, non-moment based information theoretic approaches such as permutation distribution clustering from Andreas Brandmaier as well as the chapters devoted to longitudinal clustering algorithms in Aggarwal and Reddy's book Data Clustering . The key thing to keep in mind with all of these approaches borrows from Kroonenborg's conceptualization of a multi-mode matrix insofar as you can't have all of the modes moving at the same time. This means that the last thing you want to do is reinitialize the algorithm with each new dataset. Rather, you want to "fix," e.g., two out of three of the modes, allowing the third mode to vary in a kind of experimental "design." In this way, you can more carefully study how the dynamics of change impact a given niche in your data. This approach is recommended regardless of the algorithm employed. * EDIT * Actually, I'm wrong about Kroonenberg's work being the earliest on 3-mode analysis. Ledyard Tucker probably wrote the original article in 1966, Some mathematical notes on three-mode factor analysis .
