Style sheets themselves (or at least CSS) already provide a suitable mechanism for this: User style sheets. A user can set any styles within his user agent, which, if suffixed with the !important rule, override the author's definitions. Furthermore, regarding fonts, authors can specify font families which are user-specified. Those are, among others, serif , sanf-serif and monospace . You can also use the system colors to specify foreground and background colors of elements to ensure contrast, such as background-color: Window; color: WindowText; This would ensure legibility and use of the system-defined colors.
