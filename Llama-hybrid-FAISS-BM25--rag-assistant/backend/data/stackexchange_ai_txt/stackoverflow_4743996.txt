Publicly Available Spam Filter Training Set

I'm new to machine learning, and for my first project I'd like to write a naive Bayes spam filter. I was wondering if there are any publicly available training sets of labeled spam/not spam emails, preferably in plain text and not a dump of a relational database (unless they pretty-print those?). I know such a publicly available database exists for other kinds of text classification, specifically news article text. I just haven't been able to find the same sort of thing for emails.
