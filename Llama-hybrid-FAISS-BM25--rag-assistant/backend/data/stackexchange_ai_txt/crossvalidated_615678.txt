Logistic regression with proportion data (interpretation of the log-odds-ratios, family binomial or quasibinomial, include random intercepts?)

I found this discussion very helpful for the analysis I need to conduct for my thesis: In using the cbind() function in R for a logistic regression on a $2 \times 2$ table, what is the explicit functional form of the regression equation? I am not sure if I understand it right, that the multiple trials that are mentioned in the discussion are done within the same sample? (but I think so) In my case I have a control and a treatment group, and each respondent goes through 4 questions where he/she has to choose between train and plane. I now want to analyse the difference between control and treatment group over all four choices combined. So I think I could use the approach with a weighted logistic regression model and the dependent variable "proportion_train" (which represents how often the train was chosen out of the four choices). I am also not sure about the interpretation of the coefficients of this model then. I know these are most likely the log-odds-ratios (or equivalently differences in log-odds). But do these log-odds-ratios show the probability combined over all trials (which I want to find out), or the per-trial probability? Also, in some other forum someone used "family=quasibinomial" for a logistic regression model with proportion data. How do I find out if for my data I have to use "family=binomial" or "family=quasibinomial"? Or can you in general say that for a weighted logistic regression model with proportion data as dependent variable, the family is binomial? I also read somewhere else that one needs to account for the correlation within the individuals by including random intercepts for the individual IDs (I guess as e. g. in my case the four questions were answered by the same individuals (but different individuals in control and treatment group of course). In the discussion I mentioned above, no one included such a random intercept for the individuals in the weighted logistic regression model (with proportion data as dependent variable), so I am wondering if it's necessary or not? Thanks for your support!
