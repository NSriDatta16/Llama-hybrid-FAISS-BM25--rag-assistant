This is a very important and well-thought out issue on your part. I do think the concept of the sampling distribution is very basic to understanding inference and definitely should be taught. I have taught many introductory statistics courses, particularly in biostatistics. I teach the concept of sampling distribution and have approaches that I think are good but don't really have good feedback to determine how successful I have been with them. Anyway here is what I do. First I try to give a simple definition. The sampling distribution is the distribution that the test statistic would have if the sampling process were repeated many times. It depends on the population distribution that the data are assumed to be generated from. Although I think this is about as simple a definition as I can give I realize, it is not very simple and understanding of the concept will not come immediately in most cases. So follow this up with a basic example that reinforces what is said with the definition. The example I would use is a sample of size $n$ that is independent and identically distributed as a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ . The sample average, which is used as a point estimate or to form a test statistic for the population mean $\mu$ , has a sampling distribution which is normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ /n. Then I would follow this up with an important application, the central limit theorem. In the simplest terms, the central limit theorem says that for many distributions that are not normal, the sampling distribution for the sample mean will be close to a normal distribution when the sample size $n$ is large. To illustrate this take distributions like the uniform (a bimodal distribution would also be good to look at) and show what the sampling distribution for the mean looks like for sample sizes of 3, 4, 5, 10 and 100. The student can see how the shape of the distribution changes from something that does not look normal at all for small $n$ to something that looks very much like a normal distribution for large $n$ . To convince the student that these sampling distributions really do have these shapes have the students conduct simulations generating many samples of various sizes and compute the sample means. Then have them generate histograms for these estimates of the mean. I would also suggest applying a physical demonstration showing how this works using a quincunx board. While doing this you point out how the device generates samples of the sum of independent Bernoulli trials where the probability of going left or right at each level equals 1/2. The resulting stacks at the bottom represent a histogram for this sampling distribution (the binomial) and its shape can be seen to look approximately normal after a large number of balls land at the bottom of the quincunx, a demonstration of the DeMoivre-Laplace version of the central limit theorem through sampling distributions.
