Google Cloud Storage and temporary serving urls

im wondering if its possible to create a temporary serving url for files on Google Cloud Storage. i have a GAE app and i would like to serve bigger video files over google storage for develpers without 'straming' the files over my appengine app like here . i would like to have a temporary seving url in my page which gets generated on request to avoid other pages to embed the videos. is that possible on on google storage? what is the best way to do this? thx
