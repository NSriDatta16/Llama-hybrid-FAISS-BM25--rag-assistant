Visual Source Safe --> TFS Migration

Around here we have been working with a bunch of Visual Source Safe repositories for about 10 years or so. Now I want to get rid of sourcesafe and move on to Team Foundation Server. Do you have any tips or tricks for me before I embark on this migration? What are the things I have to be careful about? I am sure this migration will mean that our working habits have to be modified in some way. Do you think that these changes could be a problem for the organization? Think about a group of about 20 .NET developers in a single site.
