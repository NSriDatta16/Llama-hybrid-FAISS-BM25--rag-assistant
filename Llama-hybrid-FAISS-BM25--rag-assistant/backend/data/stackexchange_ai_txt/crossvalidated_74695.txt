@digdeep, as usual @whuber provided an excellent and comprehensive answer from a statistical view point. I'm not trained in statistics, so take this response with a grain of salt. I have used the response below in my real world practice data, so I hope this is helpful. I'll try to provide a non statistician view of transformation of time series data for Arima modeling. There is no straightforward answer. Since you are interested in knowing which transformation to use, it might be helpful to review why we do transformation.We do transformation for 3 main reasons and there might be ton of other reasons: Transformation makes the data's linear structure more usable for ARIMA modeling. If variance in the data is increasing or changing then transformation of data might be helpful to stabilize the variance in data. Transformation also makes the errors/residuals in ARIMA model normally distributed which is a requirement in ARIMA modeling proposed by Box-Jenkins. There are several data transformations including Box-Cox, Log, square root, quartic and inverse and other transformations mentioned @irishstat. As with all the statistical methods there is no good guidance/answer on which transformation to select for a particular dataset. As the famous statistician G.E.P Box said "All models are wrong but some are useful", this would apply to the transformations as well "All transformations are wrong but some are useful". The best way to choose a transformation is to experiment. Since you have a long time series, I would hold out the last 12 - 24 months, and build a model using all the transformation and see if a particular transformation is helpful at predicting your out of sample data accurately. Also examine the residuals for normality assumption of your model. Hopefully, this would guide you in choosing an appropriate transformation. You might also want to compare this with non-transformed data and see if the transformation helped your model. @whuber's excellent graphical representation of your data motivated me to explore this data graphically using a decomposition method. I might add, R has an excellent decomposition method called STL which would be helpful in identifying patterns that you would normally not notice. For a dataset like this, STL decomposition is helpful in not only selecting an appropriate method for analyzing your data, it might also be helpful in identifying anomalies such as outliers/level shift/change in seasonality etc., See below. Notice that the remainder (irregular) component of the data, looks like there is stochastic seasonality and the variation is not random, there appears to be a pattern. See also change in level of trend component after 2004/2005 that @whuber is refrencing. Hopefully this is helpful. g
