Multinomial logistic regression interpretation in R

I have run a multinomial logistic regression test for the interaction between species of deer, days a camera trap was in the field and type of reaction. The model with the best AIC value was: Coefficients: (Intercept) speciesmuntjac speciesroe speciessika days r -0.7471023 0.6263753 -0.005967869 -0.74253017 -0.05189515 sr 0.6909319 0.5552278 -0.355611180 -0.01622306 -0.03178001 Residual Deviance: 971.6464 AIC: 991.6464 But I also got the following (Intercept) speciesmuntjac speciesroe speciessika days r 0.0071741793 0.17599897 0.9865350 0.2095687 0.08669276 sr 0.0001402185 0.08536257 0.1331651 0.9574258 0.08829020 I'm just wondering if anyone would know what the interaction between species and days is in relation to r (reaction) and sr (strong reaction)? I know I can't reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect of species or days on r or sr but beyond that I'm lost!
