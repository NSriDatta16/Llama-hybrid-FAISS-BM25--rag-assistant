Quickest (Easiest) GUI MFC or C# or QT or?

I have just finished my first real commercial application written in C++ / MFC. The application consisted of agent installed on users workstations which in turn was controlled from a GUI Application on an administrators workstation. I choose C++ / MFC for these reasons. Because I didn't know C# Because I was not sure how long it would take for me to become as productive in a new lanuage Because I did not want the hassle of installing the .NET runtime on workstations some of which might be W2K. Now I am thinking of my second application which will again consist of an agent & a GUI Application. I am happy to continue on the same track with the agent for the reasons above but the GUI application will be much more complicated then the first. The first GUI app took a very long time to develop, was torturous and looked out of date even though it was freshly made. Should I just bite the bullet with .net c# or look into something like QT. TIA.
