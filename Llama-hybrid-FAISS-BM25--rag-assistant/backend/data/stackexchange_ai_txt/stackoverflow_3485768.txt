c# - how to sniff packets in an app without relying on WinPCap?

BACKGROUND : I now understand how to write a C# application that can monitor packets going in/out of the network card on the PC the application is running on. The approach I know relies on http://www.winpcap.org/ being already installed on the PC however, and then I use a C# wrapper such as http://pcapdotnet.codeplex.com/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharppcap/ . QUESTION : My question however, what would I need to do to be able to have a C# application that can sniff packets that does NOT require a 3rd party application/drivers to be pre-installed? CLARIFICATION : That is I really want the application I currently have but without any requirement for me to tell the user to have to go and download/install XYZ prior to being able to use the application. For the purpose of the question assume that automating the download and install of a 3rd party application/drivers is not allowed either. (with WinPCap I'm not sure if you can bundle it, however I believe you're not supposed to in any case unfortunately) thanks
