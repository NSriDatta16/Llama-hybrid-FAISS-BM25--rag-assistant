The main thing to consider is whether you need relational database capabilities (joins, group by, etc.). If so, you'll have to put some thought into how to accomplish those using a non-relational storage solution. If, however, your access looks like "store row #12345" and "retrieve row #12345", you should have an easy time using something like Windows Azure tables. I would recommend Episode 10 of Cloud Cover (a weekly show I'm on) which covers Windows Azure's table storage API: http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Cloud+Cover/Cloud-Cover-Episode-10-Table-Storage-API/
