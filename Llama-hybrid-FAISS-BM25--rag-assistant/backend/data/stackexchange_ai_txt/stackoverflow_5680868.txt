you can get a working example of how to do this here: https://www.samplecode.oracle.com/sf/projects/oracle-parcel-svc/ and we have a webcast series that covers JAX-RS on WLS in Session 4 at this link: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/learnmore/weblogic-javaee6-webcasts-358613.html When you configure your method that you want to return JSON from you have to specify that it produces JSON. Here's one way to do it: @GET @Path("{id}.json") @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON}) public Parcel getParcelById_json(@PathParam("id") int id) { return getParcelById(id); } You also need to put the right HTTP headers in the client in order to specify that it expects a JSON response. Some test clients like SOAP-UI auto-convert JSON to XML such that you can do an XPATH on it, even though the actual transmission of data is JSON.
