Beta regression fitted values

I have a beta regression model in R, have generated predicted (fitted) values based on my data, and plotted lines of those fitted values on a scatter plot of the actual data. I'm most used to GLMMs, and, at least in practice, have been thinking about the beta regression in a similar way. However, the fitted values for this additive-only fixed-effects model are not creating a straight line, nor are the slopes the same between groups. I was expecting the fitted values to show the same slope, with different intercepts per group. Was that the wrong expectation? Or does this suggest there is an issue with either my data or implementation? About the data: y = a 0 to 1 proportion value of [# individuals in an experiment plot on a vegetation type]/[# individuals found across vegetation types within that plot] x_coverage = a 0 to 1 proportion value of [amount of a vegetation type in a plot]/[total amount of vegetation measured in that plot] x_type = a categorical factor of the type of vegetation a measurement was taken on 9 plots in the study (study site was once considered as a random variable, but AICc has me leaving it out), a section of the data: site plot x_type x_coverage y fit S1 1 B 0.143312327 0.916667 0.77496105 S1 2 B 0.102556653 0.931034 0.75413317 S1 3 B 0.107069321 0.738462 0.756502 S2 4 B 0.001628412 0.215385 0.69722273 S3 5 B 0 0.631579 0.69624543 S3 6 B 0.002018163 0.545455 0.69745638 S4 7 B 0.161420819 0.938776 0.78380402 S4 8 B 0.09705228 0.741176 0.7512228 S4 9 B 0.02603157 0.90625 0.711652 S1 1 P 0 0.016667 0.08769793 S1 2 P 0 0 0.08769793 S1 3 P 0 0.015385 0.08769793 S2 4 P 0.083824442 0.338462 0.10871038 S3 5 P 0 0 0.08769793 S3 6 P 0 0 0.08769793 S4 7 P 0 0.020408 0.08769793 S4 8 P 0.44368743 0.223529 0.2531569 S4 9 P 0 0.03125 0.08769793 S1 1 T 0.343765489 0.066667 0.09710628 S1 2 T 0.570017432 0.034483 0.16978323 S1 3 T 0.848919012 0.246154 0.31109899 S2 4 T 0.412763648 0.415385 0.11569752 S3 5 T 0.595125254 0.236842 0.18007354 S3 6 T 0.534252719 0.090909 0.15594049 S4 7 T 0.83374445 0 0.30193773 S4 8 T 0.364015573 0.035294 0.10226738 S4 9 T 0.52603157 0.0625 0.1528916 About the model: gamlss(data=newbyplotvegpred, y ~ x_coverage + x_type, family="BEINF0") Used a zero-inflated hurdle model version of the beta regression (BEINF0), as y contains zero-values (which are fairly believable as real zeros given our methods). Transforming the data and using plain BE changed the fitted values, but not the fact that slopes varied by vegetation type. Double checks with package betareg and glmmtmb give essentially the same results. Predicted values were generated by predict(MODEL, type = "response) . Not specifying type , defaults to values scaled to the predictor vars (as I understand it), and indeed produce same-slope lines. But truly wacky intercepts. Fitted values put into ggplot with geom_point and geom_line ( Any thoughts on what's up with these regression lines I'm plotting. The summary(MODEL) output is sensible, and I feel like that aspect of the our approach has been reasonable. Thank you!
