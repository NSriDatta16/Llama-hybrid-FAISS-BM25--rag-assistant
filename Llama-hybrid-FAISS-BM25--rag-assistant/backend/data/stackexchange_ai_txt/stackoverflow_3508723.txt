Unfortunately the SSRS web services do not support running data subscriptions. If you want to run subscriptions through a web service call, you could expose a web service on a server that runs a sp_start_job command to the SQL Server Agent job for the associated schedule. Sounds dangerous to me, but it is feasible.
