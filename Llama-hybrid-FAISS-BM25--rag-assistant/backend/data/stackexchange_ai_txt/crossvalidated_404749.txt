A few essential packages come to mind that every Python statisticians must know: SciPy , which is based on NumPy, extends NumPy capabilities. You can do linear algebra, probability theory, integral calculus and many more tasks with SciPy. StatsModels - estimating of statistical models, conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. Matplotlib - 2-dimensional static plotting, from histograms and scatterplots to non-Cartesian coordinates graphs Seaborn - high-level API based on matplotlib. It has better default settings for statistical charts, along with a rich collection of visualizations including some complex types like time series, jointplots, and violin diagrams.
