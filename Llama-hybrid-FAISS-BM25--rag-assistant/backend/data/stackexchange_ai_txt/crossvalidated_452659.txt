Relation between causal mediation model and regular GLM in R

In the vignette for the 'mediation' R package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediation/vignettes/mediation.pdf ), the authors state that when "the outcome is binary all estimated effects are expressed as the increase in probability" of the outcome. So the total effect of 0.07447 below indicates that compared to untreated, treatment increases the probability of the outcome by 7.4%. When I run GLM, however, the estimate does not mirror the total effect from this causal mediation analysis. THe estimate is 0.4690. Exponentiation gives an OR of 1.33, which means that a 33% increase chance of the outcome is attributable to treatment compared to no treatment. Why does the total effect of treatment in causal mediation analysis not correspond to the total effect in a logistic regression? Note: the original example from the vignette uses the probit link function. I tried this all with probit regression and still see major differences. data(framing) med.fit |z|) (Intercept) -0.8256 0.1548 -5.333 9.65e-08 *** treat 0.4690 0.2910 1.612 0.107 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 336.89 on 264 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 334.33 on 263 degrees of freedom AIC: 338.33 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 ```
