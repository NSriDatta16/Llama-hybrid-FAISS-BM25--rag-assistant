One of the talks at the Selenium Conference this weekend talked about Selenium Grid 2. It is on track and will be released with Selenium 2, including the next Beta (Beta 4). It is going to be more robust than Grid 1. In fact the hope is that it replaces RC, which would essentially become a grid of 1. You can read about it in the fifth paragraph of this blog post covering the conference .
