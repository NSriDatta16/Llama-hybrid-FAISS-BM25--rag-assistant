View your crash log using Organizer and it should not look nearly so mysterious. There are tools to interpret the crash logs from other people running on other devices, but you don't need to jump through hoops to decode ones on your own device when your app crashes. You need to be running the most recently compiled version of your application on your device in order for XCode to be able to decode the symbols for you.
