This adds a new constraint with the name APPL_SRV_STORAGE_APPLICAT_FK1 to the table APPLICATIONS_SRV_STORAGE . The constraint itself is that for every value in the column APPLICATIONS_SRV_STORAGE.APP_ID , there must be a matching value in APPLICATIONS.APP_ID . APPLICATIONS.APP_ID can contain values not contained in APPLICATIONS_SRV_STORAGE.APP_ID . In addition to that, if an APP_ID is deleted from the table APPLICATIONS , then all rows from APPLICATIONS_SRV_STORAGE with the same ID are deleted as well. At creation time, the constraint is enabled (Oracle allows you to disable constraints temporarily).
