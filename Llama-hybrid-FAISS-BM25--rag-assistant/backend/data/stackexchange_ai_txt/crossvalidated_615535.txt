There are a lot techniques for dealing with missing values (multiple imputation, EM, weighting, etc.) However, none of these apply to your situation, as your missing values are not missing values as these techniques understand them. For a value to be missing it first needs to exist. In your case the age of the child just does not exist for people without children, so it cannot be missing. Unfortunately for you, they still have a missing value code in your data. So you need to do something, but those techniques are not applicable to your situation. Lets say you want to explain a variable $y$ with respondent's education ( $educ$ ), which is observed for everybody, and age of youngest child ( $chage$ ), which is only observed for people with children. The child's age cannot influence $y$ for persons without children; this characteristic just does not exist for those persons. So for these persons the logistic regression model is $P(y=1|x)=\Lambda(\beta_0 + \beta_1educ)$ , where $\Lambda(\cdot)= \frac{\exp(\cdot)}{1+\exp(\cdot)}$ . For people with children, your model is $P(y=1|x)=\Lambda(\beta_0^* + \beta_1educ + \beta_2chage)$ . It reasonable to suspect that just the fact of having children has its own effect on top the children's age, so $\beta_0\neq\beta_0^*$ . You can estimate this model. The first step is to create a new variable indicating whether or not a person has children (in all likelihood you don't need to create that variable as it is probably already in your data). Lets call that variable $child$ . The second step is to change the variable $chage$ to 0 for all persons without children. Than you can add $child$ , and $chage$ to your model. So we have $P(y=1|x)=\Lambda(\beta_0 + \beta_1educ + \beta_2chage + \beta_3 child )$ If someone does not have children, then $child$ = 0 and $chage$ = 0. So the model becomes: $P(y=1|x)=\Lambda(\beta_0 + \beta_1educ + \beta_2 0 + \beta_3 0 ) = Lambda(\beta_0 + \beta_1educ )$ , which is what we wanted. If someone has children, then $child$ = 1. So the model becomes $P(y=1|x)=\Lambda(\beta_0 + \beta_1educ + \beta_2chage + \beta_3 1 ) = \Lambda(\underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_3}_{\beta_0^*} + \beta_1educ + \beta_2chage ) $ , which is what we wanted. Notice that the number of variables in your model differ depending on whether $chage$ had a missing value or not. In your case that is exactly what we wanted, because quite sensibly we don't want to control for characteristics that don't exist for an individual. However this also means that this trick does not work for a general case of missing values, i.e. the value exists but we have not observed it.
