A recent development related to this question: Scott Guthrie posted on September 28th 2008 (see: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx ) that Microsoft will actually begin shipping JQuery with Visual Studio . MVC projects will include the library by default. Scott indicates that this is being done with the consent and encouragement of the JQuery team. See the original post for full details .
