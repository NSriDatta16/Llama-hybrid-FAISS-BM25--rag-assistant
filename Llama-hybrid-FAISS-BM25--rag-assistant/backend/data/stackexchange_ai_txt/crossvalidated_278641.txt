How to Gaussian processes for time series prediction?

I am trying to fit Gaussian process to learn a distribution from input sequence to output sequence. I am relatively new and have several questions: 1) For time series prediction problems, if you have a sequential input you can feed them without stacking inputs into a vector while using RNNs or LSTMs. Do Gaussian processes have such a structure? If no, is it still make sense to use GPs to learn output sequence from input sequence? 2) When I try to fit GP to training data with 400 samples and 18 features it has really difficult time. Is there a way to batch the data and use the learned parameters from one batch to another as in neural networks. Thanks in advance.
