What is the definition of Incomplete Type and Object Type in C?

What is the definition of Incomplete Type and Object Type in C? Also, could you provide some examples of each? ANSI C99 mentions both type categories in various places, though I've found it difficult to understand what each of them means exactly (there is no paragraph/sentence explicitly defining what they are).
