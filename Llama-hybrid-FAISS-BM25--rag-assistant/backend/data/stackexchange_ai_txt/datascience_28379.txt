Each sample (read: each row in your table/matrix) can be seen as the realization of an $m$-dimensional random variable $X_{i}$, where $m$ is the number of features (read: number of columns in your table/matrix). Independence means that the random variables $X_i, i = 1, \dots, n,$ that generate your samples are independent . StatsSorceress explains the intuition behind independence wonderfully. A different way of looking at it is: 'Does knowing sample $X_i$ give me additional information about another sample $X_j$?' One case where this is true (and the samples are not independent) is for time series. If your samples are stock prices, and you know that the stock price one second ago was USD 100, then you can be fairly sure that the stock price right now is also going to be close to USD 100.
