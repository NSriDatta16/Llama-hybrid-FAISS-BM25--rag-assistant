Why are my p-values so high?

I am getting astronomically high p-values for all the coefficients in a logistic regression model. I am not sure why they are so high: 0.7096 0.4441 0.9783 0.7826 0.6890 0.7538 0.8017 0.9332 0.9564 I honestly cannot find out why they are so high. My dependent variable consists of ratios between 0 and 1, and my independent variables vary between continuous data, ordinal data, and categorical data. Just adding a bit more information. I am creating a model to predict the proportion of those who evacuated to the remaining population in an area. For example, 10 percent evacuated / 90 percent left, and so on, over 37 hours. The data is sequential where each hour before effects the value of each hour after it. In the literature they call it the sequential logit model. Currently I am using Matlab's generalized linear model function using a binomial distribution linked with a logit. I am using 9 independent (predictor) variables and one dependent variable that is continuous between 0 and 1. More information! The model being developed operates only on people that have already made the decision to evacuate. So I am not testing for if they will leave or not but when they will leave. Hopefully this clarifies what I am trying to do. I downloaded R and I ran a logistic test. Here is what I got Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.41146 -0.12817 -0.00301 0.10222 0.47937 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I am beginning to think that instead of trying to fix this, I should just believe that what I am doing is wrong and take another approach. Thanks all who answered and helped!
