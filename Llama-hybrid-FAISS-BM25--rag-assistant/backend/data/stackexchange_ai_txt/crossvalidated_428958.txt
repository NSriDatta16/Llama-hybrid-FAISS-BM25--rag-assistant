Is there a name for the bias addition after weight multiplication in Neural Network literature?

My question is, what is this step called (if at all): $$ W_2a_2 + b_2 $$ This is what each neuron does, and then the activation layer decides how much participation this neuron will take in the next layer: $$ \sigma(W_2a_2 + b_2) $$ But is there a name to the previous step? I see this as basic transformation of the type: $$ y = mx + c $$ Is simply transformation an appropriate name for this step?
