Core Data expects you to define your own sorting with NSSortDescriptors, so you'll have to add your own attribute to track a user-customizable ordering index like that. I've had luck using KVO on the entity's relationship keypath (from within the managed object itself) to change the ordering as needed when new relationship objects are added or removed. To handle rearrangement, you'll want to take advantage of NSTableView's drag and drop methods and reset the order index attribute as needed. The NSTableView documentation should explain it pretty well.
