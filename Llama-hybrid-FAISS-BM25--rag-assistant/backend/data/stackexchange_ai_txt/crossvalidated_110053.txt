The Generalised likelihood ratio test DOES NOT work the way you are saying. See for example the following lecture notes: http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~peterf/MATH38062/MATH38062%20GLRT.pdf http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~bb/MS_Lectures_12b.pdf The GLRT is defined for hypothesis of the type: $$H_0: \theta\in\Theta_0 \,\,\, vs. \,\,\, H_1: \theta\in\Theta_1,$$ where $\Theta_0\cap\Theta_1=\emptyset$ and $\Theta_0\cup\Theta_1=\Theta$. For the framework you describe, you can compare the models using other tools such as AIC and BIC. Also Bayes factors, if you are willing to go full Bayesian.
