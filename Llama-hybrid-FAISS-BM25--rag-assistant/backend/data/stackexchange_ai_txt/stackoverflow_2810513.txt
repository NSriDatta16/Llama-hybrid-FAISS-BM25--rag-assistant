As others have suggested you could poll a mailbox to detect an incoming message - but its far more efficient to get the MDA (mail delivery agent) to trigger the process when a mesage arrives - how you do this depends on how your mail system is configured (on most Linux systems procmail is used for the MDA which provides all sorts of filtering, automatic responses and execution functionality, failing that, .forward files in the users home dir can usually do at least part of the job). In terms of parsing the message - it should contain one or more headers seperated by a newline (or carriage return + newline) followed by at least one blank line, followed by the body. But you'll need to think about how you deal with mime encoded content. Regardless of how you get the email you still need to get it into the blog. Most blog software supports some form of xmlrpc for adding messages - there's a lib published at http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/ Have a look at the discussion pages for examples of usage as a client. Failing that - try reverse engineering the form used to submit a new post. C.
