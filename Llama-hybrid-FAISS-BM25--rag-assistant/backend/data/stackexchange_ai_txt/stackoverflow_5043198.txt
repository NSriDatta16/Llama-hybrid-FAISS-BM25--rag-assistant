I'd recommend the following resources: Zend Framework manual (seems obvious, but it's really great and sufficient in most cases), Sample open source projects based on ZF, like Magento or the other discussed already , Zend Framework tag on Github (e.g. PasteBin or ZFPlanet , Source code from Books (e.g. StoreFront ). To answer the other questions: Zend Cache has an action helper and application resource to make it really simple in usage, Zend Feed in action may be seen in ZFPlanet, Zend Paginator may be set up in bootstrap, using static methods.
