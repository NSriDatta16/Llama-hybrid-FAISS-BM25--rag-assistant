The first doublequote inside the value is breaking the value too early. You should use singlequotes only to denote strings in EL, not doublequotes. You should use doublequotes only to denote HTML attribute values. > (please don't pay attention to the Stackoverflow code syntax highlighter, it doesn't recognize taglibs/EL correctly, the above is legitimately valid) Or, when you're on JSP 2.0 or newer, you can even just leave that c:out away as long as there's no risk for XSS (which is not the case here since you're printing a server-controlled value).
