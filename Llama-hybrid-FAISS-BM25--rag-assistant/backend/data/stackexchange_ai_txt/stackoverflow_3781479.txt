How to set up a proper select form

I am trying to draw the end result being that @gallery = whatever i choose in my select - form_for :gallery do |f| .grid_6.hr_dots.clear .exist_gal .grid_5 %label 2. Or add to an existing Gallery .clear .grid_4 = select @gallery, :gallery, options_for_select(@galleries.collect { |g| g.name }), {}, :class => "gallery_title" .grid_2 = link_to 'add photos', new_photos_organization_media_gallery_url(@organization.id, @gallery.id), :class => 'button add_photos_btn' My controller : def new @gallery = Gallery.new @galleries = @organization.galleries end
