Database design for text revisions

This question contains some excellent coverage of how to design a database history/revision scheme for data like numbers or multiple choice fields. However, there is not much discussion of large text fields, as often found in blog/Q&A/wiki/document type systems. So, what would be considered good practice for storing the history of a text field in a database based editing system? Is storing it in the database even a good idea?
