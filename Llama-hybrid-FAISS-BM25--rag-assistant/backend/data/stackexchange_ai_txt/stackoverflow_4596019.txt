The technique in fact depends on the actual scenario. This goes by several names, such as content based retrieval, template matching, image description and such. My suggestions: If your scenario is like the faces, rotated at known angles with known sizes, look for simpler techniques, such as the correlation of two images. Do it for each angle and you got it. If you know that the only variation between images is the rotation, that means you have only the happy and sad faces rotated, without other distortions, you can look for rotation invariant matching methods. The Fourier theory may help you there, and also mappings to polar coordinates associated with correlations. The worst case, where you have several variations, you will need to look into image descriptors and pattern matching techniques. These also depend on the image type, and there are several of them. If you end up with these, you'll have a scheme with some libraries/code to extract features from the images and a classifier to tell you which are the same and which are not, with some kind of confidence (such as a distance measure between the features vectors).
