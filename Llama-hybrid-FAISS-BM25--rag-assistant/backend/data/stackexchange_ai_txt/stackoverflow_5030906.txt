Yes it is very trivial, but I'm a novice. So someone explained to me that not every entry listed in the sysprocesses table is a SQL Agent job, and only SQL Agent jobs have the hex string as a part of program_name. Since I didn't have any SQL Agent jobs running at the time, none of the entries in sysprocesses had a hex part (which is OK, because I only need to identify long-running SQL Agent jobs). I hope this is helpful to another beginner out there!
