VC Dimension of Gaussian Kernel

The VC dimension of SVM using the Gaussian kernel $K(x,x') = e^{-\gamma \|x-x'\|_2^2}$ is infinite, but I have never seen a proof or a detailed explanation of this fact. How do we explicitly choose points $x_1,\cdots, x_n$ in, say, $\mathbb R^2$ that can be scattered by SVM hypotheses using the Gaussian Kernel? Intuitively, just from looking at pictures, the SVM with Gaussian kernel lets us place any number of bounded patches on the plane. Then we can choose points sufficiently far apart (depending on the parameter $\gamma$, which also determines the size of the patches) and place a patch around precisely those points which we wish to classify positively. How do I make that rigorous?
