No, they are not the same. In Convolutional neural networks, the features in the image are extracted using multiple Feature detectors. The result(convolved feature map) again is pooled (shrinking the image to reduce the size) and then the result of pooling step(matrix) is flattened into an array. This flattened array acts as the input layer of the neural network, which is fed to the hidden layer, which has neurons.
