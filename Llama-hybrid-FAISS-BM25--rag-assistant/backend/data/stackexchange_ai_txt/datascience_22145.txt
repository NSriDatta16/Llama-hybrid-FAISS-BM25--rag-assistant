Is statistics a pre-requisite to learn deep learning?

I am very interested in deep learning, and I was recommended to read The Elements of Statistical Learning , but it is very hard to get into. So my question is : How important is learning statistics and reading books like elements of statistical learning, if my end goal is to learn deep learning? I should have mentioned that I have already done Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.
