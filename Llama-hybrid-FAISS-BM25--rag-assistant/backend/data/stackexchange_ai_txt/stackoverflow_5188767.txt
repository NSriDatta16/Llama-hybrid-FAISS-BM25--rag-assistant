communication between extensions developed for Google Chrome

I have developed two extentions (say extenstion A and extension B) for google chrome. Extension A uses Content-scripts.js A and extension B uses content-scripts.js B. In content-scripts.js A, i have used localStorage.setItem("parameterVariable","hi"); In content-scripts.js B, i have used localStorage.getItem("parameterVariable"), which is suppose to return "hi", as extension A runs first and set the "paraneterVariable",and ectension B uses it. But it is returning NULL. How to make the extension B's localStorage.getItem("parameterVariable") to return the value set by the extension B. Thanks in advance.
