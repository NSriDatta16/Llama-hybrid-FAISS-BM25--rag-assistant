The fundamental difficulty with averaging the posteriors is that the data has no say in the weight of the said posteriors. If the global prior is the average of three possible priors (with weights $1/3$ , $1/3$ , $1/3$ ), the posterior will not be the average of the corresponding posteriors with weights $1/3$ , $1/3$ , $1/3$ , as the weights will depend on the data. Check out the keyword Bayesian model averaging for more details. As for instance in Hoeting et al. (1999) . Or these slides .
