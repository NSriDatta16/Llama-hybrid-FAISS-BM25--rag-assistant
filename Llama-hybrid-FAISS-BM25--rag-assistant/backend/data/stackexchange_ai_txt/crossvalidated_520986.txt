How can I prove something rarely happens using statistics and mathematics?

I want to prove that something rarely happens. I have a dataset generated by air-conditioners and I need to prove that it is not worth providing statistics including mean, max, median, min, and max mode to other departments because the target temperature of the air conditioner, which is adjusted by people for the air conditioner to reach it to cool down the air around us, hardly ever changes. The number of air conditioner dataset is 500,452. The maximum number of changes in the target temperature of air conditioners is 27 a day and the average number of target temperature changes is 0.0032. The averages tells the target temperature hardly ever changes so I don't think I need to calculate the five statistics but I am not sure if I don't really need to provide the statistics because the average is extremely low. Therefore, I think it is almost meaningless to provide the above five numbers of statistics because most of target temperatures of air conditioners do not change a day. I want to prove that the five statistics hardly change using statistics or mathematics. How can I prove the target temperature hardly ever changes so that I can only provide the dataset but I don't have to provide the five statistics above as I am so sure that the target temperature hardly ever changes? The goal of proving my thought using statistics or mathematics is that I want to justify myself that providing the five statistics for the dataset with almost no changes in them is meaningless.
