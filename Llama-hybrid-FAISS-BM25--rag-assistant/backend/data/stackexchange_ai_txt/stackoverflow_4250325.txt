Calling exit "terminates the program without leaving the current block and hence without destroying any objects with automatic storage duration". In other words, leak or not, you shouldn't really care. When you call exit , you're saying "close this program, I no longer care about anything in it." So stop caring. :) Obviously it's going to leak resources because you never let the destructor of the string run, absolutely regardless of how it manages those resources.
