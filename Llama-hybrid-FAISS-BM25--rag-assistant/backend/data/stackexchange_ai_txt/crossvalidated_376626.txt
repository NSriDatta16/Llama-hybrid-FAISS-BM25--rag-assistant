It looks to me as though the proposed method at its core uses robust estimates of location and covariance based on the MCD ( Minimum Covariance Determinant ) algorithm (the link is to the FastMCD variant.) This algorithm randomly samples the data hundreds of times, constructing covariance matrix estimates for the subsamples, then selects the one with the minimum determinant. From your perspective, the important part is that "randomly samples" bit. This means that the estimated covariance matrix at the core of the pcaCoDa algorithm is non-deterministic, so the output eigenvectors are too. Given how different the results are from run to run, I'd guess there's some parameter tuning in the calls to the FastMCD algorithm that aren't working well for this problem. Since it doesn't appear that you can alter the parameters passed to the FastMCD algorithm by altering any parameters passed to pcaCoDa , you may have to mess with the code, or seek another approach altogether.
