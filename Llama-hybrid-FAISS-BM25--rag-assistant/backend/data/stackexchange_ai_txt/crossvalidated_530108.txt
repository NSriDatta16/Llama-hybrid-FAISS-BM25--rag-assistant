As long as your records are not correlated, there is a much simpler approach: any technique for a single proportion will work. Asymptotic methods will not work well, because they assume at least a decent number of 1s and 0s, but you have all 1s. However, there are alternatives. Let's use the example of 100 out of 100 correctly classified records, and here's some methods with R code and resulting 95% confidence (or credible) intervals: exact methods such as the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval qbeta(0.025, 100, 0+1) = 0.964 to qbeta(0.025, 100+1, 0) = 1, or Jeffreys with a Beta(0.5, 0.5) prior: qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 100+0.5, 0.5) = 0.975 to 0.999995. Why do you need to worry about correlated records and when would this happen? This could e.g. happen if you asked 10 different people to try to deal with the same 100 records, when obviously the same record classified by 10 different people does not provide the same information as if they had each looked at completely independent records. In that case, techniques for independent trials for a single proportion will not work, but e.g. methods like logistic regression with a random record and a random person effect could work (but you'd probably have to take a Bayesian approach to deal with the perfect separation of the observed proportion being 1).
