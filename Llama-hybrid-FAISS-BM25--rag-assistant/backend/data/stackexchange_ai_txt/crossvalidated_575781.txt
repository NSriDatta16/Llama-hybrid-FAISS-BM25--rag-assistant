I wouldn't say the authors are wrong as such, but they weren't adequately careful with the wording. Often it's clear from context whether you mean simple or multiple linear regression, but here it wasn't. The authors should have written ...it will not be possible to produce an accurate estimate using simple linear regression. ...where simple linear regression means using a single predictor: only $X_1$ . You are right that in this same paragraph, the authors had been discussing (multiple) linear regression in general: For example, linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between $Y$ and $X_1$ , $X_2$ , ..., $X_p$ . There's no reason you couldn't define e.g. polynomials such as $X_2=X_1^2$ and $X_3=X_1^3$ , in which case a linear model should indeed be able to fit that true $f$ reasonably well. Edit : Alternately, to @whuber's point, they could have said ...it will not be possible to produce an accurate estimate using a regression that is linear in $X$ . Especially given that in Chapter 3 the authors note how a polynomial regression (nonlinear in $X$ ) is still a linear model (linear in the $\beta$ s), it would have been helpful to be more explicit here. Their point here was not to say that the $f$ plotted in Figure 2.11 can't be well-approximated by a model linear in the $\beta$ s--- only that it can't be well-approximated by a model linear in $X$ .
