Symbol of precision and precision matrix

This is one of my first questions so sorry in advance for any rules that I break. Is there any mainstream convention for the symbol of the precision and precision matrix? I have seen the following ones: In Information theory, inference and learning algorithms by MacKay: $$ \text{Precision: }\tau = 1 / \sigma^2$$ $$ \text{Precision matrix: }\mathbf{A} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} $$ In Pattern recognition and machine learning by Bishop: $$ \text{Precision: }\beta = 1 / \sigma^2$$ $$ \text{Precision matrix: }\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} $$ Is any of them preferred over the others?
