How to check for mutual existence of Fields in same table in Two columns

I tried using "Exist" and "IN". Not only did I not succeed, it didn't seem as an efficient solution. Here is a simplified example: TblMyTable UserName1 - Grade - UserName2 - Grade I need a query where there is a mutual relation / existence. What I mean is that the returned result from the query will only include the users where on the same row there is both UserName1 and UserName2 mutually (see image below for a better example / explanation). Any user can work with any other user. So the result will be (the order doesn't matter) ideally in one line: John - 5000 -- Mary - 3000 or Mary - 3000 -- John - 5000 The punchline is, it's one dynamically changing table with active Users using the F.Key to the main User's table, which has the P.Key. Please see image below for a better example / explanation. Database is SQL 2005. Many thanx in advance * Edit: Screenshot that hopefully help explain it all. The end result should be 2 rows, because only they have a mutual relation in TblDynamicUserList: ana - Phone - 3000 --- RanAbraGmail - Wifi - 2000 and anaHeb - Phone - 5000 --- RoyP - Phone - 4000 http://www.marketing2go.co.il/SqlQuestion.jpg
