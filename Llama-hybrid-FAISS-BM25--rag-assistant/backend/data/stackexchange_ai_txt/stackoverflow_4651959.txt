Is there a more elegant way to achieve a "cheat code" implementation for a game in C++?

I have been learning C++ by diving into a project, a simple 2d game. I have attempted to implement a set of cheats but I'm seriously novice at string manipulation. I'm sure there would be a more elegant way to achieve what I would like than my code below. As requested, stringBuffer is just a string that contains the last 12 pressed characters. I prepend it because it's trimmed at the end later with resize, and hence my cheats have to be backwards. I'm very much a noob at string manipulation, and I know something is wrong here, which I why I asked for it to be looked at and possibly improved. //The following code is in my keyPressed function cheatBuffer = (char)key + cheatBuffer; cheatBuffer.resize(12); string tempBuffer; string cheats[3] = {"1taehc","2taehc","3taehc"}; for(int i = 0;i The codes are "cheat1", "cheat2" and "cheat3" respectively. I can't help thinking that this could be a lot better. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
