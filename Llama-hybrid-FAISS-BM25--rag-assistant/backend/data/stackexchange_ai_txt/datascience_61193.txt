This is not really a data science project. It's more a programming problem as you are trying to build a program with multiple functions to gather data, sort data, etc. Data science is about finding, researching, analyzing relationships within data itself. Data scientists don't work on APIS, neither SQL or other data sources (but it doesn't mean they don't know about it). https://stackoverflow.com/ should be a right place for your question, specially if you have some code. I am sure they will help you there with Google API
