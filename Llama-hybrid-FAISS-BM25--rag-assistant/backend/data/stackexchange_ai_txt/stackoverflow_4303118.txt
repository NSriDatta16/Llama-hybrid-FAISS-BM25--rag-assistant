It's not clear from your code, but I'm going to assume that you have a many-to-many here based on the belongsTo property. I've managed to reproduce this with Grails 1.3.5. The problem only seems to affect the side of the relationship that has the belongsTo property. If you tried the same code with organization -> users instead, it would work. The fix is rather odd: make the users collection on Organization non-lazy too. This one will have to make it into the GORM Gotchas series!
