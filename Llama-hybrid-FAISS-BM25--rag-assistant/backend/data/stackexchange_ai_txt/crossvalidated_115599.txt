Testing correlation between multiscaled rank-ordered variables

I aim to test correlation for the following rank ordered ordinal variables : 1st set of variables - Total 4 ( These are reduced variables using PCA from original 10 variables to 4, ranked on a scale of 1 to 10) 2nd set of variables - Total 2 ( These are reduced variables using PCA from original 6 variables to 2, ranked on a scale of 1 to 6) 3rd set of variables - Total 9 , ranked on a scale of 1 to 9 I believe Spearman Rank Correlation (SRC) would be the right technique to test correlation. However, the tricky part is all the above variables are ranked at different scales. All the SRC examples show that the variables tested for correlation are measured at same scale. Is there any way to standardise the rank-ordered ordinal variables on the same scale to be eligible for Spearman Rank Correlation test though they are measured on different scales? I would be grateful if you could advise on it. Many Thanks. Regards, - Tanuja
