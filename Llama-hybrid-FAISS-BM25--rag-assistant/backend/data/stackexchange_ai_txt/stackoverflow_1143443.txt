I really think that you (and others) are wasting your time when you start adding complexity to log files. The whole point of a log is that it should be simple to use and implement, and should work most of the time. To that end, just write the log to an unbuffered stream (l;ike cerr in a C++ program) and live with any, very occasional in my experience, snafus. OTOH, if you really need an audit trail of everything your app does, for legal reasons, then you should be using some form of transactional storage such as a SQL database.
