Emails with Attachments Cause an Error in Mule

I have a working Mule 2.2.1 configuration with the imaps:connector . But I am not able to proceed emails with attachments. Any experience? org.mule.api.service.ServiceException: Cannot route event as component "imap" is stopped. Component that caused exception is: SedaService{imap}. Message payload is of type: MimeMessage Or alternatively type MimeBodyPart is reported instead of MimeMessage if I remove org.mule.transport.email.SimpleMailMessageAdapter. I tried to restrict configuration as much as possible (no outbouds, no components), but it does not help. Edit Strange! Transformers do not help because they are not even called. I wrote a custom one doing nothing, just for debugging purpose. Transformer is called if is added to inbound. It causes skipping a component, even non existing.
