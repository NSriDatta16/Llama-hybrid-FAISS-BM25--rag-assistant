Given that there were no determistic brekpoints in model error variance over time AND no changes in model paramaters over time AND that there are no pulses, seasonal pulses, level shifts or deterministic time trends in the data ...... one might consider adding an MA2 and a SEASONAL MA at period 12 ..... BUT only your data knows for sure . You might consider posting your OBSERVED SERIES and allowing some of our time series experts to actually model the data for you in order to formulate a reasonable model.
