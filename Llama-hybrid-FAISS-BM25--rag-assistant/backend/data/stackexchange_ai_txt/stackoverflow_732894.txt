Access violation with malloc() and glDrawPixels()?

Can anyone see what's wrong with this code? SIZE_BG is 6MB as I am trying to draw a large bitmap image (3366x600). I use malloc to prevent my image from overflowing the stack. I get an access violation error on the call to glDrawPixels(). bgPtr seems to point to the correct data as I checked the first few bytes before calling glDrawPixels and they are correct. bgPtr = (char*)malloc(SIZE_BG); fstream inFile(texFileName, ios::in | ios::binary); inFile.read(bgPtr, SIZE_BG); inFile.close(); //... other code glDrawPixels(3366, 600, GL_BGRA_EXT, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, bgPtr+54);
