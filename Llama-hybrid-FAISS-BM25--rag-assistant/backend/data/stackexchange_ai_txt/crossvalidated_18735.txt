You asked for a simple model. Here's how I would start with R code: glm(match ~ outdoorDif*outdoorImport + optimistDif*optimistImport, family=binomial(link="logit")) outdoorDif = the difference of the two people's answers about how much they enjoy outdoor activities. outdoorImport = the average of the two answers on the importance of a match regarding the answers on enjoyment of outdoor activities. The * indicates that the preceding and following terms are interacted and also included separately. You suggest that the match data is binary with the only two options being, "happily married" and "no second date," so that is what I assumed in choosing a logit model. This doesn't seem realistic. If you have more than two possible outcomes you'll need to switch to a multinomial or ordered logit or some such model. If, as you suggest, some people have multiple attempted matches then that would probably be a very important thing to try to account for in the model. One way to do it might be to have separate variables indicating the # of previous attempted matches for each person, and then interact the two.
