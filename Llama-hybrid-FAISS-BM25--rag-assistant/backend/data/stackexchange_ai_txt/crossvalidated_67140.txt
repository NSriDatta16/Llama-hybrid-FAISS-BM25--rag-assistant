Suitable analysis for my data...?

everyone, I'm new at the statistical analysis so I need some help from more experienced people. I'm working with biological data from gene expression analysis. I have 5 treatments (1 parental toxin; 3 compounds resulting from the metabolism of the parental toxin -let's calll them A, B and C), and a control, each one with 3 time points (6, 12 and 18h). I was trying to relate them somehow, although they are independent experiments, and summarize like this "the response of the toxin A after 12h is 23% similar to the parental toxin after 6h". So here's a list of what I've tried so far: 1. Pearson correlation/Cosine similarity. I created a matrix comparing each treatment. However, it didn't add much, because I can't turn the coefficient into a numerical valueor percentage. 2. Linear regression. Since Pearson does not discriminate between the axis, I used linear regression shifting the position of the treatment that I wanted to be the "dependent variable" (in this case, x=A,B or C toxins and y=parental toxin). I was planning to use the slope (a), as measure. If the angle a was between 0 and 22.5ยบ degrees, I would have a response of y = 0.5 times toxin A; if the angle was 45 ยบ, I would have y = toxin A; and if the angle >45ยบ, I would have y = 2 times toxin. But I'm sure that's not a good idea. My supervisor insists on that, but I don't know if that's viable. What do I do with the euqation intercepts? 3. Multiple linear regression. I used the treatments that showed the highest correlation coefficients to build a multiple linear regression equation, and so I had "parental toxin 6h = 0.754 toxin A 12h + 0.246 toxin B 12h + 0.847 toxin C 18h". That's almost what I want, but, again, I feel that this is not the best way to analysze my data because it doesn't fulfill the necessary assumptions to use linear regression. 4. Binary analysis, percent agreement, logistic regression, matrix determinants, etc. So, if anyone have any suggestion, publication suggestion, anything that could shed some light to my (so far) insoluble problem, I would appreciate very much. Thanks in advance. ADDITIONAL INFO: My data is composed of 2280 genes, which have different expression values among treatments. In some treatments they are significant (expression ratio >1.5 or
