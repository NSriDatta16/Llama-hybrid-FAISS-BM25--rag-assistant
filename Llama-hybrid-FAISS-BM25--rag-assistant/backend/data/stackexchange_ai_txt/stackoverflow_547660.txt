You'll want to get an HTTP sniffer tool like Fiddler and compare the headers that are being sent from your app to the ones being sent by the browser. There will be something different that is causing the server to return a different response. When you tweak your app to send the same thing browser is sending you should get the same response. (It could be user-agent, cookies, anything, but something is surely different.)
