AJAX Get/Post in MVC2 Application is embedding login page when using Authorize tags

I have an MVC2 application that uses forms authorization and a session timeout. I use jquery ajax calls throughout my application in order to retrieve or submit data (in the form of partial views). When a session times out, upon posting to the application, mvc2 returns a redirect, which prompts the browser to retrieve my login page, which it then embeds within the current page. This produced one view embedded within my current view, which is obviously undesirable. I attempted to implement the solution referred to in other posts on SO, which outline steps similar to the ones in this blog post: http://craftycodeblog.com/2010/05/15/asp-net-mvc-ajax-redirect/ However, perhaps because I'm using authorize annotations such as: [Authorize(Roles = "Patient, Staff, Provider, Administrator")] I find that the solution appears ineffective. Is anyone aware of a solution that will alter my C# response in a similar fashion as the one outlined in the blog post (returning a document.location redirect) that will work for authorize annotations?
