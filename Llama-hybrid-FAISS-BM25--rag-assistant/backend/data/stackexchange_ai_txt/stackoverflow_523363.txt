How do I layout a 3 pane window using wxPython?

I am trying to find a simple way to layout a 3 pane window using wxPython. I want to have a tree list in the left pane, then have a right pane that is split into two - with an edit component in the top part and a grid component in the bottom part. Something along the lines of: -------------------------------------- | | | | | Edit | | Tree | Control | | Control | | | |----------------------| | | | | | Grid | | | | -------------------------------------- I would like the window to be re-sizable and give the user the ability to change the (relative) size of each of the components within the windows by dragging the borders. I figure that I need some combination of sizers and/or splitter-window components but can't find a decent example of this kind of window in the documentation or on the web.
