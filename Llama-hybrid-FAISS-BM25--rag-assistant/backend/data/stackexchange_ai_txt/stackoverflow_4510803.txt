From Java Tutorial: Understanding Instance and Class Members : Class variables are referenced by the class name itself, as in Bicycle.numberOfBicycles This makes it clear that they are class variables. Note : You can also refer to static fields with an object reference like myBike.numberOfBicycles but this is discouraged because it does not make it clear that they are class variables.
