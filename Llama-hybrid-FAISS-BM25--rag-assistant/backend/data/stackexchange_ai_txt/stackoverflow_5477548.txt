If you want me in your website's audience, I would prefer if you wouldn't. When switching between windows, clicking in the window area is the quickest way to switch focus between windows. If like 80% of your window is really a link, I would find that annoying. I think I am not the only one. The way it sounds there is also plenty of area which you can make behave like a link, such as the image, and the text in the grid. If that would be clickable, that would be big enough a target to hit. Also imagine your app being used on a touch screen. These sometimes imsinterpret drag (scroll/zoom) and tick gestures. Which is annoying if everything responds to clicks.
