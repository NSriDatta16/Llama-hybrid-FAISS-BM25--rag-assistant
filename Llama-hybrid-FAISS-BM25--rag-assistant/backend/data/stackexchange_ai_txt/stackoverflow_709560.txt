LINQ In Line Property Update During Join

I have two obects, A & B for this discussion. I can join these objects (tables) via a common relationship or foreign key. I am using linq to do this join and I only want to return ObjectA in my result set; however, I would like to update a property of ObejctA with data from ObjectB during the join so that the ObjectAs I get out of my LINQ query are "slightly" different from their original state in the storage medium of choice. Here is my query, you can see that I would just like to be able to do something like objectA.SomeProperty = objectB.AValueIWantBadly I know I could do a new in my select and spin up new OBjectAs, but I would like to avoid that if possible and simply update a field. return from objectA in GetObjectAs() join objectB in GetObjectBs() on objectA.Id equals objectB.AId // update object A with object B data before selecting it select objectA;
