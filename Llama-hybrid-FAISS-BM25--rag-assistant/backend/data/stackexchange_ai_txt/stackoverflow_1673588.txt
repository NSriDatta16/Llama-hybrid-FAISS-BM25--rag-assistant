Elegant Web Permission Schemes

I'm currently writing a web application that have about 6-12 pages. On each one of these pages, I want the user to be able to do some (or all) of the following actions: View, Add, Update, and Delete. The current permission scheme I thought of is having an integer in a database. This integer will correspond to a binary number (e.g.: 26 -> 11010). The resulting binary number acts as a "toggle" and determines what permissions the user has. The definition of what bit represents what permission is stored in another table. My problem is, if each page has 4 options (view, Add, Edit, Delete), then this way of determining permissions can get out of hand. Does anyone have any other ideas for a permission scheme that would be as flexible (with respect to configurability) as this, but not as overwhelming (with respect to integer limits)?
