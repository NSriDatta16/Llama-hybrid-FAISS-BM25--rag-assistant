The PCA is not good or bad. The values you have, where two principal components do not explain a big part of variance, mean that the data is far from being near a 2 dimensional subspace. I can understand your data have many dimensions, as the variance of the second component only explains 6% and rest of components must explain even less each. Here is an example. I create 1000 points in 5 dimensions with center (0,0,0,0,0) and different covariance matrices. In the first case, they are all distributed equally along each of the 5 dimensions. In the second case, points are also in 5 dimensions, but mostly near a plane in 2d. You can see the explained variance of each component. data_5d = mvrnorm(1000, c(0,0,0,0,0), diag(5)) summary(prcomp(data_5d)) # Importance of components: # PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 # Standard deviation 1.027 1.0064 0.9928 0.9604 0.9511 # Proportion of Variance 0.216 0.2076 0.2020 0.1890 0.1854 # Cumulative Proportion 0.216 0.4236 0.6256 0.8146 1.0000 data_almost_2d = mvrnorm(1000, c(0,0,0,0,0), diag(c(1,1,0.1,0.1,0.1))) summary(prcomp(data_almost_2d)) # Importance of components: # PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 # Standard deviation 1.0074 0.9724 0.32140 0.30981 0.30016 # Proportion of Variance 0.4511 0.4203 0.04591 0.04266 0.04005 # Cumulative Proportion 0.4511 0.8714 0.91729 0.95995 1.00000
