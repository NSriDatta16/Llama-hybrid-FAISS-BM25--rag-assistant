I remember getting this problem a few times. It might have to do with the Flex Profiler (I used to accidentally click that every now and then trying to launch the debugger). If you start the Profiler and stop it too fast, it will add something to a file in your home directory that it shouldn't. Check out /path/to/home/mm.cfg on your operating system (on mac, you can open it in textmate with mate ~/mm.cfg ). The mm.cfg file stores some information about debugging in Flex Then in that file, make sure this is the only content: ErrorReportingEnable=1 TraceOutputFileEnable=1 If there's an extra line (can't remember/find it, something like PreloadSwf=/Users/[username]/Documents/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/com.adobe.flash.profiler/ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9999 ), delete it. Let me know if that fixes it. Lance
