Does Bayesian statistics bypass the need for the sampling distribution?

Let's take the classic case where the population follows a normal distribution, observations are iid, and we want to estimate the mean of the population. In Frequentist stats, we calculate the sample mean and sample variance from observed data. We know the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a normal distribution with mean = population mean and variance = population variance/ sample size. Knowing that, we can test to see what is the % chance the population mean falls within some range, using the sampling distribution. Seems like in Bayesian Stats, we don't need the sampling distribution of the sample mean to make inferences about the population mean. Let's say we assume the prior distribution of population mean is uniform. Using MLE, we determine the posterior distribution of the population mean. No where was the sampling distribution of the sample mean involved. To make inference about the population mean, we just directly calculate intervals from the posterior distribution. If the posterior distribution does not follow any known distribution, we just use our simulated distribution and do a frequency count between intervals? Is my understanding correct?
