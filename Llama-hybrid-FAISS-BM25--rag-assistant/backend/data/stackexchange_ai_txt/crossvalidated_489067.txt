It's helpful to start with the equation of the multilevel model, which applies whether the data is cross-sectional (multilevel) or person-period (longitudinal): At level 1 (within cluster): $y_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + e_{ij}, e_{ij}\sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)$ and at level 2 (between cluster): $\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j}, u_{0j}\sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$ In the longitudinal context, $\gamma_{00}$ is the grand mean estimated from all the observed data points - the average value of the outcome y. If not all individuals are measured the same number of times, then this is becomes a weighted mean of the outcome. The random intercept $u_{0j}$ is how much each person's mean outcome value deviates from the grand mean. The spread of person mean deviations around $\gamma_{00}$ can be summarized by a variance estimate ( $\sigma_u^2$ ). Partial pooling is determined by the number of repeated observations and the level 1 and level 2 variances (essentially how much of the total variation is at the person level). So if person A had outcome data on two occasions and person B had outcome data on 5 occasions, the $u_{0j}$ prediction for person A is going to be pulled back toward $\gamma_{00}$ moreso than the prediction for person B. Translating these ideas back and forth between the multilevel (groups as clusters) and the longitudinal (persons as clusters) cases takes time and effort, but is a critical part of fully understanding mixed effects models. If something still isn't clear, please post a comment.
