Autorcorrelated processes A variable in series that 'remembers' its previous values to some degree is not i.i.d.! Any autoregresive value depends on previous values of the variable, and the distribution changes depending on location within the series. For example, the time series variable $y$ , where $t$ indicates period of time, $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t,$ and $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ is not i.i.d. for non-zero values of $\beta_1$ (especially for $|\beta_1|\ge 1$ ), because the variance of $y$ is a function of $t$ (the more time passes, the more variable $y$ is). In a similar way, the expected value of $y$ at some point in the future is also a function of $t$ . Real World Examples Ok, so is that just some statistical abstraction? Or are there actual real-world examples of autocorrelated processes? In fact, they abound! Here are some: Annual marriage rates by state, province or country Annual mortality rates by state, province or country Daily closing value of the NASDAQ Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or S&P 500 Index—all marketing indexes—in the US What these (and other) autoregressive series have in common is that their value at one point in time 'remembers' (i.e. is a function of) their previous value or values.
