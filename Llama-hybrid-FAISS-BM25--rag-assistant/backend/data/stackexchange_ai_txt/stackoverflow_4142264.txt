On the phone, you can use HttbWebRequest (recommended to avoid UI impact) or WebClient per the project I posted here. WebClient, HttpWebRequest and the UI Thread on Windows Phone 7 You can then take your stream and pass it into something of this form to write it to isolated storage. private void PicToIsoStore(Stream pic) { using (var isoStore = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { var bi = new BitmapImage(); bi.SetSource(pic); var wb = new WriteableBitmap(bi); using (var isoFileStream = isoStore.CreateFile("somepic.jpg")) { var width = wb.PixelWidth; var height = wb.PixelHeight; Extensions.SaveJpeg(wb, isoFileStream, width, height, 0, 100); } } } Jon is correct you can also use MediaLibrary.SavePicture. Be aware that this would put the pics mixed in with the users photos in the Picture Hub. This is as straight forward as private void PicToMediaLibary(Stream pic) { MediaLibrary lib = new MediaLibrary(); lib.SavePicture("blah", pic); } Storing it in isolated storage is basically your apps private file system.
