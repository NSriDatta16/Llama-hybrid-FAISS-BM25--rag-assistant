I've been using caret for a long time, and love it. I only discovered mlr today, and have spent most of the day learning how to use it. I discovered mlr because I was searching for a way to produce a partial dependence plot of variable importances from random forest models. After one day's experience, I'm actually leaning toward switching to mlr! So I would say stick with mlr unless you have a compelling reason to devote time and energy into learning caret.
