How do I a query to list out all commits by a user to a Subversion repository?

How do I a query to list out all commits by a user to a Subversion repository? I would like to find all commits I have ever done to the Subversion repository, not just commits in the current snapshot. More importantly, I would like to organize the file lists by the SVN comment used while committing. I am thinking maybe a Python or shell script that would parse the output of svn log | grep username to extract revisions and then pipes the output to: svn log -r [revision numbers go here] Maybe some scripting gurus can help me out..
