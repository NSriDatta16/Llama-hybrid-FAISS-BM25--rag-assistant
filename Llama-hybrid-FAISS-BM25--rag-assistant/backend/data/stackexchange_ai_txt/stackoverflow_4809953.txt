Is there a wrapper for the TCPDump output in C or Objective-C?

I'm writing a small utility in Cocoa and I need dissect the output of the TCPDump tool. I began writing my own wrapper to convert the output of TCPDump into usable & meaningful classes and realized I can't be the first person to do this. Does anyone know of a wrapper in C or Objective-C that analyzes the output of TCPDump and can help me get this done faster? Cheers
