How to tag a scientific data processing tool to ensure repeatability

we develop a data processing tool to extract some scientific results out of a given set of raw data. In data science it is very important that you can re-obtain your results and repeat the calculations, that led to a result set Since the tool is evolving, we need a way to find out which revision/build of our tool generated a given result set and how to find the corresponding source from which the tool was build. The tool is written in C++ and Python; gluing together the C++ parts using Boost::Python. We use CMake as a build system generating Make files for Linux. Currently the project is stored in a subversion repo, but some of us already use git resp. hg and we are planning to migrate the whole project to one of them in the very near future. What are the best practices in a scenario like this to get a unique mapping between source code, binary and result set? Ideas we are already discussing: Somehow injecting the global revision number Using a build number generator Storing the whole sourcecode inside the executable itself
