How to get files from 1 to n in a particular pattern?

Suppose you have files like: NewFile.part01.zip NewFile.part02.zip NewFile.part04.zip NewFile.part06.zip NewFile.part07.zip How do you get the files in this patter so you only get a SINGLE file called "NewFile" and also get the missing ones as integers, in this case (3, 5) Right now I am checking files one by one and if the name only differs in the suffix then skipping, also checking the number is +1 than the previous, etc. But I thought someone might have a better, more elegant way of doing this. Linq, regex, etc? EDIT: So the way to know when the continuous files end is when the last file size has a difference than others. So it's like 200mb, 200mb, 200mb, ..., then the last one is 196mb. My input is the full file list with the path like: "C:\NewFile.part01.zip" "C:\NewFile.part02.zip" ...
