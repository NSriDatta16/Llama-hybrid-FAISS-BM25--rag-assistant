Do you want to do multi-modal classification? If yes, the basic principle is to have one model for stats data, one model for image data, and one model that decides which one is more informative. However, this solution considers photos as important as stats, which might not be the case. Consequently, a better solution is to include the photos data in your existing data in a compressed way through CNNs like another feature: the result from the fully connected layer would differentiate each picture efficiently thanks to a flattened vector. As pictures are not as important as all stats, it is better to consider the pictures as a single feature as important as any stat. Note: Some notebooks have interesting code that reaches 78% accuracy only from stats (see https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset/code ).
