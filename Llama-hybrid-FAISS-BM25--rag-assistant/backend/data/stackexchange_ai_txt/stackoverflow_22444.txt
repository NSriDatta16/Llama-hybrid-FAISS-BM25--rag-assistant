My regex is matching too much. How do I make it stop?

I have this gigantic ugly string: J0000000: Transaction A0001401 started on 8/22/2008 9:49:29 AM J0000010: Project name: E:\foo.pf J0000011: Job name: MBiek Direct Mail Test J0000020: Document 1 - Completed successfully I'm trying to extract pieces from it using regex. In this case, I want to grab everything after Project Name up to the part where it says J0000011: (the 11 is going to be a different number every time). Here's the regex I've been playing with: Project name:\s+(.*)\s+J[0-9]{7}: The problem is that it doesn't stop until it hits the J0000020: at the end. How do I make the regex stop at the first occurrence of J[0-9]{7} ?
