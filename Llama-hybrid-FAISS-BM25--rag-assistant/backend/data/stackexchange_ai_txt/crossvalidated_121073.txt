Systematic change of proposal density of metropolis algorithm - still a markov chain?

The problem is that I have a Gibbs-Sampler where one of the parameters has to be sampled via a Metropolis-Step from the respective FCD. I have problems finding a suitable scale for the Gaussian proposal density. In the Paper Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of random and residual varianceâ€“covariance matrices in bivariate mixed effects models , I found the following: [...] the proposal density is Gaussian with mean equal to the mode of the FCD function and a variance equal to the negative of the inverse Hessian of the FCD function evaluated at the previously sampled value [...]. Question: Will this give me valid samples from the correct posterior distribution?
