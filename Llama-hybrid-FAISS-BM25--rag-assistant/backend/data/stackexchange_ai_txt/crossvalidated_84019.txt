What proportion of your 225,000 training samples are cases of fraud? I suspect very few. This will cause problems unless you take care in how you build a classifier from the logistic regression. Given the issue you've described, I assume you are making your classifications based on a cut-off of a probability of $0.5$ from the logistic regression. You either need to choose a more appropriate cut-off, or weight the fraud samples (a weight of $19$ would be appropriate given you have $19$ times more not fraud cases in your data set), or discard a lot of the not fraud cases so you have a balanced data set. As for your second question, to properly assess the out of sample performance I would calculate the average/min/max of each column only using your training set. As an alternative to scaling you might consider binning the relevant variables.
