Simple answer - in some circumstances you can't, this is one of those circumstances where I would argue that you should use whatever means necessary to get the job done. Many popular plugins ( datepickers and modal scripts ) need to do this ( eg iframe shim ) or the script wouldn't work properly for a specific ( albeit old ) browser. However instead of sniffing the userAgent as $.browser does, I would object detect for IE6 or use CC's. You could also feed a general IE js file and then branch out inside of it based on the version.
