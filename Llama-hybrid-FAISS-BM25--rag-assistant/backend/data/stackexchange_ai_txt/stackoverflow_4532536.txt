How to do good benchmarking of complex functions?

I am about to embark in very detailed benchmarking of a set of complex functions in C. This is "science level" detail. I'm wondering, what would be the best way to do serious benchmarking? I was thinking about running them, say, 10 times each, averaging the timing results and give the standard dev, for instance, just using . What would you guys do to obtain good benchmarks?
