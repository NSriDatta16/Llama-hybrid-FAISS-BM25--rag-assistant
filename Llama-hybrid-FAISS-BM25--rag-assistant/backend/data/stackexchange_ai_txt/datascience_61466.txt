What does it mean when we say an algorithm/metric is agnostic

Problem I have all kinds of machine learning terms that co-occur with the word "agnostic", including model-agnostic learning , model-agnostic metric . From the dictionary, it explains the word "agnostic" in the following way a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (such as God) is unknown and probably unknowable. which does not make those terms more understandable. In some contexts, I find that "agnostic" refer to "generic" or "free of". For example, in the paper I am reading now, the authors define a threshold-agnostic metric, where they use score rather than hard 0/1 assignment for the task. However, I am wondering if there is formal definition for the word "agnostic" in the machine learning community.
