'None' or 'Not Used' foreign key when using GUIDs as primary key

We are building an application that may need to be replicated to many servers (I'm hoping not, but there's no way to know if clients will need their own client/server copy until after we release the online product). Since the number of servers is unknown, I've decided to use GUIDs for any transactional table IDs. Since each client has their own database, I intend to use the NEWSEQUENTIALID() default, and the largest table will add no more than 1.5M rows per year (but on average 15K rows), I don't expect much of a performance problem. However, I'm not sure how to handle cases where we want the foreign key to indicate 'none selected'. For example, a client has a single admin user. This is set up as a foreign key (login_id) to login.id (a GUID). However, if a client doesn't yet have an admin user, how would we easily set up a "None Selected" key? In prior applications we used IDENTITY columns, and inserted a dummy entry in most tables with an ID of 0. Is there an accepted approach to providing similar functionality with a GUID?
