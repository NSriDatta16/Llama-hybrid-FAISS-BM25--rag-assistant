I think some of the most important "documentation" that helped me improve some parts of my code / coding are : documentations from Frameworks / libraries, and the source code of some of those : they showed me how useful it is to have a well-presented well-structured well-commented well-organized code. About those, I could say the manual and sources of MVC Frameworks tend to show great stuff, sometimes (inheritance, interfaces, design patterns, ... things you only hear about at school -- or at least it was the case when I was at school ^^ ) code reviews / peer reviews at work both when my code was under review : advices from more experienced colleagues are always great, when you're willing to learn and when I am the one reviewing code : you always learn new stuff when reading other's people code, and being able to discuss about it really is great ! The community : I read (even if often quite only rapidly) lots of blog-posts, and those are often written by people with lots of experience, who want to share great stuff One nice source of those, for PHP of course, is Planet PHP ; just subscribe to the RSS feed ^^ But there are plenty more, not only about PHP ! Conferences are also a nice way to meet people, discuss with them, and learn from them
