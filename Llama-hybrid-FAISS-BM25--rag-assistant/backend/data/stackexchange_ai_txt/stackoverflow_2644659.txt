Accepts Nested Attributes For - edit form displays incorrect number of items ( + !map:ActiveSupport::OrderedHash {} )

I have a teacher profile model which has many subjects (separate model). I want to add subjects to the profile on the same form for creating/editing a profile. I'm using accepts_nested_attributes for and this works fine for creation. However on the edit page I am getting a very strange error - instead of seeing 3 subjects (I added three at create and a look into the console confirms this), I see 12 subjects(!). #Profile model class Profile Other info in case it's relevant. Rails: 2.3.5, Ruby 1.8.7 p149, HAML, inherited_resources I've never had so much difficulty with a bug before - I've already lost about 8 hours to it. Would really appreciate any help! Thanks to any courageous takers Jack
