Don't use either. Use System.Collections.Generic.List . That really is my recommendation. Probably independently of what your application is, but here's a little more color just in case you're doing something that needs a finely tuned choice here. ArrayList and LinkedList are different implementations of the storage mechanism for a List . ArrayList uses an array that it must resize if your collection outgrows it current storage size. LinkedList on the other hand uses the linked list data structure from CS 201. LinkedList is better for some head- or tail-insert heavy workloads, but ArrayList is better for random access workloads.
