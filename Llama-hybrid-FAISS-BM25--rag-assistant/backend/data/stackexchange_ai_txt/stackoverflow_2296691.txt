My answer to you will be very high level as this is not simple, as you can imagine. You probably are doing some sort of image segmentation, where you segment each character of your text. But in order to recognize the characters, even when they are rotated, you need to use a feature vector with rotational invariant characteristics. To do it some people are using Zernike Moment Neocognitron neural network - widely used for handwriting I don't think it's a simple task
