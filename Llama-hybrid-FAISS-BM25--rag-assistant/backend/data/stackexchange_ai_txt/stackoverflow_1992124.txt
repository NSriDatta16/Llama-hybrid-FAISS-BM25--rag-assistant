You can use LDAP also as lookup-addressing mechanism to retrieve resources, for example Database-Connections or remote-services. The nice thing I like about LDAP is, that you can retrieve stuff in directory/URL style. This is quite different to RDBMS where you have to use a dedicated query-language. This often makes sense and is intuitive if things are organized in a hierachical way.
