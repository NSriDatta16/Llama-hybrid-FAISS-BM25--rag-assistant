At this time, Azure Queues cannot be made public. As you have noted, this "privacy" is enforced by requiring all Storage API calls made in RE: to queues to be authenticated with a signed request from your key. There is no "public" concept similar to public containers in blob store. This would follow best practice in that even in the cloud you would not want to expose the internals of your infrastructure to the outside world. If you wanted to achieve this functionality, you could expose a very thin/simple "layer" app on top of queues. A simple WCF REST app in a web role could expose the queuing operations to your consumers, but handle the signing of api requests internally so you would not need the queues to be public.
