Since I don't seem to be permitted to comment yet I'll add my comments to Noah's answer here. I've successfully achieved this by the method that Noah Witherspoon described. I worked around the jumping behavior by simply not calling the setContentOffset: method when the scrollview is past its edges. - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { // Don't snap when at the edges because that will override the bounce mechanic if (self.contentOffset.x self.contentSize.width) return; ... } I also found that I needed implement the -scrollViewWillBeginDecelerating: method in UIScrollViewDelegate to catch all cases.
