I recommend placing it in the DB. It makes little sense building a special format for storage and access of this data, just to avoid going through the DB. What about simultaneous accesses from multiple instances of your application (a likely scenario in a web app)? With a DB you can leave these worries to the DB engine if you just use it correctly. With your home-cooked file format you'll be in trouble.
