I don't think you have the information to make that call. To do so you'd need to know whether the probability curve was normalised (probably) and whether it was skewed (almost certainly) plus what the various statistical values associated were (mean, standard deviation and so on). If you have those I don't think you'd be asking. In addition to that your skill in estimating, the assumptions you've made and their accuracy and so on are all factors, most of which are very hard to quantify. It's why evidence based scheduling is good - you don't have to understand exactly why things take a certain amount of time, you just know that they do. A couple of simple things I'd say you should think about: 1) In my experience the realistic chances of it being your lowest estimate are roughly zero. Shit happens on software projects, most people aren't that good at estimating and things will go wrong. If you want a good estimate then go with that. 2) Think very carefully about what you want the number for. If you're going to give it to a client or most managers then: (a) they won't remember the caveats, the won't remember the top end of the range and the won't remember the probabilities or the theory. They'll remember the nice low number you gave them and the rest is just "wah wah wah". (b) clients and managers want certainty so you need to give them something you're certain about. If you assume that your estimate is normally distributed and you have your best case and worst case values, if you give them an average of the two you will miss your deadline 50% of the time. From a managers perspective that's bad. If you want to hit your deadline 95% of the time then you need to be giving the mean + 2 standard deviations. Again if you want a rough estimate then your worst case is probably the easiest number to grab. Generally under promise and over deliver. Be the guy who never misses deadlines and often delivers early. That doesn't involve changing the way you work, you just have to manage expectations.
