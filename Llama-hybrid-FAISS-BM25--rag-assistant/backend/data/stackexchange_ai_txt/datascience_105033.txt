Basically yes, weights are used for attribute or feature importance. Gradient Boosted Tree weights are the best for feature importance in my tests for most of data. But there are other methods like PCA, Weights by Correlation but the performance would be worse. Also deep learning first two layers (input and first hidden layer) can be used to measure importance of features.
