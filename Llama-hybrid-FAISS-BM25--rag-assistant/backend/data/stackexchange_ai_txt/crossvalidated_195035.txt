Which regression model should I build?

I'm trying to handle a dataset about student performance in 2 Portuguese Schools in the subject of Portuguese. Student grades go from 0 to 20, discrete. I have a set of 30 Regressors (all but 3 numerical, the other categorical)and 3 response variables (student grades after first, second and third semester). I would like to conduct a Bayesian Analysis over the dataset. As such I thought about a blueprint like this one: Building a linear semiconjugate model, with priors over Beta|Sig^2 and Sig^2 being a P-variate normal (P= number of regressors +1) and an Inverse-Gamma. Given that I don't have any prior literature I was considering to use the OLS estimate of the coefficients as mean of the normal distribution and the Sig^2 Ols as estimate of the mean of the inverse gamma one (even if that is not strictly bayesian as I use data for the prior). In alternative I would use the Zellner G prior. The response would be just one of the 3 scores. Since the first is not a completely bayesian model and the second uses no information a priori I was wondering how to use some of the information available in literature regarding the strong correlation between parents education/job/status(divorced or not) to build a prior on Betas. Unfortunately I don't have a priori information over all 30 predictors so I'm puzzled. The other linear model I would build is a generalized one, where the response y is now multinomial (21 levels), but I don't have a clue on which model to implement between a cumulative logit/probit and I find it hard to picture a bayesian model behind it (may be a Dirichlet Process? ) . The dataset is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance I just transformed the variables MotherEducation, FatherEducation, MotherJob and Father Job (with k levels) into k-1 dummies given there is no mathematical meaning to the number associated to the level.
