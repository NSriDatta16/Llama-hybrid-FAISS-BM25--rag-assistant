I don't understand how doing Bayesian Inference using MCMC is not considered optimization?

I've read many documents/articles on Bayesian Inference using MCMC and they always mention that this is not optimization. Now, I understand that MCMC is only used to compute integrals and that this integral is the one needed for the normalization constant in Baye's theorem. Let's say we're doing bayesian inference to infer the 2 parameters of a straight line. Are we not trying to maximise the log probability at each iteration to converge towards the best possible values for these 2 parameters? If so, why is this not optimization? If not, what are we doing exactly and how are we obtaining these "best-fit" values? In this example, is the Markov Chain simply the prior distributions from which we sample our 2 parameters? I hope my questions are clear! Thank you very much.
