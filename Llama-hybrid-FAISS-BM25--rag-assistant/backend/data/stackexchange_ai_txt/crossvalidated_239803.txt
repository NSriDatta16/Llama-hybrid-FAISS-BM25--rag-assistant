Using generative models for classification

I think I never saw a generative model used for a classification task: usually a discriminative model is used; Sometimes (AFAIK, with deep neural networks) a generative model is created as a pre-training step, but then it is used to build a discriminative model - which usually performs better in classification tasks. Can we use P(Y=label,X=data) to classify any given data using a generative model? How are generative models used in classification tasks? If they are not used, why is it so?
