It's not a silly question, but the concepts should be clear. If we denote your random variables as $X_1$ and $X_2$ , the average will be $\bar{X}=\frac{X_1+X_2}{2}$ , and we can find the variance of it via a simple calculation noting that the two RVs are independent: $$\operatorname{var}\left(\frac{X_1+X_2}{2}\right)=\frac{\operatorname{var}(X_1)+\operatorname{var}(X_2)}{4}=\frac{5+6}{4}=\frac{11}{4}$$ This calculation has nothing to do with the means of $X_1,X_2$ , as well as the measurement values. Informally, variance of an unknown $X_1$ can be non-zero. However, variance of a known $X_1$ is $0$ because it is known and therefore constant. So, variance of $X_1=250$ will be $0$ , and it actually means something like $\operatorname{var}(X_1|X_1=250)$ , mathematically, which is $0$ . Measurement random variables have non-zero variance, but the measurement itself is fixed and have no variance (e.g. it is 250 always since you measured it).
