ARIMA, Simple Moving Average, and Exponential Smoothing

I have time series data about a museum visitors in each month since 2011 to 2019. This data has seasonality. If I want to forecast the visitors in 2020, what forecasting method I should use? ARIMA, Simple Moving Average, or Exponential Smoothing? and why? Thank you :)
