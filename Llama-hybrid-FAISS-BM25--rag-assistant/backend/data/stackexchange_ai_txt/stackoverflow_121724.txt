Where can I find free WPF controls and control templates?

I am looking for some recommendations on good places to find libraries of controls/templates/styles for WPF. I know about the usual places like Infragistics, but it seems to me that there should be some kind of community effort by now to share nice, clean, well written controls for WPF controls. I am not big on the design side, and it would be nice to fill out my personal libraries with some nice examples from people who are better at design. Any ideas or recommendations?
