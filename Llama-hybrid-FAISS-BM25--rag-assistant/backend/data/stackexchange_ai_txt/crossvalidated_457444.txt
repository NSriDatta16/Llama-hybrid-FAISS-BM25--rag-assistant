The researcher-analyst may be better off subjecting the data to stepwise regression – a method whereby the predictive variables are added to the regression models in steps. In each step, a variable is considered for addition to, or subtraction from, the set of explanatory variables, based on some pre-determined and specified criterion. Usually, this takes the form of a sequence of F-tests or t-tests, but other techniques, such as adjusted R², Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and Mallows's Cₚ are possible.
