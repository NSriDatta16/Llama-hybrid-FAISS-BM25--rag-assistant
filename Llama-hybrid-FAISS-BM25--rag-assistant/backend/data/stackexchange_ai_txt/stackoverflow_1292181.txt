Fill a zend::form select from db

I have a result array fetched form database. It's structure in print_r is like this : Array ( [id] => 1 [code] => MSjoo7 [description] => Hello World [Organization_id] => 1 ) Now I want to set these fetched values in my Zend Form's elements some think like this: Code: MSj007 Description : Hello World https://imageshack.com/lost/0jscreenshotxlsp For getting above output I also used : $Form->populate( $result_array); but the browser does not show anything.
