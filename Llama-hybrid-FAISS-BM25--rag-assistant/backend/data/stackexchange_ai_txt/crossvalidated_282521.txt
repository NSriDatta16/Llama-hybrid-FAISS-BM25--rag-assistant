First, in logistic regression it's not the probability $p=P(y=1)$ that is modelled as a linear function of the coefficients, but the logit $\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$. Second, you could to some extent automate the search for a perfect polynomial transformations of the original features with fractional polynomials as described in Hosmer, Lemeshow, Sturdivant. Applied logistic regression, 2013, 4.3.3, and implemented in R package mfp .
