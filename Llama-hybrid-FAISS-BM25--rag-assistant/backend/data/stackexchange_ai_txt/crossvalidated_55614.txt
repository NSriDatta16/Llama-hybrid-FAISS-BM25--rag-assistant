Log, geometric and elasticity

Suppose I want to calculate the average annual growth in GDP per capita from year 1980 to 1988. I suppose this is done by ln(gdp per capita 1998) - ln(gdp per capita 1990) ? So for example: ln(900)-ln(100) / 8 = 0.2747 , so 27.47%. But if I take the start value times the growth increase i get: 100 x 1.2747^8 = 697 But if I use the geometric growth average (compound annual growth) to calculate growth I get: 8^âˆš(900/100) = 1.316 , so 31.6%. and taking the start value times growth increase i get: 100 x 1.316^8 = 899.6 , so almost exact 900. Does the log difference method underestimate the growth increase? Why? Which is best to use? And if I have calculated the growth rate with the geometric approach and regress it against another percentage change in say increase of cars (growth of cars bought), would such a relationship be an elasticity between average growth in gdp per capita and average growth of cars?
