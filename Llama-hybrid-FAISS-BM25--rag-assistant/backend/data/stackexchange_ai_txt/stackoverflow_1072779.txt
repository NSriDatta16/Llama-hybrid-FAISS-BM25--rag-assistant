Ahh, libraries... There are two conflicting purposes here: Sanity when updating scripts (ie. not breaking 10 other apps). Keeping things in one organized logical place for developer efficiency. I suggest you take a close look at git and git submodules We use git submodules extensively for this very purpose. It allows the best of both worlds because shared scripts can be upgraded at will in any project, and then that change can be moved to the other projects (deliberately) when you have time to do so and test correctly. Of course, you need to be using git to take advantage of submodules, but if you are not using git, and you start , you'll eventually wonder how you ever lived without it. Edit: Since the original poster is using svn, consider using SVN Externals .
