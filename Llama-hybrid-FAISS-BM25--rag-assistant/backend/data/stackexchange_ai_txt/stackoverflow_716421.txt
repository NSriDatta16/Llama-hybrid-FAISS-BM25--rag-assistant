Working with USB in C (Windows)

This is a few questions compiled into one post. 1) What would be the best way to tell if a USB mass storage device is plugged in. 2) What is the best way to write data to a USB drive 3) Can you treat the memory on a usb drive as you would in regular memory.. (Could I use like malloc and or write directly two it with values/ and or zero it out?)
