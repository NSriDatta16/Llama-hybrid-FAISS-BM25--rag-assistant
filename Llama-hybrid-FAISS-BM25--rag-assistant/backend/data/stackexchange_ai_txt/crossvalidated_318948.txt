In H2O Deep Learning, the term "iteration" refers to a MapReduce iteration. There are two related parameters: train_samples_per_iteration (usually best to leave the default) score_each_iteration (False by default; set to True to get more frequent scoring) The term "epoch" has the traditional meaning of one pass through all the training examples. There is more information in the section 5.2.4 of the H2O Deep Learning Booklet .
