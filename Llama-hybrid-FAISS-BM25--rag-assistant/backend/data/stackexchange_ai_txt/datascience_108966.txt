How to deal with variable length input in the architecture of deep learning methods?

I am working on a variable-length classification problem. I want to utilize multiple Deep learning methods in combination, like CNN, LSTM, attention, etc. Now I'm quite confused and having difficulty preparing and feeding data into the model. I am receiving plenty of errors but had no idea why. As a result, I am eagerly looking for help. I am doing implementation Tensorflow Keras libraries. Is there any help or guidance available implementation wise as well as theoretical?
