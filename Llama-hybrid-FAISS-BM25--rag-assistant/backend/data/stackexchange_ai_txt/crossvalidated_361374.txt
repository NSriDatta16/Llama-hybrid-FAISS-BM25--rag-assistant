The values s=267.8483 -106.6074 -69.7656 -91.4754 Are the initial values of the seasonal components that were used to estimate your model. Choice of initial values in exponential smoothing and state space models (which is what ETS uses) is tricky, and can have an influence on the quality of the forecast. I assume that ETS() is returning the estimates of the initial states for informational purposes. tell me which quarters have seasonality (and thus need to be accounted for in any model)? Seasonality is a concept that applies to a time series as a whole, not a specific period of the series. So you can't have some quarters that have seasonality and others that don't. The final model that ETS produces already accounts for your seasonality, so you don't need to account for it. If you want to isolate and visualize the seasonal components in your data, then you should try decompose() or stl(). They will display the seasonal component of your data.
