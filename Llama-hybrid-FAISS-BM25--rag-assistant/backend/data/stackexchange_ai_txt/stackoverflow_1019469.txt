My own system is: Index cards for immediate jotting down of things I need to remember or reference. (Almost all of these get thrown away by the end of the day.) OmniOutliner for personal notes OmniFocus for to-do lists Bug-tracking system comments for info about tracking down and fixing bugs Wiki for info to be shared with team Blog for stuff that might be of general interest to programmers everywhere Typically, things start in OmniOutliner then get copied-and-pasted to other systems as appropriate. My Macbook's Spotlight search is good at finding things, so I don't worry too much about organization.
