deep learning keras best practices

There isnt a lot of wisdom here but on a regression data set, I can get a slightly lower RSME with adding in a learning rate schedule for exponential decay. The curve on the plot is also slightly smoother too. Its sort of hard to see but this first plot is with adding the exponential decay. Exponential decay, Final RSME is 6.5 No exponential decay, final RSME is 7.5 Would anyone have any other tips to try for deep learning tuning/better performance? This is my script with tf.keras below. The model depth is something I already experimented with on the layers & amount of epochs... import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import math import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from scipy.stats import t from tensorflow.keras import backend import os # This function keeps the learning rate at 0.001 # and decreases it exponentially after that. def scheduler(epoch): if epoch
