As others have said, dummy variables is one method. Another method is to take quantitative statistics from the populations having that property. For instance, you can create a "marital situation average" column, and populate it with the average value of the target variable among people with the same marital situation as that subject. If you are using a tree method, simply assigning integers to each category will approximate dummy variables, especially if there are only a few categories. For instance, if the only categories for marital situation are Married, Single, Divorced, and Widowed, and you assign them 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively, then the only possible splits are Married vs. Everything else, Widowed vs. Everything else, or Married/Single vs Divorced/Widowed. So two thirds of the splits are effectively dummy variables, and the last one will turn into a dummy variable as soon as you split on that variable again.
