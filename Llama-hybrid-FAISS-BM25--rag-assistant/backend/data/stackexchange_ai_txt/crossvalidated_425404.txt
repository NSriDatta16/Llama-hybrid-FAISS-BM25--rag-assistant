In VAE we encode the image and take its statistics (mean and variance) I wouldn't take the word "encode" too seriously here. The encoder parameterizes an approximate posterior $p(z|x)$ . 1) How these two vectors are defining acording to what? How the dimensions of these vectors be formed? The encoder network outputs the mean and variance of the approximate posterior (which is typically gaussian with diagonal covariance). The dimensionality of the latent space is a hyperparameter. 2) if we want to edit a image with using VAE for example changing the color of skin or adding make up, how do we know the exact place of these fetures' places in the latent place? By trial and error.
