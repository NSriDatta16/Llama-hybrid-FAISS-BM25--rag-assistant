C++: Should I use global variables or class member pointers to communicate between modules?

In my project, I have multiple subsystems organized as classes. I need those classes to communicate (so be able to access the other one via a pointer), and I want to implement this in the best way as possible. I basically see three possible solutions here: If subsystem X needs to access subsystem Y, add a member variable to class X pointing to an instance of Y. When X is created, pass to it the pointer to Y and have the member variable m_pSystemY set. Declare a global variable CSystemX * g_SystemX for every subsystem. It will be filled with a pointer to the freshly created subsystem instance on program start. Later on, you can easily access it from anywhere. Create a sophisticated subsystem manager class. All subsystems are stored in an array. You need to call a function in order to access a specific subsystem. My questions: Which one of these solutions should I use for my game engine project? Does anybody of you have personal experience with any of these methods?
