On the server side, you are welcome to use whatever you are comfortable with. On the client side, for Android, I would recommend serializing to JSON instead of XML, simply because the org.json package supports creating JSON, and there are no classes in Android well-suited for creating XML. You are welcome to use the Serializable interface in Java and convert your Java objects to byte arrays for storage and retrieval, but then you are locked into Java, which may not be a sound plan for future flexibility.
