Google has done more than simple text search for images, see this post on Google Official Blog . Remember that image search on visual features (Content Based Image Retrieval - CBIR) is a open research problem . Global color histogram can be disapointing (for example, USA and France flags present similar global color histograms - but they are very different). Local color histograms can produce better results for that flags example. You could take a look on Nuno Vasconcelos' work at UCSD.
