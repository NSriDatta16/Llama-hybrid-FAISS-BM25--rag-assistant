Is the random slope for a binary, categorical variable in a mixed model also reported in reference to one of the categories?

I'm wondering if I should be interpreting an estimated random slope for a binary categorical variable in the same way that I should be interpreting it if it were a fixed effect. That is, is it reported as a comparison against a reference. So for example, I'm analyzing mini-golf performance and trying to assess how player handedness impacts the probability of a hole-in-one while controlling for random effects for multiple observations at each hole and for each player. So the model looks like: glmer(hoi ~ hand + (hand | hole) + (1 | player), family = binomial(link ='probit'), data = minigolf) For the fixed effects, the model intercept is -1.96 and the intercept for handRight is -0.018 . So the expected probability, assuming the average player and hole, for lefties is -1.96 %>% pnorm and for righties, it is (-1.96 - 0.018) %>% pnorm The model also reports a random intercept and slope for handedness for each hole. So let's say the intercept and slope for hole1 is -.11 and .019 , respectively. Would calculating the expected value for lefties on that hole, assuming average players, then be (-1.96 - .11) %>% pnorm and the probability for righties be (-1.96 - 0.018 -.11 +.019) %>% pnorm ?. That is, is the slope for handedness in a random effect also reported in reference to lefties, which would be reflected in the random intercept alone?
