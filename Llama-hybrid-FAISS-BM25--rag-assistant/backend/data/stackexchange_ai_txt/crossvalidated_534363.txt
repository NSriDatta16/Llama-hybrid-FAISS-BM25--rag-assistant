Linear Trend for Stock Price Prediction

I have a very simple, and probably a stupid question. Though, I would like to ask. Suppose we have $Y_1,...,Y_N$ price observations of a particular stock. I assume that $Y_{N+1}$ can be forecasted using linear trend, so it is needed to estimate parameters of the following equation: $$Y_t=\alpha+\beta\times t+\epsilon_t.$$ By definition, time series $t$ is non-stationary, then how we can explicitly estimate equation in the above form using OLS?
