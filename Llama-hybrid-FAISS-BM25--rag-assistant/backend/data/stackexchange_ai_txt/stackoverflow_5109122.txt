UpdatePanel's PostbackTrigger that is inside a usercontrol inside a masterpage?

I have a masterpage and inside that masterage is a user control that has a toolbar with a save button. I then have an aspx page that inherits form t he master page. In that page I have and updatepanel. Is it possible to set the post back trigger to the Save button inside the usercontrol?
