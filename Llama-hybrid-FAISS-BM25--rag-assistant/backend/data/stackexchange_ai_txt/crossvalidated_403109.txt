One virtue of significance testing is the ability to conclude 'data compatible with no difference [two-sided question] / no superiority [one-sided question]'. In your situation [the one-sided one], if the observed superiority in the data is "significant," i.e., NOT well compatible with zero trrue superiority, then it is even less compatible with a negative superiority (i.e., inferiority) of whatever magnitude one might hypothesize. So you conclude: Superior! The Ho vs. H1 of your question do fit into what I have just written. (But note that in some situations the "even less" argument doesn't work because the model structure is non-monotonic. For instance, if a slight inferiority is accompanied by a big increase in data variance. - Here we typically have cum. distr. curves of the data average that cross, and likelihood graphs that are non-monotonic.)
