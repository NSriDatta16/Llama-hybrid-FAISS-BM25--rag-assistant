Featurization for Relation Extraction using Support Vector Machine(SVM)

Regarding Relation Extraction using SVM paper( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225671271_Relation_Extraction_Using_Support_Vector_Machine)I am looking for any code references on how to make features(word, pos, syntactic features, semantic feature types, chunk tags,distance) for relation extraction between two entities. Entity1 - Drugs, Entity2 - Disease, Relation types:1.taking a drug caused disease 2. Drug was taken for a disease, first model is a binary classification model to classify if the entities are related to each other or not. Second model takes only positive outputs from first model and classifies the relation which is a multi class classification model
