There's no such thing as a 'free thread'. There's only an unused core. You can simply count them with Environment.ProcessorCount and base you threading strategy on that. Not leveraging the ThreadPool is usually a mistake, it does a good job distributing tp threads across cores. But it doesn't easily give you what you ask for, ThreadPool.GetAvailableThreads is a constantly changing number. Should be anyway.
