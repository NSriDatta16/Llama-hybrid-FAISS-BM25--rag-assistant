It is kind of hard to interpret the results of a KPCA. The PCA, enables you to understand the created variables as a linear combinations of the original predictors. However you loose it when you use KPCA, since the individuals are not expressed in terms of (linear combinations of) features of your data set any longer, but in terms of their "kernelized" inner product with respect to the other elements. The following paper is a great help in understanding what is going on when doing KPCA. http://pca.narod.ru/scholkopf_kernel.pdf Here, the author proposes a variable importance score based on SVM : http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/rakotomamonjy03a/rakotomamonjy03a.pdf
