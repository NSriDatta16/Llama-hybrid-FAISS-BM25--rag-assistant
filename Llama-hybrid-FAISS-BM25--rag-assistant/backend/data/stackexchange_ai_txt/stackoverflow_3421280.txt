Winforms. ObjectDataSource add calculated column

I use ObjectDataSource and bind IEnumerable[Person] to my DevExpress GridView class Person { private int Id {get; set;} public string Name {get; set;} } At grid there are two columns Id,Name. I want new column "Sum", which is calculated by person object(aggragate by person). At asp.net I create new column and calculate its value at RowDataBound event. At winforms I don't see this event and other appr. So what should I do in this case. Where can I handle binding moment? Thanks
