One way is to use delayed performance. Store the current contentOffset . Do the selection with selectRowAtIndexPath:animated:scrollPosition: and then immediately call performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: with a very small delay (0.1, say). In the method you call with performSelector:... , ask for the current contentOffset again. If it hasn't changed, I think you may assume it isn't going to - we are not going to scroll! So you may proceed with your metadata display now. If it has changed, then do nothing and let your scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation take care of it. I know this seems sort of skanky, but I find myself using delayed performance a lot to work around automatic animations of this sort.
