In CMS>Manage Pages create and enable a new page (or you could use a static block) e.g. call the page My Contact Form with a url ID of my-contact-form and a layout that matches your theme. For the content of the new page add {{block type='core/template' template='contacts/mycontactform.phtml'}} Now in your template folder (app/design/frontend/default/default/template/contacts for default theme in Magento 1.3.x) copy the existing form.phtml file, rename it to mycontactform.phtml and copy it back to the contacts folder. Edit the new mycontactform.phtml code and html as you wish to create your new contact form. Load the new form by going to http://www.example.com/my-contact-form Hope that helps...
