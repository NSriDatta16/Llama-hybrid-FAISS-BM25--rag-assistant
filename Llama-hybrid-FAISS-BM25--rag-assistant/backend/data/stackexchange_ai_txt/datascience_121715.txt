GAN Output Gradient Calculation

Loss function for discriminator, which needs to be maximized: -log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z))). Loss function for generator, which needs to be maximized: log(D(G(z))) What would the calculation of the loss gradient of the output value of the discriminator look like? What would the calculation of the loss gradient of the generator output look like?
