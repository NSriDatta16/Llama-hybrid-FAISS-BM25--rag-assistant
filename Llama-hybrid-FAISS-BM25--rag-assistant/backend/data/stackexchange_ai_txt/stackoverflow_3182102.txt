Return to nowhere in C source code(?)

Take look at the code that follows. "Hello " "World!"; "The number is ", 37; int x=23; char *y="232"; x,x+2,x*3; atoi(y) - x; It is a perfectly valid fragment of C(99) source. But! All that expressions return to nowhere! How can one trace or even use all this anonymous values? Where are they stored and what is their purpose?
