Aggregate functions like MIN/MAX aren't supported in indexed views. You have to do the MIN/MAX in the query surrounding the view. There's a full definition on what is and isn't allowed within an indexed view here (SQL 2005). Quote: The AVG, MAX, MIN, STDEV, STDEVP, VAR, or VARP aggregate functions. If AVG(expression) is specified in queries referencing the indexed view, the optimizer can frequently calculate the needed result if the view select list contains SUM(expression) and COUNT_BIG(expression). For example, an indexed view SELECT list cannot contain the expression AVG(column1). If the view SELECT list contains the expressions SUM(column1) and COUNT_BIG(column1), SQL Server can calculate the average for a query that references the view and specifies AVG(column1).
