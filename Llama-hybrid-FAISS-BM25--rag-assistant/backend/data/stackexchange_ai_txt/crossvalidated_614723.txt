Combining Bayesian and Frequentist Estimation into a Single Model?

We are usually told the following: In the Frequentist Probability Approach, we are told that: the data is random but the parameters being estimated are fixed In Bayesian Probability Approach, we are told that: the data is fixed but the parameters being estimated are random Conceptually, both approaches have their advantages: Often in the real world, the data we collect can be thought of as random - for example, if we collect the same data on a different day, the data might not be exactly the same as the data from another day. Therefore, treating the data as random might have its benefits. On the other hand, the parameters we are trying to estimate can also be thought of as random - many times the "true" values of these parameters are not directly observable and might inherently have some level of randomness encoded within themselves. Therefore, treating the parameters as random might also have its benefits. I was wondering about the following question: Is it possible to combine both of these approaches together such that both the data and the parameters are considered as random? This way we can get the best out of both worlds? Thanks!
