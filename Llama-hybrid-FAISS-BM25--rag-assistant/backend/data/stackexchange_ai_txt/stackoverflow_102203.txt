as a rule of thumb use the stack whenever you can. i.e. when the variable is never needed outside of that scope. its faster, causes less fragmentation and is going to avoid the other overheads associated with calling malloc or new. allocating off of the stack is a couple of assembler operations, malloc or new is several hundred lines of code in an efficient implementation. its never best to use the heap... just unavoidable. :)
