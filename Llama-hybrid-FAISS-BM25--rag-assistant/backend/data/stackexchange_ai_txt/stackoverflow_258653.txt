One of the challenges that you will have is to align the data in each of the different systems so that it can be integrated in the first place. It may be that each of the systems that you want to integrate holds entirely different sets of data but more likely it is data that is overlapping. Before diving into writing API:s (which is the route I would take as well given your description) I would recommend that you try and come up with a logical data model for the data that needs to be integrated. This data model will then help you leverage the data that you are having in the different systems and make it more useful to the other databases. I would also highly recommend an iterative approach to the integration. With legacy systems there is so much uncertainty that trying to design and implement it all in one go is too risky. Start small and work your way to a reasonably integrated system. "Fully integrated" is hardly ever worth aiming for.
