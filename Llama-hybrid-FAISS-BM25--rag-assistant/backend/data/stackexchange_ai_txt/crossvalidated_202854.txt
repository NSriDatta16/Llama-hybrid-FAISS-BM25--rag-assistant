Approximating GLM with a linear model

Let's say I have a model of $y$ with a single continuous independent variable $x$ that satisfies the GLM assumptions, but for computational reasons I prefer to run OLS instead. I replace $y$ with moving average of $y$ (as I change $x$), in the hope that in the new model the error becomes distributed closer to normal due to law of large numbers. Assuming that $x$ is sufficiently dense, would my OLS be a decent approximation for the GLM (in terms of both estimates and p-values), or am I missing something?
