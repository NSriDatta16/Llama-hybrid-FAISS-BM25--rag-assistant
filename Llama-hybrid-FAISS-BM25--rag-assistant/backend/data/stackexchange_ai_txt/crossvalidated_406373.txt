Pixel-wise classification of black & white high resolution images

I know of methods using CNNs with fully connected conditional random fields as additional interpolation, or fully convolutional networks which seem to be brutally slow. So I do not want to use these methods because my images are fairly simple (2 pixel values, maybe 20 at most if it turns out that black and white isn't enough, and 10-20 classes for each pixel). The only issue is that images are fairly high resolution (millions of pixels), so I assume I'd have to use GPU to get performance. What would be the direction here?
