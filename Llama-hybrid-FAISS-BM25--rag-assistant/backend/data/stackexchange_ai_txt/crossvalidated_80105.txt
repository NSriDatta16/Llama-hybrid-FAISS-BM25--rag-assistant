This is not a literature I am familiar with, but one way to approach this might be to ignore the fact that these are bootstrapped p-values, and look at the literature on combining p-values across multiply imputed data sets. In that case, Li, Meng, Raghunathan, and Rubin (1991) applies. The procedure is based on statistics from each of the imputed datasets, weighted using a measure of the information loss due to imputation. They run into issues related to the joint distribution of the statistics across imputations, and they make some simplifying assumptions. Of related interest is Meng (1994) . Update A procedure for combining p-values across multiply imputed datasets is described in the dissertation of Christine Licht, Ch. 4 . The idea, which she attributes to Don Rubin, is essentially to transform the p-values to be normally distributed, which can then be combined across MI datasets using the standard rules for combination of z-statistics.
