I posted a related question here . The answer involved using :join_table when declaring associations in the model. The error message "nil object" I was getting involved the object not getting instantiated. Sometimes, it seems the message comes up when there's no data in the table. The last error message, I have no answer for. Thanks for your responses. SO is asking if I want to place a bounty, but I think this is one of those problems that you just get and in solving something else it goes away. Sometimes, moving on is more pragmatic than trying to find out why.
