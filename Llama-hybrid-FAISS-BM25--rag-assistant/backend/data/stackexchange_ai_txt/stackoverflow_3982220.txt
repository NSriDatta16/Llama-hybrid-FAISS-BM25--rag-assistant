Pay attention to the grid spacing, Report + Report Properties, General tab, Grid spacing. The default setting is 0.125 inch, 4 points. With the "Snap to Grid" check box turned on, only font sizes that are a multiple of 4 are easy. If you try, say, a font of 10 points (not a multiple of 4) then you'll have a hard time sizing the text box.
