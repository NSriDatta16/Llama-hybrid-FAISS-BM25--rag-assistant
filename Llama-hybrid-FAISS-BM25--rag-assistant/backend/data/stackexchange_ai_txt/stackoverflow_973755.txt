Scrollable menu using MenuItem's

What I am trying to accomplish with Cocos2d, is to create a horizontal menu, which can be swiped from left to right. I posted an image, to show my idea. The image below has a white bar, where I want to show MenuItem objects, now I want to be able to do a swipe in the white region, so that the next menu item is centered. Example http://www.wimhaanstra.com/images/MenuExample.png The problem I am facing is, I would really like to use the Menu (& MenuItem) functionality of Cocos2d, but it seems somehow that the MenuItem object does not accept touches other than just tapping it. Also I want the swipe to be detected not only on the MenuItem, but the whole white bar. What would be the best approach for this? Somehow incorporate an UIScrollView, but that would be a shame, because I would like to use OpenGL for everything Subclasss the MenuItem class, to create one where the ccTouchBegan is handled, and somehow move the whole Menu? Just leave the whole Menu idea behind, and replace the Menu and MenuItems with sprites which support touching. I read somewhere that MenuItem's shouldn't really be used for this kind of work, but why not?
