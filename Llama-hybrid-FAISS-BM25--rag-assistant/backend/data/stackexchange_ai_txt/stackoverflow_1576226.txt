I'd like to encourage you to store your high scores in a more robust format. In particular I suggest JSON. import simplejson as json # Python 2.x # import json # Python 3.x d = {} d["version"] = 1 d["highscores"] = [[100, "Steve"], [200, "Ken"], [400, "Denise"]] s = json.dumps(d) print s # prints: # {"version": 1, "highscores": [[100, "Steve"], [200, "Ken"], [400, "Denise"]]} d2 = json.loads(s) for score, name in sorted(d2["highscores"], reverse=True): print "%5d\t%s" % (score, name) # prints: # 400 Denise # 200 Ken # 100 Steve Using JSON will keep you from having to write your own parser to recover data from saved files such as high score tables. You can just tuck everything into a dictionary and trivially get it all back. Note that I tucked in a version number, the version number of your high score save format. If you ever change the save format of your data, having a version number in there will be a very good thing.
