There are 2^32 â‰ˆ 4 billion confirmation codes, so brute force requires an average of 2 billion attemps. If they can only be tried online, that's enough, provided that the number of confirmation codes that can be tried by an attacked is significantly smaller than 2 billion. Note that this requires both a cap on the number of times a given confirmation code can be tried and on the total number of account resets accross all accounts. The latter could be a problem in some circumstances, for example if a news article announces (truely or falsely) that your user database has been compromised and everyone rushes to change their password. For an attacker targetting a specific account, the thing to be aware of is that this makes anyone who can receive mail at the given address in control of the account at your site. So not only anyone who impersonates the e-mail account, but anyone who can snoop on the e-mail account can impersonate the account at your site. That's not necessarily a problem, but it should appear clearly in your security model.
