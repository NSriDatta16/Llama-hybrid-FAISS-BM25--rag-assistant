Compare multinomial logistic regressions with multiple dependent variables

My dataset looks like this: agevote gender comcat1 comcat2 comcat3 comcat4 comcat5 1 0 1 High High High High High 2 1 0 Distributive Distributive Public Public Public 3 0 0 High High High Distributive Distributive 4 0 0 Public Public Public Public Public 5 1 1 6 0 1 Public Public High Public Public 7 0 0 High High Distributive Distributive Distributive 8 0 0 Public Public Distributive Distributive Distributive 9 0 1 10 1 1 Public Public High High High In this dataset, each row is a single person. comcat1 through comcat5 capture the assignments of a person to one of three different groups at five different time points (yearly). agevote and gender are my independent variables. I use multinomial regression to analyse how they affect assignment to groups. Given that the group assignment changes over time for individual observations, I would like to know if my independent variables contribute differently over time. Therefore, I run five regression models: mod1 And these are the corresponding results using the full dataset (N varies slightly due to missings): ========================================================================================= Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Distributive: (Intercept) 0.09 0.12 -0.06 0.19 0.12 (0.21) (0.20) (0.20) (0.21) (0.21) Distributive: gender -0.84 ** -0.91 *** -0.68 * -0.57 -0.57 (0.35) (0.34) (0.36) (0.35) (0.35) Distributive: agevote -0.00 -0.08 -2.16 *** -3.13 *** -2.32 *** (0.45) (0.44) (0.76) (1.04) (0.76) High: (Intercept) -0.20 -0.15 -0.26 -0.12 -0.23 (0.22) (0.22) (0.21) (0.22) (0.22) High: gender -0.26 -0.58 * -0.02 -0.05 0.05 (0.34) (0.35) (0.32) (0.33) (0.33) High: agevote -0.32 -0.49 -0.88 * -0.88 * -0.75 * (0.50) (0.52) (0.47) (0.45) (0.45) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AIC 497.31 499.11 499.24 499.95 495.31 BIC 517.83 519.72 520.00 520.71 515.96 Log Likelihood -242.66 -243.56 -243.62 -243.97 -241.65 Deviance 485.31 487.11 487.24 487.95 483.31 Num. obs. 226 229 235 235 231 K 3 3 3 3 3 ========================================================================================= My question now is: can I compare statistical significance levels and/or coefficients between the models? For example, can I argue that something that happened between time points 2 and 3 (model 2 and model 3) accounts for agevote becoming a significant predictor with a positive effect on assignment to the distributive group over the public goods group? I appreciate any help you can give and say sorry for any missing information in advance. I'm happy to add anything you think relevant as soon as possible. Thank you!
