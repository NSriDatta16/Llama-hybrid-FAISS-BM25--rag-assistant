Normal, tangent and binormal vectors form an orthonormal basis to represent tangent space . Tangent space ( sometimes called texture space ) is used in per-pixel lighting with normal maps to simulate surface detail ( imagine a wall or a golf-ball ). The tangent and binormal vectors represent the equivalent texture UVs i.e the vectors parallel to the surface normal. So technically speaking - as they form an orthonormal basis then binormal = cross (tangent,normal ) however in practice, since binormals and tangents are generated from the UVs in the normal map and may be averaged over several vertices then they may not be strictly orthonormal.
