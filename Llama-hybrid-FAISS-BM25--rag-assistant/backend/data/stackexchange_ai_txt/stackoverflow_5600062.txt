How do I remove the “My Cart” and “Checkout” menu links in Magento?

I'm using Magento 1.4 and I want to remove the "Checkout" and "My Cart" links from the top navigation menu. I know I have to change something in a layout file but I'm not sure which one. I searched for "checkout" and "addLink" but found nothing related to those two links.
