You have a lot of plots here, but let me just save you some time with these. The typical residual plots are here not going to be helpful because the outcome of a logistic regression can only span the range of $[0,1]$ . As such, this is why you get horizontal asymptotes and dual lines in your residuals. What's more, the residuals from GLMMs, as opposed to Gaussian mixed models, behave in fairly bizarre ways. A much better solution is to get residuals based on simulated data from the model. A package that allows for this is the DHARMa package, which has a very useful vignette on this topic here. I recommend running your residual analysis on these types of residuals instead, as they will be a lot more useful to you.
