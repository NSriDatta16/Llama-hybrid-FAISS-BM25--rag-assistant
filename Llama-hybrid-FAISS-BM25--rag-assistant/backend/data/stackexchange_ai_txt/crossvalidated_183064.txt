You can think of the variance as the average squared deviation from the mean. Your mean is clearly $0$. With three data, you have three deviations (and thus three squared deviations): \begin{align} &\ (1-0)^2 &=& &1^2& &=& &1 \\ &(-1-0)^2 &=& &-1^2& &=& &1 \\ &\ (0-0)^2 &=& &0^2& &=& &0 \end{align} The mean of $\{1, 1, 0\}$ is clearly $^2/_3$. I think your intuition is neglecting the fact that there is a $0$ deviation in the set.
