The thing is quite easy. In your ASPX: In your codebehind: protected void Paragraph_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e) { Control paragraph = (Control)sender; paragraph.Visible = !paragraph.CssClass.Contains("instructions"); } The codebehind will be hooked up automatically to the PreRender event handler in your class. This casts the sender to the control and sets its Visibility dependent on the css class. You just have to adjust the tags and you don't need a lot code traversing your control collection.
