Is there a 'has focus' in JavaScript (or jQuery)?

Is there something I can do like this (perhap via a plugin) if ( ! $('form#contact input]').hasFocus()) { $('form#contact input:first]').focus(); } Basically, set focus to the first input, but only if the user has not already clicked into anything? I know this will work too, but is there anything more elegant? $(function() { var focused = false; $('form#contact input]').focus(function() { focused = true; }); setTimeout(function() { if ( ! focused) { $('form#contact input:first]').focus(); } }, 500); });
