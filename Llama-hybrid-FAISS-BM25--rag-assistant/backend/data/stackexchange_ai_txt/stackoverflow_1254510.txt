The basic structure will be something like below: Public Sub ShowFontAndSize() Dim singleLine As Paragraph Dim lineText As String For Each singleLine In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs Debug.Print singleLine.Range.Font.Name Debug.Print singleLine.Range.Font.Size Next singleLine End Sub The catch will be that this won't sense if there are different fonts and sizes on the same line. If that's a possibility, you will need to add another loop with For Each singleCharacter In singleLine.Range.Characters inside of the paragraphs loop. Edit: A trickier problem is what to do with this data once you've collected it. Building up an array seems like the natural fit, but VBA arrays are borderline useless, since basic methods like .append() require you to redim the whole array. See http://www.cpearson.com/excel/VBAArrays.htm for more info if you would like to go down that road.
