Computing correlation (and the significance of said correlation) between a pair of time series

I have two time series S, and T. they have the same frequency and the same length. I would like to calculate (using R), the correlation between this pair (i.e. S and T), and also be able to calculate the significance of the correlation), so I can determine whether the correlation is due to chance or not. I would like to do this in R, and am looking for pointers/skeletal framework to get me started.
