Here's what I would do: First time out... "we're going to do this project jointly. I'm going to write the tests and you're going to write the code. Pay attention to how I write the tests, coz that's how we do things around here and that's what I'll expect of you." Following that... "You're done? Great! First let's look at the tests that are driving your development. Oh, no tests? Let me know when that is done and we'll reschedule looking at your code. If you're needing help to formulate the tests let me know and I'll help you."
