I and some others are working on this and have bespoke solutions ready for use. First, please join the discussion on groups.drupal.org: http://groups.drupal.org/lucene-nutch-and-solr Then, check out the nutch module for Drupal: drupal.org/project/nutch Finally, if you need to have it work with with multiple languages or in a multi-site environment, you'll need code that I've written and that will eventually be released as part of the drupal.org nutch project, but which isn't there yet. Watch the issue queue or contact me directly to get your hands on it. -Robert
