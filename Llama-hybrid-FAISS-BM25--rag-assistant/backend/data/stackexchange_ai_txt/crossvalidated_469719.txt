Matching biometrics with NHANES

Good morning everyone, I'm trying to figure out how to do some matching with NHANES datasets. Basically, I have a separate population of participants in a weight loss program, for which we do not have biometrics (we have age, gender, height, and weight for these participants). I've constructed two datasets, one for the participants from the weight loss program with age, gender, height, and weight, and a data set from NHANES for data cycles 2005-2016, which also contains age, sex, height, and weight, but also has biometric lab data for Blood Pressure, HDL, Serum Glucose, Glycohemoglobin, Fasting Glucose, Triglycerides, LDL, and Apolipoprotein (B). For the NHANES dataset, I've followed the instructions for merging multiple years, and have selected the proper weights for the individuals. What I'd like to do is use the NHANES dataset to figure out biometric data for the weight loss program participants. Can someone help me with what the steps for that would be? I've been doing a ton of reading around propensity matching, and inverse probability weighting, but I'm not 100% sure which one I should be using? It looks like propensity matching might not be the way to go, because that's more trying to estimate the effects of treatment, whereas inverse probability matching is more for filling in missing data (which I think this problem technically counts as?). But again, I'm not entirely sure, and I haven't been able to find explicit instructions for this particular problem, just general ideas. If someone has done something similar, or has input it would be awesome! Or perhaps a logistic regression could be used estimate the missing data? Those sound like they have some promise with this problem. If someone just has a clear cut "use this method" for this task, I can do the research and work myself, I was just hoping someone might be able to put me on the right path forwards :) . Again, any help or input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, have a great day!
