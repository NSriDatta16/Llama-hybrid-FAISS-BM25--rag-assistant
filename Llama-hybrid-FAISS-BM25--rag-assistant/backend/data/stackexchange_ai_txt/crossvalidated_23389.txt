In boosting we use weak learners mostly since they are trained faster compared to strong learners. Think about it. If I use Multi-Layer Neural Network as the learner, then I need to train lots of them. On the other hand, a decision tree may be a lot faster, then I can train lots of them. Let's say I use 100 learners. I train NN in 100 seconds and decision tree in 10 seconds. My first boosting with NN will take 100*100 seconds while second boosting with decision tree will take 100*10 seconds. That said I have seen articles, which uses strong learners in boosting. But in that problems that strong learners were fast in my opinion. I tried to train MLP on KDD99 Intrusion Detection Dataset, (4+ Million) using Weka. It took more than 72 hours on my machine. But boosting (AdaBoostM1 with Decision Tree - Decision Stump) took only 3 hours. In this problem it is clear that I can not use boosting with a strong learner, that is a learner which takes too much time.
