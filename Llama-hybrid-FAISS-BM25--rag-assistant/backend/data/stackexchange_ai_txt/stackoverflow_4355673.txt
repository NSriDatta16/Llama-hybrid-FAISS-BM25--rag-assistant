Building on Darin's solution, I would look for the generator tag for known blog editors and combine it with a lookup table of common sites, ie. WordPress.com , Blogspot.com , Livejournal.com , and so forth. That should give you 80-95% in the near term, though it won't be robust enough for an ongoing process over an extended period of time. An extended solution is much harder, given the amorphous definition of the term "blog". In which case, you'll want to consider breaking the list down into its hosting site and defining characteristics and create hard and fast rules on what constitutes a blog: Is it hosted by a blogging service provider? Is it listed in a blog aggregator, such as Technorati? Does it include blog-like services, such as user-generated articles, tags, and the ability to comment? Does it provide meta information that I can use to easily identify it as a blog? Does it otherwise identify itself as a blog, via the inclusion of the term "blog" or some other criteria? I can easily see a neural network constructed to determine if a page is a blog or not, but this serverely oversteps the bounds of your requirements. I'd say start simple, then extend your solution relative to the proposed lifetime of your system.
