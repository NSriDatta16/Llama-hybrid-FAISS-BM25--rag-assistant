Detect the location of AppData\LocalLow

I'm trying to locate the path for the AppData\LocalLow folder. I have found an example which uses: string folder = "c:\users\" + Environment.UserName + @"\appdata\LocalLow"; which for one is tied to c: and to users which seems a bit fragile. I tried to use Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData) but this gives me AppData\Local , and I need LocalLow due to the security constraints the application is running under. It returned blank for my service user as well (at least when attaching to the process). Any other suggestions?
