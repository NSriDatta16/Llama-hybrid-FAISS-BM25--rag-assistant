I see little to indicate any real trend. What do I mean by that? Well, look at these time series plots: Would you say they indicate trend? Many people would, but in fact all three are fair Bernoulli random walks -- each observation is the previous one $\pm 1$ (with equal chance of either going up or down). (plot is taken from this post ) I would not be inclined to say that those show a real trend because none of them are actually going anywhere -- the best guess at the next observation is always the current observation. If we look at the first differences, $Z_t=B_t-B_{t-1}$ we get zero-mean Bernoulli "noise" -- $\pm 1$ with equal chance of either. That idea of also plotting first differences of a series as well as the series itself can often be quite informative. So let us return to the wheat series. If you plot first differences, there's little to clearly suggest much beyond a random walk or perhaps random-walk-with-noise. The mean is nonzero but very close to it -- close enough that I wouldn't think to include a drift term in a random-walk model. [However, that random walk doesn't quite capture all the structure -- if we look at an ACF/PACF of first differences these would indicate some remaining serial correlation] If by seasonality you're asking about periodicity across multiple years, I see no clear indication of any cycles with a constant period in the data (e.g. ACF/PACF of first differences doesn't indicate anything). There's a mild effect at multiples of 5 year lag but it's quite weak and I'd be inclined to regard it as just noise.
