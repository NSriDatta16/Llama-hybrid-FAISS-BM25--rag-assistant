What options do I have for preprocessing data before entering it into a convolutional neural network?

So I am using about 1300 lines of statistical data from the 2017-2018 NHL season and I want to run it through a neural network, but I want to know what kind of pre-processing options I have. I have heard of normalization and mean subtraction, and so I did both of those to my data, and I was just deciding whether or not to balance and scale my data, but I realized that there is a lot more that I could do and am unaware of. I have seen countless tutorials doing many different things with data before entering it, from people doing absolutely nothing to people running KPSS tests to value decomposition and I really just would love a clearer picture on what I need to achieve with the preprocessing stage and ways to achieve it. I know this is a broad question but any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
