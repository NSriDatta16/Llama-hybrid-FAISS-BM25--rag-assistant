There's no built-in functionality to remove duplicates from arrays. Raj's answer seems elegant, but I prefer to use dictionaries. Dim d As Object Set d = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary") 'Set d = New Scripting.Dictionary Dim i As Long For i = LBound(myArray) To UBound(myArray) d(myArray(i)) = 1 Next i Dim v As Variant For Each v In d.Keys() 'd.Keys() is a Variant array of the unique values in myArray. 'v will iterate through each of them. Next v EDIT: I changed the loop to use LBound and UBound as per Tomalak's suggested answer. EDIT: d.Keys() is a Variant array, not a Collection.
