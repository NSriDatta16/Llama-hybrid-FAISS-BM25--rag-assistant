Your code is calling the remote GetTicketsStringInputs function : $client->__soapCall('GetTicketsStringInputs', ... The Fatal error you get indicates : Function ("GetTicketsStringInputs") is not a valid method for this service It seems pretty clear : the method you're trying to call doesn't exist, it is not provided by the remote web-service. So, to fix that Fatal Error, you have to stop calling that function ;-) You should check the WSDL of your webservice : does it really export such a method ?
