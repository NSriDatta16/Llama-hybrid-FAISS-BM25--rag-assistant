SQL Server VARCHAR(10)

When desiging a table in SQL Server Management Studio 2005, if I specify VARCHAR(10) for a column, when I tab away from the data type, SQL Server changes it to VARCHAR(50). I have to then tab back, change it back to VARCHAR(10), and it will then accept it. I understand that there are storage and processing considerations that may make VARCHAR(10) equivalent to CHAR(10) for all intents and purposes, but is there something I'm missing? Is there enough of a reason that I'm not considering, that the default behavior of the designer is to automatically change the length of the column from what I've specified?
