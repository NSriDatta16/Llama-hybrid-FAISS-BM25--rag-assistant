A logistic regression doesn't "agree" with anything because the nature of the outcome is 0/1 and the nature of the prediction is a continuous probability. Agreement requires comparable scales: 0.999 does not equal 1. One way of developing a classifier from a probability is by dichotomizing at a threshold. The obvious limitation with that approach: the threshold is arbitrary and can be artificially chosen to produce very high or very low sensitivity (or specificity). Thus, the ROC considers all possible thresholds. A discriminating model is capable of ranking people in terms of their risk. The predicted risk from the model could be way off, but if you want to design a substudy or clinical trial to recruit "high risk" participants, such a model gives you a way forward. Preventative tamoxifen is recommended for women in the highest risk category of breast cancer as the result of such a study. Discrimination != Calibration. If my model assigns all non-events a probability of 0.45 and all events a probability of 0.46, the discrimination is perfect, even if the incidence/prevalence is
