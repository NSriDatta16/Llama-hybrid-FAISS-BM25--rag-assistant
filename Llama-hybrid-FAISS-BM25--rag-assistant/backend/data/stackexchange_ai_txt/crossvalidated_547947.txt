Which trend has a better fit?

I have a time series data with 2 trend lines plotted; the red implies polynomial trend fitting while the black line is obtained from lowess (locally weighted smoothing). I'm not sure which trend line I should pick as they seem pretty much similar to each other. Any suggestions?
