NHibernate - set fetch mode on grandchildren objects

I have the following Criteria query (using Lambda extensions): var workflowResult = repository.GetSession() .CreateCriteria () .SetFetchMode (app => app.ApplicationWorkflows, FetchMode.Join) .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) .Future (); This is working correctly. Each Application eagerly loads the ApplicationWorkflows collection. However, I'd like to go one deeper and load the ApplicationStatus object of each ApplicationWorkflow. I can do this with the following HQL but would like to translate to Criteria: var workflowQuery = "SELECT DISTINCT app" + " FROM Application app" + " JOIN FETCH app.ApplicationWorkflows awf" + " JOIN FETCH awf.ApplicationStatus"; I've been advised to use the following, but am having issues with it working in all cases: .SetFetchMode (app => app.ApplicationWorkflows[0].ApplicationStatus, FetchMode.Join)
