You can use Amazon CloudFront for static resources that will be fetched by client browser (like image, static html, css, javascript). CDN (Content Delivery Network) services eliminates the latency issues for this type of data; below is the description of the service: Amazon CloudFront is a web service for content delivery. It integrates with other Amazon Web Services to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute content to end users with low latency, high data transfer speeds, and no commitments. Amazon CloudFront delivers your content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your objects are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance. Amazon CloudFront works seamlessly with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) which durably stores the original, definitive versions of your files. Like other Amazon Web Services, there are no contracts or monthly commitments for using Amazon CloudFront â€“ you pay only for as much or as little content as you actually deliver through the service.
