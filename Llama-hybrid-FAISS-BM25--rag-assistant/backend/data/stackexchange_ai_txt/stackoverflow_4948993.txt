highlight and make note in UIwebview

I am deveoping an ebook app for ipad/iphone which loads epub file. I would like to know how to highlight a text with a background color and make notes similar to iBook or Kindle in UIWebView and NOT UIView. I am able to drag select the text by long tapping. But I can only see "copy" option. I would like to add highlight and add note to that menu. How to hightlight the text with a background color?... My document is loaded in UIWebView. Thank you.
