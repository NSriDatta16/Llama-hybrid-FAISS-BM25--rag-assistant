How do I estimate a Bayesian linear regression without assuming normal likelihood?

Frequentist linear regression makes no assumptions about the joint distribution beyond finite second moments. How can I perform similar agnostic Bayesian linear regression, without imposing additional distributional assumptions beyond what is necessary? All examples I have seen assume normal likelihood.
