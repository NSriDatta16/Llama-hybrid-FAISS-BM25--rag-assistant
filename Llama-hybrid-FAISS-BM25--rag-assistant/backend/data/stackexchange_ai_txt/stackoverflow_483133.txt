I don't think your client wants to talk to you about any of those things... I Bet she is going to show you some drawings on how the page should be organized and how she expect things to work. You should just follow her presentation asking questions (always for the user point of view), so you can do your job as she expects. Leave the technical stuff for yourself ;)
