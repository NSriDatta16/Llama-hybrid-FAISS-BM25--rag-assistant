Adding Button on top of Table View - Interface Builder

I want to know how to add a UIRect Button on top of a table view using Interface Builder, like the one in this image: It's a + (plus) button on top of a table view. How to do this in Interface Builder? I can not drag the button onto the Table View. It can only placed below the table view.. Or it must be done only in the code?
