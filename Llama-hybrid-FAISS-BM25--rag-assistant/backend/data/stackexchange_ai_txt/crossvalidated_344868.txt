Many samples of the same identity for machine learning

This seems to be a simple question, yet I couldn't find a clear answer on the net. I'm using machine learning to classify ill/healthy patients based on their medical record (probably using a Random Forest algorithm) I'm new to ML and so far, all my data contained one row for one record/person/patient. Now, however, in my training data (labeled) each patient has about 11 records from the same medical test from different dates, and I wonder - should I aggregate then all into a one row for each patient, summing and averaging the different variables? Should I use more sophisticated techniques than simple average? or should I leave the data as is and let the machine figure it out?
