How can I top-align the content of a "fragile" frame in a LaTeX Beamer presentation?

So I am a total novice with LaTeX. I'm working on beamer presentations for introductory programming lectures, so I frequently use the examplebox object in my slides. I was told that whenever I have a frame that contains an examplebox, I need to declare it with the keyword 'fragile,' as in: \begin{frame}[fragile] I don't know precisely what this does, but I know my code will only compile if I use it. I have also gathered from the internet that if I want to top-align content on a frame, I add the 't' keyword, as in: \begin{frame}[t] Combining the two of these in what I, knowing very little about LaTeX, would consider to be the intuitive way, does not work. \begin{frame}[t][fragile] Nor does \begin{frame}[fragile][t] I'm guessing there is an easy solution to using both of these at the same time, but I'm having trouble finding a straight answer on the web. Can anyone shed some light? Thanks!
