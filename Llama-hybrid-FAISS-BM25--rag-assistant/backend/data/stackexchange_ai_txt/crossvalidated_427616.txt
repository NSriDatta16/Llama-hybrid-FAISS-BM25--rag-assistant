Should you take a sample when doing EDA?

Suppose i have a large dataset, such that python graphing libraries are unable to handle. Is it a good idea to take a random sample? Specifically if it's a classification task, and where the target is imbalanced. Could anyone point me to a rigorous resource to give this a theoretical explanation. Thanks EDIT : I'm aware of oversampling or undersampling techniques before creating a machine learning model. Im curious about Should i take a sample, before plotting the relationship of my variables?
