Why is it faster to create threads than it is to create processes?

Is it simply because they only need a stack and storage for registers so they are cheap to create ? Is the fact that threads can share common data, i.e they don't need to use interprocess communication a factor here ? Would this result in less need for protection ? Or do threads take advantage of multiprocessors better than processes ?
