Following @dimitris answer In the logistic multi-level models the odds ratio is a cluster-specific, which means it is based on the assumption of holding the random effect constant as well as other covaraites in the model. This is particularly problematic for a cluster-level variable as it has no variation within clusters. But you can transform the cluster-specific OR to population average OR or also called marginal OR by accounting for the shrinkage caused by the random effect using this equation Population average OR = cluster-specific OR /sqrt(1+0.346*( random effect variance ) This will give a quite similar or very close OR compared to the GEE Check out this Austin & Merlo 2017 article
