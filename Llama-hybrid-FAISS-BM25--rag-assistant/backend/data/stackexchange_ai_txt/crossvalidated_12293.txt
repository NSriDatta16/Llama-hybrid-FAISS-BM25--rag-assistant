You need to be clear what you mean by "prior". For example, if you are interested in my prior belief about the life expectancy in the UK, that can't be wrong. It's my belief! It can be inconsistent with the observed data, but that's another matter completely. Also context matters. For example, suppose we are interested in the population of something. My prior asserts that this quantity must be strictly non-negative. However the data has been observed with error and we have negative measurements. In this case, the prior isn't invalid, it's just the prior for the latent process. To answer your questions, Are there any issues concerning the validity of using data to evaluate a prior? A purist would argue that your shouldn't use the data twice. However, the pragmatic person would just counter that you hadn't thought enough about the prior in the first place. 2 Is any particular test best suited for this problem? This really depends on the model under consideration. I suppose at the most basic you could compare prior range with data range.
