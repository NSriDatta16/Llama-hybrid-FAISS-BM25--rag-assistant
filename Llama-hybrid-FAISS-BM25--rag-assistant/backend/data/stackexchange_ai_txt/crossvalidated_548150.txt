Most forecasters silently ignore the uncertainty in parameter estimation, because (a) there are no nice closed form solutions as there are in OLS (using a $t$ distribution instead of a normal, in order to account for the variance of parameter estimates), and (b) to be honest, it often does not really matter all that much. That said, you could of course try to get a handle on the estimation uncertainty of $\hat{\theta}$ (which, again, is in itself not easy to do in a time series context). Then get hopefully better predictive distributions by simulating many $\hat{\theta}_i$ according to the parameter distribution you assume, then for each $i$ , drawing $x_i\sim F(\hat{\theta}_i)$ . Then you can hope that the $(x_i)$ describe the true future density better than just a single $F(\hat{\theta})$ . This can then be iterated to get multi-step-ahead densities. Always assuming, of course, that you get a distributional handle on the corresponding parameter distributions. Any "reasonable" way of doing that should naturally yield larger variances for parameters that are farther out. Note that usually, there is also uncertainty in just how $\hat{\theta}$ relates to previous observations - in an ARIMA setting, that would be uncertainty about the ARIMA orders. And similarly, assuming that we know the distributional family $F$ may also be a heroic assumption.
