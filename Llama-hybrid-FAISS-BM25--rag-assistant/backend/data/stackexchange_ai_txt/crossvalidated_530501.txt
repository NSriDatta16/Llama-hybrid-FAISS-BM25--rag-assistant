To address the question of initial values, I would suggest you read Time Series Analysis by Durbin and Koopman (2012) who go into great detail on the exact diffuse initialisation procedure (this is implemented in the R package KFAS). Which is probably what you want to use in the case of a non-stationary model. For a stationary model, you can easily enough solve for the steady state and initialise with that. For a mixed model, and it's a little more tricky and often overlooked - suggest you refer to Doan (2010) Practical Issues with State-Space Models with Mixed Stationary and Non-Stationary Dynamics
