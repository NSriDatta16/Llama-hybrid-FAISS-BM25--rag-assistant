I arrived here via a search for how a regression got its name. Here are the interesting parts of what I found (mostly from wikipedia .) The term "regression" was coined by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean). 7,8 For Galton, regression had only this biological meaning, 9,10 but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl Pearson to a more general statistical context. 11,12 In the work of Yule and Pearson, the joint distribution of the response and explanatory variables is assumed to be Gaussian. This assumption was weakened by R.A. Fisher in his works of 1922 and 1925. 13,14,15 Fisher assumed that the conditional distribution of the response variable is Gaussian, but the joint distribution need not be. In this respect, Fisher's assumption is closer to Gauss's formulation of 1821. Also very interesting: In the 1950s and 1960s, economists used electromechanical desk "calculators" to calculate regressions. Before 1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression. 16 Sources Mogull, Robert G. (2004). Second-Semester Applied Statistics.
