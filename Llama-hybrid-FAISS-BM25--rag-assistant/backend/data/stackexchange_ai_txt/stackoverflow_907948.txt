There could be more that one reason to continue/break a loop. So it would look next: loop { if (cond1) { if (cond2) { if (cond2) { more conditions... } } } else { the loop action } } IMHO it's not so elegant and readable as the loop in your example, e.g: loop { if (cond1) continue; if (cond2) continue; if (cond2) continue; if( more conditions...) continue; the loop action } And you don't even need to understand all structure of all "if"s (it could be much more complex) to understand the loop logic. P.S. just for the case: I don't think the authors thought about how to write this loop, they just wrote it:)
