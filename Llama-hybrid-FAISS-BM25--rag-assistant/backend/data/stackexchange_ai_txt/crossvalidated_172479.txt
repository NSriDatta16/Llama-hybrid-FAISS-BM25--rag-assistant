One reason that you Random Forest may be overfitting may be because you have a lot of redundant features or your features are heavily correlated. If lot of your features are redundant, then when you perform the splits in the nodes of the trees, the algorithm may often only choose very poor features, which makes your model just chase some noise in your data. It is wise to look at the variable importance of the forest to try to identify if you have features that are maybe not relevant. You can also try to make some dimensionality-reduction/aggregation on the features.
