At which stage is the OOM error occurring, is it on data retrieval or processing data to XML file? If its data retrieval, get the data in batches. Get the total number of rows first, order the selects by the primary key and limit the rows selected to chewable sizes. If its at creating the XML file, send the XML node of each customer to System.out.println, don't hold it in memory. Launch the program via commad line and redirect all output to a file; java MyConverter > results.txt As you loop through the record all is saved in the file.
