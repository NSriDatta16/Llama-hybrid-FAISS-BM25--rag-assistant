Size of .apk is increasing with the increase with target devices (LDPI,MDPI,HDPI,X-Large Screens)

i have a developed an app targeting MDPI devices initially which is having many images and the size of the app is nearly 16MB. Now i need to target all the other device Screens.For this the images need to be replicated to Target these devices. Which increased the .apk to 45MB to 50MB. My question over here is this file size acceptable for market place? Or can i generate different .apk's for each target device and place it market place. so that based on device the downloading corresponding .apk will be downloaded? Please some one help out of this .. i have searched a lot on this and came to be futile ...
