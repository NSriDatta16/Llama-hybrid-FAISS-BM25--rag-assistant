Time Series Stationarity and Histograms

In a paper I am reading, the author discusses stationarity and plots the histogram of returns for the time series he is studying. I was wondering if there was any relationship between stationarity of a time series and the density of the returns? For example, if the density is normal, is this more likely to imply stationarity?
