Users need Silverlight 4.0 for Expression Blend?

I have Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 installed and Expression Blend Preview for .NET 4. When I began to debug it, it asked me to install Silverlight 4.0 beta. So now I am wondering if people who are going to view my application need to install Silverlight 4.0 instead of Silverlight 3.5. If so, how can I downgrade from 4.0 to 3.5?
