You would have to be dealing with a few BILLION rows before this makes any significant difference in terms of storage capacity. Lets say you have three columns, and instead of using a byte-equivalent database type, you use an int-equivalent. That gives us 3 (columns) x 3 (bytes extra) per row, or 9 bytes per row. This means, for "a few million rows" (lets say three million), you are consuming a whole extra 27 megabytes of disk space! Fortunately as we're no longer living in the 1970s, you shouldn't have to worry about this :) As said above, stop micro-optimising - the performance hit in converting to/from different integer-like numeric types is going to hit you much, much harder than the bandwidth/diskspace costs, unless you are dealing with very, very, very large datasets.
