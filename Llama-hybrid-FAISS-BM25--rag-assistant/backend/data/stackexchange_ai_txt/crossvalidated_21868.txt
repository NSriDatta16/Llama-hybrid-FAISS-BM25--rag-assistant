Gini coefficient and error bounds

I have a time series of data with N=14 counts at each time point, and I want to calculate the Gini coefficient and a standard error for this estimate at each time point. Since I have only N=14 counts at each time point I proceeded by calculating the jackknife variance, i.e. $\operatorname{var}(G) = \frac{n-1}{n} \times \sum_{k=1}^n (G(n,k)-\bar{G}(n))^2$ from equation 7 of Tomson Ogwang 'A convenient method of computing the Gini index and its' standard error' . Where $G(n,k)$ is the Gini coefficient of the N values without element $k$ and $\bar{G}(x)$ is the mean of the $G(n,k)$. Direct naive implementation of the above formula for Variance. calc.Gini.variance Is this a reasonable approach for a small N? Any other suggestions?
