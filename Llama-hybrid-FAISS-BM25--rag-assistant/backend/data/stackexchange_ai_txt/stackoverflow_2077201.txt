Inheritance terminology by Bertran Meyer (Object-Oriented Software Construction, p.464): Basic conventions and terminology The following terms will be useful in addition to “heir” and “parent”. A descendant of a class C is any class that inherits directly or indirectly from C , including C itself. (Formally: either C or, recursively, a descendant of an heir of C .) An ancestor of C is a class A such that C is a descendant of A . In the literature you will also encounter the terms “subclass” and “superclass”, but we will stay away from them because they are ambiguous; sometimes “subclass” means heir (immediate descendant), sometimes it is used in the more general sense of proper descendant, and it is not always clear which. In addition, we will see that the “subset” connotation of this word is not always justified.
