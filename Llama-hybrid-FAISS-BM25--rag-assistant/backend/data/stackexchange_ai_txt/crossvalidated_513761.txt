Exactly the same as for a numeric variable: Changing from public to private school, while keeping all other predictors constant, increases the odds (not probability!) of admission by factor 1.54. Internally, in regression (including logistic regression), nominal variables are treated as numbers, with possible values being 0 and 1. So, in your case, public school would be encoded by a dummy variable having value of 0, while a private school would be the same variable with the value of 1.
