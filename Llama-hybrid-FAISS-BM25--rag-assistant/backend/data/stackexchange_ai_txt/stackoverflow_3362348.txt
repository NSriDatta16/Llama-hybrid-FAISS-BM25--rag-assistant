System for tracking changes in whois records

What's the best storage mechanism (from the view of the database to be used and system for storing all the records) for a system built to track whois record changes? The program will be run once a day and a track should be kept of what the previous value was and what the new value is. Suggestions on database and thoughts on how to store the different records/fields so that data is not redundant/duplicated (Added) My thoughts on one mechanism to store data Example case showing sale of one domain "sample.com" from personA to personB on 1/1/2010 Table_DomainNames DomainId | DomainName 1 example.com 2 sample.com Table_ChangeTrack DomainId | DateTime | RegistrarId | RegistrantId | (others) 2 1/1/2009 1 1 2 1/1/2010 2 2 Table_Registrars RegistrarId | RegistrarName 1 GoDaddy 2 1&1 Table_Registrants RegistrantId | RegistrantName 1 PersonA 2 PersonB All tables are "append-only". Does this model make sense? Table_ChangeTrack should be "added to" only when there is any change in ANY of the monitored fields. Is there any way of making this more efficient / tighter from the size point-of-view??
