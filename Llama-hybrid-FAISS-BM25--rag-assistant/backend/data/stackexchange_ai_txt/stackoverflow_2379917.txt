WCF Exception Handling Strategies

We are developing a proxy in WCF that will serve as a means of communication for some handhelds running our custom client application. I am curious what error handling strategies people use as I would rather not wrap EVERY proxy call in try/catch. When I develop ASP .NET I dont catch the majority of exceptions, I leverage Application_Error in Global asax which can then log the exception, send an email, and redirect the user to a custom error landing page. What I am looking for in WCF is similar to this, except that it would allow me to pass a general faultreason to the client from a central location. Basically I am curious how people centralize their exception handling in WCF apps. Thanks
