Adobe AIR HTML - How do I dynamically load an image located in app-storage?

I'm working on an AIR application which generates a dynamic client presentation, pulling all necessary data from a PHP framework API. In the process, I download a large number of images and store them locally in the user's app-storage (air.File.applicationStorageDirectory). Side note: the HTML view I am dynamically populating is located in an IFRAME sandbox. I have a parsing script which attempts to take JSON data and populate the page with the necessary fields. Many of these fields are images that I need to locally reference. I thought I might be able to simply generate the URL using but it doesn't seem to actually load the image. My guess is AIR doesn't handle app-storage: url references dynamically. Is there a work-around for this? Could I perhaps use jQuery and load() ? Here is the current code I am using which is not working: var pos = filename.lastIndexOf("."); if (pos != -1) { ext = filename.substr(pos + 1, filename.length); switch (ext) { case 'gif': case 'jpg': case 'jpeg': case 'png': default: // update the source value $field.attr('src', 'app-storage:' + filename); break; } } I thought I might be on the right track because the return result of air.File.applicationStorageDirectory('test') was app-storage:/test Any help would be greatly appreciated!
