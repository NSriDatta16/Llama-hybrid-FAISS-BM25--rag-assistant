Logistic Regression with independently weighted regularization terms

For a standard logistic regression problem I'm interested in examining the impact of individual weighting of the parameters and in general the impact of regularization for completely separable data. Does anyone know of a package in python which allows individual regularization weights for each parameter? Thanks (logistic regression, not SSE).
