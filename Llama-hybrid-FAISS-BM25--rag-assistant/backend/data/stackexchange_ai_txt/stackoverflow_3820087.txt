I can think of three ways to do this. The first is a loop with an if statement, I probably wouldn't use that option. The second is to use Linq to do the calculation, check out this website if you don't know Linq http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746.aspx You could probably use Lamda Expressions however I'm not great with them and I'm not 100% sure how to go about it, but I feel Lamda Expressions will most likely give you the most elegant solution.
