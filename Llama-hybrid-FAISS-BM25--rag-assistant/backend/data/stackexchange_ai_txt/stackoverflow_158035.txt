After a while, I finally find out what is the solution: change a name of the external storage to something new. During startup of the addin, it loads the non-default PST file, and changes its name (not the name of the pst file, but the name of the root folder) to "Documents". This is code: session.AddStore("C:\\test.pst"); // loads existing or creates a new one, if there is none. storage = session.Folders.GetLast(); // grabs root folder of the new fileStorage. if (storage.Name != storageName) // if fileStorage is brand new, it has default name. { storage.Name = "Documents"; session.RemoveStore(storage); // to apply new fileStorage name, it have to be removed and added again. session.AddStore(storagePath); } Solution is not to use 'Documents' as a name any more, but something new. Problem is not related to specific name.
