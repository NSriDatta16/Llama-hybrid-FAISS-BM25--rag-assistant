SQL in ASP.NET - Order By sorting only one type incorrectly

I'm working on an ASP.NET application which is supposed to output detector data for a chosen interstate, sorted by mile marker. We determined the best way to do this would be sorting it by longitude (West and East) or latitude(North and South) depending on which direction it goes. Here's the query that populates it. SELECT [ShortWebID], [AvgSpeed], [update_time], [WebName] FROM [vwAverageSpeed] WHERE (([WebName] LIKE '%' + @WebName + '%') AND ([update_time] > @update_time)) ORDER BY CASE @WebName WHEN '%EB%'THEN [Longitude] WHEN '%WB%' THEN [Longitude] WHEN '%NB%' THEN [Latitude] WHEN '%SB%' THEN [Latitude] END The WebName view has different listings such as 'I-64 WB at MP 3.1'. The ListItems they have access to are listed just as 'I-64'. There's 4 different interstates, and it's working fine for everything but one, I-55/70. When that option is chosen, the list is not sorted by the latitude or longitude, but instead just by the order that they're in the table. I-55/70 is the only one with a / in it. Would this affect things? Thank you in advance. Edit: These are listed in the list item as 'I-55/70 WB' and so on in the same style as the example above. Sorry about the confusion. Edit2: That did the trick. Thanks!
