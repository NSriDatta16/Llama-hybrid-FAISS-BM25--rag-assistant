Is there a simple way to select and copy 1 or 2 columns of an HTML table?

I've heard that there's a button you can hold to drag a selection of a table column in Firefox, but I'm looking for a cross-browser answer. I'm wondering if maybe I can put radio buttons above the columns, have the visitor select them, then, on the click of a button, have the columns copied to their clipboard. I'm sure many have come across this problem; anyone with a good solution?
