The "bottleneck" would be the generated query executing, not SubSonic generating it or returning the result. If a particular query is slow, you should look into using your database provider's indexing functions to optimize it. In the second case, I'm assuming the additional execution time is overhead for LINQ to return the first item from the collection. So my answer would be, the first way is the best way to do it, and if 29ms isn't acceptable (which for a call to a DB, I don't think is unreasonable), add some indexes in your DB to speed up retrieval.
