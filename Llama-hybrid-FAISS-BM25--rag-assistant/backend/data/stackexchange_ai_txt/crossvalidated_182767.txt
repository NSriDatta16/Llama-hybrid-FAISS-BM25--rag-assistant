Comparison of regression methods with MATLAB

I am writing a chapter of my thesis, where I try to establish the relationship between regressors (512 x 8) and response (512 x 1) in my data. I have been suggested to use three regression methods: Bayesian linear ( tapas_vblm ), Gaussian process (a non-parametric probabilistic regressor; GPML package), Artificial Neural Network (MATLAB, Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, MLPNN , with a backpropagation reinforcement learning training algorithmâ€”scaled conjugate gradient). Once I trained the models with 85% of the data, for cross-validation I compared them with the remaining 15%, and determined over the testing data the: - coefficient of determination - root mean square error - mean square error - mean average error My question is how to theoretically compare the three methods (cost function, given priors, etc.)?
