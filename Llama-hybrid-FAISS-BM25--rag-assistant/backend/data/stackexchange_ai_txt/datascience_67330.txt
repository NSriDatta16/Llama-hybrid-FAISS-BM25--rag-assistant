Are there any examples other than anomaly detection where unsupervised deep learning could be useful?

I am new to deep learning and its concepts. After reading a while I understood that unsupervised deep learning techniques usually try to reconstruct the input data(probably with less number of dimensions using encoder-decoder) and train the network by optimizing reconstruction error. But I am unable to image how these could be used for solving real life tasks(other than anomaly detection, for example clustering). Note: You can correct me, if my understanding about the unsupervised deep learning techniques is wrong.
