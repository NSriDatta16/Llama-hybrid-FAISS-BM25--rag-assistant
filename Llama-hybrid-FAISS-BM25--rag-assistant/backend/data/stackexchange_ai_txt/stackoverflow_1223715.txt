You can avoid having different pages based on User Agent by using conditional CSS. Apple actually has some very good documentation on creating web pages that can support Safari on the iPhone along with desktop browsers. I would recommend starting with reading iPhone Human Interface Guidelines for Web Applications . This will give you a good start in using conditional CSS to customize pages on the basis of device characteristics (such as screen size) rather than User Agent.
