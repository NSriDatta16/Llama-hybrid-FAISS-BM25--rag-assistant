This is how I read your question: when a customer comes to a store, they always buy one, and only one, of $K$ items. Thereâ€™s an infinite supply of the items (i.e. they are sampled with replacement). With no other prior knowledge, you assume a prior probability for picking any of the items to be $1/K$ . A customer comes and buys $i$ -th item, you want to use this information to update the prior. In such a case, use Dirichlet-multinomial model . Your prior is an uniform Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\dots= \alpha_K=1$ , hence the individual probabilities are on average equal to $1/K$ . When you observe a purchase for the $i$ -th category, you update the prior to get the posterior $E[p_i]=\frac{2}{K + 1}$ and $\frac{1}{K+1}$ for other categories.
