After looking into the pca.py code of Scikit Learn, understood the original code was incorrect. I was thinking that SVD was to decompose a co-variance into U, S, V. However apparently it is to decompose input matrix X into U, S, V with no need to create the co-variance matrix. Incorrect covariance_matrx = X_centered.T.dot(X_centered) U, s, Vt= sp.linalg.svd(covariance_matrx) Correct X_centered = X_train - X_train.mean(axis=0) U, s, Vt= sp.linalg.svd(X_centered, full_matrices=False) Without "full_matrices=False", memory error was caused.
