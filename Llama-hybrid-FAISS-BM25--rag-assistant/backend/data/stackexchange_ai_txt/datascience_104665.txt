Best Javascript Modules for creating Neural Networks

After checking out this similar post for python: Best python library for neural networks , I was curious if the community had recommendations for JavaScipt modules for creating neural networks. I am transitioning from Python to JavaScript for work and have not found the same readily available modules that Python has or that have been developed to the same extent as Python versions (sklearn, keras, etc). I have been working with the tf.js module. So, what JavaScript modules are particularly helpful for neural network building?
