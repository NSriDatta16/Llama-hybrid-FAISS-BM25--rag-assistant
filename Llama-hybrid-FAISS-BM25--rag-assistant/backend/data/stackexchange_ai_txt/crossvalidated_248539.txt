how to do decorrelation and covariance equalisation?

In order to improve the convergence of a MLP, one should do "mean removal", "decorrelation" and "covariance equalization". I know how to do mean removal, but how do you do decorrelation and covariance equalization ? I didn't find any formulas on that online. I don't even understand what decorrelation/covariance equalization is doing intuitively. In my view, equalising the covariance between every pair of inputs is basically impossible. For example, the covariance between "interest on German government bonds" and "interest on loans to German companies" is positive while the covariance between "interest rate changes" and "average stock prices" is negative. How do you want to make them equal?
