Where does weight factors come into play with real data (in R)?

I do understand the IMHO simple concept using weights to fit a sample to another (real) population. Calculating the weight factors is not hard. Regarding to my MWE there maybe is a more elegant R way but it works in my case. But what I don't get is to how to apply the calculated weight factors to my real data. In the example below there are 50 people in the sample: 36% female and 64% male. The "real" population is 60% female and 40% male. So weight factors I calculated are female male 1.666667 0.625000 In this MWE I have to types of result variables. The foo is a categorical variable with TRUE and FALSE . How to apply the weight factors on this? Imagine a survey question the people can answer with "Yes" or "No". The second more complicated (for me) is kind of a likert scale from 0 to 4. How do I weight there? Imagine this as a survey question like "How do you feel on that scale from 0 (absolute bad) to 4 (awesome)?". set.seed(0) k = 50 df $foo)) print(table(df$ bar)) Example with foo > table(df $gender, df$ foo) FALSE TRUE female 9 8 male 20 13 This is the frequency in the sample. Now do I have to mulitplicate the female row with 1.666667 and the male with 0.625 ? > t["female",] * weight_female FALSE TRUE 15.88235 14.11765 > t["male",] * weight_male FALSE TRUE 12.121212 7.878788 Example with bar > addmargins(table(df $gender, df$ bar), 1) 0 1 2 3 4 female 3 5 6 1 3 male 7 6 8 7 4 Sum 10 11 14 8 7
