In Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft introduced Web Site "projects". This is a simpler model that does not use a project file like all the other project types do. They got rid of the Web Application Projects we had been using since day 1. Due to popular outrage, they reinstated Web Application Projects in Visual Studio 2005 SP1. It's possible that you are looking at a web site, not a Web Application Project. Look in the "project" properties, as "Koistya Navin .NET" says above. Personally, I recommend Web Applicaton Projects in most cases. I have to admit that there are some cool things about Web Site "projects": it's nice to be able to change your codebehind, save it, and then refresh the browser to see the result of the change. No compilation necessary. I still don't think it was worth the confusion, though.
