This really depends on what you mean by strength. Because of the versatility of the DAG in representing information, you could be discussing anything from a multiple-outcome control flow to argument clauses of non-adverbial discourse connectives or even the full set of dependencies between different words in a sentence. All of these would view node strength in a different way. For instance, a control flow may consider the node with the most amount of outcomes (therefore the most outward arcs) as the strongest, because it has the most power over the eventual outcome of the diagram. In discourse, the strongest node is the discourse connective, but it is found in speech and text after the first connective and before the third. Selection of the lexical "head" of a sentence is not directly related to the amount of arcs directly interacting with it. What I'm getting at is that there is no real panacea for computing "strength" in this data type because of the polysemous character of the term "strength" and the kind of data a DAG fits. I would say that in a machine learning problem, all three of these approaches would be very informative in selecting particular types of nodes for a classification or ranking problem, but in the end, the answer depends upon the data type's practical application.
