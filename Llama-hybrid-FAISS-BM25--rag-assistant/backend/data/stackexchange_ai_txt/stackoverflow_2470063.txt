Using the Microsoft convention might be a good idea. The static version is prefixed "lib". The debug version is post-fixed "d". The 64-bit version goes in the amd64 subdirectory. Not the greatest convention but at least it is familiar. In MSVC, you can use the predefined _DLL macro to detect that the user selected the DLL version of the CRT. The _WIN64 macro is defined if the 64-bit compilation is selected. Enough to generate the required #pragma comment(lib, "name") directive.
