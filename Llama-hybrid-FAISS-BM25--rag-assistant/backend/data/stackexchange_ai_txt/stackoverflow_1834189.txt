OpenCV and Xcode

I am looking at pattern recognition in images and video and have thought that C++ is the way to go (for high performance/real-time applications). I want to use the OpenCV libraries in Xcode when I build a C++ application (command-line tool) I am running Xcode 3.2 and have just followed the steps at http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port up to "This probably breaks something in TIFF export, but the build at least completes" in the section "Building using the new CMake build system". I have had no errors. How do I proceed if I want to use the libraries in Xcode now or do I need to do something else? Any help is greatly appreciated. Max.
