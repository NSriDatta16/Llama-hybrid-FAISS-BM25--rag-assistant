Principle components are linear combinations of the original variables. The first one has the largest variance, the next has the second largest, and so on, subject to a fixed constraint on each set of coefficients. If all the variables are measured on the same scale then the resulting linear combinations have that scale also. If we were to do a PCA on the size measurements of mammals, say length, width, and height, all measured on the single scale of centimeters, then the resulting components are also centimeters. If we add another scale, say weight in kilograms, then the components are a mix of different measuring systems and we can't assign a standard measure to, for example, the first component. All we can do is call it "size." Most people don't care since there measurements might be on several different scales.
