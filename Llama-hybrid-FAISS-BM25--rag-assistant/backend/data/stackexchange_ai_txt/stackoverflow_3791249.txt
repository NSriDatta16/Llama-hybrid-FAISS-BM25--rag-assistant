Two [UPDATE, make it Three] (untested) suggestions: use the -plistin option to specify all the parameters; (better) try organizing the files to be hidden into directories, if necessary, so you can easily hide them by directory-specific globs rather than having to spell out each file. [UPDATE] you could try using mkisofs from cdrtools to make the ISO image. MacPorts has a supported port of it. It could be that the code in hdiutil was originally based on an earlier version. In any case, you have the advantage of access to the source code and perhaps figuring out what the limitations are. P.S. There seems to be a couple of minor nits with the MacPorts port. In particular, the man pages are installed in the wrong directory. [UPDATE: fixed in 3.00_1]
