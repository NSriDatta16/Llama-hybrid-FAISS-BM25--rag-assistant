Assuming your distribution remotely resembles a normal curve, you could convert the standard errors into a more intuitive percentage value pretty easily. For example, if the distribution is pretty normal, approximately 95% of your population falls within +/-1.96*SE of the mean. Building from SheldonCooper's sample values, you could say, "The average was 1000 and about 95% of the population was between 600 and 1400." Likewise, about 70% of the population falls within +/- 1*SE, etc. If your sample distribution tends to deviate from normal by a lot, don't despair, but try to provide more details so we can help.
