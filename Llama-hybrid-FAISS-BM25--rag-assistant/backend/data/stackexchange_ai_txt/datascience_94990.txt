Presentation of data - Correctness of using exponentially weighted moving average values in charts

I have a set of data that I would like to present to an audience in a chart. The data points span several years and they each year needs to be presented as separate series. The datapoints are daily, so a single series data looks 'busy': My intention is to make the chart readable (overlapping multiple high-frequency series would look messy), and it is clear that I could acheive that by removing the high-frequency changes in the data. I have attempted to group the values by downsampling from 1 day to 10 days: Is this a valid way to solve the presentation problem? What would you do? EDIT: My question is specifically about the correctness of presenting exponentially weighted data to the audience who may not understand the implications of it. Please consider the grouped values versus e.w. values: A sharp drop in value becomes a much smaller dip. That looks like potential misrepresentation to me, hence my question about the conventions of presenting the data. Trying to answer my own question, I would reason that I must choose the decay (span) parameter for the exponential weighted function, so that the result doesn't distort the 'meaningful trends' in data. Woh is to decide what is a 'meaningful trend'? My personal judgement?
