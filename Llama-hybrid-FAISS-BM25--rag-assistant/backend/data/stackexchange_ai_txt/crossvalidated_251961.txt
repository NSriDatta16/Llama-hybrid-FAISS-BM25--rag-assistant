Logistic Regression: Interpretation regarding Block 0 and Block 1 on SPSS output

We received the following two tables as a result of a logistic regression analysis with by Enter and backward LR methods. The two outputs, Block 0 and 1, are provided below. Despite attempts to explain it in various ways, we are puzzled as to why only such a small difference is observed between the null model and the model with multiple variables (predictors) , which we assumed was the fitting model in consideration to the research question at hand. It is also worth mentioning that our attempts to reduce the number of variables resulted in a less significant model, so that was not an option. Additionially, we would also like to ask if it is possible to compare the classification tables for different "N"?
