PHP: Advice on gantt-type chart

I have an app that I've developed that has time entries. The time entries have a start date (datetime), an end date(datetime), and are associated with a task. Time entries typically range from a couple of minutes to a couple of hours and would be being recorded during the day. Each time-entry has a description. The type of chart I want to create would be similar to a gantt chart. It would show a days time range, ranging from the time of the start of the first time entry to the end date of the last. 8am 9am 9:15am 10:05am Task 1 |---------- -- Task 2 | ----- -- Task 3 | ---------- ---- I've used fusioncharts but I'd like to move away from them. Has anyone created a chart similar to this one that can give me some advice? Thanks in advance, Billy
