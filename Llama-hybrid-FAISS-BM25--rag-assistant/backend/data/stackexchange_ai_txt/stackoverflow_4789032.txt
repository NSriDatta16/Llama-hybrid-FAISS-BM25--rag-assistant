Google Page Speed Recommendation for Leveraging Browser Caching

Well, I'm trying to optimize my application and currently using page speed for this. One of the strongest recommendations was that I needed to leverage browser caching. The report sent me to this page: http://code.google.com/intl/pt-BR/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html#LeverageBrowserCaching In this page there is this quote: If the Last-Modified date is sufficiently far enough in the past, chances are the browser won't refetch it. My point is: it doesn't matter the value I set to the Last-Modified header (I tried 10 years past), when I access and reload my application (always clearing the browser recent history) I get status 200 for the first access, and 304 for the reaming ones. Is there any way I can get the behavior described in the google documentation? I mean, the browser don't try to fetch the static resources from my site?
