Visualising log odds from logistic regression model in R

I'm working on a logistic regression analysis using R and aiming to visualize the effects of the predictor "age" on the binary dependent variable "domestic violence." My dataset includes multiple predictors, and I want to plot the change in odds ratio for experiencing domestic violence as the age of women increases, while keeping all other predictors constant. Here's a brief overview of my approach: I've fitted a logistic regression model using the glm function: model Now, I would like to create a plot that shows the effect of age on the odds ratio of experiencing domestic violence that is how a unit increase in the age changes the odds of a woman experiencing violence while keeping other variables constant. I've read about the margins package and how it can be used to calculate marginal effects and plot them. However, I'm struggling with the exact steps to achieve this. Could someone guide me through the process of using the margins package or any other package which I can use here to calculate and plot the desired effects? Any advice on customizing the plot appearance and incorporating confidence intervals would also be greatly appreciated.
