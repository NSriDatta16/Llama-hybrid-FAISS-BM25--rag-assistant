I'm assuming you already have made feature selection so all your ~200 features are the ones that describe your target So particularly for models that use SGD you can train your model in batches i.e adding new observations each time In your case if using python you can make usage of SGDClassfiier with loss = log to optimize logistic regression cost function, and use the method partial_fit . You may need to do something like this: chunksize = 5 clf = SGDClassifier(loss='log', penalty="l2", random_state = 42) for train in pd.read_csv("train.csv", chunksize=chunksize, iterator=True): X = train[features_columns] Y = train["target"] clf.partial_fit(X, Y)
