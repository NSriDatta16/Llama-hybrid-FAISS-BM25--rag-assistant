Inherit initialize() method in ruby?

I still can't figure out how to make a subclass constructor follow its parent... example: require 'mechanize' class Scraper attr_accessor :agent def initialize # I dont know if using instance variable is the right thing to do @agent = Mechanize.new end end class ScraperA I want to make ScraperA follow its parent constructor behaviour, that is instantiate a Mechanize object without me retyping Mechanize.new in ScraperA initialize() method. Is this possible ? Just want to follow DRY principle but ruby makes it hard for me ??? Hope not, maybe it's just my ignorance. Looking forward for simple solution,Tnx. Edit: it turns out that I had empty initialize() method in ScraperA, which override the default initialize(). So yeah the example is working, because no empty initialize method there. Sorry for my stupidity. Tnx.
