I'd be concerned with why your child processes are not terminating properly. Under "normal" circumstances, the parent shouldn't have to do anything (perhaps call waitpid if you care about the results, or halting processing until they are done). This isn't really much of an answer yet -- you'll probably have to paste some of the code in the children. But a bit of advice -- start off with simple programs that call fork manually, rather than relying on a CPAN module to do it for you. It's important to understand how multiple processes are handled by the system. Then when you've got that, you can leverage some framework to handle a lot of processes for you. You should probably also read through perldoc perlfork if you have not done so recently, and try out some of the examples.
