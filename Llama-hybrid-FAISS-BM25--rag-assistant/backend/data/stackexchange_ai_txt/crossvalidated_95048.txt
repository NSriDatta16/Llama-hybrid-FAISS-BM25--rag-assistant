Throwing out an idea here, but what about having the time series as realisations of Gaussian processes? In particular the covariance functions would be parameterised by the species and group. Depending on the kernel function used, the values learned about the parameters would indicate how the smoothness of the timeseries depended on the group and on the species. Something like: $K(x,x')=\exp\{ -\frac{(x-x')^2}{(\theta_g \gamma_s)^2}\}$ Where $\theta_g$ and $\gamma_s$ are parameters to be learned about the effects of the $s^{th}$ species and $g^{th}$ group respectively. I'd be interested if anyone else's thoughts on the above.
