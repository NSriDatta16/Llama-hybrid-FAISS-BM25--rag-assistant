There's no particularly elegant way of doing this when you hard-code the column width values. I'm not sure why you have to do that in the first place; the question doesn't give much background information. The better solution is to call the AutoResizeColumns method , which will automatically adjust the width of all your columns using the specified size mode. You would call this method in the handler for your form's Resize event. For example: protected override void OnResize(EventArgs e) { myDataGridView.AutoResizeColumns(DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells); } This MSDN article gives more information about sizing options for the DataGridView control.
