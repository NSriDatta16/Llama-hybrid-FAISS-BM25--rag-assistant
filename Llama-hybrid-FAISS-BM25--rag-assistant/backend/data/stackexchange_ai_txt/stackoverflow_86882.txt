So, it sounds like you are gathering categories. The nodes are the entry points of this categories. How about "TopCategoryNode", "CategoryEntry" then for som,ething that is below them. Or, if you want to divide more, something like "CategoryCSS", "CategoryLayout" etc? This is kind of generic, but you make clear that there are "categories", and that these do consist of more than one subnode, or subtheme.
