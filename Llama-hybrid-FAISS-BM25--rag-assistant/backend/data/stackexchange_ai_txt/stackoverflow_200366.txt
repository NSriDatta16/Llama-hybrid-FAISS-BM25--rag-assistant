These days, I think the most advised method is not to do javascript (or meta) redirects. Do you really need it ? Could you use a redirect HTTP header instead ? The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4) also discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate
