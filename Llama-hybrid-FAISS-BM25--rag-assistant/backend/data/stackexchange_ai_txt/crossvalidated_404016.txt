How to estimate the "effect of an effect" identified through regression?

Suppose I estimate the effect of some variable $X_t$ on $Y_t$ . Let's say that $X_t$ is some firm variable (age of CEO in year $t$ or something like that), and $Y_t$ is a firm's change in investment in year $t$ (so, we are trying to see how $X_t$ influences investment in firms). Suppose that this analysis is done properly, and all the correct variables are controlled for etc. etc. Now, suppose I find that $X_t$ has a positive effect on $Y_t$ , on average. I want to find out whether this increase in $Y_t$ increases firm value, $Z_t$ . That is, I want to estimate how $Z_t$ changes through the change in $Y_t$ caused by $X_t$ . How do I go about doing this? Is it sufficient to regress $Z_t$ against $X_t$ ? What if there are other channels through which $X_t$ impacts $Z_t$ ? I apologize if this is a very basic question, or if it is not well-defined/too broad. Please let me know if I can clarify this further.
