As a data scientist the other languages (C++/Java) come in handy when you need incorporate machine learning into an existing production engine. Waffles is both a well-maintained C++ class library and command-line analysis package. It's got supervised and unsupervised learning, tons of data manipulation tools, sparse data tools, and other things such as audio processing. Since it's also a class library, you can extend it as you need. Even if you are not the one developing the C++ engine (chances are you won't be), this will allow you to prototype, test, and hand something over to the developers. Most importantly, I believe my knowledge of C++ & Java really help me understand how Python and R work. Any language is only used properly when you understand a little about what is going on underneath. By learning the differences between languages you can learn to exploit the strengths of your main language. Update For commercial applications with large data sets, Apache Spark - MLLib is important. Here you can use Scala, Java, or Python.
