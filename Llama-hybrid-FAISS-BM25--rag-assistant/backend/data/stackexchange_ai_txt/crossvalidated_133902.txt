You don't "reject the alternate hypothesis". You either reject the null or fail to reject it. It's perfectly possible that you can neither conclude "a majority prefer milk" nor "a majority do not prefer milk" (because you cannot distinguish milk preference from 50%) If you set up your hypotheses as: $H_0$: Not more than 50% of the population prefer milk $H_1$: More than 50% prefer milk Then rejection of the null would lead to the conclusion that more than 50% prefer milk. One must be very careful of hypothesis tests (especially one sided ones). Failure to reject the null is not positive assertion that the proportion who prefer milk is $\leq$ 50%. -- You should explicitly clarify whether your hypothesis includes the 'not sure' as 'don't prefer'. It's probably better still to explicitly state it in terms of answers to the survey question and then interpret it in the conclusion. Consider this phrasing: Let $p_Y$ be the population proportion who would answer 'Yes' in response to 'Do you prefer milk?' $H_0$: $p_Y\leq \frac{1}{2}$ $H_1$: $p_Y> \frac{1}{2}$ This phrasing avoids the ambiguity in your question. What majority is being considered is then interpreted in the text, either before the test or in the conclusion -- or both. -- Alternatively if you set up your hypotheses as: Let $p_N$ be the population proportion who would answer 'No' in response to 'Do you prefer milk?' $H_0$: $p_N\leq \frac{1}{2}$ $H_1$: $p_N> \frac{1}{2}$ Then rejection of the null would lead to the conclusion that more than 50% do not prefer milk. -- If, instead, you want to investigate the sum of the two 'not-yes' categories, you'd say: Let $p$ be the population proportion who would answer either 'No' or 'Not sure' in response to 'Do you prefer milk?' $H_0$: $p\leq \frac{1}{2}$ $H_1$: $p> \frac{1}{2}$ Then rejection of the null would lead to the conclusion that more than 50% would not say they prefer milk. [If that was the test you were trying to carry out, I suggest you organize it as an explicitly as that so that the ambiguities inherent in ordinary language are avoided.] A warning One sided hypotheses would normally be based on a clear a priori reason to think that the alternative would not occur, or at the very least, is of no interest. In general, if you don't have that you'd use a two-sided test. If you don't have good prior justification for a one-sided test, you'll likely be seen as significance hunting.
