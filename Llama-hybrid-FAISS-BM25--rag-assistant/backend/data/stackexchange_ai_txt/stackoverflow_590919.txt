WinForms Events for Inheriting Controls for UI Style

Follow up to this question: Winforms Style / UI Look and Feel Tips So I have created my "base controls" from which other controls inherit from. For testing, I am trying to change one of the base label's font. But it is not propagating to the controls that inherit from it. On one of the forms, I can see the designer file is setting the properties for the control, so my base control's properties are getting overridden. On the base control's I am using the Constructor to set the default properties. Should I be using a different event? If so, which one. Here is the code for one of the base controls based on comment request... Public Class InfoLabel Inherits Label Public Sub New() ' This call is required by the Windows Form Designer. InitializeComponent() ' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call. Me.Font = New System.Drawing.Font("Tahoma", 14.25!) Me.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.FromArgb(CType(CType(49, Byte), Integer), CType(CType(97, Byte), Integer), CType(CType(156, Byte), Integer)) Me.AutoSize = False End Sub End Class The base controls show on the projects toolbox on the winform editor. Controls are then drag/drop from the toolbox.
