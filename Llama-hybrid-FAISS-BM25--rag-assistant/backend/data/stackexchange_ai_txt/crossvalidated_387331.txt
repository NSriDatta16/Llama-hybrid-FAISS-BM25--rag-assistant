multilevel logistic regression with rare events

I am running a multilevel logistic regression with a dichotomous outcome. The outcome variable measures protest participation. About 10 percent of the overall sample reports positive answers, which varies between 2 and 23 percent across the different clusters. Each cluster is around 1000 observations, with a sample of 266.000 respondents. The model converges, but one of the reviewers suggested looking into rare event analysis as a robustness check. However, I am not sure what that implies in the multilevel logit framework. I might be completely off track, but my best guess was to set up a Poisson multilevel model. Any concrete suggestions or literature references are welcome!
