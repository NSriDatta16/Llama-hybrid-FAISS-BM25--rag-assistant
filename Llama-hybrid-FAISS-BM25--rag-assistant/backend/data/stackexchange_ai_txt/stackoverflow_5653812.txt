Magento not accessible since tried to move to multi website setup. Apache issue?

I wish I had never seen this article: http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/tutorial-multi-site-multi-domain-setup I have Apache 2.2 installed on my XP machine and until a while ago I had a Magento site that I could test the development of a custom module on. I decided that I wanted to have multiple websites and multiple stores so that I could test that my modules configuration variables set at the different scopes (global, website, and store) were working as expected. So I followed the instructions in the above Magento article. I created a website and gave it a name of “paulsplace.com”. I created a couple of Stores under that website. I then went to System/Configuration/General/Web and, with the scope set to paulsplace.com, I set the unsecured and secured URLs to http://paulsplace.com/ and https://paulsplace.com/ and hit Save Config - what a mistake!! I got a 404 error. And now I can’t get to my magento front end or back end. I tried a couple of things: I added these lines to my hosts lookup file: 127.0.0.1 paulsplace.com 127.0.0.1 www.paulsplace.com I then uncommented this line in my httpd,conf file: Include conf/extra/httpd-hosts.conf and added the following to the conf/extra/httpd-hosts.conf file: ServerAdmin me@myemail.com DocumentRoot "C:/Applications/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/htdocs" ServerName paulsplace.com ErrorLog "logs/paulsplace.com-error.log" CustomLog "logs/paulsplace.com-access.log" common and restarted Apache. If I browse to “http://www.paulsplace.com” I now get a page that just says “It works!”. Same for “http://paulsplace.com” and “http://www.paulsplace.com/magento/index.php”. I tried a few more things - I added this line to httpd.conf: AccessFileName htaccess (I did this because Windows Explorer didn’t let me create a file starting with a dot; I could do it from the command prompt, but I believe what I have done should be ok). I changed AllowOverride to All from None: Options FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All Order deny,allow Deny from all AllowOverride All and in C:\Applications\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\htaccess (a file that I created), I entered: SetEnvIf Host www\.paulsplace\.com MAGE_RUN_CODE=pws1 SetEnvIf Host www\.paulsplace\.com MAGE_RUN_TYPE=website SetEnvIf Host ^paulsplace\.com MAGE_RUN_CODE=pws1 SetEnvIf Host ^paulsplace\.com MAGE_RUN_TYPE=website (pws was the value I used for the “Code” when creating my store). Please tell me how I can put this right. I feel like I’m taking one step forward and three backward at the moment. Any help really would be greatly appreciated.
