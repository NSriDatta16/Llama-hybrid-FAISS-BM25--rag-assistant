How to evaluate the quality of a synthetic dataset?

I'm still playing with the data related to the year 2008 of the " Household power consumption " dataset (free to download at UCI Machine Learning Repository). I was able to generate some synthetic data but now I have a new question: how can I evaluate the quality of my synthetic data? Considering this distribution as the ground truth: How can I (for example) find the best between these other two distributions? At the beginning I thought that I could base the quality on the similarity / distance between my synthetic data and the generator but now I don't think that it's enough, because I want to create something that is also a little bit different (or far if we talk in distance terms) in trend but is good to be used as synthetic data.
