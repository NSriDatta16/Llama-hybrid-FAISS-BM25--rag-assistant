Is it possible to insert data in MySQL from a SQL Server trigger?

A fun question for a Friday afternoon, no? As the question states, is it possible to write a SQL Server trigger that inserts data into a MySQL table? EDIT: Yes, I know this is basically a dumb idea and that the application should be doing it and so on. But this is a legacy Classic ASP application which we're transitioning to MySQL; and until we get rid of the ASP bit we really would like to be able to squirt data over to the MySQL system without touching the ASP code. For there be dragons. Just mentioning it tends to make it crash. Thanks all!
