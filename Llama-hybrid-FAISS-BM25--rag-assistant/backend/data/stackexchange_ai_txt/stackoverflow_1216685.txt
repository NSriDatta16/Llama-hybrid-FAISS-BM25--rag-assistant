I misread the question - I don't know of a way for the SL tree to display both the Children property and the Users property as child nodes. You may want to create a wrapper class with an AllChildren property that returns Users and Organizations in the same collection. The SL tree's HierarchialDataTemplate has a single property called ItemsSource that should be bound to a single child collection. Sorry I couldn't be more help - I'd delete this answer but I don't see a way to do that.
