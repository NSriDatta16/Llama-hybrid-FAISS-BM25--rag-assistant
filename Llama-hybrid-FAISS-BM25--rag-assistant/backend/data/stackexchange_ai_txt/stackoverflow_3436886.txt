Too deep a folder structure makes it confusing. Too wide makes it confusing. I prefer to keep a balance between them. On the project I'm working on, we had no idea what we'd need, so we didn't prematurely create a massive folder structure. After all, we only started with 5 files, so we didn't really have a need for a folder structure. As the project got bigger, we organised things to keep it neat as we went; no folders having more than 10 files, grouping things into folders clearly. It would take a few minutes to move it all around. Now we have well over a hundred files, and it's always clear where things are. My recommendation is to do similar - keep it neat, don't go too far with either depth or width, or you'll over-complicate things.
