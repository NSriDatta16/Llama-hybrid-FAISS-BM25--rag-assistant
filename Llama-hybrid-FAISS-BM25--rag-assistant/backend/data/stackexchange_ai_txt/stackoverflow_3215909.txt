I think you might need to learn at least how to configure a deployment descriptor (web.xml) file for wicket. And I don't think there's a shortcut to know all of the involved technologies. You might need some basic knowledge of the underlying ones, since probably you'll get stuck and frustrated soon as problems arise. I would recommend exhaustive and complete documentation, that cannot only serve as a tutorial, but also as a reference. I would recommend going to the source: For Java, "The Java Tutorials": http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17409_01/javase/tutorial/ For Java EE development, "The Java EE Tutorials" : http://java.sun.com/javaee/reference/tutorials/ For Apache Wicket (you probably know this): http://wicket.apache.org/ Good luck.
