Tooltips Problem with Infragistics UltraToolBar in child window

Currently have an UltraToolBar displaying within a MDI child window currently all the buttons on the bar function but they do not show their tooltips when hovered over. I was wondering if anyone else may have dealt with this problem before and what they did.
