Can table rows be made draggable?

I have two divs that are float:left: Alexander Graham Bell Thomas Edison Nicholas Tesla Tesla coil Explanation Telephone Explanation Phonograph Explanation Light bulb Explanation and I want to be able to drag the inventor over to the invention. $("#inventor tr").draggable({ revert: "valid" }); $("#invention tr").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { var inventor = ui.draggable.text(); $(this).find("input").val(inventor); } }); I was able to get this working with list elements, but now that I'm adding an explanation to the invention table, I'd like to use a table on the left-hand side for styling purposes.
