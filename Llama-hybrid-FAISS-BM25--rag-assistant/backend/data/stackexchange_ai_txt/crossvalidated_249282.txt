At the risk of sounding trite, you can just use the cluster centroids to characterize the clusters . The centroid of a cluster is literally the average representation of all the cluster elements. So not only are these are the natural output of k-means clustering, but they're also relatively intuitive. What I think the answer by TrynnaDoStat is saying is that this can be risky because cluster uniformity is not a given. That is, some applications of k-means will result in clusters that are mostly homogeneous internally, and other applications will result in "messy" clusters. There are several ways to quantify the "messiness" of a clustering result: the answers to How to tell if data is "clustered" enough for clustering algorithms to produce meaningful results? contain some excellent suggestions.
