Say you have two sets of data: $x_i$ and $y_j$. We know that $\frac{1}{y_j}=x_j$ from theory or the previous research. I think the best estimate of the average $\bar x$ is the following: $$\bar x=\frac{\sum_{n_x}x_i+\sum_{n_y}\frac{1}{y_j}}{n_x+n_y}$$ Let's see if it's biased: $$E[\bar x - \mu]=\frac{\sum_{n_x}(E[x_i]-\mu)+\sum_{n_y}(E[\frac{1}{y_j}]-\mu)}{n_x+n_y}=0$$ This is because $$E[\frac{1}{y_j}]=E[x_j]=\mu$$ Note, that $E[y]\ne\frac{1}{\mu}$ If you want to compare the ratios, then proceed in a similar fashion: $$\mu_x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_x}x_i}{n_x}$$ and $$\mu_y=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n_y}\frac{1}{y_j}}{n_x}$$ the same goes for standard deviations and the usual t-test ANOVA: use $\frac{1}{y_j}$ wherever you use used $x_i$. The key here is not to work on aggregates, such as $E[y_j]$, because they're not convertible easily into $\frac{1}{E[x]}$ due to Jensen inequality. UPDATE Here's analogy from physics. Let's say you're measuring the resistance. You have Ohm-meter, which measures it directly and shows 10 Ohm. Now, you measure it with a Ampere-meter by connecting the resistor to the DC power supply which produces 10 Volt. Ohm's Law: $R=\frac{V}{I}$. You read two measurements: 1.1 A and 1.2 A. I'm suggesting you compare 10 $\Omega$ with $\frac{\frac{10}{1.1}+\frac{10}{1.2}}{2}=8.7 \Omega$ UPDATE2: Based on OP's comments, it seems the model is as follows: $$x_i=z_i+e_i$$ $$y_j=\frac{1}{z_j}+u_j$$ Here, $z$ is what we want to measure, while $x$ and $y$ are what we actually measure, and $e,u$ are errors, which are quite large. If you go with combining $E[x]$ and $\frac{1}{E[y]}$, then you'll have to deal with the bias $\frac{1}{E[y]}-E[z]$. I think in this case it is important to understand the errors, especially $u_j$. If we knew something about the distribution, we could correct for bias.
