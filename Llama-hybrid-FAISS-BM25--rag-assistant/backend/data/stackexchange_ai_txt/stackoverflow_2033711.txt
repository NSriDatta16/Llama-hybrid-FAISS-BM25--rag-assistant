How can I attach "meta data" to a DOM node?

Sometimes I want to attach some kind of meta data to a HTML node and I wondered, what's the best way to do this. I can imagine the following: Non-standard attributes: (Breaks validation) Re-use an existing attribute (Requires parsing and some level of escaping) Both solutions are really ugly! Is there any way to do this more elegantly? I'm already using jQuery so any good Javascript solution, if any, is appreciated, too.
