How to assign a prior distribution to a loading matrix that has restrictions?

I came across the paper Fast Variational Bayesian Linear State-Space Model . They work with the following model: $$\begin{align} {\bf{x}}_n &= {\bf A} {\bf{x}}_{n-1} + {\text{noise}} \\ {\bf{y}}_n &= {\bf C} {\bf{x}}_n + {\text{noise}} \end{align}$$ where $M >> D$ , the noise is Gaussian, $\bf A$ is the $D × D$ state dynamics matrix and $\bf C$ is the $M × D$ loading matrix. They assign a prior to $\bf C$ to be $$p \left(\bf C \;\middle\vert\; \gamma \right) = \prod_{m=1}^M \prod_{d=1}^D \mathcal{N}\left( c_{md} \;\middle\vert\; 0, \gamma_d^{-1} \right),$$ where $c_{md}$ is the element in the $m$ -th row and $d$ -th column of the matrix. I am studying a factor model of similar form where the first $D × D$ part of $\bf C$ is assumed to be lower triangular, e.g. if $D = 3$ $${\bf C} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ c_{21} & 1 & 0 \\ c_{31} & c_{32} & 1 \\ c_{41} & c_{42} & c_{43} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ c_{M1} & c_{M2} & c_{M3} \end{bmatrix}$$ I don't need to worry about a hyper-prior and I believe the components should be standard Gaussian. I have some non-random terms in this matrix, so how can I go about assigning a prior distribution? I am wondering if I can just ignore the non-random parts and do something like $$p\left(\bf C \right) = \mathcal{N}\left( c_{21} \;\middle\vert\; 0, 1 \right) \mathcal{N}\left( c_{31} \;\middle\vert\; 0, 1 \right) \mathcal{N}\left( c_{32} \;\middle\vert\; 0, 1 \right)\prod_{m=4}^M \prod_{d=1}^3 \mathcal{N}\left( c_{md} \;\middle\vert\; 0, 1 \right)$$ I've never seen this type of thing handled in literature so I'm not sure if it's a proper way to handle this issue.
