A t-test would be able to test if the average of all the values is different from 0. There is no second set of data, you want a one-sample t-test. In R : x would do. But if you want to test whether the trend is different from 0, that's a different question. How to do that would depend on whether the time intervals in your data are equal, whether you want to look at possible seasonality and so on. A simple (but possibly incorrect) method would be: x before that, though, I would make some plots, e.g plot(x~time) and perhaps look at some smoothers.
