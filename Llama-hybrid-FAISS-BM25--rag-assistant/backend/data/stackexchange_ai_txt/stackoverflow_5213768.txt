Interesting question. I love the google maps api. Here is a jsFiddle with your solution: http://jsfiddle.net/JsAJA/2/ You will have to query your database for points between the minimum/maximum lat and lngs. Hope this helps. Bob P.S. Note that this breaks the natural user experience of google maps. The map is no longer dragged when you mouse down. It needs a better user experience.
