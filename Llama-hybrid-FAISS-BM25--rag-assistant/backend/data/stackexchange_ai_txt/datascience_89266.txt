Trying to figure out which book to tackle first

I'm currently at my 4th and last year of my Applied Maths degree and just recently got an internship at a startup. During this period I've been reading and getting deeper and deeper into studying machine learning. And so I've stumbled upon two interesting books: 1- "The elements of statistical learning", Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie 2-"Understanding machine learning (From theory to algorithms)", Shai Ben-David, Shai Shalev-Shwartz I intend to read both books but just wanted to hear from someone more experienced in this field which one i should focus on first, and each books strenghts and weaknesses.
