Most of the machine learning algorithms are not "hard" classifiers, but "soft" classifiers . This means that instead of returning the predicted class (or yes/no answers for binary cases), they return a score . The score often is a probability of the sample belonging to the class, as in your example. To convert the score to the hard classification, you need a decision function . The simplest thing you can do for binary classification to use the 0.5 cutoff, i.e. probability > 0.5 means that the model predicted the positive class. Please notice however that the 0.5 threshold is quite arbitrary, as you can learn from the Why P>0.5 cutoff is not "optimal" for logistic regression? thread.
