Not to be a killjoy here, but this is not a feat that is currently possible in any meaningful way in my opinion. There are several reasons for this, the main ones being: Whatever measurement you do, if it is to have any meaning, will have to test the maximum potential of the browser/cpu, which you cannot do and maintain any kind of reasonable user experience Even if you could, it would be a meaningless snapshot since you have no idea what kind of load the cpu is under from other applications than the browser while your test is running, and weather or not that situation will continue while the user is visiting your website. Even if you could do that, every browser has their own strengths and weaknesses, which means, you'd have to test every dom manipulation function to know how fast the browser would complete it, there is no "general" or "average" that makes sense here in my experience, and even if there was, the speed with which dom manipulation commands execute, is based on the context of what is currently in the dom, which changes when you manipulate it. The best you can do is to either Let your users decide what they want, and enable them to easily change that decision if they regret it or better yet Choose to give them something that you can be reasonably sure that the greater part of your target audience will be able to enjoy. Slightly off topic, but following this train of thought: if your users are not techleaders in their social circles (like most users in here are, but most people in the world are not) don't give them too much choice, ie. any choice that is not absolutely nescessary - they don't want it and they don't understand the technical consequences of their decision before it is too late.
