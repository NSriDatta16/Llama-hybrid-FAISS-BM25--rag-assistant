Using WPF blur to focus attention...Why won't the whole screen gray out?

I used this example to make the screen blur to focus attention. http://blog.wpfwonderland.com/2010/03/23/use-the-wpf-blur-effect-to-focus-attention/ I wanted the whole thing to grey out too, except only one user-control is graying out. I have a grid with 2 columns, left column is a tab control styled like outlook sidebar, and the right column is the main view. The main view grays out, the sidebar does not. Why? Is it because if the styles applied? The code is in the code behind of the main form that holds everything.
