You should read Using Large-Value Data Types The max specifier expands the storage capabilities of the varchar, nvarchar, and varbinary data types. varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max) are collectively called large-value data types. You can use the large-value data types to store up to 2^31-1 bytes of data. The large-value data types are similar in behavior to their smaller counterparts, varchar, nvarchar and varbinary. If you can't pass more than 4000 bytes, I'd check in your client application to see if it is limiting or truncating your data. SQL Server can take more than 4000 bytes at one time. EDIT just found this: EXECUTE (Transact-SQL) Using EXECUTE with a Character String In earlier versions of SQL Server, character strings are limited to 8,000 bytes. This requires concatenating large strings for dynamic execution. In SQL Server, the varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) data types can be specified that allow for character strings to be up to 2 gigabytes of data.
