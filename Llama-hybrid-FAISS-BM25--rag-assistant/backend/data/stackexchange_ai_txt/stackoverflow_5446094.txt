Any reference for good Datamining tools in Java?

We are working on an internship project for company. The project itself consists of Datamining. Let's say the structure of database we have to work is huge (in Gigabytes). Sad to say that DB itself is very poorly structured with inconsistent values and most importantly no primary or foreign keys . So in our simple Servlet modules to extract and show the inconsistent data, it takes forever for queries to perform and show up on servlet. As n00b programmers we do not know about Join and such things in DB. Also we are using MySQL as our DB server. The DB is composed of real-time data from telecom towers. To find sample inconsistency in table values we are using combination of multiple queries, output of one query serving as input to another query like: "SELECT distinct(tow_id) FROM 'tower_data' WHERE TIME_STAMP LIKE ? "; //query for finding tower-id. "SELECT time_stamp FROM tower_data WHERE 'TIME_STAMP' LIKE ? AND 'PARAM_CODE' = ? AND 'TOW_ID'=? GROUP BY time_stamp HAVING count( * ) >1"; //query for finding time stamps with duplicate data. And so on. Also there are some 10 tables in the database. We need to combine 2-3 tables to get values for custom queries. After finding all the inconsistent values for multiple factors, we have to do data cleansing, removal of noise, data prediction and such tasks in the next stage. So we thought we can apply some Java Data Mining tools which would in turn apply some algorithm to speed up the data retrieval. Please guide us towards some good datamining tools. Any guidance towards optimizing/rewriting the queries would also be highly appreciated.
