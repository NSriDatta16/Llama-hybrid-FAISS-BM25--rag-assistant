Firstly, a Subject is an observable that generates in response to having observed other observables. They are useful as "plumbing" in some situations, and you can even use them to build a form of "agents" that communicate via channels. For your main question: I think it may not have clicked because in your examples of Subscribe you've left out what Observer should be subscribed - it can't be ...Subscribe(), it has to be ...Subscribe(observer). One answer to your question is that you can just subscribe the same observer to multiple observables. Or you could use Merge. If you want to be able to distinguish them, then the easiest way is to have two Subjects that observe, do what's specific to that kind of thing, then pass observations onwards to be Merged. Alternatively, you could use Select to tag observations prior to merging them.
