This question pops up once in a while. As per the spec it's not authorized. The best page to look at is this one: Q/A: J2EE Restrictions That said, there are ways to spawn threads, especiall in Weblogic with the WorkManager . See these questions: How can an EJB parallelize a long, CPU intensive process? Why spawning threads in J2EE container is discouraged? J2EE programmers do not write to files The fact that the first one targets EJB shouldn't matter that much, and the last one about access to file system is about general restrictions. Hope it helps.
