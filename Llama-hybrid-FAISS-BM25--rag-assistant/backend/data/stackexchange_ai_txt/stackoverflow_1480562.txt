GCC sayeth (with no arguments to encourage error reporting): $ gcc -c z.c z.c: In function ‘main’: z.c:13: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘test’ makes pointer from integer without a cast $ The code in z.c is the code in the question preceded by ' #include ' and a blank line. GCC is telling truth - the code is bust on C - indulging in undefined behaviour (converting an integer, 5, into a pointer to integer, without a cast to tell the compiler that the programmer has any clue what they are up to). Because p1 is equivalent to 'int *p1', the distance apart of p1 and p2 (4) is correct for a 32-bit compilation.
