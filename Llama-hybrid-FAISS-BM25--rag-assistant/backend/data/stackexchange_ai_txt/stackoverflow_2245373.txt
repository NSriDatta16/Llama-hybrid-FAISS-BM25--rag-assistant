To set up the 100x100 thumbnails, add the following to your model: has_attachment :content_type => :image, :storage => IMAGE_STORAGE, :max_size => 20.megabytes, :thumbnails => { :thumb => '100x100>', :large => '800x600>', } (In this example, I am creating a 100x100 thumbnail, and also an 800x600 'large' size, in additional to keeping the original size.) Also, keep in mind that the thumbnail might not be exactly 100x100; it will have a maximum dimension of 100x100. This means that if the original has an aspect ration of 4:3, the thumbnail would be 100x75. I'm not exactly sure if that is what you meant by "exactly 100x100 with any excess cropped off so that the aspect ratio is preserved."
