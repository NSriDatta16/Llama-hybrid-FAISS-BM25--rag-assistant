magento: rewriting templates

I have altered a template file in: app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/sales/order/shipment/create/tracking.phtml However i'd like to save this file with these new changes into a new file and leave tracking.phtml in its stock standard form and somehow redirect the block to the location of the new file and use it instead. Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Order_Shipment_Create_Tracking is the class I think i have to change and i've tried creating a constructor in it and using a few different methods such as Mage::settheme and $this->setTemplate but none of them make a difference. Any help would be greatly appricated
