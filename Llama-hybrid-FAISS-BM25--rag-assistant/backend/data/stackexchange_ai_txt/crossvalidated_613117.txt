How can I make inferences about individuals from aggregated data?

Say I am trying to run a logistic regression on an individual's choice between objects A and B based on some vector of characteristics. My dataset, however, only happens to have the proportion of people who chose A and the proportion of people who chose B in different countries and a vector of aggregate characteristics of the individuals in that country. Is there a way to identify the effects of these characteristics on an individual's choice?
