I see four options : First, I'm thinking of Apparat , by Joa Ebert (thanks, dude), which provides tools for ABC bytecode optimization, as well as a very deep API for the manipulation of this bytecode. It is written in Scala, so it's also a good moment to learn about this awesome language. Also, you could write your own tool. The ABC (ActionScript Bytecode) format is well documented , as well as its container, the SWF file format . It might be not too hard to parse both files for interesting tags and add needed instructions in the bytecode. On a more "simple" approach, the SWF and ABC compiler most of us are using, mxmlc , is open-source. You could try to edit the compiler code directly to do what you want. Everything you need for that is in the Adobe OpenSource Flex SDK web site . And as an alternative answer to your question, instead of trying to inject bytecode in the SWF (which will always have an impact on the performances of the global application), you could use the awesome AS3Trace/AS3DynamicProfile options on mm.cfg, to have a full log of execution of each function, as well as profiling informations about the opcodes execution. More on that here . To conclude, such external profiling tool will be an awesome application to be open-sourced and released to the community, since more and more "big" AS3 projects are coming out these days. ;)
