Paraphrasing Robert Sebesta in Concepts of Programming Languages : A scripting language is used by putting a list of commands, called a script, in a file to be executed. The first of these languages, named sh (for shell), began as a small collection of commands that were interpreted as calls to system sub-programs that performed utility funcions, such as file management and simple file filtering. To this basis were added variables, control flow statemens, functions, and various other capabilities, and the result is a complete programming language. And then you have examples like AWK , Tcl/Tk , Perl (which says that initially was a combination between sh and AWK , but it became so powerful that he considers it an "odd but full-fledged programming language"). Other examples include CGI and JavaScript.
