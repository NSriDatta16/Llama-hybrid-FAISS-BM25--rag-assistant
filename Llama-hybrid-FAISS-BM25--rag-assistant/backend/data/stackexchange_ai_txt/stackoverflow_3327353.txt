Actually, you're better off using the higher-level interface, MySQLdb. (See the user's guide ) The _mysql functions are really just wrappers around the C API. They're meant to be an implementation detail, the kind of thing that wouldn't even show up in the documentation in PHP. The developers leave them sparsely documented on purpose to discourage people from using them unnecessarily, and also because you can refer to the MySQL C API documentation for the equivalent function, which is rather more complete.
