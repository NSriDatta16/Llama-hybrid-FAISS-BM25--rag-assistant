adonis in vegan: order of variables -- non nested with one degree of freedom for each

I am trying to understand why the order of variables seems to effect p values for both of those variables for the adonis() (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices) test in vegan in R . If I have a community data similarity matrix and two numeric predictors: library(vegan) data(dune) data(dune.env) dune.env2 I can run adonis with the two variables trying to predict environmental similarity, with either varaible leading, like so: adonis(dune ~ A1 + Moisture, data=dune.env2, permutations=9999) Call: adonis(formula = dune ~ A1 + Moisture, data = dune.env2, permutations = 9999) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 9999 Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(>F) A1 1 0.7230 0.72295 4.5132 0.16817 7e-04 *** Moisture 1 0.8529 0.85292 5.3245 0.19840 2e-04 *** Residuals 17 2.7232 0.16019 0.63344 Total 19 4.2990 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 adonis(dune ~ Moisture + A1, data=dune.env2, permutations=9999) Call: adonis(formula = dune ~ Moisture + A1, data = dune.env2, permutations = 9999) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 9999 Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(>F) Moisture 1 1.3782 1.37822 8.6039 0.32059 0.0001 *** A1 1 0.1976 0.19765 1.2339 0.04598 0.2804 Residuals 17 2.7232 0.16019 0.63344 Total 19 4.2990 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 In the first case, both variables seem to have a statistically significatnt relationship to community structure. Meanwhile in the second case, only the Moisture variable appears to have a statistically significant relationship to community structure. In both cases, the residuals account for about 63% of the variance. My working interpretation here is that in the first case, A1 ends up describing about 17% of the variance, and then Moisture predicts about 20% of what is left. Meanwhile in the second case Moisture describes 32% of the variance, and then there is not as much unexplained variance left for A1 to describe and so only Moisture ends up being statistically significant. I find this surprising that adonis works this way, since with OLS regression, predictor variable order doesn't seem to matter this way. summary(lm(log10(dune$Poaprat + 1) ~ dune.env2$A1 + dune.env2$Moisture)) Call: lm(formula = log10(dune$Poaprat + 1) ~ dune.env2$A1 + dune.env2$Moisture) > > Residuals: > Min 1Q Median 3Q Max > -0.32734 -0.11272 -0.02233 0.13877 0.42511 > > Coefficients: > Estimate Std.

In that post, it was suggested that differences in degrees of freedom and nestedness accounted for this difference between models with different variable order. In my case, however, degrees of freedom for each variable equal one, and yet the pattern persists. Could anyone help me in interpreting differences between adonis tests with different orders of predictor variables, even when each predictor variable has the same number of degrees of freedom? Thanks.
