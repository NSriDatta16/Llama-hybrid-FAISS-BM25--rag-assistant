how to average standard deviations of independent groups

I have means and standard deviations on a given variable, $X$, for six independent samples of unequal sample sizes: Group 1: $SD = 0.96 , n = 290$ Group 2: $SD = 1.082, n = 250$ Group 3: $SD = 0.70, n = 250$ Group 4: $SD = 0.794, n = 310$ Group 5: $SD = 0.819, n = 290$ Group 6: $SD = 0.691, n = 190$ total sample size = $1,580$ I am asked to report the the average standard deviation based on these values, so, in essence, I am looking to compute the average standard deviation based on six independent datasets - that is, an average of six separate standard deviations ( not the combined standard deviation for the total sample). Can I just calculate the weigthed mean of all six standard deviations, with the weights for each sample given its sample size divided by total sample size of all six samples combined? So, in essence, producing the following: average standard deviation = $\frac{[(\frac{290}{1,580}\cdot0.96) + (\frac{250}{1,580}\cdot1.082)+(\frac{250}{1,580}\cdot0.70)+..continued for all six groups..)]}{6}?$ Thank you!
