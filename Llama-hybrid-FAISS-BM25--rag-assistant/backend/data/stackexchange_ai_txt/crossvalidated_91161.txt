The maximum likelihood estimator for $\lambda$, given some observations, is just the mean of the observations. So if you do have observations, simply average them. Your probabilities do not add up to one. You can take the weighted mean of (8, 7, 5, 2) with your weights (0,0.01,0.1,1), which yields 2.32. The corresponding probability mass function will look like this (R code underneath): lambda This does not look much like your plot. You may want to consider overdispersion and try modeling your data using a negative binomial distribution.
