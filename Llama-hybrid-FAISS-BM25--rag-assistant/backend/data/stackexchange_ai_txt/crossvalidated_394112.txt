It depends on the data and your reason for saying data into training set are only those events that finish before the events in the testing dataset start One approach might be to take the latest date which puts $20\%$ of events starting later and make those your test set. Put it to one side until the final test, in the usual way You then have a training set which has a combination of (a) events which started and finished before the critical date and (b) events which started before the critical date but finished after it. You should if possible include the events in (b) in your training, treating them as right-censored at the critical date This censored data could complicate your training, but failing to include it could bias your results by making it appear that events in the training set have shorter intervals on average than the underlying population distribution
