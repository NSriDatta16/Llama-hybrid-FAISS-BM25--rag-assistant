Selecting the best subset of features in binary logistic regression

I am using a binary logistic regression (a type of probabilistic statistical classification model, is used to predict a likelihood of belonging to a class (True, False)). I have 4 features and I want to know what is the best subset of using these features to reach the best result? should I try all of possible subset of these features? Is there any scientific solution for this purpose? I don't have sufficient knowledge about this. Any help will be highly appreciated.
