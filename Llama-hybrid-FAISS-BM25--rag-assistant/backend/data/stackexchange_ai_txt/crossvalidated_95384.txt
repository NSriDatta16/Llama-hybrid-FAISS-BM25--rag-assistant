You are making a number of assumptions that seem to come from the machine language community and ignore decades of statistical theory and application. Something is wrong with pre-specifying a multivariable model Something is wrong with leaving insignificant variables in a model Classification is useful and well-defined, with a cutpoint of 0.5 yielding the correct loss function Proportion classified correctly is a useful measure of predictive accuracy with direct probability models All predictor effects are linear Odds ratios per 1-unit change in all $X$s are interesting In fact none of these assumptions is likely to be true. It would be valuable to spend a good deal of time studying multivariable modeling, and logistic regression in particular, before running analyses.
