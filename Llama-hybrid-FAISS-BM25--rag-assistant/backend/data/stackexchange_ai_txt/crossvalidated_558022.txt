To expand on @BruceET, the quantile functions in R and in many statistical software packages were analyzed by Robert Hyndman (@Rob Hyndman here) and Yanan Fan around 25 years ago in their paper Sample Quantiles in Statistical Packages . This will have the definitions and comparisons for each. Some have an unbiased mean under the normal assumption, others an unbiased median. They have a twenty-year followup in which they lament various software package design decisions :)
