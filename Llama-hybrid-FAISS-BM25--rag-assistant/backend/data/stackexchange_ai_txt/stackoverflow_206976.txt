Tragically, my favorite cartoon is too old to be on the interwebs. It's from Datamation. (Remember Datamation?) A man is sitting at a desk. There are bits of electronics everywhere. Rubble is strewn into every corner of the room. His face and hair are singed. He is thinking "It's never done that before."
