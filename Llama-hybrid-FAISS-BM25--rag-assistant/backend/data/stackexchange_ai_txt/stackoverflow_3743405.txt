If I were you, I would create a text-based command line interface first. Then, if you decide to make an actual GUI, you can just have the GUI automate the command line game, so you don't have to write the game logic twice. Many tools will use this approach. Someone will create, for example, a command line defragmentation tool and then someone will create a GUI "wrapper" for the tool. Sort of like what Nethack did.
