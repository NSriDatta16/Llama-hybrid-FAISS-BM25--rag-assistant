It used to be that there were no common audio encoding formats for Android and iPhone. iPhone: iPhone audio encoding supported formats Android: Android supported media formats But Android 2.3.3 adds support for AMR-WB and AAC: Android Audio Encoder AAC See Media Framework at Android 2.3.3 API changes So I believe AAC is your format choice if you want interop between Android and iPhone devices and can handle the Android 2.3.3 limitation. Otherwise, just pick from the list for widest coverage (AMR-NB on Android) or plan on converting the recorded audio to a suitable format. A quick check shows that AMR is patented and I assume AAC would have some patent coverage as well. PCM is decodable on iPhone and Android and most cellphones at the expense of larger filesize.
