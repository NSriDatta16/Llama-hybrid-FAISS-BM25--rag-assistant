Unless you're making a general purpose library you should try and limit what you have built to what you will be using. Extend as you need it. As such, you should have full code coverage, and you should test it all. Perhaps your code is a bit smelly? Is it time to refactor? If you have a large class doing lots of things internally, perhaps it should be broken into several smaller classes with interfaces you could test separately.
