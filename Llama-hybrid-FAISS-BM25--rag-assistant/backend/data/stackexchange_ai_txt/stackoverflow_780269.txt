As someone who embraced OO heartily, and RDBMS grudgingly... I would encourage, even beg, computer science departments to keep theory and practice of relational databases in the foreground. If that can be done even while you use an ORM for the OO classes, then go for it. But I'd prefer to see students coming out of college understanding that OO - relational mapping is hard, and why it's hard, and that this does not mean that the relational model is broken. Not very broken, anyway.
