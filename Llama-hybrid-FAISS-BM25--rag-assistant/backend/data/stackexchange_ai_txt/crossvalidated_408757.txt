ATE is the difference in potential outcomes if an individual is treated and if they are not treated, averaged over all individuals. So you need to add subscripts: $$ ATE = E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}] $$ where 0 and 1 denote whether an individual is treated (1) or not treated (0). The expected value operator then gives us the average of the difference in potential outcomes across all individuals in the population. In other words, it gives the average of individual-level causal effects. So to answer your question, $E[Y_{1i}]$ then just gives us the average of potential outcomes for individuals if they are all treated. These are potential outcomes, not necessarily observed for all individuals. If everyone was in fact treated, then this would give you average outcome for the population. Instead, this is the average outcome had everyone been treated .
