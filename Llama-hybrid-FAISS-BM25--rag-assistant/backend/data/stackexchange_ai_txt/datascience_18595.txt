using classification when there is no dataset + guidance

i am working on my final year project that is a social network. Based on user interest, i have to add him in groups based on area he lives in, age group, interest type, gender and some other features.i have to use machine learning to predict in which group should i place him. I am thinking of using classification but i need data set to train which i don't have at all nor there is any data set related to this problem, so if any one of you guide me in right direction how can i do this ?
