el expression in jsp:invoke

I'm trying to use the following snippet inside my tag file: ... ... and compiler gives me the following error: Syntax error, insert ") Statement" to complete IfStatement so as I understand it's not permitted to use el expression in fragment attribute. Could somebody point me to this restriction in specification? Or give advice how to invoke content of fragment if name of fragment I calculate at runtime
