What is the most accurate open-source tool for sentence splitting?

I need to split text into sentences. I'm currently playing around with OpenNLP's sentence detector tool. I've also heard of NLTK and Stanford CoreNLP tools. What is the most accurate English sentence detection tools out there? I don't need too many NLP features--only a good tool for sentence splitting/detection. I've also heard about Lucene...but that may be too much. But if it has a kick-ass sentence detection module, then I'll use it.
