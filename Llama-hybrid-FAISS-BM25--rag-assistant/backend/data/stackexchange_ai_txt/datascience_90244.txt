No need for machine learning here. After you've transposed the dataframe, just count the number of unique combinations in the new column, and then rank them by frequency. Set a suitable threshold of "rareness" (like freq=2 below) and you will have your list of strange combinations. There's a tool in Pandas for this called df.values_count() e.g. combination freq a,b 1 a,c 1 a,d 1 a,b,c 2 a,b,c,d 10 b,d 10 Then just compare you new combinations with your "bank of rare combinations", and update them if they are no longer rare.
