Is a forward-pass on a neural network a similar operation to a predict operation?

I understand that in the case of the forward-pass the outputs are passed into a loss-function, rather than used to generate a prediction, but up until that point they are the same right? I'm asking as I'm looking at two methods of using the VGG16 model. In one method the keras -model.predict- is used on the convolutional base of the VGG to generate features for new classifier layers which are then trained. In the second method the VGG base is frozen and new classifiers are trained on data passed I think into the frozen VGG base. To me the output from the frozen VGG base seems to be the same as the output from -model.predict-. I know from the guidance they are very different methods [the second method is much more expensive], but I can't separate them conceptually.
