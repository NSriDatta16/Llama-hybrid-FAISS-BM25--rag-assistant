Why is the Wasserstein distance not used in Variational Inference

I just started learning the concept of variational inference in the context of variational Autoencoder, so please excuse me if the answer is obvious. I would like to know why traditionally, KL-divergence is used instead of the Wasserstein distance in the Loss-function of a VAE.
