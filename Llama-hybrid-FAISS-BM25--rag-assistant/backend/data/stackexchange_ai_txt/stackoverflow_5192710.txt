How can I organize controls on a form relative to one another and the form itself?

I have a child form in a MDI Windows Forms application. It has two controls: a ComboBox and a TreeView, with the last one under the first one. Both controls have the same width. How can I set up them and form properties to achieve the following: When changing the size of the form, a width of both controls must be equal to the width of the form. The height of the TreeView must be changing to fill all free space of the form.
