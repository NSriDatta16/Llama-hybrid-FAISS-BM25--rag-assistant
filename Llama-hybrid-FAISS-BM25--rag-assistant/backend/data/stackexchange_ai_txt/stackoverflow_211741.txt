The origin of sprintf-style string formatting

The string formatting concept found in sprintf can be found in almost any language today (you know, smothering a string with %s %d %f etc. and providing a list of variables to fill their places) . Which langugage was it originally that had a library function or language construct which offered this functionality? Please specify some kind of source reference to confirm your claim, so that we avoid pure speculation or guessing. Regards Robert
