Grails: eager loading doesn't work

I want to access the list of organisations from a user object within the main.gsp: The user object is defined by the following class: class SystemUser { static hasMany = [organisations: Organisation] static belongsTo = [Organisation] static mapping = { organisations lazy: false } } But when I execute my code, I get: Exception Message: could not initialize proxy - no Session Caused by: Error executing tag : Error executing tag : could not initialize proxy - no Session Why does the eager not work here?
