Welford vs Bayes?

To incrementally estimate the mean and standard deviation of some data one can use an algorithm such as Welfordâ€™s algorithm or Bayesian updating by using the likelihood, a conjugate prior and combining them into a posterior (e.g., see here for the equations used for a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance or precision). What are the advantages and disadvantages of both? When should we use one over the other? The application could be a multi-armed bandit.
