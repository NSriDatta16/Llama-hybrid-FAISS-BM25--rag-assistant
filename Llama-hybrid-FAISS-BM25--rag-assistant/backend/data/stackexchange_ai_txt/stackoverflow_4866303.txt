svn 2 projects same engine - joomla

Currently I have to repositories for two joomla components: /var/svn/component1 structure root administrator/components/com_component1 components/com_component1 /var/svn/component2 structure root administrator/components/com_component2 components/com_component2 The problem is most of the code is similar e.g component1 have extra reviews added but "engine" is the same Now i would like to make changes to engine or fix bug I have do it twice? How to organize svn server to have 1 engine (component base) and extras in Joomla environment? structure of directories has to be the same? Thanks
