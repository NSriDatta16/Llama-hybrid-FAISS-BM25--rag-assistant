Almost the same as derobert's, but other way around. The idea is anyway that you make a subquery that takes the cardnumber with the latest (max) transaction date and then join that with the original table. This of course assumes that there aren't any transactions on cardnumber occuring at the exact same time. SELECT t1.trans_id, t1.cardnumber, t1.trans_date, t1.balance FROM transaction AS t1 JOIN (SELECT MAX(trans_date), cardnumber FROM transactions) AS t2 ON t2.cardnumber = t1.cardnumber
