Recurrent neural networks are the best suited for time-series analysis but they can be somewhat cumbersome to train in practice. You can try couple of layers of convolutions in time direction (does it make sense to do the other direction also? E.g. frequency dimension would). This should be quite a bit faster than a regular NN and would allow you to add a couple of layers increasing model complexity.
