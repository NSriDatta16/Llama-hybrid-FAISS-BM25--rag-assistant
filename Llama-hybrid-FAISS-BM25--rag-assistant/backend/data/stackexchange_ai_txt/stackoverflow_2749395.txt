You can leverage iconv (or a few other functions) to convert a code point number to a UTF-8 string: function unichr($i) { return iconv('UCS-4LE', 'UTF-8', pack('V', $i)); } $codeunits = array(); for ($i = 0; $i (I avoided the surrogate range 0xD800–0xDFFF as they aren't valid to put in UTF-8 themselves; that would be “CESU-8”.)
