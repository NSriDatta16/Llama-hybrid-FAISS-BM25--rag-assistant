How does SVM classify when test data point lies between the 2 margins

I have understood that SVM classifies points using a hyperplane and a margin. A point is classified +ve when w.x + b >= 1 (margin 1) and -ve when w.x + b (margin 2) and the decision boundary has equation as w.x + b = 0 . I still don't understand, how would SVM classify a point coming from test data which lies in between the margin?
