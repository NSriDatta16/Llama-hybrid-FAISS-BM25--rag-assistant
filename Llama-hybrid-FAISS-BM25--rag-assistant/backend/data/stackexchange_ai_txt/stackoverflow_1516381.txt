Data lookup method for small data set with Java?

We have to lookup some data based on three input data fields. The lookup has to be fast. There are only about 20 possible lookup combinations. We've implemented this using a static HashMap instance where we create a key by concatinating the three data fields. Is there a better way to do this or is this the way to go? Code is below. Update : I'm not implying that this code is slow. Just curious if there is a better way to do this. I thought there might be a more elegant solution but I'm happy to keep this in place if there are no compelling alternatives! Create class level static HashMap instance: private static HashMap map = new HashMap(); How we load data into memory: private void load(Iterator iterator) { while (iterator.next()) { Object o = it.next(); key = o.getField1() + "-" + o.getField2() + "-" o.getField3(); map.put(key, o.getData()); } } And how we look up the data based on the three fields: private Stirng getData(String f1, String f2, String f3) { String key = f1 + "-" + f2 + "-" f3; return map.get(key); }
