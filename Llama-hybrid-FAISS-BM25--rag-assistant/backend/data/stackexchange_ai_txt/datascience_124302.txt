Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

I'm a beginner, and I'm wondering whether a logistic regression in a nut-shell is just normalizing a linear regression? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I came to this conclusion because the predicted value of logistic regression is simply just the linear regression's prediction put into a sigmoid to get 0 and 1. So, logistic regression = normalized linear regression?
