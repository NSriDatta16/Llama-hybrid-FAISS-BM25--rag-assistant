Clustering using Random Forests Results

I used a RF model to predict a rare event. After testing using multiple iterations, I settled on a model which provided decent results. I tested this model on a validation data I had kept aside before training the model. The result is similar here also. Now i extracted the votes(ie the probabilities)from the RF model for each training observation and also the probabilities from test & validation runs. Now I have a data frame of all my observation plus a column of the probabilities predicted by the random forest model. I want to preform clustering now on this data to understand the predictor values that are a part of my high probability conversion cluster. Any advice on what tools would be best to explore these clusters.
