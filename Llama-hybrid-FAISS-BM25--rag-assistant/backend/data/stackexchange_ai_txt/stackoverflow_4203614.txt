Python GUI with custom render/drawing

I am looking for a Python GUI library that I can rewrite the rendering / drawing. It has to support basic widgets (buttons, combo boxes, list boxes, text editors, scrolls,), layout management, event handling The thing that I am looking for is to use my custom Direct3D and OpenGL renderer for all of the GUI's drawing / rendering. edit suggested by S.Lott: I need to use this GUI for a 3D editor, since I have to drag and drop a lot of things from the GUI elements to the 3d render area, I wanted to use a GUI system that renders with Direct3D (preffered) or OpenGL. It also has to have a nice look. It is difficult to achieve this with GUI's like WPF, since WPF does not have a handle. Also it needs to be absolutly free for commercial use. edit: I would also like to use the rendering context I initialized for the 3d part in my application
