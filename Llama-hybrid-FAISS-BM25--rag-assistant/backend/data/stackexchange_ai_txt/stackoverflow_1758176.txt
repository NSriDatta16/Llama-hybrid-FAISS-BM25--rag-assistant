Can java transform and validate the input at the same time?

I know how to call a java Transform and have it validate the output against a schema. What I want to do is: Validate the input and Transform it via xsl. I could: Create a Validator Validate and have it output a DOMResponse Pass the DOM to a Transformer. What I really want to do is have this done in one step and not have to create a DOM model; have it all work via SAX. -Dave
