HTML5 web storage is a generic umbrella term for the new client-side data storage options. Local Storage is persistent and scoped to the domain. At the moment two flavors are usually mentioned: 'default': stores things in name/value pairs Web SQL (aka Web Database): uses an SQL database Session Storage is non persistent and scoped only to the current window. Cookies are the old school way of doing all of the above. Stores name/value pairs per domain.
