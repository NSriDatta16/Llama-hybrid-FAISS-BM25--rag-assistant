good question! As far as I know handling both left and right is not possible directly using makeResizable. Btw, by trying to make some tricks using makeDraggable, you could set the element-to-be-resized and 2 draggers (1 left, 1 right) and by dragging each element you could set the left/width properties of the element-to-be-resized. i.e. html: css: #resizable{ width:100px; height:100px; background:red; border:1px solid #787878; position:absolute; left:100px; bottom:100px; } .fakeHandler{ height:100px; width:10px; position:absolute; } #leftHandler{ left:0; cursor:e-resize; } #rightHandler{ right:0; cursor:w-resize; } js: check this fiddle This example is just a sketch that has to be improved . However I think it's a good starting point, or an idea ;)
