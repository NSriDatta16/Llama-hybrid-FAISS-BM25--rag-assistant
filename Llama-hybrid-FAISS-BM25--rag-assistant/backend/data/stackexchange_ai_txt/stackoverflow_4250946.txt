There's not really a whole lot you can do about django templates and their issues with threading, besides not using them, or at least not using the tags that are sensitive to threading issues. There aren't many django template tags that do have issues, only the stateful ones do, such as cycle . In the example you have given, you are not doing anything about thread safety, and you shouldn't be anyway: the logging module is already perfectly thread safe, so long as you use it in the normal way, which is to call logging.getLogger in the modules that need it, and LOGGING or LOGGING_CONFIG is set appropriately in your settings.py . No need to be clever with this. other things you might be concerned about are database integrity in the face of concurrent updates. Don't be, if you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL/INNOdb databases, then you are completely protected from concurrency shennanegans.
