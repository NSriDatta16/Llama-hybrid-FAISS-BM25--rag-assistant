If you are using PEAR or Zend naming conventions, the interface will be in a the components folder. I.e., the a class Myprefix_Router_Interface translates into the path /Myprefix/Router/Interface.php This is an excellent way to compartmentalize your components, and makes organization logical when looking at just the class name (you know exactly where the specific files are located).
