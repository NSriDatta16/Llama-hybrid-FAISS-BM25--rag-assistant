You are basically interested in estimating a Spectrum -assuming you've already gone past the stage of reading the WAV and converting it into a discrete time signal. Among the various methods, the most basic is the Periodogram, which amounts to taking a windowed Discrete Fourier Transform (with a FFT) and keeping its squared magnitude. This correspond to Paul's answer. You need a window which spans over several periods of the lowest frequency you want to detect. Example: if your sinusoids can be as low as 10 Hz (period = 100ms), you should take a window of 200ms o 300ms or so (or more). However, the periodogram has some disadvantages , though it's simple to compute and it's more than enough if high precision is not required: The raw periodogram is not a good spectral estimate because of spectral bias and the fact that the variance at a given frequency does not decrease as the number of samples used in the computation increases. The periodogram can perform better by averaging several windows, with a judious choosing of the widths ( Bartlet method ). And there are many other methods for estimating the spectrum (AR modelling). Actually, you are not exactly interested in estimating a full spectrum, but only the location of a single frequency. This can be done seeking a peak of an estimated spectrum (done as explained), but also by more specific and powerful (and complicated) methods (Pisarenko, MUSIC algorithm). They would probably be overkill in your case.
