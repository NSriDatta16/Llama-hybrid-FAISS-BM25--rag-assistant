Just because there is a high correlation between the two does not mean that they are dependent. Any non-zero correlation in the population is proof of dependence, but you don't need to look at the correlation in the sample to infer that this is matched (on person). I'm looking for a general description of "matched pairs" I guess that terminology may differ across books, but to my mind a matched pair is not what you have here. (Matched pairs are where you identify similar subjects/experimental units and associate them together e.g. matching on size, age and gender -- see the first paragraph here - that is, take an action to identify pairs that will be similar on any variables of importance in order that they can be used as blocks). Some definitions of 'matched pairs' don't seem to follow this convention, though (a pity because this is a useful distinction for which they'll now need a new term). You have paired data, certainly, but they're naturally occurring pairs. The fact that they're both from the same person is the giveaway. [If your book would call values from twins a 'matched pair' then this would be a matched pair of values.] Paired of values will tend to be more alike within a specific pair than across them. In this case the "person" is giving you the specific (height, arm-length) pair. People vary in general size, so if height and arm-length tend to be similar (whether or not the null is actually true) they will tend to be more similar within one person than they would be across people (person A's height will be less similar to person-B's arm-length than to her own). These inherent 'pairs' are what is giving you 'paired data'.
