You should be using enums in your code - strong typing helps avoid a lot of mistakes - and converting them to strings or numbers for storage. Strings do require significantly more storage space - "Basketball" is 10-20 bytes depending on encoding, and if you store it as 4 it only needs 1 byte. However, there are very few cases where this will actually matter - if you have a million records, it is still less than 20MB difference in total database size. Strings are easier to work with and less likely to fail silently if the enumeration changes, so use strings. Strings are also slower than numbers for most operations, including conversion to enum on load. However, the difference is orders of magnitude less than the time taken to retrieve anything at all from the database, so doesn't matter.
