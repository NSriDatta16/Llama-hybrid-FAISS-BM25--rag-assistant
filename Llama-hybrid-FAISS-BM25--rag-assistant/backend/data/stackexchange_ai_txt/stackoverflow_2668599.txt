In my opinion you need a pivot grid control. There are good ones at Infragistics and DevExpress Edit: but, if you do it manually, I would have something like this (from the top of my head) Class Data Public Categories() as List Public Types() as List Public table as list( of row ) End Class Class Row Public Category as string Public Type as string Public Group as string Public Header1 as string Public Header2 as string Public cell as string End Class Then I would code a function like: (pseudo-code) function AddData( Category, Type, Group, theData ) 1. Search if the Category exist in array of categories, else add it 2. Search if the Type exist in array of Types, else add it 3. add the rec end function function DisplayData( ) //show headers For each category in data.categories For each Type in data.categories AddColumn( Category, Type ) next next //get the groups for each group in (from g in data.table select g.group).distinct for each category in data.categories for each type in data.types cell = (from r in data.table where r.category = category and r.type = type and r.group = group) if cell is nothing then addcell("null") else addcell(cell) end if next next next I think I left behind the several rows that may have the common category, but you will get the idea. It's not the best in performance, but it is easy to follow.
