Looks like to me that a 10-fold cross validation was used where the dataset was split into 10 equal parts and 9 parts was used to train the model and test on the last part. Repeating this for each of the 10 parts would produce 10 sets of prediction error. The "Test error" in the table refers to the average of the 10 cross validation errors which can be calculated this way: For each tuning parameter $\theta$ in the model, $CV(\theta) = \frac{1}{10} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{10} CV_k(\theta)$ where $CV_k(\theta) = \frac{1}{|F_k|} \sum\limits_{i\in F_k} (y_i -\hat{f_\theta} ^{-k}(x_i))^2 $ The "Standard Error" refers to the error made on the cross-validation estimate which can be obtained by first calculating the SD of the 10 CV errors, and estimating the SE by correcting by a factor: $SD(\theta)=\sqrt{var(CV_1 (\theta),CV_2(\theta),...,CV_{10}(\theta))}$ $SE(\theta) = \frac{SD(\theta)}{\sqrt{10}}$ Note that this can be generalised to a $K$-fold CV by replace $10$ by $K$ in the formula. Hope this helps!
