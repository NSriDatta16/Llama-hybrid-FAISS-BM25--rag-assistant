The Behrens-Fisher distribution is defined by $t_2\cos\theta - t_1\sin\theta$ where $\theta$ is a real number and $t_2$ and $t_1$ are independent $t$-distributions with degrees of freedom $\nu_2$ and $\nu_1$ respectively. Behrens and Fisher's solution of the Behrens-Fisher problem involves the Behrens-Fisher distribution with $\theta$ depending on the observations because it is a pseudo-Bayesian (in fact, a fiducial) solution: this data-depending distribution is a posterior-like distribution of $\tau$ (with $\delta$ the only random part in the definition of $\tau$ because the data are fixed).
