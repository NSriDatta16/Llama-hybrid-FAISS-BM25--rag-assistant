Looks like all of your fitted values are within $(0,1)$ . This is what you would expect if the neural network were intended for modelling probabilities, which is what people often need when doing classification. In these instances, the output layer of the neural network uses a sigmoid function or some other function bounded within $(0,1)$ . I am not sure how the train function of the caret package works, but the nnet function of the nnet package uses a sigmoid transformation in the output layer by default; see the argument linout = FALSE of nnet . You may need to supply linout = TRUE as an additional argument to the train function. This could remove the sigmoid transformation from the output layer and thus allow for fitted values outside the $(0,1)$ range.
