JavaEE containers will not serve resources out of a jar. If you wanted to package by feature you'd have to pre-compile your JSPs and place them in the same package as other servlets for your feature. By supposing you did that, you wouldn't be able to serve any static resources from within the jar such as images, css or javascript. If you really wanted to get fancy I suppose you could write a general purpose servlet that would serve resources from a jar. But I imagine that would get fairly complicated fairly quickly for little gain.
