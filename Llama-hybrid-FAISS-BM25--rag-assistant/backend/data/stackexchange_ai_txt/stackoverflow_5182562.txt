The yellow box in the storage guide says: Android does not impose any limitations beyond the standard SQLite concepts. We do recommend including an autoincrement value key field that can be used as a unique ID to quickly find a record. This is not required for private data, but if you implement a content provider, you must include a unique ID using the BaseColumns._ID constant. Now when you click on the BaseColumns class you will see public static final String _ID The unique ID for a row. Type: INTEGER (long) Constant Value: "_id" So I guess, a GUID will not work.
