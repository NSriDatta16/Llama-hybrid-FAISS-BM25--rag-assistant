I agree with the point that statistics consultants are often brought in later on a project when it's too late to remedy design flaws. It's also true that many statistics books give scant attention to study design issues. You say you want designs "preferably for a wide range of methods (e.g. t-test, GLM, GAM, ordination techniques...". I see designs as relatively independent of statistical method: e.g., experiments (between subjects and within subjects factors) versus observational studies; longitudinal versus cross-sectional; etc. There are also a lot of issues related to measurement, domain specific theoretical knowledge, and domain specific study design principles that need to be understood in order to design a good study. In terms of books, I'd be inclined to look at domain specific books. In psychology (where I'm from) this means books on psychometrics for measurement, a book on research methods, and a book on statistics, as well as a range of even more domain specific research method books. You might want to check out Research Methods Knowledge Base for a free online resource for the social sciences. Published journal articles are also a good guide to what is best practice in a particular domain.
