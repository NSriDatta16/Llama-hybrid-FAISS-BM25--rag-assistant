Logistic Regression-Linear Features

I was reading this post on quora https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-different-classification-algorithms It states here that :-"Logistic regression is a pretty well-behaved classification algorithm that can be trained as long as you expect your features to be roughly linear and the problem to be linearly separable" What does it mean to have features linear?. Another place this comes up in the post is "Tree Ensembles have different advantages over LogisticR. One main advantage is that they do not expect linear features " I am not sure what does linear features mean?
