Sensitivity and specificity for non-binary outcome

I'm very new to machine learning (this is my second project and only the first significant one) and here's the problem I'm currently dealing with: I am evaluating the performance of a model that outputs a percentage as a final result (which is not meant to be thresholded to create separate categories). This result is compared against the estimation given by pathologists, and I've been asked to create a ROC curve testing different parameters for my model. The issue is, as far as I understand it, that can only be done for a binary 0/1 output. I suppose I could set a margin within which my model would be judged to be 'accurate' but I don't see how I could divide my results between true/false positives/negatives. It seems to me that this is simply not an applicable approach for my situation, but I might be mistaken....Is there a way to produce a ROC curve in such a situation?
