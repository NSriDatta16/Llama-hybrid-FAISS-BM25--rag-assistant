You can ensure that the library in question is used only from a single thread at a time. If it contains instantiatable classes, one possibility is to hold these in thread local storage . Or you can build a thread-safe wrapper around it. These approaches could also be combined, e.g. you can wrap the library in a class (it would be a Facade in this case), which is not thread safe in itself, but whose instances you access from a single thread at a time. Update: as @Wim pointed out, if the library manages global state, you must have a thread safe wrapper to ensure that changes are made visible between threads.
