openCV usage cvFindDominantPoints

Does anyone know how to use the cvFindDominantPoints API of openCV? I basically have a 1 channel, binary image from which I get a set of contours. Judging from the image, I seem to be getting the correct contours. Now, I am selecting one of these contours to get dominant points of. This contour has about 60 vertices. However, the API call to cvFindDominantPoints is giving me a sequence of points (about 15) that does not even lie on the contour. It is quite far from it. Any insight? my usage: CvSeq *dominantpoints = cvFindDominantPoints(targetSeq, tristorage, CV_DOMINANT_IPAN, 7, 9, 9, 150);
