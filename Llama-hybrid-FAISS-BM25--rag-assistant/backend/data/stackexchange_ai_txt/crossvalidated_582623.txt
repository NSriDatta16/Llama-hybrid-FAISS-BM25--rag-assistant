Only you and your colleagues can answer the question in the title, based on your understanding of the subject matter. Here's how I would start to approach it. In your plot, it looks like the coefficient estimate is slightly below 0.1 at early times, and drops off a bit at later times. It would help to add a horizontal line at the overall coefficient estimate from the model.* Let's say the estimate at early times is $\beta(\text{early}) = 0.08$ , that at late times is $\beta(\text{late}) = 0.05$ , and the coefficient returned by the model overall is $\beta=0.065$ . That corresponds to a hazard ratio of 1.067 for the model's overall estimate, versus 1.083 for early times and 1.051 for late times. How practically significant are those differences? I think that addresses specific questions 1,3, and 4. With respect to continuous predictors, I'd first worry about modeling them with adequate flexibility. It's unrealistic to expect an exact linear association of such a predictor with the log-hazard of an event. Mis-specifying the association with outcome can show up as an apparent violation of proportional hazards (PH). See this page for an example. With this size data set you can have a lot of flexibility in modeling individual predictors and potential interactions. Table 20.9 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies summarize strengths and weaknesses of several approaches to evaluating PH. For a continuous predictor you could use categorical log-log plots for PH on cases grouped by quantiles of their values. Alternatively, you could include properly modeled interactions of the covariate with time in the model, as described near the end of Section 20.6.2 of that book, and evaluate the significance of the interactions with time. That's equivalent to the modeling of time-varying covariates explained in Section 4.2 of the R survival package time-dependence vignette . It might be computationally expensive for your large data set. But even after you've done all that, the fundamental question is still one that only you and your colleagues can answer: is the violation of PH large enough to matter for your application? *Although this is called a "Schoenfeld residual plot," the plot is of the time-dependent estimates of the regression coefficient, residuals added to the overall model coefficient. The coefficient returned by the full model can be considered a type of average.
