Matlab - why crossval function inputs a full trained model?

The question is regarding the Matlab implementation. As we can see here , the crossval function expects to receive a full trained model. For example, my data consist of 100 observations and we would like to build a model that classify each observation to "1" or "-1" using the SVM classifier. So if we like to cross validate we first should fit a classifier for all 100 observations (this results a ClassificationSVM model trained using fitcsvm) and then we input the crossval function with it. What I don't understand is, why Matlab's implementation require to first train the model before cross validating? since the standard CV process trains on each k âˆ’ 1 subsamples (and don't use the full fitted model).
