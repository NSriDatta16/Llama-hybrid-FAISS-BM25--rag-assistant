Predicted 90% chances with 70% accuracy - so what are the chances?

If my model, for some inputs, tells me that there is a probability of 90% for an event A to happen but the model predictions agrees with test data in 70% of cases then what is the real probability for event A / what else do I have to know or calculate to get the real probability for an event A? Update: I've been asked to give more details. I have a relation [i1,i2,...,in] -> {0,1} where in - value of n-th indicator. I have create a logistic model using neural network. We can say that this model have "learned" probabilities for the input vector. I consider the output value of this model to be my probability. Now, for simplicity of this example, I assume that values >= 0.5 are rounded to 1 and Now i take a test data-set and pass it through the model making predictions which I round to 0 or 1. I compare that with real outcomes from the dataset. The outcomes predicted from the model match the outcomes listed in the test data set in 70% of cases. What can I do now to correct my probability estimation by the accuracy of prediction? What refining techniques are possible?
