As a freelancer, I often feel cut off from learning resources that would otherwise be available in a team/office environment. I have found working with Zend Framework to be extremely helpful in learning best practices for application architecture, code-re-use, separation of concerns, and coding conventions. The learning curve felt a bit steep to me, but I realize now that I was not just learning ZF-specific content, but also general development concepts. The community is active and I have found many of them to be very helpful and encouraging. I have made ZF my default choice for new projects and on my legacy sites, I have been able to successfully employ many of the components. I recommend ZF very highly.
