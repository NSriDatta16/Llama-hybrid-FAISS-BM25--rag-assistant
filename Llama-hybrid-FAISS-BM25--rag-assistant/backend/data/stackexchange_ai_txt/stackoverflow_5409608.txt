It you work with the custom formatter you should just work with strings and not use and jQuery operation. For example if you have HTML fragment represented having "blabla" as the "id" and you want to set new id you can just use string replace method. In the same way you can rewrite your custom formatter. You current code is much much slowly. You should understand, that every $("#myid") operation is the slower the more elements with id you have on you page. Moreover you use jQuery.clone which has not fixed bugs. So I strictly recommend you simplify the code of your custom formatter and use only string or RegExp operations inside.
