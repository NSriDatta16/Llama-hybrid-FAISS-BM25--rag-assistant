I think the problem here is that cycle length is growing as the training window proceeds down the time series. That will give any NN heartburn. Consider a radically different approach based on feature detection. When you look at a repeating cycle you see it contains various components, which remain the same at any frequency: A top, bottom, rising trend, and falling trend. First build a NN that detects these components. Then a straight algorithm that scores the component sequence as well as estimates the time distance between them. Then another algo that reconstructs the location of future components, then a 3rd algo reconstruct the entire future time series to fit the time and locations of projected components (cubic splining?) This approach is more likely to survive a time series with growing wavelength. So in all of this, the NN is used to perform the hard part: pattern recognition on noisy data.
