Trouble with Cross Domain Iframes on IE8: changing parent.location forces new popup window. if on a click event, it works as expected

I'm having a lot of trouble getting cross domain iframe communication working. It's working on Firefox and Chrome, but on Internet Explorer, it only works in some ways: If the parent.location = 'new_hash'; is not encompassed in an onClick event, it forces the parent frame to open a new popup window. If it is in an onClick event, the cross domain fragment identifier trick works. What gives? Sounds like I need to understand javascript.. Edit to comments: parent.location.href and parent.location have the same behavior. It seems to be my specific browser IE 8.0.7600.16385 reading the hash change as a popup. I'd like to hear if anybody else has experienced something like this. Creates popup in parent: parent.location = 'http://example.com#new_hash'; shows a "popup blocked" dialog in IE8. If I let the popups open, they infinitely open popups. Does not create popup in parent: clicky or $(function() { $("mybutton").click( function() { parent.location='http://example.com#new_hash'; }); Does not create popup in parent. My real example Mine needs the parent.location=newhash to fire when its own hash has a certain value. I essentially have a : setInterval(function() { if (location.hash == 'something') { parent.location='http://example.com#new_hash'; } }, 500); What's going on? How can I tackle this problem? Why does it work when tied to a click event but not if the statement runs on its own? The specific example i'm working on is at http://www.grovemade.com/products/test at v.04 I'm actively messing around here so it may become outdated.. On Firefox and Chrome, the parent frame is modified from no hash, to #xdm-success, to #handshake-complete. On IE8, #xdm-success forces a new page to open. Thank you!
