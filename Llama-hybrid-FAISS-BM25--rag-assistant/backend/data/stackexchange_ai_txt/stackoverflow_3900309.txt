Random number generator that generates integers for Java

I want to generate some random integers in Java, but this according to some distribution laws. More specific: I want to generate some random integers for gaussian distribution. I found out only generators which return double results for the gaussian distribution. Why is that? I want to generate some random integers between some limits for exponential distribution? Here I also found out only about generators which return double. I also didn't find out a way to generate some random exponential numbers only between two limits. Can you help me? Do you know a library which can do what I want? I studied Michael Flanagan's library, colt and apache's Commons Math but they don't have what I need. Thanks!
