Is there a DRYer method in this controller?

Using ROR 2.3.8. Here's my code: class CitiesController ["(city=? or state=?) and country=? and shop_type=?", "#{@city.name}", "#{@city.name}", @city.country, "Places"], :page => params[:page], :per_page => 20, :order => 'rating_average DESC' ) end def middle-east @city = City.find(params[:id]) @spots = Spot.paginate( :conditions => ["(city=? or state=?) and country=? and shop_type=?", "#{@city.name}", "#{@city.name}", @city.country, "Food"], :page => params[:page], :per_page => 20, :order => 'rating_average DESC' ) end def asian @city = City.find(params[:id]) @spots = Spot.paginate( :conditions => ["(city=? or state=?) and country=? and shop_type=?", "#{@city.name}", "#{@city.name}", @city.country, "Accommodation"], :page => params[:page], :per_page => 20, :order => 'rating_average DESC' ) end end I've created western.html.erb , middle-east.html.erb , asian.html.erb and _shops.html.erb . So the first three are basically empty, but yields the _shops.html.erb in order not for me to recode the view layout. Is there a better method in writing the controller? Thanks!
