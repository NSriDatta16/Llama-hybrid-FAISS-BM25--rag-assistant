User Control obstructing underlying User Control from recieving drag and drop content

I have an WPF application where there is a toolbox on the left with objects that you can drag and drop in a large area to the right. This large area is treated like a time line. There is a slider at the top that is used to scrub through the time line and there is a ruler across the bottom displaying time increments. In the middle, there is the area that receives the drag and drop content. The slider (top) and ruler (bottom) are contained in a scroll viewer, in their own separate user control, which sits "on top" of the drag and drop area. The problem is that the this user control is obstructing the drag and drop area from receiving its content. I tried experimenting with the "IsHitTestVisible" property on various elements and this did not help. When i disabled the IsHitTestVisible property on the proper elements, it allowed for the drag and drop ability that I was looking for, but then in turn disabled my slider and scroll viewer. Any ideas on how to bypass this problem? Thanks in advance! -Matt
