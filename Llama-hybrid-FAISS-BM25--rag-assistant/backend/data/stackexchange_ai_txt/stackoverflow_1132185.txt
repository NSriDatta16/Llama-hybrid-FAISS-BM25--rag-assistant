How to configure curl to only show percentage?

Is there an option for the curl command to show only a percentage output to shell rather than all of this, for example: % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 12.4M 100 12.4M 0 0 4489k 0 0:00:02 0:00:02 --:--:-- 4653k Maybe there is a flag I can set? If not, pipe it somehow through a regular expression to show me a continuous update of the percentage only? Thanks all
