Chris solution is the most correct. But I think you should not do more than you need. Solution should be extandable and that's enough. Change value of a parameter is a bad practice. Never use empty generic catch statement, at least add a comment why you do so. Make the methods throw exception and handle them where it is appropriate to do so. So now it is much more elegant :) public void MyMethod() { try { GetNewOrders(); CheckInventory(); PreOrder(); // etc } finally { // do something } }
