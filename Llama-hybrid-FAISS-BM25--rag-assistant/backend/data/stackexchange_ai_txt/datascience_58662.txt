Data quality improvement as a part of preprocessing: Imputation

I have a python pandas dataframe representing a superset. The data contains a lot of nulls which I want to overwrite with real values. the superset has: both numerical and categorical data some nulls for most attributes multi class attributes (attributes can have multiple values) It is not time dependent each row is a unique person It would be neat to use machine learning to fill in the nulls, any recommendations on how I can do this? (I guess that I can tranform the categorical data to numerical if required)
