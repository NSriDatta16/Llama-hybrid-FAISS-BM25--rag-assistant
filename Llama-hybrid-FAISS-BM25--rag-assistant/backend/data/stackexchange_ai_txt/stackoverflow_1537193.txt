I would love to contribute as I just discovered the answer on my own after quite a bit of frustration. The UITextField in InterfaceBuilder has a forced frame height of 31 pixels. This cannot be click-dragged to resize nor can it be set in the frame properties in IB. You need to go to viewDidLoad and adjust the frame height to 32 pixels, and this should solve the problem. Hopefully, future versions of IB will correct this.
