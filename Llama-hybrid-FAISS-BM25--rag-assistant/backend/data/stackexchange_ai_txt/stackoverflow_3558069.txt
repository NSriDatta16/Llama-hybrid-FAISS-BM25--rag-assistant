I don't see what the issue is with a plugin having dependencies so long as these are qualified and easily understood. A Rails plugin is nothing without Rails, and often it requires a specific version. The thing that's bad design is having a plugin which will wreck an app if it can't load properly instead of producing some kind of useful message. For instance, you might test the environment before launching in feet-first. A very brute-force way of doing this, but at least giving feedback, might be like this in an initializer for your plug-in: unless (defined?(MyApp)) raise "MyAppPlugin requires MyApp to be installed" end You can do this more elegantly by making private gems for your app and setting the requirements more formally. The new Bundler system makes this possible.
