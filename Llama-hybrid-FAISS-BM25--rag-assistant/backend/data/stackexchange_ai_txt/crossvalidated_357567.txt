A short answer which is a quote I like from Gary Kasparov's book Deep Thinking A clever process beats superior knowledge and superior technology I work mainly with time-series financial data, and the process from gathering data, cleaning it, processing it, and then working with the problem owners to figure out what they actually want to do, to then building features and models to try and tackle the problem and finally to retrospectively examine the process to improve for next time. This whole process is greater than the sum of its parts. I tend to get 'acceptable' generalisation performance with a linear/logistic regression and talking with domain experts to generate features, way better time spent than spending time over-fitting my model to the data I have.
