C# Storing Binary Stream (or byte Array) in Resources

I am guessing, as Images and Icons are stored in a resx file, I am guessing that it should be relatively easy to store a byte array (or similar stream) in an embedded Resource file. How might this be done, should I pretend the binary stream is a Bitmap, or if the Resource file is the wrong place to be embedding binary data, what other techniques should I investigate?
