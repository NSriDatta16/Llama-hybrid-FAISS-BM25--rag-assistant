I suggest to run basic models, such as linear/logistic regression using stepwise selection criterion. I found very useful the stepAIC function (from MASS package) in R. Correlations are useful but also potentially misleading, what if all the features correlate with the target variable but there is multicollinearity? library(MASS) lm. fit
