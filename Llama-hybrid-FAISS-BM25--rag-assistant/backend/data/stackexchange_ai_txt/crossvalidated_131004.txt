Unadjusted OR is a simple ratio of probabilities of outcome in two groups $p_1, p_2$ (check here or here ): $$OR = \frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)} $$ and it can be derived from the results of logistic regression (as opposed to counting a simple ratio calculated by hand from a $2 \times 2$ table). However, in logistic regression you can include other, confounding variables so to control their influence on your dependent variable and if you do so, what you can get is OR that is adjusted for the influence of confounders (see also here ). So you adjust by controlling additional variables in logistic regression model.
