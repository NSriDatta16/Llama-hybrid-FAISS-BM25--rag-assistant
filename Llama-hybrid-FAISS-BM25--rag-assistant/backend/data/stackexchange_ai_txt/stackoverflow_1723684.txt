I would guess that if you accessed an identical URL it would look in the cache first, but can't say with any authority. Why not just try it? It may need to be in the manifest of both apps, which might lead to unpredictable results. I would also worry about behavior changing with new versions of Safari. However, what will work is to use localStorage. You can serialize just about anything and save it in localStorage variables for other webapps from the same domain to use. The only limit is the Â±5MB per domain (I think). Which leads to an important warning: DO NOT use the same localStorage.variablename in multiple webapps/web pages unless you want to as both apps can change the value. If you do this unintentionally, expect hair pulling support issues.
