Is there something in the Android developer guidelines that disuadea developers from providing the option to "exit" (stop running) an application from within the application itself? Yes. It is generally not needed, just as it is generally not needed to restart a Web server because some user with a browser decided (s)he is done with a Web app. the vast majority of apps don't have their own Exit functions and hence just keep running forever They don't keep running forever. Android will close things up as needed. don't give you a choice about running when you turn on the phone - they just do by default Those developers aren't paying attention to me . Both of these things lead to memory usage constantly increasing Generally, it doesn't. If you find specific apps that do this, uninstall them. and your device running with this performance burden all of the time Generally, it doesn't. If you find specific apps that do this, uninstall them. Also, this question is a duplicate of this one .
