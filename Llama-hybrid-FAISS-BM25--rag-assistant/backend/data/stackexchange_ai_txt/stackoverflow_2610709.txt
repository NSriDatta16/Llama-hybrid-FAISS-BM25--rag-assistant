Gallio MbUnit and Team City problem

I asked a question this morning about an integration problem between Gallio and Team City. I changed the msbuild file to use the proper syntax with the latest Gallio build script API. Thank you for that Jeff Brown but now when I tried to build the application on Team City I get the following error : An unexpected error occurred during execution of the Gallio task.[16:19:49]: [Project "CoderForTraders.msbuild.teamcity.patch.tcprojx" (RebuildSolution;RunTests target(s)):] C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\fa1d38b0af329d65\CoderForTraders.msbuild(9, 9): FilterParseException: Colon expected Here's line 9 : and here is the whole file : Do you have an idea about the possible problem ?
