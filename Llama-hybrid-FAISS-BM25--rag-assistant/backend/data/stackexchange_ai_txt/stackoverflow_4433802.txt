Help setting up YUI Compressor with maven, spring, freemarker etc. for different environments (test/development/production)

I am almost done setting my project to use normal javascript files or the min versions for different environments, but there's one thing I can't figure out - at least not elegantly. I've set up my project's Maven POM to use the YUI compressor: net.alchim31.maven yuicompressor-maven-plugin 1.1 .min compress This works no problem. I also created a freemarker macro to include various css and javascript files... and if we want to use "min" versions, it will add the suffix into them: My only problem now is getting Spring or Maven to put "true/false" (or I guess it could just set the suffix too) in my freemarker script for me if I am in test environment or production environment. How have you guys dealt with this issue? Honestly, I don't want to do any manually fudging around when I deploy my app. I just want to tell maven, "Use my production environment" and it works.
