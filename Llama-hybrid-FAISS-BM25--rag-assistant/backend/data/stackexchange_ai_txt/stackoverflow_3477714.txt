Acceptable load depends on the number of CPU cores. If there is one core, than load average more than 1 is overload. If there are four cores, than load average of more than four is overload. People often just specify the number of cores using -j switch. See some empirical numbers here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17749621/412080
