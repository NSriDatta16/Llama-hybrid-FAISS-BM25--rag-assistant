Make sure you're actually wiring up the handler for the button's event (probably touch up inside) and not the button itself. So instead of dragging directly from the button, either ctrl-click the button to see its connections and drag from its touch up inside event to the target, or ctrl-click the target, find the action, and drag from that to the button. If the action doesn't show up on the target in these cases, and you're sure interface builder knows what class it is, then I'm baffled.
