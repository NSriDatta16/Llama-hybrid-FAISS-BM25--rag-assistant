As the others have already stated, you either need to provide the path to those files or switch the current working directory so the os can find the files. ++entry_pos doesn't do anything. There is no increment operator in Python. Prefix + is just there fore symmetry with prefix - . Prefixing something with two + is just two no-ops. So you're not actually doing anything (and after you change it to entry_pos += 1 , you're still resetting it to zero in each iteration. Also, your code is very inelegant - for example, you are using a separate index to file_list and fail to keep that in synch with the iteration variable file_name , even though you could just use that one! To show how this can be done better. - def rename_by_ext(to_ext, path): if to_ext[0] != '.': to_ext = '.'+to_ext print "Renaming files in", path for file_name in os.listdir(path): root, ext = os.path.splitext(file_name) print "Renaming", file_name, "to", root+ext os.rename(os.path.join(path, file_name), os.path.join(path, root+to_ext)) rename_by_ext('.rar', '...')
