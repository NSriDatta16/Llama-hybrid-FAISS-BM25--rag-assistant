The values of "Top" and "Left", unless explicitly defined in the CSS, won't be defined. Dragging controls onto the designer won't do that as the Top/Left positions can vary depending on the browser, the end users screen resolution (whether elements get re-positioned due to the width of the screen) and a number of other factors. You'll probably need, from the sounds of it, to use a bit of client side javascript (if possible) to trigger the pop-up being shown and/or setting its Top and Left properties.
