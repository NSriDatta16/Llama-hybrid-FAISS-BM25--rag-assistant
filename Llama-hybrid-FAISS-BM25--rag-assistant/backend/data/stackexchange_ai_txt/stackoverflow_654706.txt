You could probably get away with a basic Network Load-Balanced cluster for your web servers but you need more sophisticated hardware to run a SQL cluster, specifically the shared quorum drive. Your Mac Mini's aren't really suitable for this purpose. You could use SQL Server High Availability Database Mirroring instead. I would recommend picking up copies of Pro SQL Server 2005 High Availability by Allan Hirt and Windows Server 2003 Clustering and Load Balancing by Robert J. Shimonski and do some research before embarking on this adventure. Although the titles refer to SQL Server 2005 and Windows 2003, the material is still very relevant to SQL Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008.
