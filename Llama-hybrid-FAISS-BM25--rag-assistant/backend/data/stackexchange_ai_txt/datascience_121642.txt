Given the nature of the problem, it might not be amenable to machine learning. The structure of the data drives how it can be modeled. The features are "name" (assumed to be a string) and "type" (assumed to be hierarchical categories). The target is called "signature". Typically, signatures are unique. Labeling unique items is commonly called identification (i.e., mapping different occurrences to the same individual instance). That is different than categorization (i.e., finding features common among a discrete group). Machine learning tends to focus on the generalization problem of categorization, not on identification.
