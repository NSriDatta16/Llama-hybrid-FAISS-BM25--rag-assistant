its very challengning task to extract text that reflects real opnions of people because machine learning is still not advanced in this area, take a look at the following example: your program finds this sentence on some SN website: "I made her duck" what are possible options that your program will infer: 1-i cooked a duck for her 2-i "magically" transformed her into a duck" 3-i took her duck and created it. and many other so its really challenge. I suggest to take a look at NLP(natural language processing) which covers this area you're interested in
