RNN model for predicting room temperatures

I am currently doing a project in Machine Learning where I am trying to predict the temperature of a room in future. I have a 1-year dataset of a house with 12 rooms. Data is collected at 10 min interval. Hence, 6 points at every 1 hr interval. The dataset contains the following features - Outdoor Temperature [degC] Global solar radiation [W/m2] Rain Status [Yes/No] Outdoor Wind Speed [m/s] Outdoor Wind Direction [deg] Individual Room Temperature of all the room [degC] Individual Occupancy information for all the rooms [Yes/No] Individual Electricity consumption of all the rooms [W] Individual Light power consumption of all the rooms [W] I plan to predict the Room Temperature of 1 Specific Room, using input features (total - 18 features) Outdoor Temperature Global Solar radiation Outdoor Wind Speed Outdoor Wind Direction Specific room Occupancy Specific room Electricity consumption Specific room Light power Room temperature of all other 11 rooms I am planning to train an RNN model to predict the temperature of the specific room. Now, in the house, we also have a floor heating system, that will heat the room to achieve a setpoint temperature. The idea with the model is to guide the floor heating system to make it act upon the future room temperature in the room. Now my doubt is if a model trained on data collected without floor heating, can also predict in presence of floor heating? I am hoping that the model will learn the relation between the different input features with room temperature. Hence, even if I change the room temperature, the model will still be able to predict. Let me know your thoughts.
