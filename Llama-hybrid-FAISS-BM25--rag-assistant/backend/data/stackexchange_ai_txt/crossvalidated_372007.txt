Dynamic Time Warping w/ Different Sampling Rates

I am fairly familiar with the basics of calculating the Dynamic Time Warping distance between two time series but I am not sure if it can handle the following case: Two series sampled at different and irregular rates. For example, I observe how many leaves fall from two different trees and I record the the time that each leaf or set of leaves fall. So observations for tree 1 might look like, at (10AM,1), (10:00:01,5), (10:00:08,2), etc. Then tree 2 might be (10AM,0), (10:00:03,1), (10:00:12,1), etc. How can I apply DTW in this situation?
