One possibility is to use the TimeSpan as Itay indicated, but divide by 30.4375 (the average days per month), ignoring fractional months. This is close enough for things I'm currently working on, but may not be accurate enough based on your needs. For instance, The difference between February 1 and March 1 would be 0, which (based on a 30.4375 day month definition) is correct; it may not be correct for your particular purposes, however.
