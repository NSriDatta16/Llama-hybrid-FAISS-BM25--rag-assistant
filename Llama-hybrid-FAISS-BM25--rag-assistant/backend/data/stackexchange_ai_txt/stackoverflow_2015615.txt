The premise of your question states: In our organization we have the need to let employees filter date in our web application by supplying WHERE clauses. I find this premise to be flawed on its face. I can't imagine a situation where I would allow users to do this. In addition to the problems you have already identified, you are opening yourself up to SQL Injection attacks. I would highly recommend reassessing your requirements to see if you can't build a safer, more focused way of allowing your users to search. However, if your users really are sophisticated (and trusted!) enough to be supplying WHERE clauses directly, they need to be educated on what they can and can't submit as a filter.
