There are numerous topics that you've mentioned but I will suggest those which I've read and are helpful. For hidden markov models and markov processes I suggest reading Pattern Classification by Richard O. Duda . You can also take a look at Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop . For better understanding Markov processes and their behaviour, you can also take the course stochastic process which is also known as random process . I suggest taking that course before reading any book, because you may need some help if you're not very familiar to the concepts. For LSTMs , I highly suggest taking a look at the fifth course of deep learning on coursera by pr. Andrew Ng . If you do their homework you can realise how the inner operations exactly work and you'll have a very deep understanding of time series and what their nature is. After that, you can take a look at the Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow .
