ckeditor class on paragraph is not being recognized

Good day to all. I need to put a class on paragraph tags in ckeditor. Inside config.js I added: ... config.format_p = { element : 'p', attributes : { class : 'whatever' } }; ... as in http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html#.format_p . The problem is that the class is not being recognized (paragraphs still don't have any class). Can anyone help pls?
