You can do it in 3 ways: You can have while and for loops inside method, and then just call return You can break for-loop and set some flag which will cause exit in while-loop Use label (example below) This is example for 3rd way (with label): public void someMethod() { // ... search: for (i = 0; i example from this site In my opinion 1st and 2nd solution is elegant. Some programmers don't like labels.
