iAd error "Ad inventory unavailable"

I'm adding iAd to my app. Now, in simulator, it works well but when I load it on a device (v4.1) the ADBannerViewDelegate calls bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError: with this description on the error.userInfo { ADInternalErrorCode = 3; NSLocalizedFailureReason = "Ad inventory unavailable"; } I think my iAd Network setup is correct. Have I to add an ad by myself or iAd Network automatically sends test ads as in simulator? EDIT: I think it was a latency problem of the iAd Network server that dispatches the ads. I suppose that when the network had ads for my app it began to work fine.
