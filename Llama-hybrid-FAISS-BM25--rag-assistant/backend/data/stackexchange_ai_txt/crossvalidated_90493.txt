You don't explicitly state in your question whether you're prepared to assume independence of the two times, but some things about the way you wrote your question do seem to suggest it. I'm not at all sure that is a reasonable assumption, since if traffic turns bad, the average wait and the average trip will be longer, in both cases because the buses will tend to be delayed. Nonetheless, I have written the rest of this under the assumption that you intended the question to apply to the situation where they're independent. The convolution of a normal and an exponential has what is sometimes called an Exponentially modified Gaussian (ExGaussian) distribution. Some ExGaussians are skewed, others are very nearly normal. With your particular parameters, the distribution of the sum is not very close to normal. Here's a histogram of simulated values (100,000 of them) for the sum: The mean and variance of the sum is easy - the mean is the sum of the means, and for independent variables, the variance is the sum of the variances; but this is not much use for getting the 99th percentile. Incidentally, the same simulation above can be used to get a pretty good estimate of the 99th percentile: The results from five simulations (of 1,000,000 values of $X+Y$ each) give 99.31, 99.23, 99.20, 99.26, 99.45 minutes respectively; if you need more accuracy, more simulations would be needed -- or actually finding the argument of the CDF that gives 0.99 (the CDF is given at the link to the ExGaussian I gave above). A little trial and error with that CDF gives the value 99.34 minutes for the 99th percentile, which seems to be consistent with the simulations (and vice-versa). (If you allow for even some mild positive dependence between the two times, it's going to go over 100 minutes.)
