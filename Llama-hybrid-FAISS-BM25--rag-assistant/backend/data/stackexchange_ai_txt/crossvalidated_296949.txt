If the main thing you are interested in is slowdowns/train speeds for each segment, first things you could do are simple tools: filter the data to view various characteristics by speed, and perhaps build a simple linear regression model that regress speed ~ everything else. Extracting the time of day, day of week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) and perhaps whether the day is a holiday would be useful. Changing the location to a location ID or journey info may be more useful than lat/long as well. This might tell you which variables are important in predicting speed. These are both relatively easy to do in the languages you suggested. If you are looking for unsupervised methods, I would recommend looking at principal component analysis and self-organized maps as two possibilities. Principal component analysis is basically used to check for correlations between variables, and self-organizing maps are a great unsupervised tool for clustering data automatically. Hope that helps!
