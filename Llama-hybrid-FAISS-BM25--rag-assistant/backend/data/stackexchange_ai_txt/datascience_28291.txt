Expected value and standard deviation are 'independent' in the sense that knowing one gives you no additional information about the other. Therefore it is more accurate and much simpler to train two separate networks - one for the expected value and one for the standard deviation. This also has the advantage that you need to be explicit about what you mean by 'standard deviation of a (heteroscedastic) time series'.
