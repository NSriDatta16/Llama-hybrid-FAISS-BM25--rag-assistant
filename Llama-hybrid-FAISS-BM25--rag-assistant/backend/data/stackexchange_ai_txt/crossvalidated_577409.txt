How to interpret angles between explantory variables in Redundancy analysis (RDA)?

I am learning to apply constrained ordination to community data using the vegan package in R. According to some materials, like this one , in a scaling type 2 RDA triplot: Angles between all vectors reflect linear correlation. It confuses me how the triplot would look like if all explanatory variables are uncorrelated. I tested in R by creating a matrix consists of 5 vectors with very low（0.001）correlations (code copied from the second answer ) as explanatory variables, and two artificial response variables like below : set.seed(42) require(vegan) # generate uncorrleated variables n And it generates plot like this, with V1 , V4 and V5 very close to each other though they have low correlations. So my question is what is wrong with my understanding and how should I interpret angles between explanatory vectors in a RDA triplot?
