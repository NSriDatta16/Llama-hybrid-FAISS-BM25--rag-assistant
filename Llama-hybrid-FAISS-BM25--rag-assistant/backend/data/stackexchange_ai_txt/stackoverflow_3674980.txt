Notify user his password has been changed via text message on the same page (with PHP or AJAX?)

Here is the scenario. A user wants to change his password. So he login and fill up his new desired password and clicked submit. Back end PHP checks his codes and updated it in MySQL database. User is brought back to the same page (with the form) and is notified by this small paragraph sitting on the top of the page that his password has been changed successfully. Is it possbile to do this with PHP only (without jQuery)? Apologies if I had phrased my question poorly.
