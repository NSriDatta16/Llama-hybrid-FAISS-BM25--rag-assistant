Logistic Regression, Advantage of GLM's : "*If the link produces additive effects, then we do not need constant variance*"

From this page : The bottom section : Summary of advantages of GLMs over traditional (OLS) regression contains the advantage If the link produces additive effects, then we do not need constant variance. Could someone explain what this means in the context of logistic regression please. For example, suppose that the model was $$ \log ( \text{odds} ) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 $$ where $x_1$ is a categorical variable with two levels. The "link" function is the logit, which is the log of the odds. What I don't understand is why being able to write the model in the above form means that we " do not need constant variance ".
