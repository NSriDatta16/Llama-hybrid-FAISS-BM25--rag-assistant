Is drag and drop a good catcha method? I.e. would it be a good way of allowing only humans to submit a form? This is nice idea in correct direction. One should prevent passing captcha to 3d party human solvers sweatshops (which do not directly interact with web-boards being cracked) But the mentioned http://www.webdesignbeach.com/beachbar/ajax-fancy-captcha-jquery-plugin is 100% passable by bots in 5 guessing, while bots have 15-20 before being locked. The spambot devs I asked about it just called it "a masqueraded trap". I am making survey of spam and anti-spam techniques and would recommend to look into KeyCAPTCHA plugin. See my another answer on it for more details.
