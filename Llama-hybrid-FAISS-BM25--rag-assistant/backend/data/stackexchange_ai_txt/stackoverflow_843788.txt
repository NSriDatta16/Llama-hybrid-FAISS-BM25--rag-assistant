You may want to look at Eigen . It is a C++ template library that uses SSE (2 and later) and AltiVec instruction sets with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code . Fast. (See benchmark). Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate -- Eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases. Explicit vectorization is performed for the SSE (2 and later) and AltiVec instruction sets, with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code. Expression templates allow to perform these optimizations globally for whole expressions. With fixed-size objects, dynamic memory allocation is avoided, and the loops are unrolled when that makes sense. For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness. You could implement you function in C++ and then call that from C#
