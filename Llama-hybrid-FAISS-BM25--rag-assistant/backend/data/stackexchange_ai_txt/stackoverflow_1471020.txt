Not strictly a security hole, more of a "feature" that lots of rookie server admins didn't know/care about at the time. Around 1999-2001 I had lots of fun with Frontpage and unlocked Frontpage server extensions installed on public facing websites. When you had Frontpage installed you got this nice handy "Edit in Frontpage" button within Internet Explorer. When visiting a site, e.g. www.foo.com, If you clicked on the "Edit in Frontpage" button in Internet Explorer and the server admins hadn't done their job properly then Frontpage happily opened up the full directory structure of the virtual directory and allowed you to read/edit the contents. This worked on many sites from little one man band setups to bigger public organisations. I always fired an email off to the "webmaster" when found an open server and I once got a Â£50 gift voucher from an online retailer for alerting them to this. Shocking stuff really. DISCLAIMER - I need to point out that Frontpage was on the standard build PC I was given in those days, not of my own choice!
