Ensuring exploratory study's validity with pseudo-simple random sampling

The context of my questions is as follows. I'm performing a cross-sectional secondary research study , involving open source software (OSS) projects. I collect data (information about the projects) from several sources, mostly OSS repositories . While I don't have exact statistics on that, I believe that projects, listed in those repositories represent a lion's share of the total OSS projects in existence (my estimate is around 90-95 percent, as some OSS projects are still listed on organizational websites). Technically, I'm able to collect most of the projects' data from repositories and I'm doing it for convenience and feasibility reasons. For clarity, below I will use OSS_World and OSS_Repos to refer to the corresponding data sets. One of the problems with OSS_Repos data set is that it has a significant ratio of missing data in some categories, where categories essentially feed data for my study's latent variable indicators . This certainly seems like a threat to validity of the proposed study. However, I have no reason to believe that the data is missing due to some systemic factors , since there are no existing theories or studies that prove otherwise, and assume that. My questions are the following: A) Considering that my study is exploratory in nature, can I: make the above-mentioned assumption and consider the validity of the study acceptable (by exploratory research standards); use simple random sampling from the subset of OSS_Repos data, which excludes all observations with missing data (later referred to as OSS_Repos_Nonmissing ); still consider this a simple random sampling, rather than stratified, and, thus, the sample OSS_Repos_Nonmissing representative of the population? B) It is my understanding that I can statistically support my assumption (hypothesis) about non-systemic nature of data missingness by using MCAR tests, such as one developed by Little (1988) and its more modern cousin by Jamshidian, Jalal and Jansen (2014). Hopefully, these tests will support my MCAR hypothesis. However, if not, should I test sample on missing data being MAR ? References Jamshidian, M., Jalal, S., & Jansen, C. (2014).
