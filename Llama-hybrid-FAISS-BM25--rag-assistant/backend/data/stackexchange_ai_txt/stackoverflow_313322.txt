First, do a quick assessment on what you want to achieve with Silverlight. If you are planning to create applications that will take advantage of Silverlight's multimedia capabilities, you might want to play around with Expression Blend first and then study .NET. If you're planning to build "Line fo Business" applications then you should learn .NET first. Once you have a good foundation in .NET it would be relatively easy to develop applications that will leverage the power of Silverlight. The Silverlight website's Learn Page is a good place to learn Silverlight specific stuff. A good book that I can recommend for someone staring to learn .NET using C# is John Sharp's "Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Step by Step" by Microsoft Press.
