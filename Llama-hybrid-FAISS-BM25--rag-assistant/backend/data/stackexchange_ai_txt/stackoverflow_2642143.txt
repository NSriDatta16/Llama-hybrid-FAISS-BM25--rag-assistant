MySQL's query generator has a cutoff when figuring out how to use an index. As you've correctly identified, MySQL has decided a table scan will be faster than using the index, and won't be dissuaded from it's decision. The irony is that when the key-range matches more than about a third of the table, it is probably right. So why in this case? I don't have an answer, but I have a suspicion MySQL doesn't have enough memory to explore the index. I would be looking at the server memory settings, particularly the Innodb memory pool and some of the other key storage pools.
