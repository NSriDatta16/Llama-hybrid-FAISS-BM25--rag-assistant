Choice of window length in Singular Spectrum Analysis

Thanks in advance for your answers, I'm trying to decompose a stock price using the Rssa package provided in R, after millions of trials, I tried to change the window Length and the eigentriples, the error between the forecast and the test series is really High, as definition the Window length should be chosen between 1 and (N/2) which is the half of time series of length (N), if we multiply (N/2) for periodicity we should obtain the optimal separation of the components, my question now is "How I should decide the Window length if stock prices do not have an explicit periodicity or seasonal components?"
