Testing linear restriction of parameters of ordered logistic regression models

Given the ordered logistic regression model: $outcome=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_1*X_2$ Can I test linear restrictions on the parameters? For example I would like to test $H_0: \beta_2+\beta_b3=0, H_1: Otherwise$. I can formally test after fitting an OLS model, and I would like to know if I can also do this test after fitting an ordered logistic model.
