Why is my counter incrementing in loop, but returns zero?

With my current project, I have to keep a counter of the number of insertions into a TreeMap > . The project is to run search of individual words in a string, in this case, song lyrics. I have three tests to determine the course of the map insertions, and my algorithm goes: test if word has more than one character and is not a common word if map already contains the word as a key, test if set already contains the song if true, increment insertion counter if map doesn't contain word as key make new node, add song to set increment counter I declare the counter as private double insertions; as a class variable. It is initialized in the constructor: public SearchByLyricsWords(SongCollection sc) { this.songs= sc.getAllSongs(); buildSongMap(); insertions=0; totalReferences=0; averageReferences=0; } The buildMap method: for (String word:currentLyrics) { if (word.length()>1 && !commonWords.contains(word)) { if (lyricWords.containsKey(word)) { if (!lyricWords.get(word).contains(song)) insertions++; //this is a non-duplicate song in the set lyricWords.get(word).add(song); } else { TreeSet songSet= new TreeSet (); songSet.add(song); lyricWords.put(word, songSet); keyWords.add(word); insertions++; } //System.out.println(word+" added"); } } //end loop through string Why is a class variable that is modified in a method, not then giving the correct value in another method?
