Why do we interpret the results of logistic regression as probabilities? Because the logistic regression model can be viewed as arising from a linear regression latent variable model, where the error term of this linear regression is assumed to follow the standard logistic distribution. See for example this post . Given that the output is between 0 and 1, is it enough to interpret the results as probabilities? No. The "output" must come from a function that satisfies the properties of a distribution function in order for us to interpret it as probabilities. These properties are: 1) The function $F$ under consideration must be non-decreasing and right-continuous ("cadlag") 2) $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}F(x) =0$ 3) $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}F(x) =1$ The "sigmoid function" satisfies these properties.
