The Grand Mean of the data is the pooled average of a parameter. The basic null hypothesis of linear regression for the relationship: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x+\epsilon$ , is $H_0:\beta_1 = 0$ . If you were to consider $x$ to be a categorical variable, then the Grand Mean and Pooled Variance could be used as evidence against the null hypothesis, but in short, No, the Grand Mean is not synonymous with the null hypothesis for regression
