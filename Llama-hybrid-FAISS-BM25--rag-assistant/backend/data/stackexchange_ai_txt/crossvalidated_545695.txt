Math behind applying elastic net penalties to logistic regression

I understand how Ridge / Lasso / Elastic Net regression penalties are applied to the linear regression's cost function, but I am trying to figure out how they are applied to Logistic Regression's Maximum Likelihood cost function. I've tried looking into pages through google, and it looks like it can be done (I believe Sci-Kit's logistic regression models accept L1 and L2 parameters, and I've seen some YouTube videos saying that the penalties can be applied in logistic models too) and I've found how they are added to the sum of squared residuals cost function, but I am curious on how the penalties are applied with the Maximum Likelihood cost function. Is it Maximum Likelihood minus the penalties?
