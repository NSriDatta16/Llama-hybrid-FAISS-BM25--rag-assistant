If you're looking for something that is offline I cannot recommend The RSpec Book (http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) enough. It's a great book and introduces not only BDD, but also Cucumber and Gherkin. On how to write great Gherkin I have found this article very useful: http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/15-expert-tips-for-using-cucumber/ Good luck
