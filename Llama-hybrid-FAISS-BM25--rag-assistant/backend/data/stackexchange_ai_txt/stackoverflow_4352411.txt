I ended up solving this by adding a new method to the generated User.php model as follows: public function setPassword($pass) { $this->_set('password', $this->_encrypt_password($pass)); } It achieves the same end result as the tutorial linked above (e.g. allowing modifications to the User model schema via YAML without losing code), but doesn't feel as elegant or general-purpose. I'm marking Olof's answer as correct/accepted, as his solution feels more extensible and OO - mine "smells" a bit
