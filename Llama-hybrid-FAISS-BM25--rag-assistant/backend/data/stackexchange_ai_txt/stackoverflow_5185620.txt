I prefer to limit the scope of my classes and methods to private or package protected wherever possible (so they don't clutter Eclipse's autocomplete:) which automatically means that packages can contain quite a few classes. I do prefer to separate business data objects (DAO's) from their repositories/retrieval services, which are separated from business logic objects and views. Sets of related functionality with no cross dependencies tend to go in their own artifact as I tend to reuse logic. Especially handy when you start playing with OSGi and independent services. One thing is important, the publicly exported interface (public interfaces, enums and classes) need to be somewhat related so the package documentation shows some cohesion.
