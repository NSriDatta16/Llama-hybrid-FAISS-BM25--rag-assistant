Optimizing big import in php

I have a simple importer, it goes through each line of a rather big csv and imports it to the database. My question is: Should I call another method to insert each object (generating a DO and telling it's mapper to insert) or should I hardcode the insert process in the import method, duplicating the code? I know the elegant thing to do is to call the second method, but I keep hearing in my head that function calls are expensive. What do you think?
