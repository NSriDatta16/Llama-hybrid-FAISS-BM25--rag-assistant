How is prior knowledge possible under a purely Bayesian framework?

This is more of a philosophical question, but from a purely Bayesian standpoint how does one actually form prior knowledge? If we need prior information to carry out valid inferences then there seems to be a problem if we have to appeal to past experience in justifying today's priors. We're apparently left with the same question regarding how yesterday's conclusions were valid, and a kind of infinite regress seems to follow where no knowledge is warranted. Does this mean that ultimately prior information must be assumed in an arbitrary way, or perhaps based on a more "frequentist" style of inference?
