I'm doing some similar research, and have found PluralSight, http://pluralsight.com , to be an invaluable resource. They have video courses on Machine Learning, AWS, Azure, Hadoop, Big Data, etc. Personally, I find that these video courses allow me to learn the material much faster and more easily than books.
