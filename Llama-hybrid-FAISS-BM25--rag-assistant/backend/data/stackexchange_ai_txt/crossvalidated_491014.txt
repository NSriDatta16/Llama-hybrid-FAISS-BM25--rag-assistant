How do I simulate from GAR(1) model in R?

I want to simulate an GAR(1) model, defined by $(1-\alpha \beta )^{\delta }X_{t} = Z_{t}$ , where $X_t$ is a time series, and $Z_t$ is a white noise process. How do I simulate from this model in R with $\alpha=0.8$ , $\delta=0.8$ and $\sigma^2 = 1.0$ ? Any help is appreciated!
