First of all, module is not equal assembly. You can spread a module's parts between several assemblies (including Models, Views and ViewModels). Although, usually you place classes related to a module together in one DLL or XAP file (in case of Silverlight if your module is a separated Silverlight application). As of your case, if a Model is a shared entity which can be used by several modules, Prism encourages to place it in so called Infrastructure assembly that keeps shared non-module specific logic. Otherwise, it could be a good idea to place MVVM parts together, since they solve common business tasks. In the future, if you need to replace implementation of one of the MVVM's parts, you can do it just adding a new one and adjusting container's mapping.
