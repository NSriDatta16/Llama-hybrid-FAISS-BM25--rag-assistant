As an applied statistician and occasional minor software author, I'd say: WinBUGS (released 1997) It's based on BUGS, which was released more than 15 years ago (1989), but it's WinBUGS that made Bayesian analysis of realistically complex models available to a far wider user base. See e.g. Lunn, Spiegelhalter, Thomas & Best (2009) (and the discussion on it in Statistics in Medicine vol. 28 issue 25 ).
