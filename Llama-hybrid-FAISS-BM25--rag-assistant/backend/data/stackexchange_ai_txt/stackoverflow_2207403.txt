I do not really agree on the fact that the choice of a language is related to system resources. Hardware is cheap and we are not in a time where we need to closely look at the system resources as we used to have. Don't misunderstand me: we still do need to pay attention, but the time where people were xoring their pointers to save some space is over (luckilly). And if your main concern is performance, then either running a JVM or an interpreted language is probably not the best option. I do not think it is related to the orientation of the language per se either. Ok, I know, PHP is not object oriented but still, you can now code OO with it. You will find descent web frameworks for almost any language. I agree with Jacco on his list. Another aspect is indeed the culture the language refers to. PHP is for script kiddies. Java is for serious, wearing suits business developers. Of course, we all have many counter examples but still. Java was largely adopted by big companies, now competited by .Net. There are good reasons for this, among which the fact that it a lot easier to write poor code in PHP than in Java (and almost any other language). On the other hand, Java is not exactly freedom oriented. If your project is strictly personal, you can choose whatever suits your tastes better. If you plan to develop as a team, the choice of the language will impact its general mood/way of thinking. I would finally add some important parameters to me: fun and elegance This may be a matter of taste here again, but I have much more fun coding in python than in C# for instance.
