How does the GARCH part affect the ACF/PACF of an ARMA-GARCH process?

I need some help with fitting an ARMA-GARCH model. I'm analyzing a daily time series. I don't understand how the order of the GARCH impacts ACF or PACF plots. I mean: what is the difference I should notice in the ACF plot when I'm using GARCH(1,1)+ARMA(1,1) instead of GARCH(2,1)+ARMA(1,1)? What 'part' of the ACF plot should change when I modify the GARCH or/and ARMA orders?
