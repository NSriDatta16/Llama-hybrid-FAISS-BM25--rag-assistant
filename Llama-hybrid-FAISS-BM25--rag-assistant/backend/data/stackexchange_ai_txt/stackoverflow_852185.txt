Right now, I'm using twinsplay to organize my windows side by side. I tried Winsplit before, but I couldn't get it to work because the default hotkeys ( Ctrl-Alt-Left, Ctrl-Alt-Right ) clashed with the graphics card hotkeys for rotating my screen and setting different hotkeys just didn't work. Twinsplay just worked for me out of the box. Another nice thing about twinsplay is that it also allows me to save and restore windows "sessions" - so I can save my work environment ( eclipse, total commander, visual studio, msdn, outlook, firefox ) before turning off the computer at night and then quickly get back to it in the morning.
