How to Inherit method but with different return type?

Given the following classes: ClassA { public ClassA DoSomethingAndReturnNewObject() {} } ClassB : ClassA {} ClassC : ClassA {} Is there a way to get ClassB and ClassC to inherit the method but customize the return type to their own class? I prefer not to copy the method from ClassA and change the type there. I need to get a ClassB object when I call ClassB.DoSomethingAndReturnNewObject() . I need to get a ClassC object when I call ClassC.DoSomethingAndReturnNewObject() . Something like calling a constructor based on current type like: this.GetType() ? But I have no clue how to actually do that.
