Consider this approach: Asset Catalog Service (WCF App). Its responsibility is to act as a repository for found assets. The service encapsulates the actual storage (database, etc). Asset Finder (Winform app). Its responsibility is to scan all active network, find all IT assets and calls Asset Catalog Service to register the device. Asset Catalog Service will reconsile whether a device has not been registered (therefore will be stored), a device have been updated (therefore will be updated) or no change (therefore will be ignored). You may have multiple instances of Asset Finder running at the same time to speed up the discovery process. Asset Catalog Service or another service may be used to keep track the work pool of the asset finders. The website (Asp.Net Web app). Its responsibility is to visualize the asset catalog. It queries Asset Catalog Service and display the result to the end users. I can't see any obvious use case for using Microsoft Sync framework. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience in writing any asset discovery algorithm. Others might be able to help on that point. Hope that helps.
