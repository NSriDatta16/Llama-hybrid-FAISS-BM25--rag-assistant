As a design decision, I'd opt for storing JSON because it can only represent a data structure, whereas serialization is bound to a PHP data object signature. The advantages I see are: * you are forced to separate the data storage from any logic layer on top. * you are independent from changes to the data object class (say, for example, that you want to add a field).
