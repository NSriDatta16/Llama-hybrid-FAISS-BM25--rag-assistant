There is no floating toolbar in the SDK but you can certainly make your own. Make a new subclass of UIView and draw your toolbar there (or use the existing UIToolBar if it does what you need but as a subview of your custom view). Then capture the touch events into your custom view so the user can move the floating toolbar by dragging it with his finger. Many of the best iPhone and iPad apps have custom controls so this is certainly not frowned upon.
