Roxygen, package building, and use.Rd2=TRUE

I have a simple shell script that builds my Roxygen documents, builds the package, checks, then installs the newly built package on my machine. It's quite simple: #! /bin/sh R CMD roxygen -d myPackage R CMD build myPackage/ R CMD check myPackage_0.01.tar.gz R CMD INSTALL myPackage myPackage_0.01.tar.gz But I'm having issues with Roxygen picking up my .onLoad() function as described previously on StackOverflow . The solution is to use the use.Rd2=TRUE option with roxygenize. Well I want to build from the command prompt so I changed this line R CMD roxygen -d myPackage to the following line which shoves a roxygenize line to R through the stdin: echo 'require("roxygen"); roxygenize("myPackage", roxygen.dir="myPackage", copy.package=FALSE, use.Rd2=TRUE)' | R --no-save This seems to work just dandy. But it feels a little convoluted. Is there an easier and/or more elegant way?
