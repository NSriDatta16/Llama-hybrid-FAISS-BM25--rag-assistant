What math topics are most needed to become data scientist?

I am trying to learn data science from very different sources like Coursera, edx and many other sources. But I can not able to find any proper syllabus that what actually topics are needed. So, if anyone can please list out topics that I can follow and able to complete data science math skills. Even if you post the name of books which can able to complete these criteria, then also it will be a great help. Thanks in advance.
