You could use the Google Location API which is used by Firefox (Example see at http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/ ) which has the url www.google.com/loc/json/. In fact this is JSON based webservice and a minimal Perl Example Look like this: use LWP; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->agent("TestApp/0.1 "); $ua->env_proxy(); my $req = HTTP::Request->new(POST => 'https://www.google.com/loc/json'); $req->content_type('application/jsonrequest'); $req->content('{"cell_towers": [{"location_area_code": "8721", "mobile_network_code": "01", "cell_id": "7703", "mobile_country_code": "262"}], "version": "1.1.0", "request_address": "true"}'); # Pass request to the user agent and get a response back my $res = $ua->request($req); # Check the outcome of the response if ($res->is_success) { print $res->content; } else { print $res->status_line, "\n"; return undef; } Please keep in mind that Google has not officially opened this API for other uses...
