Your dataset is tiny and multiple, very different, "rules" can be defined for it, e.g. output = 0 + 1*x + 0*y , output = max(x,y) , output = x , output = x or y , output = draw randomly 0 or 1 etc. ...all of those rules are perfectly valid and yield error-free results on your training set. The problem is that you haven't seen the $(0,1)$ combination in the training set, so not much can be said about it. There is nothing in your data that suggests that $(0,1)$ is "closer" neither to $(1,1)$, nor to $(0,0)$. With such limited data and no background knowledge probably the best that you can get is non-machine learning guesstimates like: (a) "predicting" the most frequent class: $1$, (b) randomly assigning $0$, or $1$, (c) randomly assigning $1$ with probability $2/3$, or $0$ with probability $1/3$ (proportions in your observed sample). No matter what method you'll choose, your final estimate would be more related to assumptions that you made about the data since it does not permit you to make any reliable conclusions. The more complicated method for prediction you will choose, the more assumptions you would need to make about your data.
