In the past I've used BT (2004) for ecommerce purposes (ordering, order acknowledgement, delivery notification, etc) in a B2B environment and it worked really well. This is probably the bread-and-butter of BT in that it is the most obvious place for it to sit in an organisation. These days I'm (almost) involved in an entirely internal BT project that is initially handling a massive data-load from a legacy system into a new app, and going forward will handle the messaging between another legacy app and the same new system. Probably not the most efficient use of technology, but the infrastructure is now in place to implement an Enterprise Service Bus type architecture that is viewed as "the saviour of our business". I've yet to be convinced on that thinking, though. :S
