Components are like little sub-projects. Projects seem to be most useful when they group people together. I recommend to my clients that JIRA projects reflect the social organization to some degree, at least until the number of projects becomes very large. Also, avoid the use of a component named "Misc" or "Other". They tend to become waste dumps of issues that no-one cares about.
