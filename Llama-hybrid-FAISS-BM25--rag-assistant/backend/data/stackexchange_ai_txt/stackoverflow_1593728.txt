Your question can be divided in two I think: 1) How to build out-of-browser Silverlight applications? You can do that since Silverlight 3. See for example here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd882515.aspx 2) How to have offline access to data that is normally online? You need to implement a cache mechanism that locally stores the data using isolated storage. See for example here: http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/06/26/data-focused-silverlight-demo.aspx
