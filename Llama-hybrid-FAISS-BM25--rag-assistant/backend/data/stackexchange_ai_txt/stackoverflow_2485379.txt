A class is basically a way to organize your code. It allows you to put all of the code related to one abstraction (think "concept" or "idea") in one place. As an example - in your example of an app, the Window with the two buttons, a text box, and some code for handling what happens when the user types in the information may be organized into a single class: something like "PromptWindow". This class would be made up of multiple classes internally (two buttons, a textbox, etc) This would probably be used by some separate class, which would create an instance of the PromptWindow class, call a method on the class to show the window, then use the results.
