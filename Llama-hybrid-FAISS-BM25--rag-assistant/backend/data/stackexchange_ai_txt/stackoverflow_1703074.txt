The code will work. The point you are returning ( StrArray[4] ) points to a string literal "BB" . String literals in C are anonymous array objects with static storage duration , which means that they live as long as your program lives (i.e forever). It doesn't matter where you create that sting literal. Even if it is introduced inside a function, it still has static storage duration. Just remember, that string literals are not modifiable, so it is better to use const char* pointers with string literals.
