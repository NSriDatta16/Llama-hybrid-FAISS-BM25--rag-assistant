Have you considered using a quantile forecast as your ARIMA? Quantile forecast is when, instead of predicting the average, you predict quantiles. In your case, you could predict for a given day the probability that an observation is below the 0.5%-percentile and the 99.5%-percentile. That range would define the 1% of "abnormal" values for the next days. Recapitulating, usually in regression you find the average value by minimizing $\min_\beta \sum_i||X_i\cdot\beta -y_i||^2$. You could find the median value by minimizing $\min_\beta \sum_i|X_i\cdot\beta -y_i|$. You can also find any given quantile $\tau$ by minimizing $\min_\beta \sum_{i|y_i\geq X_i\cdot\beta}\tau|X_i\cdot\beta-y_i| + \sum_{i|y_i Of course, these minimizations problems become more and more complicated. You can only estimate your $\beta$ for this last one using ADMM or gradient descent. I don't think you'll find python tools for this. You'll find plenty of packages in R though. For instance, see this page: http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/quantile-forecasts-in-r/ One last piece of advise: if you need this forecasting to interoperate with other python code, my recommendation is to do it via CSV files. Just have your python code do the pre-processing and generate a CSV file, then R doing its thing and generating another CSV file, then use this file for the post-processing in python, etc. Some people try to use things like rpy2, but I find it to be overengineering.
