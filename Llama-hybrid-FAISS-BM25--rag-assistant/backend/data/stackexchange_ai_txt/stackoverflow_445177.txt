Preventing XSS (Cross-site Scripting)

Let's say I have a simple ASP.NET MVC blog application and I want to allow readers to add comments to a blog post. If I want to prevent any type of XSS shenanigans, I could HTML encode all comments so that they become harmless when rendered. However, what if I wanted to some basic functionality like hyperlinks, bolding, italics, etc? I know that StackOverflow uses the WMD Markdown Editor , which seems like a great choice for what I'm trying to accomplish, if not for the fact that it supports both HTML and Markdown which leaves it open to XSS attacks .
