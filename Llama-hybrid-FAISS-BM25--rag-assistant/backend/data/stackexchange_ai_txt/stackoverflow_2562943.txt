Avoiding CheckStyle magic number errors in JDBC queries

I am working on a group project for class and we are trying out CheckStyle. I am fairly comfortable with Java but have never touched JDBC or done any database work before this. I was wondering if there is an elegant way to avoid magic number errors in preparedStatement calls, consider: preparedStatement = connect.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO shows " + "(showid, showtitle, showinfo, genre, youtube)" + "values (default, ?, ?, ?, ?);"); preparedStatement.setString(1, title); preparedStatement.setString(2, info); preparedStatement.setString(3, genre); preparedStatement.setString(4, youtube); result = preparedStatement.executeUpdate(); The setString methods get flagged as magic numbers, so far I just added the numbers 3-10 or so to the ignore list for magic numbers but I was wondering if there was a better way to go about inserting those values into the statement. I also beg you for any other advice that comes to mind seeing that code, I'd like to avoid developing any nasty habits, e.g. should I be using Statement or is PreparedStatement fine? Will that let me refer to column names instead? Is that ideal? etc... Thanks!
