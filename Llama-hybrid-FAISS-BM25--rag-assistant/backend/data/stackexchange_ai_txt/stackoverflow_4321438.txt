how to create a RTSP streaming server

So I am trying to create a RTSP server that streams music. I do not understand how the server plays a music and different requests get what ever is playing at that time. so, to organize my questions: 1) how does the server play a music file? 2) how does the request to the server look like to get whats currently playing? 3) what does the response look like to get the music playing in the client that requested the music?
