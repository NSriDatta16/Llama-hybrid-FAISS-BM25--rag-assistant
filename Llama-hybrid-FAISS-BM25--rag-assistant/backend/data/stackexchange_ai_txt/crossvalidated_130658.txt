Generally, when we build optimization routines we need some stopping criteria. For instance, we may look the last change of the target function: $\Delta y_i=y_i-y_{i-1}$, where $y_i$ is the value of the target function at iteration $i$. Whenever $|\Delta y_i| Another criteria is a relative tolerance: $\partial y_i= \frac{\Delta y_i}{y_i}$ and $|\partial y_i| Finally, we usually add a max number of iterations constraint, and stop the optimization when it's reaching additionally throwing a warning that stopping criteria were not reached at max number of iterations. It seems that you want to go backwards in this waterfall. So, what you can do is to stop at some number of iterations, and collect $\Delta y_i$ and $\partial y_i$ to compare the methods. Instead of using $\Delta y_i$ you could compute some sort of summary metrics such as moving absolute average $\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} |\Delta y_{i-j}|$ or moving variance. I wouldn't bother though, because in the end it's not going to change your conclusions, you'll see.
