VB.NET XMLWriter: How to change what's in the header?

I have a requirement to make an XML file - and the partner is rather sticky about the header. Apparently, the header must be exactly this: But whenever I create an XML file I get extraneous properties like this: The hacker in me wants to stop using XMLWriter to make the file so that I have more control over the header; "no problem, I'll just write a loop that makes its own XML tags as a StreamWriter or something, forget this XMLWriter object..." but I must admit that XMLWriter has been rather elegant to use so far; surely there must be something where I can change the XMLWriterSettings object to say "stop putting your custom properties in to the XML header please", right? Here's the relevant VB code: Dim settings As New XmlWriterSettings() settings.Indent = True settings.IndentChars = " " settings.NewLineChars = "\n" Using writer As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(strFileName, settings) writer.WriteStartDocument(True) For Each kvp As KeyValuePair(Of String, String) In dictArguments Dim key As String = kvp.Key Dim value As String = kvp.Value writer.WriteStartElement(key) writer.WriteString(value) writer.WriteEndElement() Next End Using Works perfectly; but I can't find a way to control the header. I can find a way to remove it entirely of course but that's not what we want to do. Edit: thanks for the help; so far once we removed the WriteStartDocument it now no longer displays standalone = yes. I can't get it to stop adding the encoding however. Any ideas?
