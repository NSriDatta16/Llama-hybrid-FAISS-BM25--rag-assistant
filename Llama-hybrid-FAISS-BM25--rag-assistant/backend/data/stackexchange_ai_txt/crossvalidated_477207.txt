Cox regression. Find 95% confidence interval for comparison of two groups

I am working with pbc dataset in R and would like to build 95% confidence interval for the comparison of two groups: 60-year-old males on DPCA with bilirubin = 1 mg/dL 40-year-old females on placebo with bilirubin = 0.5 mg/dL In order to to do this I built Cox regression : cox.adj = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ trt + age.cat + bili + sex, data = data) summary(cox.adj) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) trt1 0.10349 1.10904 0.18644 0.555 0.57882 age.cat 2. [42, 50) -0.01111 0.98895 0.30553 -0.036 0.97099 age.cat 3. [50, 57) 0.52052 1.68291 0.28611 1.819 0.06887 . age.cat 4. >= 57 0.87540 2.39983 0.28495 3.072 0.00213 ** bili 0.14951 1.16127 0.01343 11.136 = 57 2.3998 0.4167 1.3729 4.1950 bili 1.1613 0.8611 1.1311 1.1922 sexf 0.6006 1.6649 0.3737 0.9653 and made predictions: data_test1 age.cat sex trt bili 1 4. >= 57 m 1 1.0 2 1. Hazard ratio: exp(0.7007238) / exp(-0.8626783) = 4.78 So, 60-year-old males on DPCA with bilirubin = 1.0 mg/dL have 4.78 times the hazard of mortality when compared to 40-year-old females on placebo with bilirubin = 0.5 mg/dL. The question is how to calculate 95% cofidence interval for this comparison? My approach is: exp(0.7007238 - 2 * 0.2556641) / exp(-0.8626783 - 2 * 0.2074737) exp(0.7007238 + 2 * 0.2556641) / exp(-0.8626783 + 2 * 0.2074737) which gives me [4.336299, 5.258169] but I have information that 95% confidence interval probably should be about [2.3, 10]. So, my question is - are my calculations correct or not? If not, how should I calculate 95% confidence interval for this comparison? Here are slides which I am trying to replicate in R:
