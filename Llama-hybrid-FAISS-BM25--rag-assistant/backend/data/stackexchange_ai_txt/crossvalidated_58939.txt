What is the difference between a Frequentist approach with meta-analysis and a Bayesian approach?

Say I am performing an analysis looking at a particular health measure. I am interested in the difference in that measure between patients and controls and whether or not the difference is different from 0. There have been studies in the past looking at my same research question and health measure, but in different samples of patients. In my Bayesian analysis I would build up a prior distribution based on the previous studies incorporating the mean difference and standard error. Please forgive me if this a newbie question as I am newly learning Bayesian stats, but in what ways would the results from my Bayesian analysis differ from the results I would obtain using an inverse variance weighted meta-analysis to combine the mean difference estimates from the prior studies with my current data ?
