To be honest you'd probably do better to start by looking at the Hercules emulator. http://www.hercules-390.org/ Other than that in theory with VBA you can use the Decimal type to get good results (note you have to CDec to create these) it uses 12 bits with a variable power of ten scalar. A quick google shows this post from the hercules group, which confirms Alberts point about needing to know the hardware: ---Snip-- In theory, but rather less so in practice. S/360 and S/370 had a choice of Scientific or Commercial instruction sets. The former added the FP instructions and registers to the base; the latter the decimal instructions, including Edit and Edit & Mark. But larger 360 (iirc /65 and up) and 370 (/155 and up) models had the union of the two, called the Universal instruction set, and at some point the S/370 dropped the option. ---snip--- I have to say that having looked at the hercules source code you'll probably need to figure out exactly which floating point operation codes (in terms of precision single,long, extended) are being performed.
