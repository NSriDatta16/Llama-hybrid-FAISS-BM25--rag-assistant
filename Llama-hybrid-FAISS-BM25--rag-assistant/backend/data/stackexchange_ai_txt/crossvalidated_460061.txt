Peter cannot inflate his effective sample size for the purpose of estimating treatment effects just by repeatedly subsampling the same experimental units – this would be the most egregious form of 'pseudo-replication'. Sample size in the context of a designed experiment is set by the randomization design – since the different samples within the same plot could not possibly be assigned to receive different treatments, they cannot be considered separate experimental units. It doesn't matter, for the purpose of sample size, how much soil Tom or Peter collect from each unit – what matters is that all the soil in that unit received the same treatment – that all of it was required by the experimental design to receive the same treatment. Tom and Peter can potentially take different measurements of the same experimental unit, and one might get "better" measurements in some sense than the other – maybe measurement error is reduced by using a larger volume of soil, or maybe it's reduced by averaging samples from several points within the plot – but that's an issue of reducing the size of the error variance (assumed the same for each plot) not inflating the sample size. A more precise/reliable/stable measurement method could thereby still reduce the standard errors of effect estimates, but not through changing the sample size. The sample size is, again, fixed by the design of the randomization scheme – each unit that could be independently assigned to a different treatment is one experimental unit and adds one to the total sample size.
