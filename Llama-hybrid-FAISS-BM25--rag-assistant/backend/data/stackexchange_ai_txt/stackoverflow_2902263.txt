Considering you are talking about IIRESET I assume you are talking about multiple developers sharing a single SharePoint development server and not multiple end users. Although this is not impossible it is generally discouraged to share a development server as that could lead to unexpected results. Multiple web.config or other changes could conflct with each other and waiting for SharePoint to spin up after each reset will be really annoying.
