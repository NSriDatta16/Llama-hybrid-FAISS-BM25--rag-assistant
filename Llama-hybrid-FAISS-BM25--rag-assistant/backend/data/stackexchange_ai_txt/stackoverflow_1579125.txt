One important question that must be asked in a commercial setting is, "who will support us if we get stuck / something goes haywire / etc.?". Most of the open source VCS are widely used by many organizations, both commercial and non-, and have a wealth of free (and paid) resources available to help you. Books, websites, consultants, etc. You also have the source, if you want to dig deeply on your own. There are lots of third party tools that extend the functionality of them, like code review and defect tracking systems. Some commercial VCS (particularly Perforce) also have widespread use, and have decent support, if you want to stick with a commercial solution. Anecdotally, I've heard more horror stories about VSS than all other VCSs combined. That's not out of pure Microsoft hatred, either. Depending on your shop's development practice, you probably can't go wrong with one of the "big three": Subversion, Mercurial, and git.
