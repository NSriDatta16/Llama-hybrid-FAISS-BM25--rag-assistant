Forecasting data that has both additive and multiplicative seasonality

I wish to decompose the trend of the following time series. The data is as follows, index = c(96,1492,121,245,95,1621,144,366,158,1679,210,469,194,1796,265,589,305, 1861,348,754,403,1853,490,979,465,1984,630) It looks like it has both an additive, and a multiplicative component. How do I treat something like this?
