I don't think you're going to be able to do this. I believe that it only supports certain folder names like layout-large, layout-mdpi, layout-hdpi, layout-fr, etc. You can use more than one of these modifies as well like layout-fr-hdpi-large. This page shows all of the allowed modifiers http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html
