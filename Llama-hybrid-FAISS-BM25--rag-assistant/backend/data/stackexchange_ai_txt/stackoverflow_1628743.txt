Maybe you can use On Error Resume Next , along with some testing of the Err object . This will provide all the necessary info to allow logging at the level of the application, where you have all the desired context and the necessary programming language's expressiveness to express various business rules about what and when to log... Furthermore the On Error statement will allow the elegant handling of exceptions, without "messing" the whole ASP page.
