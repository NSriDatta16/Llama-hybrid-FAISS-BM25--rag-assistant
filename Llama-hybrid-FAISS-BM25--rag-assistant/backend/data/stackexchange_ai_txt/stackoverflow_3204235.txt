UPDATE > from the manual : the declared type of "STRING" has an affinity of NUMERIC, not TEXT so please change the type of this column to TEXT , and you should be done. UPDATE END > what is the type of your Phone column (try PRAGMA table_info (tblPhoneList) )?. if it is TEXT (or BLOB ), you shouldn't have any problems - just tried this here. if it is INTEGER or REAL , you should convert it to TEXT - you cannot expect an INTEGER or REAL column to store the + string. for all the details, see Datatypes In SQLite Version 3 .
