If we interpret your claim as "if an ARIMA process has no MA part, then it is independent of every other stochastic process", the answer is decidedly no. As I said above, just take two correlated white noise processes: $$Y_t = \eta_t$$ $$X_t = \varepsilon_t$$ $$\text{corr}(\eta_t,\varepsilon_t) = \rho$$ The two processes will be more or less correlated depending on $\rho$. So, you have an ARIMA(0,0,0) process $Y_t$, but there exists another process related to it, $X_t$. Fundamentally, if you observe only $Y_t$, it is impossible to reject the existence of a related process $X_t$. However, it sounds like your real question is closer to: "if I have found evidence that, marginally, my time series are well-modeled by an ARIMA process with no MA part, should I not bother using VAR/VECM?". The answer is also no, for the following reasons: As I said above, there is no theoretical basis for this. Since your goal is forecasting, you should be looking at out-of-sample forecast performance, not in-sample goodness of fit. Most importantly, the fact that a univariate model fits a specific series well is a fact about its own distribution only. It says absolutely nothing about its relationship to other series.
