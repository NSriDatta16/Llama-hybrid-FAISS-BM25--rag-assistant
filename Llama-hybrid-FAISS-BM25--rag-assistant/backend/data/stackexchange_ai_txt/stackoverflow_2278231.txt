"Do you have an example of this? It's a basic for-each that select a list of items based on the template, and then sort by a number field and shows the 3 top (so its basicly a top 3 list)" Based on what you're trying to accomplish, I think you would be much better off putting this logic into a save handler and organizing your items when a content author saves an item based on the template you're looking for. For example (and this is a very rough example), create a "Top 3" folder in your content tree. Then, write a save handler that checks the TemplateID of an item as it's being saved. If the saved item's TemplateID matches the TemplateID you're looking for, select all the items in your tree based on the TemplateID and process them with whatever sorting logic you need. As you find an item that belongs in the "Top 3" folder, move the item to the "Top 3" folder. Then, in your rendering code, you simply have to get the "Top 3" folder and retrieve it's children. This will be MUCH faster than attempting to look through 1700 items every time the rendering is loaded.
