Bayesian Analysis of Box-Cox Transformation

This problem is problem 5 in Chapter 7 of Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd edition. Consider the Box-Cox transformation: $y_i^{(\lambda)} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $y_i^{(\lambda)} = (y_i^{\lambda}-1)/\lambda$ for $\lambda \neq 0$, $y_i^{(0)} = \log y_i$ To do Bayesian inference, we need to specify a prior $p(\mu, \sigma^2, \lambda)$. From the question: "It seems natural to apply a prior distribution $p(\mu, \log \sigma, \lambda) \propto p(\lambda)$, where $p(\lambda)$ is a prior distribution (perhaps uniform) on $\lambda$ alone. Unfortunately, this leads to unreasonable results. Set up a numerical example to show why. (Hint: consider what happens when all the data points $y_i$ are multiplied by a constant factor.)" From this information, the prior I have to consider is $p(\mu, \sigma^2, \lambda) \propto p(\lambda)/\sigma^2$, since $1/\sigma^2$ translates to the uniform prior on $\log \sigma$. The likelihood is as follows: $p(y_1,...,y_n | \mu, \sigma^2, \lambda) \propto \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(\frac{y_i^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda}-\mu\right)^2\right)$ because $P(\lambda = 0) = 0$ since it is a continuous distribution. So the posterior is proportional to $\frac{p(\lambda)}{\sigma^3}\prod_{i=1}^n \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(\frac{y_i^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda}-\mu\right)^2\right)$ I don't see why specifying the prior as we did would lead to unreasonable results. I'm not sure what it means by "set up a numerical example." Also, the hint didn't really point me in any direction. It seems like if you multiply every data point by a constant you just get $\frac{p(\lambda)}{\sigma^3}\prod_{i=1}^n \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(\frac{(cy_i)^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda}-\mu\right)^2\right)$ which still seems fine.
