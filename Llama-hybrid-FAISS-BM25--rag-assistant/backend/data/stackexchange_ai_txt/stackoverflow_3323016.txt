Use cid in sqlite instead of column name?

When creating a view, the name assigned to a column is not always usable in sqlite, in order to perform a specific operation afterwards. For instance, I created the following view: CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT amount, count(name), name FROM mytable GROUP BY name HAVING count(name) > 1; Then I would like to do the following operation: SELECT total(amount*count(name)) FROM myview; Unfortunately, count(name) is the name given by sqlite to the second column, hence, cannot be used in a select statement. the PRAGMA table_info(myview) shows us that the cid to count(name) is 1, is there anyway to use this information to be able to do some computation on that column?
