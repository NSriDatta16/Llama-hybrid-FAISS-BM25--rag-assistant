How can I organise my resources into folders?

I'm working with a lot of files in my resources directory and I'd like to create folders to organise them. I've made a folder of plists, but I can't access it. Here's the code that works: NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"test" ofType:@"plist"]; and the code that doesn't work: NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"test" ofType:@"plist" inDirectory:@"plists"]; Outputting the path gives me (null) . I've tried both grouping in Xcode and creating an actual folder in the Resources directory. What am I doing wrong? Thanks.
