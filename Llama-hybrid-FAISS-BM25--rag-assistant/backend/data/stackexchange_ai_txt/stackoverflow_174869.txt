Disable the scroll bar in MDI Parent

It is possible to prevent scroll bars from appearing when you drag a Mdichild outside the bounds of the Mdiparent in vb.net? I would prefer the solution to not involve checking the posistion of the child form as there are too many forms to alter. Obviously autoscroll is set to false on the mdiparent and setting VScroll and HScroll to false doesn't work
