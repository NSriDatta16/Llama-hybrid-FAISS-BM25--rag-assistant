Facebooker params empty

I am trying to connect facebooker and authlogic using this http://github.com/kalasjocke/authlogic_facebook_connect I was having problems so began to debug the facebooker gem code. I realized that no params are getting set using the facebook login that have anything to do with facebook. I can push the facebook login button, it brings up the facebook window as it should and I accept/sign into facebook. Then in facebooker/rails/controller.secure_with_facebook_params! I print out params, this is what shows: authenticity_token actioncreatecontrollerperson_sessions person_sessions is the name of my user_sessions. Not sure if this makes a difference though... This is it. Clearly there should be other parameters here. I checked to make sure that my application numbers are all OK with facebooker.yml (although honestly I don't understand why that would matter as I'm not yet making a facebook app, just want to use connect). Any ideas?? I would be SOOOO thankful if someone could help me out... any clues would be useful! K
