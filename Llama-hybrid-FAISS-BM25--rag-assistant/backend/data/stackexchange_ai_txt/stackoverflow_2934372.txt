how to get average that ignores outliers?

say I have a postgresql table with the following values: id | value ---------- 1 | 4 2 | 8 3 | 100 4 | 5 5 | 7 If I use postgresql to calculate the average, it gives me an average of 24.8 because the high value of 100 has great impact on the calculation. While in fact I would like to find an average somewhere around 6 and eliminate the extreme(s). I am looking for a way to eliminate extremes and want to do this "statistically correct". The extreme's cannot be fixed. I cannot say; If a value is over X, it has to be eliminated. I have been bending my head on the postgresql aggregate functions but cannot put my finger on what is right for me to use. Any suggestions?
