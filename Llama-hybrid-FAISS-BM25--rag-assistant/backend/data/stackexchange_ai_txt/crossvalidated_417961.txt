Test for significant differences in coefficient with different levels of fixed effects

I have two regressions with time and entity fixed effects (using felm in R) but the regressions have different levels of entity FEs (hospital FEs in the first and physician FEs in the second in my case): $outcome_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_1^H Treat_i +\delta_{t}+\delta_{h} $ $outcome_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_2^P Treat_i +\delta_{t}+\delta_{p} $ where the delta terms are the different FEs. The samples and regressions are otherwise the same. I want to test whether $\beta_1^H$ and $\beta_1^P$ are stat. significantly different from each other. I can think of how to bootstrap to build CIs and do it that way, but is there a more elegant/clean solution to test the difference?
