I had this exact problem today and fixed it by installing jQuery UI. Apparently rails3-jquery-autocomplete uses the autocomplete functionality that is included in jQuery UI. It will be broken until you install jquery-rails and include both the jquery UI js and CSS files in your layout. Quoting the Github site: Before you start Make sure your project is using jQuery-ui with the autocomplete widget before you continue. You can find more info about that here: http://jquery.com/ http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs I'd encourage you to understand how to use those 3 amazing tools before attempting to use this gem.
