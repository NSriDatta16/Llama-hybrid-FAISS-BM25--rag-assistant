Regression of binomial response when the predictor range is limited

I am looking into a dataset for which I will be doing a regression. When considering the option of a logistic regression, I started doing univariate regressions to get a feeling for the possible relationship of my predictors, and happened across a case I haven't seen before: The predictor is a positive rational number - there can never be observations that are below zero - and for practical purposes, we could assume it won't get over 10. You can see a bubble plot of the actual observations, on the 0 and 1 horizontal lines. But of course, the logistic function is not restricted to that range - and it so happens, that with the current dataset, the predicted line crosses the zero line at below 50% probability. I suppose that a very literal interpretation would be that the variable is a poor predictor (at least when taken alone) and if we had to stay with this model, we would have to predict an outcome of 0 for all cases. But I am unhappy with that idea, not only because from a domain point of view, the variable is interesting, but also because mathematically, we are trying to fit to a function of the wrong shape. Is there a subtype of logistic regression, or maybe a completely different type of regression, that deals properly with a restricted domain of the link?
