Running Delphi builds under TFS MSBuild

Wanting to build and test a bunch of Borland Delphi 6 projects that are integrated with ASP.NET services. Had been using WANT and CruiseControl for building Delphi. With TFS Build agent we can tie all together and do some testing. I am looking for guidance and direction. One issue I see is that there is no "solution" in a Delphi project to be given to MSBuild as a ' '. Also, I have references to > but am a little unsure how to use them. The > allows run custom task for Delphi command-line compile. Your guidance would be appreciated.
