There is no magic answer to improving your MySQL server performance. You need to make a change, then restart your MySQL server and benchmark . Make sure your thread concurrency is set to 2x the number of cores in the server's CPU. You may want to try increasing your query cache size also, if its too small then you may have a lot of cache fragmentation (which degrades performance).
