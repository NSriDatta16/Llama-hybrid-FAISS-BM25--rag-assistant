In R confused about inferences I'm getting from logistic regression

Currently, I'm using Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and running the logistic regression on the dataset. When I'm using the whole dataset for the logisitc regression I've almost 30 features which are significant (p-value less like between 0.1 & 0.001 ). But when I use a subsample say 80% of the data for fitting all my variables are not significant. fit.glm This is the code I wrote for it. This is the result using all the data: This is the result using 80% of data: You can see that all variables are becoming insignificant after using 80% of data and I also tried with 95% of the dataset and the same thing happened. I'm curious to understand why it' happening
