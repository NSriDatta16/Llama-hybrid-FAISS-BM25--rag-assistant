Joining vectors using [x y] has different results depending on whether your vectors are rows or columns. If rows, then joining them with [x y] makes a longer row vector, but if columns, you'll get a Nx2 matrix. You should probably convert them to column vectors using the TRANSPOSE operator thus: [x' y'] . Although you should check if transpose means the same thing with Time Series objects as at does with regular vectors.
