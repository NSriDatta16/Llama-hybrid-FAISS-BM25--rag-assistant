Can I train an LSTM on two features to predict a third?

I have a multivariate time series with three features x1,x2,x3, I have chosen window size 5 to make a prediction on variable x3 at time t=6. Is it correct to use only the LSTM input on the variables x1,x2 to predict the value of x3 at time t=6???
