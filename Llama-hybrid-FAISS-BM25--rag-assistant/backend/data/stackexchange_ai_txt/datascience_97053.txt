A single-layer neural network has the potential to be far more expressive than a 2-layer decision tree. The decision tree at most can use only two of the features. The neural network has the potential to use information from all of the features. The decision tree can only use linear combination of the features. The neural network has the potential to use a non-linear combination of the features.
