For MLE and MAP you are right. "Conditional MLE" is another way of saying "MLE in a conditional model". Logistic regression is a conditional model in the sense that $\theta$ only controls $P(Y|X)$ (it has no effect on $P(X)$). Therefore the MLE for logistic regression is a conditional MLE. If you have a model in which $\theta$ affects $P(X)$ then it is no longer a conditional model. The MLE in such a model cannot be regarded as a conditional MLE. A discriminative model is the same thing as a conditional model. The Wikipedia pages for generative model and discriminative model do a reasonably good job of explaining this, however the definitions there do not correctly handle the case when $P(X)$ exists but does not depend on $\theta$. Wikipedia would say that such a model is generative, even though it would behave in every way like a discriminative model. I would regard such a model as discriminative. For more explanation, see Discriminative models, not discriminative training .
