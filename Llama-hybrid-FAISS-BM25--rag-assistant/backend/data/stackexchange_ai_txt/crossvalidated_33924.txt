There are several possibilities in this problem, and really the best discussion I can cite is The Theory and Practice of Econometrics, 2nd edition, George Judege, W.E. Griffiths, R. Carter Hill, Helmut Lutkepohl, and Tsoung-Chao Lee, Wiley Series in Probability and Mathematical Statistics 1985, Chapter 13, Inference in Models That Combine Time Series and Cross-Sectional Data. Sounds dated, but I have been doing research with ridge regression that dips back into this resource. This was a big, very comprehensive book. Sorry I don't have more time to specifically analyse this, but I may do a post on this type of problem in my blog www.businessforecastblog.com
