Arno -- here's my answer: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=miraglia-yuiconf2009-yui3 Here's Luke's answer (even better!): http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=smith-yuiconf2009-events Oh, and Todd's answer (also fantastic): http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=kloots-yuiconf2009-sugar YUI 3 is a big step forward for us -- we're really excited about the basic architecture, and what we're hearing from people who are making the migration is that they love the YUI 3 experience. We need to get the widgets going on 3, but we're working on that (see http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets ). I'm not remotely objective, but I hear good things from those who are. -Eric
