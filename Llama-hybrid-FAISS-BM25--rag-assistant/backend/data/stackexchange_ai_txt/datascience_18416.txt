Algorithm for finding best juice combinations

I am making a fun experiment in which a machine will mix different percentages of three juices â€“ orange, apple and grape. After each mix is dispensed, a participant will taste the juice and rate it on a numeric scale, a score from 1 to 7. Using the data collected, I would like to try and find the optimal juice mix programmatically. For this I wish to implement a machine learning algorithm, that will both generate new ratios of juices to try, and using the response will try and find to the optimal juice mixture percentages. What algorithm would you recommend me to use? Notes: I am planning on displaying this at an event, and estimate around 200 people to taste, at least. I am aware that due to the fact that different people have different taste preferences, I aim for the best tasting mixture that will fit most people.
