Why not instead make an array keyed on the spubid: // assuming $array is your array: $storage = array(); foreach($array as $entry) { $bid = $entry['spubid']; if (!isset($storage[$bid])) { // duplicate entry - taking the author out of it. $stortmp = $entry; unset($stortmp['sfirst'], $stortmp['smi'], $stortmp['slast']); // add an authors array $stortmp['authors'] = array(); $storage[$bid] = $stortmp; } $author = array( 'sfirst' => $entry['sfirst'], 'smi' => $entry['smi'], 'slast' => $entry['slast']); $storage[$bid]['authors'][] = $author; } Now your $storage array should look like: Array( "A00502" => Array( "spubid" => "A00502", "authors" => Array( [0] => Array ( [sfirst] => J. [smi] => A. [slast] => Doe [1] => Array ( [sfirst] => J. [smi] => F. [slast] => Kennedy And you could easily do a foreach on the authors to print them: foreach ($storage as $pub) { echo 'Pub ID: '.$pub['spubid']." "; foreach ($pub['authors'] as $author) { echo 'Author: '.$author['sfirst'].' '.$author['smi'].' '.$author['slast']." "; } } And as an added bonus, you can access $storage['A00502'] . UPDATED FOR COMMENT It seems that your array is probably coming from some sort of SQL query that involves a JOIN from a publications table to a authors table. This is making your result dataset duplicate a lot of information it doesn't really need to. There is no reason to have all the publication data transferred/retrieved from the database multiple times. Try rewriting it to get a query of all the books its going to display, then have a "authors" query that does something like: SELECT * FROM authors WHERE spubid IN ('A00502', 'A00503', 'A00504'); Then convert it into this array to use for your display purposes. Your database traffic levels will thank you.
