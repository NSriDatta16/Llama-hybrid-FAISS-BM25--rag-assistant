Finding object in the image

I'm working on building a classifier that needs to find one particular object in the photo. I'm planning on using SIFT/SURF + kmeans for feature extraction and logistic regression for classification. I do have training set with images of the object but what should I use for "no_object_found" class. Training set with random images that do not include this object?
