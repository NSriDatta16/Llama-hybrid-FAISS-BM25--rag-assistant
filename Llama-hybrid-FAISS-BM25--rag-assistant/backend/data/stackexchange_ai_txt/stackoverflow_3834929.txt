I would like to know if Scrum methodologies can be used in electrical engineering development Yes you can.You can do whatever you want as long as it benefits your organisation. Pardon me if I am being presumptuous but are you really meaning to ask the below question? I would like to know if Scrum methodologies would be beneficial in electrical engineering development? Do you have the following? 1. a product or final product vision 2. a cross functional team who builds that product 3. product requirements which can be converted to bit sized shippable product user stories 4. and it is technically possible to work in as less as 2 weeks to 1 month iterations 5. a collocated team If you have most of the above in your favor then it should work great for you, even if you don't, there is nothing that stops you from using Scrum in EE Development.
