Access to paperclip temp file when using s3 storage option on heroku

I am using the Paperclip gem to resize upload photos and store them on amazon S3. I need access to the resized photo to also pass along to another web service, during the lifecycle of the upload request. I suspect there is a temp file created somewhere the imagemagik uses before the photo is uploaded to s3. How can I get access to it.
