When to do the split training and test set

I want to split my sample into a training and a testing set in order to cross-validate my findings. However, I am not sure in which point in the process I have to do the split. Here is the order I want to do the analysis: Descriptive analysis on the whole sample Split into training and testing set Correlation analysis only on the training set (kick out highly correlated variables) Logistic regression only on the training set Use resulting logistic model on the testing sample and validate Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance
