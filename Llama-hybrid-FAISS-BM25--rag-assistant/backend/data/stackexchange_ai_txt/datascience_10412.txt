Stanford NER - Increase probability for a certain class

I'm new to machine learning so I apologize if this question is silly. I'm using Stanford NER's english 4class classifier with good results. However, since my dataset is mostly focused on organizations, I think the results could be improved if I could boost the probability for an entity to be an organization to the detriment of other classes.(Ex: I would prefer "Carl Zeis" to be identified as an organization rather than a person). Is my supposition correct? If so, can it be achieved in an easier way than retraining the model?
