Finding sequence combinations that impact target variable the most

One can create a time series model to predict a target variable. What I need to do is find the input combinations and sequences that impact the target variable the most. In this case, the input data is a series of time steps, each of which has many features. The desired model would give clarity to not only the best features but the combinations and sequences of combinations that impact the target the most. This is desired because it models a system that I'd like to optimize based on this analysis. Hope that makes sense. Ideas?
