There's no reason you can't apply Fisher's exact test to this problem. Or you could use a standard chi-squared test for independence, as the expected cell counts aren't that small. Neither approach will answer the question "what is the probability that these 39 times of seeing something is unevenly distributed between these 4 plants" though. That would require a fully Bayesian analysis.
