I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, as it is mostly algebraic and not really leveraging the properties of p being a probability distribution, but here is something you can try. Due to the bounds on pmi, clearly $\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}\leq e^k$ and thus $p(x,y)\leq p(x)p(y)\cdot e^k$. We can substitute for $p(x,y)$ in $I(X;Y)$ to get $I(X;Y)\leq \sum_{x,y}p(x)p(y)\cdot e^k\cdot log(\frac{p(x)p(y)\cdot e^k}{p(x)p(y)}) = \sum_{x,y}p(x)p(y)\cdot e^k\cdot k$ I'm not sure if that's helpful or not. EDIT: Upon further review I believe this is actually less useful than the original upper bound of k. I won't delete this though in case it might hint at a starting point.
