Use this close-form approximation approximation. The author claim it is 2 orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. To abide by CV rules I will be citing key infos from the intro of this very clear paper: The key idea is that: The key idea in that paper is that $$P(X_B>Y_B)\approx P(X_N>Y_N)$$ where $X_B$ and $Y_B$ are independent beta random variables and $X_N$ and $Y_N$ are their normal approximations formed by moment matching. The author shows that these approximations are rather accurate, even for small values of $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$ . For example: when these parameters take integer values between 1 and 10 inclusive, the average absolute error is 0.006676. Edit:updated link.
