tl;dr - Any one-off guess from a particular guesser can be reduced to a single probability. However, that's just the trivial case; probability structures can make sense whenever there's some contextual relevance beyond just a single probability. The chance of a random coin landing on Heads is 50%. Doesn't matter if it's a fair coin or not; at least, not to me. Because while the coin may have bias that a knowledgeable observer could use to make more informed predictions, I'd have to guess 50% odds. My probability table is: $$ \begin{array}{c|c} \textbf{Heads} & \textbf{Tails} \\ \hline 50 \% & 50 \% \end{array}_{.} $$ But what if I tell someone that the coin has 50% odds, and then they have to make a decision about what happens on two coin flips? Lacking further information, they'd have to default to guessing that coin flips are independent events, arriving at: $$ {\newcommand{\rotate}[2]{{\style{transform-origin: center middle; display: inline-block; transform: rotate(#1deg); padding: 25px}{\rlap{#2}}}}} \hspace{-165px} \begin{array}{rc} & \qquad \qquad \small{\text{First flip}} \\ \rotate{-90}{\hspace{-25px}\small{\begin{array}{c}\text{Second} \\ \text{flip} \end{array}}} & \begin{array}{r|c|c} & \textbf{Heads} & \textbf{Tails} \\ \hline \textbf{Heads} & 25 \% & 25 \% \\ \hline \textbf{Tails} & 25 \% & 25 \% \end{array}_{,} \end{array} $$ from which they might conclude $$ \begin{array}{c|c} \begin{array}{c}\textbf{Same side} \\[-5px] \textbf{twice}\end{array} & \begin{array}{c}\textbf{Heads} \\[-5px] \textbf{and Tails} \end{array} \\ \hline 50 \% & 50 \% \end{array}_{.} $$ However, the coin flips aren't independent events; they're connected by a common causal agent, describable as the coin's bias. If we assume a model in which a coin has a constant probability of Heads, $P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} ,$ then it might be more precise to say $$ \begin{array}{c|c} \textbf{Heads} & \textbf{Tails} \\ \hline P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} & 1 - P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \end{array}_{.} $$ From this, someone might think $$ {\newcommand{\rotate}[2]{{\style{transform-origin: center middle; display: inline-block; transform: rotate(#1deg); padding: 25px}{\rlap{#2}}}}} \hspace{-165px} \begin{array}{rc} & \qquad \qquad \small{\text{First flip}} \\ \rotate{-90}{\hspace{-25px}\small{\begin{array}{c}\text{Second} \\ \text{flip} \end{array}}} & \begin{array}{r|c|c} & \textbf{Heads} & \textbf{Tails} \\ \hline \textbf{Heads} & P_{\small{\text{Heads}}}^{2} & P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \left(1-P_{\small{\text{Heads}}}\right) \\ \hline \textbf{Tails} & P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \left(1-P_{\small{\text{Heads}}}\right) & {\left(1-P_{\small{\text{Heads}}}\right)}^{2} \end{array}_{,} \end{array} $$ from which they might conclude $$ \begin{array}{c|c} \begin{array}{c}\textbf{Same side} \\[-5px] \textbf{twice}\end{array} & \begin{array}{c}\textbf{Heads} \\[-5px] \textbf{and Tails} \end{array} \\ \hline 1 - 2 P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \left(1 - P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \right) & 2 P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \left(1 - P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} \right) \end{array}_{.} $$ If I had to guess $P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} ,$ then I'd still go with $50 \% ,$ so it'd seem like this would reduce to the prior tables. So it's the same thing, right? Turns out that the odds of getting two-Heads-or-Tails is always greater than getting one-of-each, except in the special case of a perfectly fair coin. So if you do reduce the table, assuming that the probability itself captures the uncertainty, your predictions would be absurd when extended. That said, there's no " true " coin flip. We could have all sorts of different flipping methodologies that could yield very different results and apparent biases. So, the idea that there's a consistent value of $P_{\small{\text{Heads}}}$ would also tend to lead to errors when we construct arguments based on that premise. So if someone asks me the odds of a coin flip, I wouldn't say $`` 50 \% " ,$ despite it being my best guess. Instead, I'd probably say $`` \text{probably about}~50\% " .$ And what I'd be trying to say is roughly: If I had to make a one-off guess, I'd probably go with about $50 \% .$ However, there's further context that you should probably ask me to clarify if it's important. People often say some event has a 50-60% chance of happening. If you sat down with them and worked out all of their data, models, etc., you might be able to generate a better number, or, ideally, a better model that'd more robustly capture their predictive ability. But if you split the difference and just call it 55%, that'd be like assuming $P_{\small{\text{Heads}}} = 50 \%$ in that you'd basically be running with a quick estimate after having truncated the higher-order aspects of it. Not necessarily a bad tactic for a one-off quick estimate, but it does lose something.
