No, when a child process dies you will not lose any data unless it was in the middle of a request at the time (which should not happen if it exits due to MaxRequestsPerChild). You should try to reproduce the memory leak using an identical software stack on your test system. You can use tools such as Valgrind to try to detect it. You can also try a debug build of your web server and its modules, which will enable you to detect what's going on. It's difficult to reproduce the behaviour of production systems in non-production ones. If you have auto-test coverage of your web application, you could try using your full auto-test suite, but in practice this is unlikely to cover every code path therefore may miss the leaky one.
