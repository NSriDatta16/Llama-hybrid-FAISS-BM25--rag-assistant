Link functions convert the expected value of Y (given X) to something that is unbounded. While in logistic regression, Y takes values 0 or 1, the logit isn't applied to Y but to Pr(Y=1|X). (The logit of 0 and 1 are each undefined.) So it's perfectly reasonable to use the logit or the probit in this case. The other thing to think about is the residual variance: is there a particular transformation that would best stabilize the variance for your case? For proportions, the arcsine square-root transformation is often used, as it is variance-stabilizing for binomial proportions. Consider the discussion here .
