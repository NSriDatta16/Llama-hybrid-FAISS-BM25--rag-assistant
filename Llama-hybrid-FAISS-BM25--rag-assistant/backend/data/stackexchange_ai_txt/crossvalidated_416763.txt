After continuing to look I finally found the answer for Q1 in: Why does my loading matrix following PCA with a varimax rotation contain only ones and zeros? The answer is provided by Leonardo Fontenelle. In short: I took all my components with me into the varimax rotation. Instead what I should've done, is after considering eigenvalues, screeplot and % of explained variance, decide which components I wanted to keep (from what I found you generally want eigenvalue >1, % of explained variance of 70-80% (cumulative for all components), and in the scree plot you want as many components as it takes for the variation to "level off". For a more in depth explanation see: https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/factor-analysis-how-many-factors/ As for Q2: Sadly there this is less clear-cut of an answer; but it depends. In my case, I would like to couple the 4 categorical tests to my other test scores as these 4 are better understood, thus aiding in the interpretation of the component loadings. That said, it is statistically less sound and there are alternative analysis for purely categorical data.
