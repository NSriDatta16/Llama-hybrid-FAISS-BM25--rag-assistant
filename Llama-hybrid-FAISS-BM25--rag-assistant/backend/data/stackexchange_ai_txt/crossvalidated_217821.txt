Find the relationship between multiple binary variables

I have a data set which includes 5 binary variables per row of data. I was planning on creating a logistic regression to use 4 of the variables to predict the 5th and measure the significance (if any) of each variable. Before I do that, I thought I'd look at more simple relationships between the 4 predictors. What technique can I use to do this? A correlation matrix wouldn't be suitable as they are binary variables.
