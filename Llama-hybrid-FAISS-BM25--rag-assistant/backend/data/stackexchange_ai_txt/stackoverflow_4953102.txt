Linq to Sql - Sql Generation

Recently a colleague of mine stated that the SQL generated from LINQ vary depending on the table statistics. I know that the SQL generated gets optimized depending on the SQL Server versions (Sql 2000 vs SQl 2008) leveraging new operators like ROW_NUMBER if supported. Could anyone confirm this or how to validate this?
