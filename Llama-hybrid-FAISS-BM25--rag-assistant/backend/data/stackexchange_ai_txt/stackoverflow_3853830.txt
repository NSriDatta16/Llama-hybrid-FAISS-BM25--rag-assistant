The book you have linked is actually a collection of invited research papers , which means it is quite an advanced book if you are just starting in Intelligent Systems. Actually, there are two interpretations of Intelligent Systems: (a) Artificial Intelligence studied mainly by the Computer Science community. AI deals with machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, learning and planning methods. AI is about developing algorithms. The absolute reference to AI is: " Artificial Intelligence, A modern approach " Although you are referring to this interpretation, in case you are interested, here is the second one: (b) Intelligent Control Systems studied mainly by Electrical Engineers. It deals with designing intelligent systems that are able to adapt to changes in the environment, able to learn, able to make intelligent decisions, etc. Intelligent systems deals with developing mathematical models of "intelligence" that can be applied to real-world systems, so as to optimize their performance (or some other measure). The tools used are mostly adaptive control, neural networks and optimization methods. There isn't an easy to follow book on this subject, however some excellent articles are here and here . Also, an excellent reference on Neural Networks is " Neural Networks, A Comprehensive Foundation "
