How is the Filter code organized? Are you maybe calling first FilterChain#doFilter() and only thereafter doing the needed logic? public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) { // Any code here will be executed BEFORE passing request through JSP/Servlet. chain.doFilter(request, response); // Any code here will be executed AFTER passing request through JSP/Servlet. }
