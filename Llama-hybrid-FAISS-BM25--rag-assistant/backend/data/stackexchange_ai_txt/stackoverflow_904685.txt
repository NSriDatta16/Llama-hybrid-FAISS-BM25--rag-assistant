I'm using n software Amazon Integrator in my current project for a client. It's not cheap, but supports most of Amazon's services (Simple Storage Service (S3), Simple Queue Service (SQS), SimpleDB, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and E-Commerce Service (AWS)). It's not "out of the box" solution, but with a help of a third party component.
