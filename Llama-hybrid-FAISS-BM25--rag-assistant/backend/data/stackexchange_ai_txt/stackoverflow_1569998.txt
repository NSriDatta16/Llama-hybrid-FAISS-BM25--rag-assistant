This is an interesting question. If it wasn't a constructor function you were trying to give dynamic arguments to, then normally you could use call_user_func_array() . However, since the new operator is involved, there doesn't seem to be an elegant way to do this. Reflection seems to be the consensus from what I could find. The following snippet is taken from the user comments on call_user_func_array() , and illustrates the usage quite nicely: newInstanceArgs($args); // this is the same as: new myCommand('a', 'b'); ?> To shorten it up for your case, you can use: $reflectionObject = new ReflectionClass($class); $obj = $reflectionObject->newInstanceArgs($key);
