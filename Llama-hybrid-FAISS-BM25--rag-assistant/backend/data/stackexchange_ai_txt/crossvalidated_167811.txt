Comparing magnitude of coefficients in a logistic regression

I have a logistic regression: ln(p/(1-p)) = a + b * Age + c * Balance + d * Tenure Let's say that: b = 1.4 c = 2.5 d = -0.7 We can compare signs of the coefficients. I.e. right away we can say that an increase in Tenure will cause a decrease in probability of the dependent variable. My question is: can we compare magnitudes of the coefficients to each other? I know that we can take the exp() of any coefficient and get the odds ratio and make conclusions then. But what I am referring to is different - without taking the exp() can we simply say the following: Since c > b then the impact from a 1 unit change in Balance on the DV's probability is greater than the impact from a 1 unit change in Age. (without saying how much greater. Just simply greater) I did quite a lot of search and only found this thread: Comparing coefficients in logistic regression Where this approach seems to be implied. However, I would like to confirm that you can interpret coefficients like this. I look forward to your thoughts, Thank you, Kirill
