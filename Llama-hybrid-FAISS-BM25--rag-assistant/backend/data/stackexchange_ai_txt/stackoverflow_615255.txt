Different behavior of padding-bottom in table row between IE and FF

Kindly read the following code as an example (pay attention to the "padding-bottom" of 2nd table row): test first row second row third row first row second row third row I expect that height of two tables should be the same in both IE and FF. However, FF renders it as expected, but in IE, the first table is 20px higher than the second table. What should I do in order to make it render like FF? I am also curious about what makes the difference.
