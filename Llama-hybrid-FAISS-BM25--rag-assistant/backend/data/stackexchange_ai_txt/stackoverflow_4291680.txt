What's the best recourse when hibernate/HQL is too limited?

If there's an operation I'd like to do on a mapped class, but is not currently supported by hibernate or HQL - what is the best fallback? Raw JDBC? Or can I somehow leverage the existing mappings I have, to free me from writing boilerplate code, but still giving me more flexibility than is built into hibernate? (This question does not talk about alternatives to hibernate - it assumes we are using hibernate as our main ORM)
