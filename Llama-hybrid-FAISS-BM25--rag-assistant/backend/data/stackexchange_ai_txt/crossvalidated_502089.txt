Generally speaking, ACF and PACF help you to find out which ARIMA type best suits your data (eg ARIMA(2,1,1)). The time series has to be stationary when checking ACF and PACF. https://towardsdatascience.com/identifying-ar-and-ma-terms-using-acf-and-pacf-plots-in-time-series-forecasting-ccb9fd073db8 maybe here you can find some further clarifications. It is important to point out that many times there isn't a clear answer by just looking at ACFs and PACFs, so you can use tools implemented in almost all statistical softwares to find out which ARIMA type best suits your data.
