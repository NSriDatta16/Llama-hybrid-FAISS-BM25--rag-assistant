In the end I'm going to go with the solution linked to by Uvita in the comments ( this post ). So far it seems to be working well, it allows me to perform minification as well as it lets me easily keep my javascript organized the same way I keep my views organized. All in all it seems the cleanest method to both asset management and MVC integration into my javascript files.
