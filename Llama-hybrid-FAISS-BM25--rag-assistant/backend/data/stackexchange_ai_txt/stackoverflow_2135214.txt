I don't know how well loading a python lib in c# will do ya, but I'd write my program via IronPython. you can then compile it to an exe so your users don't know the difference. now this is guesswork, but maybe you can then load your assembly in other c# projects and use it that way. i.e. wrap the python library with ironpython and then load that in c# its not elegant, but it'll work, I bet.
