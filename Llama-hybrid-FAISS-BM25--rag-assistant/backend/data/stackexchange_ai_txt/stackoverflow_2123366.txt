Thank you Michelle. My basic confusion was whether the metadata is stored as a part of the file or in a separate file which is stored somewhere else in the file system - like inode in case of Unix like systems. ID3 shows that it is stored with the file as a block of bytes after the actual content of the file. Is this the way of metadata storage for most of the other file types?
