The Kruskal-Wallis test as a seasonality test is implemented in the R package {seastests} . For a monthly time series, it tests whether the mean of the months is identical across all months. The test does not assume that the mean is identical across years, only that the time series is stationary. The latter is why by default the first differences of the series is analysed. More details on this test and other seasonality tests can be found in Ollech & Webel 2022 .
