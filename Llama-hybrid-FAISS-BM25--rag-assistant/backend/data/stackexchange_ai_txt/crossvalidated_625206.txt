Looking for a statistical test that discovers whether a set of values is statistically significant from an established value

I am working with a set of vowel lengths generated by non-native speakers of English and I want to find out whether they are consistent with vowel lengths generated by native speakers of English according to an established standard. My data therefore looks like the following: and so on. I want to find out whether these values are significantly different than the established average vowel length for native speakers. That is, I need a statistical test which will determine if the data set is significantly different from one value. What statistical tests would be appropriate for this?
