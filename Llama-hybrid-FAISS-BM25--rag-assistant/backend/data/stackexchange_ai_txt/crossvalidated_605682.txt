calculating a posterior mean + median + 95% probability int

This question comes from the Bayesian Thinking in Biostatistics textbook. So I've been given a dataset where the mean is shown to be 134.5 and the variance 242.2. Using a normal prior for the population mean μ ~ N(130, 100), I need to plot the posterior and prior distributions of μ and obtain the posterior mean and median as well as a 95% posterior probability interval for μ. My intuition and findings show that I think I need to use the conjugate prior somehow here. I know that the posterior is the (likelihood*prior)/avg likelihood I don't really know what to do after this here. EDIT: I think I might be on to something here... posterior_mean Where 404 is the number of observations. Thus producing an answer of the posterior mean = 134.5 and posterior variance = 0.61. My next question is why is the posterior variance so small compared to the prior variance?
