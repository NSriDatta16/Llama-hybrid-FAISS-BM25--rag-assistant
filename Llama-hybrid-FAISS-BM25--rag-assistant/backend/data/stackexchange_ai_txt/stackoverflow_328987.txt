Many thanks for all the replies. Smazurov's answer got me thinking and made me overlook my PHP configuration once more. PHP's default behaviour is not to encrypt the session-related data, which should make it possible to read out the session data after restarting an old session from another client. However, I use Suhosin to patch and prevent some security issues. Suhosin's default behaviour is to encrypt session data based on the User Agent , making it a lot harder to read out other people's sessions. This was also the cause of my problems; disabling this behaviour has solved the issue.
