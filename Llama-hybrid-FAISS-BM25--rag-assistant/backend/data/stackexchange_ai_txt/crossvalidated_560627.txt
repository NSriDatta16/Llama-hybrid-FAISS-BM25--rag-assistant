Comparing properties of networks of different sizes

I want to compare some network properties such as density, average path and modularity among groups of sizes ranging from 100 to 4000. How can I correctly compare these networks? Considering the densities, for example, it seems to me that I need to apply an adjustment factor to compensate the fact that the number of potential connections grows exponentially. It is much harder for the larger network to materialize, letâ€™s say, 50% of its almost 8 million potential connections than it is for the 100-node network to materialize 2,5k connections. Can anyone point me in the right direction here? Thanks in advance.
