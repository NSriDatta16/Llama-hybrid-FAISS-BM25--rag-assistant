XML is a data exchange format. Since you already considered to embed the XML file into your DLL, probably nobody will actually need the format to be XML. What about just extracting the relevant data from the XML file and storing that as a resource in your DLL? First, it saves you space, and second, you can already organize the data in the way you will need it later.
