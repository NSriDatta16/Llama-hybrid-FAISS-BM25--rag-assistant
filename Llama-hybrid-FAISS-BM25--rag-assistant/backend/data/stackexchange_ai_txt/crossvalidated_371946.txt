Essentially what you want is to change your input with 176 features into 8 values. For this you seem to have 8500 examples. If this understanding is incorrect, it means that the order of the data matters, which would mean you have to introduce a time component. If that is the case the problem becomes more involved. For now I will assume your data does not have a time component that matters. The input should consists of your 176 characteristics and the output of 8 neurons. What you do in between is the way your architecture is buildup. There can be several layers with different activations. What works best for your problem is a hard task in general and practically impossible for us to answer since we don't know more about your data. A multilayer perceptron would be a good first approach though since it is simple to build and interpret the results. The main point I want to give you is that much is dependent on your problem: what do you want to minimize/maximize, what is the corresponding loss function, what impact do you expect for certain variables? These kind of questions allow you to choose a logical set-up for your neural network.
