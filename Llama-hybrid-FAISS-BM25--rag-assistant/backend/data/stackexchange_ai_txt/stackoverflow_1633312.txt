Appropriate usage for JSON?

Great site! I have a question I haven't seen answered. I am very new to this, I didn't know what JSON was yesterday, so I apologize if this is a stupid question. A client has requested an JSON/XML type scheme to store data because they want a flat file to edit/update without having to deal with queries, and they want it flexible for future development. I would like the data to be structured, as I'll use it and php to build html pages, two parts of the site will use it, both on the same server. The json file will contain an array of objects, probably eventually 50, that consist of 5 or 6 short tag/data combos, and 1-3 tag/data combos that will be long, a couple paragraphs of text each. Details: server side implementation only, everything will reside on the same server. At this time, I will manually build the json file, in the future it may be automatically generated. I prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php. I have php 5.2.6 and json 1.2.1. My questions are: Is it appropriate to use json for data that's textarea size? Will it cause performance issues at build-out when I have 30-50 objects in my array, and I need to find the right one? Is it appropriate to use json as a data repository like this? If so, I'm having trouble finding instructions on the very basics, like how to access the file. Do I have to use XMLHttpRequest even on the same server? Any informational links to help better understand this would be greatly appreciated. If this is not a good usage, any tips on what might be a good choice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
