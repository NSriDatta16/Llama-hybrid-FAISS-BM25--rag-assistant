How do I compute the transition probability function?

I have to reproduce the algorithm of a scientific article and have chosen one that uses Reinforcement Learning. However, I don't understand how to compute the transition probability function ($f$) used in the iteration: The article says: In order to run the Q-value iteration algorithm (Table 2), the transition probability function f was first computed. My question is: how was it computed?
