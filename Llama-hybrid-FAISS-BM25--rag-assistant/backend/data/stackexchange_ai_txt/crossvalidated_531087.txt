R Squared (OOB) and R Square from correlation of prediction of test set is different?

I'm using simulated data and fitting Random Forest model for regression on a training dataset. What is confusing me is that after running Random Forest, I got R Squared (OOB) equal to 0.14. But when I predict the test set and and find a correlation equal to 0.84 between actual response variable of test set and predicted values of the response. Taking square of of correlation gives me 0.75, which R Squared. My main question is why are they different? Can we use correlation, that is, 0.84 instead of OOB R Squared to check whether our model is good are not? And also what else can I do improve the model? Here are my sample codes ######## Import libraries library(ranger) ######## data p $prediction.error) plot(y_test, pred$ predictions) cor(y_test, pred $predictions) cor(y_test, pred$ predictions)^2 # R Squared
