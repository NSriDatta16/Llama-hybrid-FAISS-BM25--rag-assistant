How to merge efficiently gigantic files with C#

I have over 125 TSV files of ~100Mb each that I want to merge. The merge operation is allowed destroy the 125 files, but not the data. What matter is that a the end, I end up with a big file of the content of all the files one after the other (no specific order). Is there an efficient way to do that? I was wondering if Windows provides an API to simply make a big "Union" of all those files? Otherwise, I will have to read all the files and write a big one. Thanks!
