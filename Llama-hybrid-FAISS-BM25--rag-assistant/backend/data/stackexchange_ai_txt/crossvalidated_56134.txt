A serious in-depth problem of probabilities for flipping coins

Lets say I'm doing 10,000 flips of a coin. I would like to know the probability of how many flips it takes to get 4 or more consecutive heads in a row. The count would work as the following, you would count one successive round of flips being only heads (4 heads or more). When a tails hits and breaks the streak of heads the count would start again from the next flip. This would then repeat for 10,000 flips. I'd like to know the probability of not just 4 or more heads in a row but, 6 or more, and 10 or more. To clarify if a streak of 9 heads is achieved it would be tallied as 1 streak 4 or more (and/or 6 or more), not 2 separate streaks. For example if the coin came THTHTHTHHHHHH///THAHTHT....the count would be 13 and begin once again on the next tails. Let's say the data comes out to be highly skewed to the right; the mean being 40 flips on average it takes to achieve a streak of 4 or more, and the distribution is u = 28. Obviously skewed. I'm doing my best to find a way to make some sense out of descriptive data, except as of now I've found nothing. I want to find some way of getting some sensible probability out of it. Like a normal curve where +/- 1 SD is 68% etc..I've looked into log normalizing and that's only really used for a parametric testing which is not my goal. I have been told beta distributions but every suggestion I've had has been quite confusing. I've asked this question a year ago and got some insight but unfortunately I still do not have an answer. Thank you to any of you who have ideas.
