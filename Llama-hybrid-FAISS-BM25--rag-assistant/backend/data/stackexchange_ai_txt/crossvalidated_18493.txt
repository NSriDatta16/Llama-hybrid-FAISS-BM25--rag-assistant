Go from cluster to random forest

I'm working on improving a random forest model. I've done some clustering of the data using the pvclust package in R. I use ward and euclidean distances. My question is how do I go from the results of the clustering analysis to a better random forest. Do I need to run multiple rf objects with data split along the edges defined in the clustering results or is it something else. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Most of my work is in R.
