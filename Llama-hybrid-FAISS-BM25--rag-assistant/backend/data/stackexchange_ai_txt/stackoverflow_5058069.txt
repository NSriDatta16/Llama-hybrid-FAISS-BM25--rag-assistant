Android SharedPreference specific storage and retreival

I am creating SharePreference using: sharedPreference=getSharedPreferences(SHARED_PREFE_LOCATION, 0); preferenceEditor=mSharedPreference.edit(); preferenceEditor.commit(); And have setup a screen using Preference From Code SDK sample. Now what I want is when user changes the preference using the code generated PreferenceScreen the changes should reflect in preference file SHARED_PREFE_LOCATION (from my code variable.) and not in defaultSharedPreference . How can I do that. EDIT I know I can implement on PreferenceChangeListener and reflect the changes in the desired file. But thats tedious. Is there any straight forward way?
