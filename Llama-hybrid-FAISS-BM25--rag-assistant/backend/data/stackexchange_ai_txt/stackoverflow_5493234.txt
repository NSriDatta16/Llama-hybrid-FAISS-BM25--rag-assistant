Are you sure you want to do that? It's usually best to arrange your app so that the only object manipulating a view controller's view hierarchy is that view controller. If other objects want to change something, they either change the data model or send a message to the view controller. So, you might give your view controller a 'backgroundColor' property, and its setter would update the appropriate view. Setting the background color indirectly through the view controller makes it easier to make changes to your view hierarchy in the future and generally keeps things better organized.
