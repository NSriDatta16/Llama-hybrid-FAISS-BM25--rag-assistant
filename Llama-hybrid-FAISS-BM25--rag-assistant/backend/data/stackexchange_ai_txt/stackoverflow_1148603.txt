Generally Linux distros aren't very interested in things they can't integrate into their release schedules. Since JNLP allows you to deploy a new version at any time, they can't do a version freeze before release. This will exclude you from most distros - Debian even removed Adobe's flash plugin for this very reason, and if they'll remove Flash, don't expect them to make exceptions for a less well known application. If you're willing to distribute it as just a plain .jar, you might be able to get it in - for debian, you'll want to read the Debian New Maintainer's Guide and Debian Policy on how to package things, submit an ITP (intent to package), upload a package , then seek sponsorship on the debian-mentors mailing list . More info can be found at the Debian mentors FAQ . Packages submitted to Debian will also make their way into Ubuntu in due course. Other distributions will have different policies, of course; if in doubt, check their faqs, or ask on an appropriate mailing list for the distro in question.
