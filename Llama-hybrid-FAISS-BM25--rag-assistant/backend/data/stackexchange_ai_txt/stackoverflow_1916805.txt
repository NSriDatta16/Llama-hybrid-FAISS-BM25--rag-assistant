If you want some handler on your GAE app (including one for a scheduled task, reception of messages, web page visits, etc) to store some new information in such a way that some handler in the future can recover that information, then GAE's storage is the only good general way (memcache could expire from under you, for example). Not sure what you mean by "tables" (?!), but guessing that you actually mean GAE's storage the answer is "yes". (Under very specific circumstances you might want to put that data to some different place on the network, such as your visitor's browser e.g. via cookies, or an Amazon storage instance, etc, but it does not appear to me that those specific circumstances are appliable to your use case).
