GPU for fully-connected network?

I'm interested in neural networks from a general machine learning and pattern recognition perspective and not as much from the perspective of image processing or NLP data. If I want to train a neural network with many layers each of which have many neurons (maybe 50 layers of 100 neurons each), then will a GPU speed up the process of learning? I've heard everyone say that GPUs speed up everything, but I'm wondering if there is much more benefit for convolutional layers, or if GPUs will always speed up matrix multiplication. Basically, in practice, what advantage can GPUs give a person training a non-convolutional neural network?
