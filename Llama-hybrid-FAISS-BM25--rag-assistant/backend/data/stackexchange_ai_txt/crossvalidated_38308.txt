What is the number of subjects needed to be representative for a small, finite population?

I have been studying an organisation with 58 people with a number of Likert style questionnaires. The data are not random samples but rather incomplete census's. For the 6 questionnaires I managed to get between 49 & 57 respondents. However when I come to combine questionnaire data, the number can fall to say 43 subjects. The responses to the questionnaires have been uniformly non-normal and generally leptokurtic. NP bootstrap regression on this number of subjects gives significant results, however I am unsure whether this enables me to say anything about the organisation more generally. If you have any guidance on the limits of what I can say with this sort of data it would be helpful. Many thanks for any advice.
