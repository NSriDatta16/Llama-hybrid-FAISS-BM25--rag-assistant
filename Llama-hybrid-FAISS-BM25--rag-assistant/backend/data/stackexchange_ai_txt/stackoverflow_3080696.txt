Why there is not a comprehensive c archive network?

There are websites as collections of python/perl/R libraries. Why there is not an equivalent one for c? I searched the internet and only found a small website calling itself CCAN . There are only a few libraries in that website. If I need extra libraries for c programming, where can I find them? Is there an well organized website of the c libraries? Thanks.
