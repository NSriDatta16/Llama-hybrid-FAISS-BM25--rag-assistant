How should I treat my covariate in R?

This is covariate age in my logistic regression. How should I treat it? Gets a little insecure. Have tried to read, but still insecure. Right now I treat it as if it were linear. A polynomial is not appropriate. Some tips? I have a binary response variable x axis is age, the y axis is the percentage of approved students first semester
