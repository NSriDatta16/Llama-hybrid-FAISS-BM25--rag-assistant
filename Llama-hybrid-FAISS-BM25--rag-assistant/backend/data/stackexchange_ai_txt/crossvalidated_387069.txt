logistic regression with high correlation but no significative variables

I am working with logistic regression in R by means of glm. I have fitted a logistic (0-1) regression model with seven predictor variables. I obtain a model where the variables have high p-values (>0.1) (not significative) but the r^2 of Mcfadden is high (0.6). McFadden is equivalent to Pearson's r^2 in linear regression (I am not totally sure). Therefore, how it is possible to obtain a high correlation with no statistically significant variables?
