On a normal form, Save should be under the form fields. Cancel should be to the left or right of Save, but not too close to avoid tragic mistakes. Luke W's Web Application Form Design page has some illuminating diagrams. Your form is unusual in that you want the buttons to be at the top. In this case I'd need to know what the page looks like and how it will be used. But since you're already breaking any flow between form fields and Save, I suspect Save should be on the right to support the natural left-to-right path. (Windows and Mac have differing standards for button placement on dialog boxes , and they both have the buttons at the bottom. These standards do not apply to web pages.)
