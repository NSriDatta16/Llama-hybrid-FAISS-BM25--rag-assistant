if I understand your issue, you have to storage your session data out of process. You could use "State Server Mode" or "SQL Server Mode" if you have a SQLServer database. Here you can find how to use http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586.aspx Otherwise you can built a "custom session state store provider", but I think that way is a bit more complicated.
