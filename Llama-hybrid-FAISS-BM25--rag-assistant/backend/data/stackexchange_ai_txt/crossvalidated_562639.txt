Final model for time series forecasting

I am struggling with understanding how the final performance on an independent test set is obtained in a time series forecasting scenario. My understanding is that rolling CV is used (as seen as in the picture) to prevent future datapoints to leak into the model. The ensemble of scores can than be used to deduce performance. This method results in many models (in this case, four). What is the final model then selected for further use? Is it the final model, trained on most of the data? Is the performance of this model then described by the scores of the model itself, or by the ensemble of itself and all preceding models?
