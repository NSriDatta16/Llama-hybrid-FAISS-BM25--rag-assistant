Have 2 separate tables or an additional field in 1 table?

I am making a small personal application regarding my trade of shares of various companies. The actions can be selling shares of a company or buying. Therefore, the details to be saved in both cases would be: Number of Shares Average Price Would it be better to use separate tables for "buy" and "sell" or just use one table for "trade" and keep a field that demarcates "buy" from "sell"?
