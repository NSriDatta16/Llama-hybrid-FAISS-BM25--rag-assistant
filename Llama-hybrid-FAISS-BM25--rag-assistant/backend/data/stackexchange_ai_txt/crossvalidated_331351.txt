Identically distributed generally means that each observation of a variable was sampled independently from a distribution identical to every other observation on that variable . A simple random walk where $y_{y} = y_{t-1} + 2\mathcal{Bernouli}\left(0.5\right)-1$ is an example of a variable ($y_{t}$) that is not i.i.d.: each value of $y_{t}$ depends quite directly on it's immediately prior value, and in fact, the process "remembers" all perturbations to it infinitely. More, the variance of $y_{t}$ is a function of $t$ (in fact, $\sigma^{2}_{y_{t}}=t$), meaning that different values in this time series cannot possible have "the same" distribution.
