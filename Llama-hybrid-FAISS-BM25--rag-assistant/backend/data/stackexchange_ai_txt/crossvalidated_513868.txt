How is the likelihood different from the posterior?

I come from an applied mathematics background and have never looked at statistics, but I started studying Machine Learning recently. One thing that I am struggling to understand is: what is the difference between the Likelihood and the Posterior? Bayes' Theorem is given by $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ where $P(A|B)$ is the Posterior and $P(B|A)$ is the Likelihood. If you multiply both sides by $P(B)$ and divide by $P(A)$ you end up with $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$ and this looks like the same equation. What is the Posterior/Likelihood now? I want to have a good understanding of the Posterior/Likelihood so if there are any recommended texts, please feel free to share them.
