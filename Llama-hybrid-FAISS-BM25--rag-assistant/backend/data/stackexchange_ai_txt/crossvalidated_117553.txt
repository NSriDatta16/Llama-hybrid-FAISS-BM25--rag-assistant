How to estimate a Logistic Regression function in a quadratic form?

I am trying to use a mixed-integer programming solver to optimize the following logistic regression function: $$\mathop {\min }\limits_w {{\exp ({w^T}x + b)} \over {1 + \exp ({w^T}x + b)}}$$ There is no solver (that I know of) can represent this function to optimize the logistic regression. I am thinking if I could represent the logistic regression with a quadratic function so I can input it to the mixed-integer quadratic solver. Any help is appreciated.
