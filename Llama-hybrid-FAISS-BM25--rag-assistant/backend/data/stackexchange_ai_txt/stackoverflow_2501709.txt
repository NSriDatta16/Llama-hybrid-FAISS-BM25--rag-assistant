There are many ways that a session id can be leaked to an attacker. XSS is the most commonly used attack to hijack a Session ID and you should test for XSS vulnerabilities in your application. . A common method of improving the strength of a session is to check the IP address. When the user logs in, record the ip address. Check the IP address for every request, if the IP changes then its probably a hijacked session. This secuirty measure could prevent legitimate requests, but that is very unlikely. Do not check the X-Forwarded-For or User-Agent, its trivial for an attacker to modify these values. I also recommend enabling httpOnlyCookies in your web.config file: This makes it more difficult for an attacker to hijack a session with javascript, but its still possible.
