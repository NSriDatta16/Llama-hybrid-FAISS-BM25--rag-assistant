I'm on the same quest. I think I may have found the answer, or close enough: Xspf Jukebox . It has a Javascript API and there's even a Wii skin . I haven't actually got it working yet, I'll update when I do. Update: I was able to get this working with a few sample mp3s included in my website. I haven't got Javascript control working on the Wii (Opera) but it does work in IE. I did struggle a bit to get the skin working -- you have to download the skin.xml file, set the skin_url parameter to the path containing the skin, and set the dimensions appropriately. My current code is: I'm running this as an ASP.NET site on Windows Home Server. I primarily listen to complete albums and my library (60,000+ tracks) is organized by album artist\album\track, so I'm thinking of writing code to traverse the file system and generate a playlist dynamically from the contents of a folder.
