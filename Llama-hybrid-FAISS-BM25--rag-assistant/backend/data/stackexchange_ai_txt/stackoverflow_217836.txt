A comparison table between JBoss, Geronimo and Tomcat for latter 2007. This article has many interesting points to aid your decision and is worth reading: Geronimo 2 is the clear choice if your Java application needs are particularly extensive or if you just want to leverage total Java EE 5 compliance. Although JBoss 4.2 is not completely compatible with Sun's Java EE 5 standard, the JBoss 4.2 team is responsible for many of the cutting-edge technologies used by all of the servers and added to the standard Java EE 5 capabilities. Tomcat 6 by itself is a lightweight solution. It does not come with all the Java EE features and additional packages found in JBoss and Geronimo, but also doesn't require much memory and runs fast even on smaller servers. In conclusion the author says: Bottom line: JBoss, Geronimo, and Tomcat are reliable, fast, and definitely able to handle the traffic on large-scale enterprise applications. Furthermore, many of the high-demand Java server technologies presented in the features comparison originate from the open source world, not the commercial one.
