Just to expand on what you and @Glen_b said: The point of the inner loop is to reduce correlation among sampled values. A common way to do this is by only taking every nth value, a process called Thinning . From Wikipedia : It is common to ignore some number of samples at the beginning and then consider only every th sample when averaging values to compute an expectation. â€¦ The reason for this is that (1) successive samples are not independent of each other but form a Markov chain with some amount of correlation; (2) the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the desired joint distribution over the variables, but it may take a while for that stationary distribution to be reached. Your example (the inner loop) does this slightly differently. Instead of reducing correlation between samples by taking every n th value, it obscures it by randomizing each sample thin number of times.
