How do I include the static library for Core Plot?

According to the Core Plot Wiki : Core Plot is built as a static library for iPhone, so you'll need to drag the libCorePlot-CocoaTouch.a static library from under the CorePlot-CocoaTouch.xcodeproj group to your target's Link Binary With Libraries folder. I do not see the mentioned library, where might it be?
