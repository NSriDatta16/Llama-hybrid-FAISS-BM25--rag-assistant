What is the classical way to visualize 3D filters in convolutional neural networks?

Suppose that at a layer $N$ within a CNN, my "image" is a 200$\times$200$\times$10 array. Thus, if I convolve such an array with, for example, 15 filters of size 3$\times$3$\times$10, I will end up with a new "image" whose shape is $A\times{B}\times{15}$ where $A$ and $B$ depend on the stride of the convolution. I am thus wondering how such 3D (3$\times$3$\times$10 in my toy example) convolution filters are usually displayed as 2D images (i.e. sum or mean, ...)?
