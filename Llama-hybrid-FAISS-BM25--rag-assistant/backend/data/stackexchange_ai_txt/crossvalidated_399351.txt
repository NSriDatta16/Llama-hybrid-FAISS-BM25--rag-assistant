First, no algorithms can accept null as an input (as in, no value passed), but many can deal with the concept or representation of null in an appropriate way. If you are using a sophisticated learner such as a neural network or tree based method, then it will have no problem learning from values that represent null, so you could fill with 0 or anything that is outside of the range of grades. You could also potentially aid the learning algorithm by passing an additional parameter such as binary yes/no indicating if the student was in class last year. This is really only an issue if you are using something simple like OLS where the hypothesis space is limited to a linear combination of inputs. Without knowing what algorithm you are working with I cannot provide a more specific answer, but I recommend reading about the hypothesis space of different ML algorithms. example showing LSTM can learn that a value means missing Also I love the downvotes with no explanation, keep them coming!
