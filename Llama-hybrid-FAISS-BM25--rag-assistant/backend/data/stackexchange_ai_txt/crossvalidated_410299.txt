Application of a Hidden Markov Model

I recently began learning about HMMs and wanted to ask about a possible application that would hopefully help me grasp the concepts. One of the applications for a regular Markov Model is modelling the sequence of interactions for customers on a website, such as: Land on page Click image Add product to cart Bounce So if we were to assume that these observations were created by certain 'types' of customers like 'bargain hunters' or 'people looking for inspiration', then we want to determine how many types exist and label these customers. Would that turn the problem into one suited for a HMM?
