ARIMA first order differencing shows strange pattern

I have came across with a strange issue when I employ a first order differencing to make the original time series stationary. The original ts is with 1-min recording interval and over 2months. Since the ACF plot attenuates very slowly for the original ts and ADF test shows the ts is not stationary. The differenced ts plot shows very strange pattern, probably because the there are many consecutive duplicated observations in the original time series,for example My questions are (1)Does this kind of pattern looks stationary? Since I haven't seen any ts plot like this, I have no idea. (2)Are there any better way to handle consecutive duplicated observations. I tried to calculate the 5-min mean of the original ts and then set up model on it but the model will be totally different. (3) Is that okay to use this kind of differenced time series for further model identification，or should I use the auto.arima() to set up model on original undifferenced time series？ The second method is definitely easier.But which will give a better estimation? I will be very grateful if someone can give me a answer as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
