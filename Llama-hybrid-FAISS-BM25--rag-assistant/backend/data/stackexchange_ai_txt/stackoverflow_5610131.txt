Game AI OO Framework

Is there an artificial intelligence (AI) programming framework for game software engineers? I'm specifically looking for a library of object-oriented classes that I can use in a game. Specifically, I would like to know the best way to program NPC decision making that is purely object oriented. I have googled and gotten a lot of useless links to machine learning and theoretical AI websites that have absolutely nothing to do with practical software engineering. Any frameworks I've found are all either out of date or too academic to be useful. Specifically, I'm looking for Java or Objective-C libraries.
