What to do with dummy variable that is not significant?

I´m running a binary logistic regression to predict the purchase probability for a product. My model contains mostly dichotomous and categorical variables. One variable, let´s say "decision maker", has three categories "x1 = CEO, x2= purchasing manager, x3= others". So, what to do when the variable "decision maker" is significant but the dummy variable "x2= purchasing manager" is not significant?
