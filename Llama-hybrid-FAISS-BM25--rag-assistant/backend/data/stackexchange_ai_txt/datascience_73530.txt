Using ARIMA parameters when transforming time series to Supervised Learning

When forecasting time series one can change the problem from a classical time series (ARIMA type of models) to supervised learning (by adding lag features). When the time series is long and you convert it to supervised learning you end up having a lot of features. In case that we had done previous modeling with ARIMA and found the AR, I, MA, parameters. Could we use this knowledge/parameters to select a subset of lag features?
