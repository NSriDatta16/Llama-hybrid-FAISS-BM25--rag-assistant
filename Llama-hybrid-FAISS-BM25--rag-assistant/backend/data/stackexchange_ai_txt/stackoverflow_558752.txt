This is the quickSelect algorithm. It's basically a quick sort where you only recurse for one part of the array. Here's a simple implementation in Python, written for brevity and readability rather than efficiency. def quickSelect(data, nLeast) : pivot = data[-1] less = [x for x in data if x pivot] less.append(pivot) if len(less) This will run in O(N) on average, since at each iteration, you are expected to reduce the size of data by a multiplicative constant. The result will not be sorted. The worst case is O(N^2), but this is dealt with in essentially the same way as a quick sort, using things like median-of-3.
