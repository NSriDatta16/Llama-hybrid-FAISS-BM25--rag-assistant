How to normalize two time series for comparison?

I have two time series a and b, which I want to compare. Due to their range difference I normalize them first. a(i), b(i) are natural numbers for i=1,...,N two different normalizations: ( mean and std_dev both refer to the whole time series ) 1) a'(i) := a(i) / mean( a ) goal : mean( a' ) = 1 2) a'(i) := [ a(i) - mean( a ) ] / std_dev( a ) goal : usual normalization what confuses me is how do the meanings after those transformations differ? does the first transformation make any sense at all?
