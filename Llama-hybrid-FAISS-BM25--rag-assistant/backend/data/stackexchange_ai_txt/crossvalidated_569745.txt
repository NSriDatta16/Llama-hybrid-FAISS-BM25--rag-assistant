Yes it's possible. Wald confidence intervals in a logistic regression are calculated on the log-odds scale and then exponentiated to get the confidence interval for the corresponding odds ratio. The $p$ -value is based on the test statistic $z = \frac{\hat{\beta}}{\operatorname{SE}_{\hat{\beta}}}$ , which is the estimate on the log-odds scale divided by its standard error. The (two-sided) $p$ -value is then calculated based on the test statistic $z$ as $p=2\Phi(-|z|)$ , where $\Phi$ denotes the cdf of the standard normal distribution. In order to calculate the confidence interval, we need the standard error. Solving for the standard error, we have: $$ \operatorname{SE} = -\frac{|\hat{\beta}|}{\Phi^{-1}(p/2)} $$ where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution. To calculate the confidence interval on the log-odds scale, we then use: $$ \hat{\beta} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\times \operatorname{SE}_{\hat{\beta}} $$ where $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is a quantile of the standard distribution, e.g. $1.96$ for $\alpha = 0.05$ for a 95% confidence interval on the log-odds scale. Exponentiate the limits to get the confidence interval for the odds ratio. Let's apply it to the estimate for variable D. Applying the formula, we recover the approximate standard error as $$ \operatorname{SE} = -\frac{|-0.040|}{-1.669593} = 0.024 $$ Hence, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio is: $$ \operatorname{exp}(-0.040 \pm 1.96\times 0.024) $$ which evaluates to $(0.917, 1.010)$ . In R , you could do: library(tidyverse) df % mutate( z = qnorm(`p-value`/2) , se = -abs(Estimate)/z , ci_lwr = exp(Estimate - qnorm(0.975)*se) , ci_upr = exp(Estimate + qnorm(0.975)*se) ) ```
