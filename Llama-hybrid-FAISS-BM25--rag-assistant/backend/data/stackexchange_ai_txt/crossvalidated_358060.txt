logistic regression binomial data in python using GLM - interpreting output

I have binomial data and I'm fitting a logistic regression using generalized linear models in python in the following way: glm_binom = sm.GLM(data_endog, data_exog,family=sm.families.Binomial()) res = glm_binom.fit() print(res.summary()) I get the following results Generalized Linear Model Regression Results I would like to check my understanding of the goodness-of-fit metrics: Deviance is the variance not explained by the model (the lower the better) The Pearson chi2 number is the difference between the deviance above and the deviance of a model with all coefficients except the constant equal to zero. The p-value associated with this chi2 number determines whether this model is a good fit I'd like to confirm these because I wasn't able to find a good source online. Also, am surprised the pvalue is not reported in the output summary - is there an easy way to get it?
