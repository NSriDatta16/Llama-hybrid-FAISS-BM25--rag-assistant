Your argument against Clearcase are it is not worth the effort to learn my project would not involve too many people neither would it involve fancy development flow. Is it difficult to learn? If your company already using it, you will have many people to ask help from. Since your company already have clearcase, you are 80% done with clercase admin works. It will be fairly simple to create vobs, project etc. In fact your project is small makes it more important to use standard within company. We had some fancy projects done using our standard SCM and some projects without the standard SCM. For the one which used standard SCM, when the projects is scrapped, the code is still safe with in organization. Other products, we lost people and code. Are you using ClearCase with UCM? It is simpler than base clearcase.
