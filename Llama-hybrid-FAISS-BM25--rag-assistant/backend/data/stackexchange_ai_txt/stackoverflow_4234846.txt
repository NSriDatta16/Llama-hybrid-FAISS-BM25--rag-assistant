No , not impossible just not particularly useful. But I dont know what you are up to :-) Drag a generic NSObject from the toolbox to the .xib window and recast (Class Identity) it in the inspector (last tab with info icon) Probably you want a NSMutableArray and then you can attach an outlet from the Files Owner to the NSArray object and manipulate it from your code. However I think you might find an NSArrayController to be a better use of your time.
