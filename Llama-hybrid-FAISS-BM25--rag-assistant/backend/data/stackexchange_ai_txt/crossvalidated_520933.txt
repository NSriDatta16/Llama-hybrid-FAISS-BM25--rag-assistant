How to choose covariate adjustment method for effect of treatment estimation?

When trying to estimate average treatment effect (ATE) how does one choose between the different methods available to adjust for confounders? For example, how to choose between propensity score block matching, regression with propensity score weights, nearest neighbour covariate matching, etc ... Is there any method that is currently considered best, or are there any rules to help one choose a method over others?
