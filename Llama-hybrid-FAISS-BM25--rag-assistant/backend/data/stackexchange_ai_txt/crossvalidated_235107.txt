Long story short: It depends. If the sample in question is an outlier in a direction covered by your extracted PCs (i.e. where most variance occurs) you'll keep the information, if its an outlier in a direction orthogonal to all extracted PCs you'll loose it. To be honest: Reduction to only one single PC is an extreme case. When applying PCA in high dimensionl space one would rarely use only one PC. If in contrast you have lots of resulting final PCs, wouldn't it be a sensible assumption, that PCs that explain only a very small amount of total variance und thus get dropped finally, are also not relevant for outlier detection? All that said: Generally the motivation to apply PCA would be driven by the assumption that all dimensions in your space are of approximately equal importance (with the final weight defined by the selected scaling of the features), and there is no idea to preselect a small subset of relevant dimensions based on some domain knowledge. Is that the case here? Otherwise selection of features based on domain knowledge would be far better.
