On one hand the ACF plot lets you pick the possible values for $q$ and $Q$ of the $SARIMA$ model, on the other hand the PACF plot lets you pick the possible values for $p$ and $P$ . I think its better to show in an example, I have the ACF/PACF plots for a monthly time series. I applied seasonal differencing on this time series to remove the seasonality and a first diffrence to make the series stationnary. First lets consider the ACF: We have a spike at lag 1 so $q=1$ . Also we have a spike at lag 12 wich is the frequency of the series so $Q=1$ . Let's take a look at the PACF: We have spikes at lags 1, 2 and 3 so the possible values are $p=\left\{1,2,3\right\}$ Also we have a spike at lag 12 so $P=1$ In conclusion, we have $p=\left\{1,2,3\right\}$ , $q=1$ , $P=1$ and $Q=1$ with $d=1$ and $D=1$ . The different combination of the parameters gives 32 models to estimate and then choose the one that minimize an information criteria i typically choose $AIC$ . In your case you don't have significant spikes in the first lags in both ACF and PACF, we can assume that $p=0$ and $q=0$ . In both plots you got a significant spike at lag 7 which is the frequency of your time series so we can conclude that $P=1$ . Finaly, in the ACF shows significant spikes at lags 7, 14 and 21 so the possible values for $Q$ are $\left\{1,2,3\right\}$ . So identifying using ACF/PACF plots gives three possible models: $SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,1)_{7}$ $SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,2)_{7}$ $SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,3)_{7}$ Hope this was of help to you.
