In this case you want the ui argument to get the draggable, rather than this which refers to the droppable area, specifically ui.draggable here. It should look like this overall: drop: function (event, ui) { var pos = ui.draggable.offset(), dPos = $(this).offset(); alert("nodeid: " + ui.draggable.data("noteid") + ", Top: " + (pos.top - dPos.top) + ", Left: " + (pos.left - dPos.left)); } For the position, we need to subtract the droppable's top/left position to get the value you want here, that's the dPos above getting removed. You can test your demo with the above changes working here .
