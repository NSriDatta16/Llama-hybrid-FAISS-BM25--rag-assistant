Set the initial capacity of your StringBuilder to a large value. (Ideally, large enough to contain the entire final string.) Like so: s = new StringBuilder(loans.Count * averageExpectedStringSize) If you don't specify a capacity, the builder will likely end up doing a large amount of internal reallocations, and this will kill performance.
