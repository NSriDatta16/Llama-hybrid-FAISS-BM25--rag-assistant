First, in terms of interpretation of linear models, I'm assuming that when you say "It is possible to understand if a variable has a significant effect on the response" you mean this in the sense of an association with the response rather than a causal effect on the response. Unless you have other evidence of a causal relation, it's important to guard against the temptation of causal inference from a regression. In terms of the model that you chose via LASSO, the interpretation of the regression coefficients is as in linear regression, insofar as they represent the relation of the expected change in the response variable with a change in an independent variable, when all the other independent variables in your model are taken into account. But the variable-selection process in LASSO necessarily adds some caution to your interpretation. Most important, variables omitted should not be considered unrelated to the response. It's just that, based on your criterion for choosing the $L_1$ penalty, they weren't as important as the included variables on the particular data set you analyzed. This is a particular problem when the variable selection was from a set of highly correlated independent variables; the choice by LASSO from data sample to data sample could be highly variable. You could explore this possibility in your own data by repeating the LASSO on multiple bootstrap samples and seeing whether you always select the same independent variables. So to the interpretation in the second paragraph of my answer, perhaps one should add "and with any additional contributions of the omitted variables being ignored." In terms of diagnostics, they don't call this site "Cross Validated" for nothing. If you haven't already, get a copy of An Introduction to Statistical Learning and learn from it.
