is code injection bad?

There are some fairly powerful tools like SIMBL or Airfoil/Instant Hijack which use code injection. As far as I understand this, these tools inject their own code in other programs. This idea sounds dangerous to me as this seems to have the potential to make perfectly stable software fragile and "buggy". Also this seems to pose security risks. Should these tools be avoided for stability or security reasons?
