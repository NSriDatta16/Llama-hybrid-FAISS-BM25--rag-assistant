Self-supervised learning refers to a really broad collection of models and algorithms. An autoencoder is a component which you could use in many different types of models -- some self-supervised, some unsupervised, and some supervised. Likewise, you can have self-supervised learning algorithms which use autoencoders, and ones which don't use autoencoders.
