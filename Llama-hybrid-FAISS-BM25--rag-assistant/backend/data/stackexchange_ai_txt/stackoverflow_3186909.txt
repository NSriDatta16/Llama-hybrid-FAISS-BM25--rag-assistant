My work environment uses Linux too. We develop mostly in Java, but it's a similar story. The company's Windows laptops are severely hobbled by anti-virus software (which is very necessary, as in a large company any security hole will eventually be exploited by viruses inadvertently dragged into the company). Our Linux boxes are locked down to the extent that we can't do major configuration changes, but no virus scanner/intrusion detector is necessary. Relative to the company standard, our Linux machines are a joy to work with! Our memory and CPU are mostly available for the tasks at hand. This setup has also proven easier and cheaper for our admins to manage.
