How do I eliminate linear dependence in a difference-in-difference model in R?

I am using panel data to try and observe the effects of Vietnamese immigration in the California Bay Counties in the 1980s. I am using R. I am regressing average weekly wages (adjusted for inflation) on the interaction between the percentage of Vietnamese in the county in 1980 with the dummy variable for after 1980 (when there is an observed wave of Vietnamese immigrants to the region). I am including county, year, and quarter fixed effects. However, using the alias() command in R, I find that I have linear dependence between my 'post' dummy variable and the year dummies starting with '1980' (the "treatment" period). I am not good with econometrics and coding, and I am sure the solution is quite obvious. If someone could please tell me what I am doing wrong and what I should do to correct this issue I would greatly appreciate it!
