From what you've shown it is difficult to determine from where comes the problem. I think you've missed some important detail. Also why in the title of your question you are talking about redirects? Both actions render the same view, there's no redirect happening here. If your code really looks like this then you definitely don't need the two actions as the first completely ignores its arguments and indeed the result should be the same. Also how are you calling those actions? Is it the same way? What's the type returned by the GetFitnessVM method? If it is string then this could be your problem.
