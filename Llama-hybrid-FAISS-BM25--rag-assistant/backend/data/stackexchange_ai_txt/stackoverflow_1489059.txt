Assuming you're not going to get into any computer vision stuff, it would be very small variations on a search of the entire problem space, i.e. trying every piece until one fits, and repeating. The major optimization would be not trying the same piece in the same place if you know it doesn't fit. Side/corner pieces make up relatively few of the pieces and probably couldn't be considered in any major optimization. The data structure would probably be something like a hash matrix, where you could quickly check if you're already tried a piece in a position. An easy optimization that includes computer vision would be to try pieces at each position after sorting pieces by how close their average color matches adjacent positions. This just off the top of my head of course.
