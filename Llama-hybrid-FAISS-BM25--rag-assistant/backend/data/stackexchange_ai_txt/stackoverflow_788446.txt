Question 1: Casting arrays doesn't work like you expect. A String is an Object, but a String array isn't an Object array. Try to use something like: public static T[] splitTop(T[] array, int index) { T[] result = Arrays.copyOfRange(array, index + 1, array.length); return result; } Question 2: For arrays of primitives my function obviously doesn't work either. There is no elegant solution to it - look at for example the Arrays library which have several copies of essentially the same method for each primitive array type.
