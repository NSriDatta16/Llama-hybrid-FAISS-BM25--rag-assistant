here's an example with 5 ways of dragging (four are commented out): * MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE * Event.ENTER_FRAME * startDrag(true) * Timer(10) which sets x = mouseX y = mouseY every 10ms * Timer(100) which creates a tween to mouseX, mouseY instead of applying values If i move the mouse fast enough all of those modes (at 30fps) look as if a sprite is chasing mouse cursor, not being dragged, and also the animation is not smooth at all. However the smoothest animation is provided by tweener, but that mode shows a bigger average distance between mouse cursor and the sprite being dragged. and btw fast dragging e.g. windows explorer also makes it blink because it doesn't have enough time for rendering at every position
