EntitySet is a result set. If tableA has a 1 to many relationship with tableB then tableA.tableB refers to the collection of results in tableB that reference the result in tableA. Table is just the table. If you drag and drop using the designer you'll see that it pluralizes the entitySets which makes things more readable. EDIT: I imagine from the sounds of your setup, you'll likely see an entitySet as follows from b in TableA select b.TableB in this case TableA is a Table, and b.TableB is the EntitySet
