I really, really want to see fixes in the camera API so that it isn't either broken (2.2.1) or forcing a switch to portrait (3.0). Apart from that, the most useful features to me are: push notifications. Great for making an app more sticky - you can let the user know that something of interest to them has happened. CoreData - I've been using a third-party SQL layer, but it's a little buggy and no longer supported. Peer-peer bluetooth, as the poster above said, is also useful for local data exchange. And the least useful? Cut and paste. I actually want to disable it in my app (to discourage people from copying content) - and it doesn't look as though you can (yet).
