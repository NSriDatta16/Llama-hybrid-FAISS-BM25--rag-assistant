No, there aren't. I wish there were. It would make life a lot easier. A categorical variable is just that: a category. It might be represented by a number but it cannot be treated like one. For example, if you have a list of cars with their colors, and the colors are denoted this way: 1 = red 2 = blue 3 = green you can't really work with them as numbers. You can't say that blue is the average color, for instance, because the average of 1 + 2 + 3 is 2. What you can do is create dummy variables, usually a 0 and 1, which then describe the category. In our example: 0 = not red 1 = red You can then create dummies for the other colors along similar lines: 0 = not blue 1 = blue and 0 = not green 1 = green This can be done across different columns to make things easier. It's all part of the mungification of data, getting it into shape so you can run an analysis.
