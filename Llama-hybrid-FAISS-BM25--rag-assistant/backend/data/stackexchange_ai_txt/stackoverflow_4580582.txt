There's a note on top of the docs : Note: The Google Web Search API has been officially deprecated as of November 1, 2010. It will continue to work as per our deprecation policy , but the number of requests you may make per day will be limited. Therefore, we encourage you to move to the new Custom Search API . The deprecation policy says that they will continue to run the API for 3 years. So if you already have an application that uses the old API, you don't have to rush to change things just yet. If you're writing a new application, use the Custom Search API . See my answer here for how to do this in Python, but the idea's the same for any language.
