There doesn't seem to be any growth here, but none the less the question can be answered. Typically, if you can write down the closed form of the posterior distribution, then that becomes your prior when you go onto condition on new data. Gelman and co-authors present a very similar model in chapter 5 of Bayesian Data Analysis known as the 8 schools model. You're free to reference their analysis to see how the marginal posterior for $\mu$ and $\tau$ can be obtained and how similar the posterior looks to your present model, suggesting how the updating can be done. If instead you wish to use something like Stan or pyMC to compute the posterior, things become a little different. Although in principle we can use the posterior as our prior in subsequent analysis, in practice it is often easier to just refit the model with all new data. No need to approximate the marginal posteriors and write a new model.
