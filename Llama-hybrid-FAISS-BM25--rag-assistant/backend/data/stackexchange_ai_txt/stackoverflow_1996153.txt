Yes and no. I've used it extensively (I work in L&D) in testing functionally and appropriateness for a corporate learning environment but finally decided against it. Some reasons: The learning curve for average instructional designers was too high. If it was meant for a dedicated half-developer/half-ISD person to somehow work in this SDK and design great e-Learning, the Vision/Scope of Semblio was way off base. It's a good product for developers - it's just that that profile of person is not particularly good at creating e-Learning/CBTs. The Education PG (the group that produces this product) has had quite a few product blotches and non-ships. This one actually made it out the door, but it isn't getting the uptake that EdPG was expecting. It's likely going to be relegated to "well, we tried but nobody wanted it" in the fight between all internal academic-focused groups (Public Sector sales, Partners-in-Learning, EdPG, Unlimited Potential, etc.) - so my guess is that support will fall away. Most important was the decision to use WPF instead of Silverlight. This not a slight against WPF, which is a fine technology, but it tells me two things: This is a Windows-platform play given that education uses Windows/Mac/Linux. WinClient Platform-Adoption products tend to fall away pretty quickly at MSFT (with the exception of Visual Studio/Expressions). 2) There will be deployment concerns of the .Net framework and the Semblio packages. On this point, it makes an assumption that most schools are running semi-sophisticated IT departments that have a good deployment server. Semblio could have just as easily been created for Silverlight and made into a true Adobe Captivate or Articulate competitor. It could have utilized an organizations existing assets, such as Office, for e-Learning creation. It was for these reasons I decided against using it.
