Matrix-based implementation for an ANN with different number of nodes per hidden layer?

Given a neural network architecture that has multiple hidden layers and a different number of nodes in each hidden layer (assuming that this is a valid architecture), is it possible to implement feed forward & back prop for such a network using matrix operations? It is clear that matrix operations can be used for feed forward updates when all hidden layers are the same size. But when hidden layers are different sizes, are you forced to iterate over layers to update them with vector operations individually?
