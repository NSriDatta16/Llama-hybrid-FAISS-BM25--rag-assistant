Extreme Values in Bayesian Regression Model

I fitted a hurdle negative binomial model using a fully parametric Bayesian regression model. This was done in R with the brms package. The outcome was count data. I am interested in a measure of "extreme values", something like the probability of observing a more extreme value than the observed one under the posterior distribution. The reason behind this is I want a probabilistic analogue to the $p$-value of a frequentist model and to assess if they reach similar conclusions. Any guidance would be appreciated, I am quite inexperienced with fitting those models and interpreting them.
