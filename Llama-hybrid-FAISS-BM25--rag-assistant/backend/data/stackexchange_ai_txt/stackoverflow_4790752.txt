Determine whether current script is running on development or production server

I've got scripts that call different URLs depending on if they're processed by my online site (release), or my offline localhost (development). I'd like to find a quick way to find which is which. I can come up with a few clunky ways to do this, but is there a definitive, fast, elegant method? Something like if(is_offline()) { ... }
