Why not scale before PCA as a default step?

In ISLR 2nd edition, it says that you may not want to scale before PCA if the features are all in the same units (below). However, I don't see the nuance. Why not just have the "default" step to scale everything to SD = 1, mean = 0, even if everything is the same units and will ultimately have no effect? Is it because of reduced interpretability? More compute power/ time wasted to scale? I'm just thinking in terms of just having 1 process that all data goes through, instead of using 2 different processes for "if data needs scaling" vs. "if data doesn't need scaling".
