ARCH and GARCH Models

I found excellent notes on ARCH and GARCH models here . On page 3 it is given that: Standard time series models: \begin{eqnarray*} Y_{t} & = & E\left(Y_{t}|\Omega_{t-1}\right)+\epsilon_{t}\\ E\left(Y_{t}|\Omega_{t-1}\right) & = & \mu_{t}\left(\theta\right)\\ E\left(Y_{t}|\Omega_{t-1}\right) & = & E\left(\epsilon_{t}^{2}|\Omega_{t-1}\right)=\sigma^{2} \end{eqnarray*} What does this $\Omega$ means here? Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks
