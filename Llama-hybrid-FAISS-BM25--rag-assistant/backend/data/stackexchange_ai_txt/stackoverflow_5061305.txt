As Robert Harvey stated, you would have to send the keys that trigger the formatting. If you are working with a word processor that allows bold, italics, underline, you could achieve the following like this: SendKeys.SendWait("^BThis is bold Text!^B^IThis is italics!^I^UThis is underlined!"); ... assuming that CTRL+B is bold, CTRL+I is italics, and CTRL+U is underline.
