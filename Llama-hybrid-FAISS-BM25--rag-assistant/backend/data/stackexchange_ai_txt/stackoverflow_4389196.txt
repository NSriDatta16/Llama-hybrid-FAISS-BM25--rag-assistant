Android touch event force closes

I have a 2d array displaying on the screen and decided to implement a method where it would detect the touch location and find the tile in which the touch is located and remove it, r more precisely, change the int at map[x][y]. I currently have a 2d map array full of 3s 15 by 15. Touch a location and this method, which i created because I could not find a way to round down numbers, would calculate the position in the array and change the value: public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { mX = (int) event.getX(); mY = (int) event.getY(); calculate(); return true; } public void calculate() { indexX = 0; indexY = 0; for (int n = 32; n It'll force close if I starting mashing the screen or dragging my finger around, but if I touch a single location one by one slowly it works fine. I assumed the method to calculate should not be in the touch event method but still am not quite sure.
