Get list item value from DragEventArgs

I'm trying to drag a listitem from a listbox onto a picture box. The list item is a persons name. The value member of the list item is the ID of the people listed. When I drop the list item onto the picture box I want to use the persons ID to query a photo and load that photo. I can't seem to access the value though, only the name text, using e.Data.GetDataPresent where e is the DragEventArgs. Could someone point me in the right direction?
