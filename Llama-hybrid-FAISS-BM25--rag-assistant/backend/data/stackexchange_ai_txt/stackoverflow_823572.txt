Either, as Barry Brown suggested, tell postfix that my-domain.com is not local by removing it from $mydestination on the postfix box, or if that's not practical, use virtual aliases in Postfix to rewrite that specific address (info@my-domain.com) to the google-hosted address you want to deliver it to. Virtual aliases in Postfix are not just for the virtual alias address class; they are a general-purpose pre-queue address rewriting mechanism. Sendmail-style aliases (depending on your distribution, either /etc/aliases or /etc/postfix/aliases) are used by the local delivery agent and only apply to the local address class. You could, of course, use sendmail-style aliases to forward mail for "info" to some-address@your-google-hosted-domain. The documentation at postfix.org is pretty good.
