First, I would like to ask you how do you know linear classifier is the best choice? Intuitively for such a large space (R^10000) it is possible that some other non-linear classifier is a better choice. I suggest you to try several different classifiers and observe the prediction errors (I would try several regularized classification models). If you run out of memory reduce the dimension using PCA
