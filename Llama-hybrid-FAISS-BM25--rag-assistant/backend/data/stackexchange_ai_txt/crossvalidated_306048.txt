Try encoding the age levels into dummy binary variables (remember to avoid the dummy variable trap) and use these variables as inputs to a logistic regression. Even if there is no linear dependency between age (as continuous) and happyness, you will still be able to capture the dependence. Another option (a straightforward one) is to use analysis of variance where you make Happy the factor and use Age as pseudo-continuous variable. The analysis will show if average Age varies significantly across being happy.
