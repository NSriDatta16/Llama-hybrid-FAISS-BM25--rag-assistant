The central limit theorem states that: "Given a population with a finite mean μ and a finite nonzero variance σ2, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution with a mean of μ and a variance of σ2/N as N, the sample size, increases." Each Example (i.e. customer) in the original dataset has an Income that is a Random Variable associated with a PDF. Each Imputation dataset samples a value from the PDF of the Random Variable Income of each Example. Therefore, 10 datasets represent 10 samples of the Random Variable Income for each Example. The average of the Income values for each Example represent the Sample Mean, for a Sample size = 10. Assuming a similar prior PDF for the Random Variable Income across Examples, the row elements of the Averaged Income represent the Sample Means from repeated (~ 300,000) Sampling experiments of Sample size 10. According to the CLT stated above the distribution of Mean converges in probability to Normal as the Sample size increases. What we observe in the graph is the distribution of the Sample mean for Sample size = 10. If we had instead 100 Imputed datasets, and therefore a Sample size = 100, the approximation of the Normal would be almost perfect.
