What is representation learning?

I am reading the Chapter-1 of the Deep Learning book , where the following appears: A wheel has a geometric shape, but its image may be complicated by shadows falling on the wheel, the sun glaring off the metal parts of the wheel, the fender of the car or an object in the foreground obscuring part of the wheel, and so on. One solution to this problem is to use ML to discover not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation to itself. This approach is called representation learning. Here, I did not understand the exact definition of representation learning. I have referred to the wikipedia page and also Quora, but no one was explaining it clearly. The lack of explanation with a proper example is lacking too. The authors cite the autoencoder as an example for a representation learning algorithm. An autoencoder is the combination of an encoder function, which converts the input data into a different representation, and a decoder function, which converts the new representation back into the original format Can someone explain in simpler terms what exactly representation learning is? [Would be much better if explained with an example. The car wheel example would do too.]
