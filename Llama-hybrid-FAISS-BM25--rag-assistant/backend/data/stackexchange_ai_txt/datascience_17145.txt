There are a lot of parameters which matter when using GPU's for machine learning, some of them are: CUDA core count Memory bandwidth (GB/s) Memory per core (MB) Raw Speed (MHz) Total Memory available (GB) Performance on 16-bit, 32-bit floating ops/sec Tim Dettmers has an excellent (frequently updated) blog where he's compared different cards, near the end he's also given a simple speed-up comparison. Using that as a guide, it can be estimated that Titan X pascal would be upto 5 times faster than a GTX 970 for Deep Learning.
