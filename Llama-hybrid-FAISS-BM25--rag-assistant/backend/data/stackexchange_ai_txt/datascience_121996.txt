why my accuracy and recall become higher in testing than training. How to interpret

Why in hidden layer 2 and 3 in neural networks scratch, the accuracy and recall I got low, but in testing the accuracy and recall become higher. In hidden layer 4 it's get weird when sampling strategy = 0.3 get higher accuracy than sampling strategy = 0.9 but have the same value in recall testing. These are the confusion matrix from hidden layer 2 and 3: with sampling strategy 0.3 = training { TN 0 FN 0 FP 13407 TP 3997} testing {'TP': 1023, 'FP': 3329, 'TN': 0, 'FN': 0} with sampling strategy 0.9 = training {TN 0 FP 0 FN 13416 TP 12022} testing {'TP': 3040, 'FP': 3320, 'TN': 0, 'FN': 0} These are confusion matrix from hidden layer 4: with sampling strategy 0.3 = training { 0 FN0 FP 13407 TP 3997} testing {'TP': 0, 'FP': 0, 'TN': 3329, 'FN': 1023} with sampling strategy 0.9 = training { TN 0 FN 0 FP 13416 TP 12022} testing {'TP': 0, 'FP': 0, 'TN': 3320, 'FN': 3040} From what I know that in hidden layer 4 the model get overfitting but I can't explain higher accuracy in sampling strategy 0.3 than sampling strategy 0.9.
