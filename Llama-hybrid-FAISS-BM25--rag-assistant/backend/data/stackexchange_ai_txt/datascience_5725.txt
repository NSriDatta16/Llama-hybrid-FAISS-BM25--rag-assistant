Datasource for regression model prediction : Machine Learning

I am trying to work using Amazon machine learning, but the data set that I have is small. The model I want to build is for regression based predictions and the domain I am aiming for the data set to belong is financial, say product price prediction, price and demand prediction based on macro/micro economic factor. I am looking for a data set that contains factors that lead to variations in value of a product or commodity. For example, I would like to predict the value of 1 unit of polyester yarn after 1 year. The factors which influence the yarn price are say - prices of crude oil, GDP of country,figures of IIP, inflation etc. So I would like a data set that contains the quotes of these factors on which the final price depends. I find difficulty assembling this data myself because I don't know all the factors that contribute to a certain predictive price. Does anyone know of a dataset I can start with that sounds like it might contain these factors?
