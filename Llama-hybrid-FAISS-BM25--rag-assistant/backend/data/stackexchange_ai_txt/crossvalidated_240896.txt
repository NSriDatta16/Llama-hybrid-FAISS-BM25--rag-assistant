As whuber pointed out in the comments, the bizzare jump simply occurred because the definition of which event is the null hypothesis, and which event is the alternative hypothesis - simply switched. By definition, the probabilities of the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis will sum to 1, so switching them will always change the result from some $x$ to $1 - x$. This begs the question, though, of why did the events switch. You state in your question: I've read that the null hypothesis has to contain the equality. Indeed there are various such guidelines like that, e.g. in this lecture : If the original claim includes equality ( =), it is the null hypothesis. If the original claim does not include equality ( ) then the null hypothesis is the complement of the original claim. The null hypothesis always includes the equal sign. The decision is based on the null hypothesis. Your question, though, shows why this guideline is sometimes meaningless. Your use of the z-score indicates a use of the normal distribution, for which the probability of attaining a specific value (e.g., 1.5) is 0. It is a completely arbitrary decision whether to calculate the probability of the result being $ So how to decide which is the null hypothesis here? As the Wikipedia entry states: The choice of the null hypothesis is associated with sparse and inconsistent advice. However, it also states the common sense advice: Routine procedure: Start from the scientific hypothesis. Translate this to a statistical alternative hypothesis and proceed: "Because Ha expresses the effect that we wish to find evidence for, we often begin with Ha and then set up H0 as the statement that the hoped-for effect is not present."[4] This advice is reversed for modeling applications where we hope not to find evidence against the null. In your particular case, the problem is: A firm producing tobacco cigarettes claims that it has discovered a new technique for curing tobacco leaves, that results in an average nicotine content of a cigarette of less than 1.5 mg. so the first alternative in your question would be the one to choose. If there would be a formalistic objection based on the equality, you could counter that, in this case, it makes no difference which alternative contained the equality.
