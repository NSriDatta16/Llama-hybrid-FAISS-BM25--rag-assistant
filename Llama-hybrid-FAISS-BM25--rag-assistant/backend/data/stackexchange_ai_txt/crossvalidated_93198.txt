You need a hold-out dataset that is representative of the actual mix of 0s and 1s. Use each model in the ensemble to predict probabilities for the holdout dataset. Then fit a meta-model, where the inputs are the predicted probabilities and the output is 0 or 1. Something like a simple logistic regression might work, but I've usually had better luck in this situation with generalized additive models. Use the predicted probabilities from your meta-model.
