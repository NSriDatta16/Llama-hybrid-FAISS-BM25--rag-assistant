Note that PCA is an unsupervised method. In most cases, when we say the data is imbalanced, we are talking about the prediction label has skewed distribution. We can run PCA on any data, even the data is not 'evenly distributed'. PCA just rotate data, and optionally, maps data into a lower dimensional space. It is not clear on what is the performance of the PCA. If we are working on data without label. A related concept is "Explained variance in PCA", if data is not evenly distributed, we may able to use less component to cover more variance. But I think that is not what you are asking for. Again PCA is an unsupervised method and is not using any information on label. So, it is possible that if you run PCA, and the classifier performance is completely destroyed (for example, a dummy feature has huge variance).
