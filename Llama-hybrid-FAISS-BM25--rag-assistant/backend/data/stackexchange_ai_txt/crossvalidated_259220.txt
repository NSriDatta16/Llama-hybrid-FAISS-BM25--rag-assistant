Interpretation of probability in geostatistics

In geostatistics, the concept of a random field is used in e.g. Kriging. Hence, at each point in your study area, there is a probability distribution. Should this probability be given a frequentistic or a Bayesian interpretation (or maybe both are possible)? I think the frequentistic interpretation of probability is difficult here (which experiment, and under which circumstances, can you (conceptually) repeat here many times?). Example: suppose you are interested in predicting the concentration of a chemical substance in the soil. I don't understand how the 'genesis' of the chemical substance at a particular point can be interpreted as a probabilistic process with a frequentistic interpretation.
