We have the same problem with certain files. CVS handles this problem very well, but unfortunately my company is moving to Subversion. Certain config files are modified by our app everytime you run it, but when the developers check in new changes, we want them to always overite the users repository. In the .CVSwrappers file, put *.fileext -k b -m COPY . This tells CVS to always make a backup copy of the file in the local repository and download the new version when there are conflicts. So elegant. There is no equivalent setup for SVN. If anyone knows how, please post it.
