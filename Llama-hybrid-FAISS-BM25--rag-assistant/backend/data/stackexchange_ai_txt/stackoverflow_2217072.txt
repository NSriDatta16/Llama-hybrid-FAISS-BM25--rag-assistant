convention to represent the exit status and actual result in XMLRPC

in the C world, a function can return error code to represent the exit status, and use INOUT/OUT parameter to carry the actual fruit of the process. when it comes to xmlrpc, no INOUT/OUT parameter, is there any best practice/conventions to represent the exit status and actual result? the context is i am trying to write an agent/daemon (python SimpleXMLRPCServer) running on the Server, and want to design the "protocol" to interact with it. any advice is appreciated. EDIT : per S.Lott's comment, make the problem more clear. it is more about os convention rather than C convention. I agree with that. the job of the agent is more or less run some cmd on the server, inherently with an exit code/result idiom .
