The issue is what sort of model structure to use (not whether a Bayesian approach could work -- a Bayesian approach works well for estimating parameters in virtually any kind of regression application). So, what sort of model? The predicted values are "ratings" so I assume they are ordinal (not metric / interval scaled). The predictor values are nominal (for room) and metric/interval (for room temperature). So an ordered probit model is a good off-the-shelf approach. Chapter 23 of DBDA2E gives examples of implementing these models in R and JAGS. Here, for example, is Figure 23.6 from DBDA2E illustrating an ordered probit model for a single metric/interval predictor: Here, from p. 683 of DBDA2E , is the JAGS model specification for the case when the predictor is nominal, with two levels: If the participants give ratings for both rooms then you have to think about a within-subjects design model...
