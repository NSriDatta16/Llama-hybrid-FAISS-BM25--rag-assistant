FormsAuthentication is stored as a cookie in the client's browser and will not use up any resources by itself. The timeout setting there does not change how long something will be kept in the server's memory or anything to do with the regular session storage. If you rely solely on the user ID/name you get from FormsAuthentication (HttpContext.User) then yes, there will probably be issues with administering user accounts like you point out. It would be a good practice to look up the actual current user data once per request.
