The Technical University of Munich recently did a survey on the question of code reuse in open source software. You can find the resulting paper here . Interested participants (of which I was one) also received a presentation with the answer numbers broken down. Here's the relevant one: Question: How many hours do you spend working on your current main project per week on average? 14%: Less than 1 hour 29%: 1-5 hours 18%: 6-10 hours 7%: 11-15 hours 5%: 16-20 hours 27%: More than 20 hours Total number of answers: 632 I can't make any statements as to the statistical validity, you'd have to dig through the paper for that, I guess.
