How to evaluate two nested neural network?

I am currently working on a classification model based on tabular dataset (dataset size is much larger than the feature size) and performing some experiments on new features. Here is some context about the problem statement: A and B are two nested shallow neural network such that A is trained on X features and B is trained on (X + x') features. Train/val/test set is same for both the models except the inclusion of feature x' for model B. I wanted to understand if this method of selecting the best model is correct: Train model A on trainA and perform validation using valA, similarly train model B using TrainB and perform validation using valB. Finally, test model A on testA and model B on test B and select the one with highest AUC score. Is there any issue with the above technique? can you point me to a direction to handle model selection for such cases. Thank you.
