A few options: Just use linear regression. The residuals probably won’t be normal, but worse things could happen. On the other hand, I suspect the estimator will be biased / attenuated, maybe inconsistent. Better minds than mine might comment on that. Use ordinal logistic regression. I don’t think you can go wrong with this. But it does throw away information—that the bins are in fact equally spaced and covering specific ranges of a numeric value. So I suspect it’ll be inefficient. Use interval regression, like intreg in Stata. The dependent variable here essentially becomes “value fell in this specific range”. This makes better use of the data than ordinal regression. The (small?) downside is that the assumption that the dependent variable is conditionally normally distributed can’t be strictly true—age can’t be negative, but that’s also a drawback of linear regression. Try them all. If they give similar results, great! In any case, this is not a classification problem.
