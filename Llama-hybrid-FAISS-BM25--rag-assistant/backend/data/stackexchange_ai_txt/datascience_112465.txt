The proper loss function for regression that prediction values do not lie on one side of the real values

I'm doing a prediction task using machine learning. First I'm doing a regression task, then I use the values to predict its class. I used MSE as loss function. However, my prediction values are generally smaller than real values. It will produce the same MSE if the prediction values are generally larger than real values. And it will produce the same MSE, if some prediction values are larger and some are smaller than real values. Apparently I prefer the last situation. Because the real values are symmetric around y=0, so the last situation will yield the same labels as real values. So I would like to know how should I set my loss function to fulfill such needs?
