request.remote_ip returns wrong ip

I have logging on my website, and i see logs for different people (with different UserAgent strings). I'm sure, that they have different ip, but all the log records having the same ip. I use request.remote_ip to store it in DB. I don't have Apache as front-end. I just have Mongrel. The question is - Why they are the same ?
