That's basically the way to do it. Comment permalinks are in the form of: node/ #comment- Where and are the node and comment IDs, respectively. You can save yourself a step by not doing calling drupal_lookup_path() -- l() or url() do it for you. The shortened routine would look like: $commentlink = l( $date, // Text of the link "node/$node->nid", // path to node, l() handles aliases array('query' => "comment/$comment->cid"), // fragment to specific comment );
