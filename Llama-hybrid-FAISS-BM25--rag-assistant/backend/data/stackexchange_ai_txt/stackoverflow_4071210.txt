The HTML audio tag does not specify any particular codec, so browser vendors are free to choose their own. Currently, none support a streaming format, although that could happen. As to recording, I'm not sure you'd really want to support unlimited recording from the browser, because you'd have concurrency issues? Would you really allow everybody to record at once? It seems to make more sense to have a limited access to recording a streaming media session on the server, and then allow archived access to that through the browser. The retrieval could be easily performed with the HTML AUDIO tag, but essentially we've just invented the podcast.
