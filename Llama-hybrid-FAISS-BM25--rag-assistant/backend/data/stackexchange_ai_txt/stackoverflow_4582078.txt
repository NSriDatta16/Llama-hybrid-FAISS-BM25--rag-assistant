The OOCSS framework doesn't solve some of the problems defined by its own principles. OOCSS still contains redundancy and by moving the composition of components into the DOM, its coupling content back to the presentation. OOCSS does make some good design decisions that should encourage users to maintain their CSS in a consistent fashion. This is a good thing. But the lack of documentation supplied with it means you'd have to reverse engineer it should it not quite fit your needs. This process wouldn't be reliable so you could end up back where you started... with messy CSS.
