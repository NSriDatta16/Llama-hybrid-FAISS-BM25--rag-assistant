We too are at a complete loss. Perhaps you could make our lives easier by: (1) posting the code (it's not that big) [forget this one, I've done it for you]. (2) tell us exactly what the correct behavior should be (desired output). (3) tell us the behavior you're getting (sample actual output). Then maybe we'll be able to do a better job. One thing I've noticed straight up: there are not 2,419,200 seconds in any month other than February (and then only in non-leap years). Similarly, no year has 364 days. I think you need to rethink how you're calculating the intervals. Assuming that your "words" version of the duration can handle a little inaccuracy, at a bare minimum you should be using the averages for those figures (taking into account that a year is 365.2425 days which should be close enough for your purposes): one year is 31,556,952 seconds. one month is 2,629,746 seconds (simple divide by 12).
