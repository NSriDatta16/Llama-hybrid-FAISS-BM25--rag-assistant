which is a Faster function

How does one go about calculating which of 2 functions is faster. Is there a way to do this conclusively in php? Is there a best practice, like do it n times then get the average, and what would that n be? p.s. I'm looking for something that doesn't require a special setup if possible. So I'm not looking for a specialized framework, more like a primitive way of getting an idea.
