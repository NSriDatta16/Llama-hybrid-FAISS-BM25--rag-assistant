OK, I will not be able to answer all your question but I will provide some thoughts a) First of all, for structured data, you have to specify if you want to predict inside your structure, or outside. So, for example, if you have a random effect year, do you want to predict for a year in your dataset, or to a new year? Same with spatial structure and so on. b) For all ML approaches such as bootstrap or CV, permutations and blocking should be done according to the answer to a), see also Roberts, David R., et al. "Cross‐validation strategies for data with temporal, spatial, hierarchical, or phylogenetic structure." Ecography 40.8 (2017): 913-929. So, if you want to see how your model performs for predicting to a year for which you have data, use a random CV, but if you want to see how it would perform in predicting to a new year use a blocked CV. c) If you could "guess" correctly the structure of your data, and use appropriate models (such as mixed models, spatial CAR structure etc.) you could in principle rely on the parametric inference of these models also outside your structure, without nonparametric methods such as a blocked CV, but some of our simulations in the Roberts paper suggest that this does not work reliably on real data, presumably because it is rare that you will guess the correct model structure. d) I don't see a use for calculating effective sample size. It's poorly defined in such a context anyway. e) Regarding model optimisation and validation: see answer a) Response to edited question: Hi Fanfoué, thanks for your clarifications - if you want to INTERPOLATE in space, you want to predict INSIDE your spatial structure, so no need for blocking in space, and if you want to predict for an average year, you can probably ignore time as well. If you are really only interested in predictions, just use a random forest or BRT with all environmental features + x,y as predictors, and a random CV to validate.
