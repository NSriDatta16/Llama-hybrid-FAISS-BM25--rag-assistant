First, make sure you have clearly defined your problem of interest, and correctly formulated your null hypothesis. Given that you research is "level of satisfaction in relation to customer service: comparative study between 2 fast foods", the null hypothesis would be "there is no different in terms of satisfaction between the 2 fast foods". Then the independent variable is the level of satisfaction. It should be a ordinal variable with different levels, which-for example-can be labelled as very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, unsatisfied, very unsatisfied. The "two fast food" is THE independent variable of interest. It can be coded as a group factor. Then other measured variables related are nested within this group factor. Last, "Gender", "Age", etc., are common covariates. Think of the ANCOVA. You can use the Cumulative-logit model . Basically, it's the logistic regression where the dependent variable has multiple ordered categories. Moreover, a more parsimonious model is the Cumulative-logit proportional odds model . The difference between these two is that the latter assumes a constant slope across all cumulative logits. This is called Proportional Odds Assumption , and of course needs to be justified. I don't use SPSS, thus cannot give any suggestions regarding coding. But if you use SAS, the PROC LOGISTIC does exactly what you want. You can specify the "link=Clogit" to fit a cumulative-logit proportional odds model. And SAS provides some tests for checking the assumption.
