As nobody more experienced with time series is answering, I will give a try. First, you should tell us clearer what is your goal---prediction or description/estimation of seasonalities. If goal is prediction, I think seasonalities should be part of the model, you should not deseasonalize first. As you have daily data, tou could find much information here . But, in all cases I would start with visualization to understand the data better. dta produced by gg_season(dta, period=7) . A subseries plot can be helpful: produced by dta %>% gg_subseries(period=7) . This plot makes it clear that the series is not stationary, it is a dip around the mid of the time period. A Seasonal decomposition made by dta %>% model(STL(pt ~ season(period=7))) %>% components() %>% autoplot() : It is interesting that the spread of the seasonal component seems to be diminishing somewhat.
