Is it possible to vary the slack of a Support Vector Machine (SVM), such that there is more slack on one side of the decision boundary than the other?

Take for example a case where you need to train a model to classify one scenario over another, where a false negative is much more costly than a false positive. Example: Credit Card Fraud Detection Is it possible to vary the softness so that it would appear like the figure below, where one side has more slack than the other? Please note that the picture is exaggerated and only used for illustration purposes only and by no means represents how a real SVM would draw the margin.
