You've got some good answers already, but a couple additional notes: If you've got uncommitted local changes, shelve will set them aside for you for later retrieval If your changeset has been pushed to another repository, then short of editing both repositories, a backout is your only option A backout allows you to make a new changeset which is the inverse of the original changeset, getting rid of the undesired changes without changing the history of the repository A rollback is normally your best option if you haven't already pushed to a remote repo since it obliterates the changeset while leaving your working copy intact Strip will get rid of a whole branch of changes, but like rollbacks it will only stay gone if you haven't pushed the changes anywhere else The same goes for cloning a repository up to a prior revision - the other tools are easier anyway
