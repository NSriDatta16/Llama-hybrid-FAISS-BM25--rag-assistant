You should not care about the Authorize attribute as that is within the asp.net mvc framework and you have to assume that the framework is already tested. You just have to worry about the dependencies. That is pretty simple, as all you need to do is create mock instances of your dependencies and then instantiate a new controller with them. Something like this: [Test] public void TestMethod() { var organisationService = MockRepository.GenerateMock (); var purchaseOrderService = MockRepository.GenerateMock (); //Setup your mocks var controller = new SomeController(organisationService, purchaseOrderService); var result = controller.Index(); //Your asserts } You do not use your ioc container to inject dependencies in your tests.
