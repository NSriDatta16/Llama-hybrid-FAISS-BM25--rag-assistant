If you are concerned with memory then investigate with e.g. "jvisualvm" in the JDK. The contents of the mail and the events needed to generate it are stored in memory. I encourage you to investigate the source code. If your application exits the JVM no more actions can be taken, but mails with errors should have been sent immediately. If this is a concern to you, then consider adding shutdown hooks to be run when the JVM is shutting down.
