To generalize, you'll need to do this in your CSS file and in the JS. You'll want to find ul#topnav li:hover{...} and clone it to something like ul#topnav li.active{...} . This is the class we will apply to the currently selected menu item. ul#topnav li.current{ background: #f00 url(topnav_current.gif) repeat-x; } From there, it will depend on exactly how your site will work. Will each Tab bring you to a new page, or will clicking a tab trigger an ajax retrieval? If you're using AJAX, you can capture the LI's click events to set a class. ( LIVE DEMO ). If you're going with a new page on every click, you will need to have JS parse the url and set the correct item's class using $(item).addClass('current');
