Does casting one of the elements in the division work for you? SELECT SUM(price+shipping_price) AS total_sales, COUNT(id) AS total_orders, AVG(price+shipping_price) AS order_total_average, (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM `order_product` INNER JOIN `order` ON ( `order`.id = order_product.order_id AND `order`.created >= '.$startTimestamp.' AND `order`.created getId().' AND `order`.fraud = 0 ) ) as total_units, CAST(SUM(price+shipping_price) AS float)/DATEDIFF('.$endTimestamp.', '.$startTimestamp.') as daily_average FROM `order` WHERE created >= '.$startTimestamp.' AND created getId().'
