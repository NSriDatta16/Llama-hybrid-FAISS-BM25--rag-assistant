Beware of cross-site scripting problems in (current) Azure Blob storage - you can call any media file from the native Silverlight media control, but I've seen a problem using (I think) the HttpRequest object - the developer wanted to have a look at the media file in order to see how big it was (they were doing something involving caching the file), and just making that request to the blob store (eg a different domain from the worker-role SL was hosted in) caused a cross-site scripting error.
