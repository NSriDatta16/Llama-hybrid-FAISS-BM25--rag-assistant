Looking at the description I will go for a ' distance based ' approach. Fist, I would produce prototypes of the six variables per country (the summarised table may be an example but there could be more than one single prototype per country). Then, in order to assign a datum to a given country, I would follow a k-nearest or similar approch. Neverthless, producing the prototypes is not necessary to use k-nearest. It only helps to characterise each country. To make a classification based on prototypes, a supervised Self Organising Map (SOM) may be a good approach but a Radial basis function Neural Network (RNN) may work as well. Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) will be an option, although they do not provide prototypes.
