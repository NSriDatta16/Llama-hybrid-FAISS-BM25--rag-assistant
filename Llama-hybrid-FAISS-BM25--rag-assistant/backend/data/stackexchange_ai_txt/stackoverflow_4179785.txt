I'm not sure what can do with code but for testing purposes I added a small icon called resolution.png that had a version in the ldpi which had the letter 'l' in it, the version for mdpi had a letter 'm' in it and the version for hdpi had the letter 'h' in it. That way you can see which version of the resources are being loaded. I test with it commented out in the layout most of the time and un-comment it when I want to investigate.
