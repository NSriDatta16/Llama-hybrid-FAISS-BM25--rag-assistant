What's the best practise if I want to fetch data from two table?

I have two tables, agent(id, name, password, ..., shop_id); shop(id, name, address, ...); Now I want to fetch the shop name for an agent, what should I do? Should I use two sequence sql queries, query($qstr); $row = $result->fetch_assoc(); foreach ($row as $key => $value) $$key = $value; $qstr = query($qstr); $row = $result->fetch_assoc(); $shop_name = $row['name']; ?> Or should I create a view for this select, CREATE VIEW f_agent AS SELECT agent.id AS id ,agent.name AS name, shop.id AS shop_id, shop.name AS shop_name FROM agent, shop WHERE agent.shop_id=shop.id; Or should I just use the sql, SELECT agent.id AS id ,agent.name AS name, shop.id AS shop_id, shop.name AS shop_name FROM agent, shop WHERE agent.shop_id=shop.id and agent.id=$id; What's the best way to do this? Thanks.
