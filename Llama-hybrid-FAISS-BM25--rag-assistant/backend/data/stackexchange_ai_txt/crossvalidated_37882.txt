I found that using the original parameters that I used to setup the problem, the moving average was performing better, but when I started playing with the parameters that defined my dynamic model I found the Kalman Filter was performing much better. Now that I have something setup to see the effects the parameters play I think I will gain a better intuition on what exactly is happening. Thank you to those who replied and sorry if my question was/is vague.
