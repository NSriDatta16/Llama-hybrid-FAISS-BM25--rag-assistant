Organization of C files

I'm used to doing all my coding in one C file. However, I'm working on a project large enough that it becomes impractical to do so. I've been #including them together but I've run into cases where I'm #including some files multiple times, etc. I've heard of .h files, but I'm not sure what their function is (or why having 2 files is better than 1). What strategies should I use for organizing my code? Is it possible to separate "public" functions from "private" ones for a particular file? This question precipitated my inquiry. The tea.h file makes no reference to the tea.c file. Does the compiler "know" that every .h file has a corresponding .c file?
