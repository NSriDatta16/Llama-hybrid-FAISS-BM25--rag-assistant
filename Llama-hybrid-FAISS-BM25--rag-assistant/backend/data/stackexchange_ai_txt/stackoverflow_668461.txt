The SQL agent job may be owned by your login, but it is not executed in that login context. It's in the SQL Agent service account context Because you have SQL Server 2005, you could use EXEC AS USER = 'mylogin' as a stored proc option. Otherwise, you have to set the database user name using the @database_user_name parameter of sp_add_jobstep . In SSMS , you can set the context. Job ownership is slighty different to setting ths, IIRC.
