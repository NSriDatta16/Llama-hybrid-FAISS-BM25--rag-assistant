My Magento Extension Install Script Will Not Run

I am trying to create an install script for my extension and for some reason it will not the install script. The extension will show up in the core_resource table, but the attributes I am trying to create will not create. I am pretty sure that the script is not even being called because I put an exit() at the beginning and the site ran just fine. Here is what I have in my config XML file. This is placed inside global -> resources path: Nie_Nie core_setup My install script is as follows: $installer = $this; $setup = new Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup('core_setup'); $installer->startSetup(); $setup->addAttribute('customer', 'nie_admin', array( 'input' => 'text', 'type' => 'text', 'backend' => '', 'visible' => 0, 'required' => 0, 'user_defined' => 1, )); $installer->endSetup(); Is there something obvious I am missing here that would be the reason the script will not run?
