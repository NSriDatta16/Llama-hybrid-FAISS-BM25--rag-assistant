overriding a method in R, using NextMethod

how dows this work in R... I am using a package (zoo 1.6-4) that defines a S3 class for time series sets. I am writing a derived class where I want to override a few methods and can't get past this one: [.zoo ! in my derived class rows are indexed by timestamp, like in zoo, but differently from zoo, I allow only POSIXct values in the index. my users will be selecting columns all of the time, while slicing series only occasionally so I want to offer obj[name] instead of obj[, name] . my objects have class c("delftfews", "zoo") . but... how do I override a method? I tried this: "[.delftfews" but I get this error: Error in rval[i, j, drop = drop., ...] : incorrect number of dimensions . I have solved by editing the source from zoo: I removed those ... , but I don't get why that works. anybody can explain what is going on here?
