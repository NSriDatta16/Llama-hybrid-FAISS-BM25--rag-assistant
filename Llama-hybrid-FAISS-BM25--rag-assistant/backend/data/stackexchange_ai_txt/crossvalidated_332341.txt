party vs randomForest: large accuracy discrepancy

I have a classification problem where the main aim is maximising classification accuracy. I am using a random forest, and would like to also use the variable importance in my analysis. For this reason, I thought it best to use cforest from the party package in R since it has been shown Strobl et al. 2007 that it gives unbiased variable importance. However, I found that it is giving +-20% less accuracy when compared to the randomForest package. To my understanding there is not much between the two implementations so I did not expect such a large difference. I also read that cforest is more aligned to ordinal dependent variables, so I was actually expecting an increase in accuracy! Can someone familiar with random forests please tell me if this is normal behaviour or if there is something else I am missing? df I also tried first learning the parameter mtry using 10 fold cross validation, but it did not make a difference. I also tried all variations of teststat and testtype mentioned in the party documentation. EDIT: I thought it might be a numerical issue, so I tried scaling the dataset first, unfortunately this didnt make a difference.
