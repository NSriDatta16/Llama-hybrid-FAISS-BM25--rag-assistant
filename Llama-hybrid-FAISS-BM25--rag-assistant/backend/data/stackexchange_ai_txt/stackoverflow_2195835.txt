Embedding dendrogram in Java

I'm looking for a library capable of drawing dendrograms of data in Java (not calculating them, I can do it by myself).. do you have any clues? Already tried to search it over Google but haven't found anything that is not stand-alone (while I need to embed the generation inside my program). Thanks!
