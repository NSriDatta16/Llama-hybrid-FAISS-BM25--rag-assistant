I believe you may safely take your "ordinal" variable as equi-interval one, like age, and do binary logistic regression with these two as the predictors ("covariates"). Or, if you want to transform your ordinal variable "optimally" nonlinearly into an interval one, you can do optimal scaling regression (CATREG) first, save the transformed predictor and then do the logistic regression.
