Forum for ASP.NET MVC site

I am buidling a new site for an organisation. I am using ASP.NET MVC. The previous site was PHP based and had a PHPBB forum. This forum opened in an IFrame, so no integration. We want a site with all functionality integrated. I thought, I probably have to write a forum myself. However there are other ASP.NET open source forums out there just like phpbb. Is there a way to integrate third-party forums cleanly into my site? Or am I better of coding it myself?
