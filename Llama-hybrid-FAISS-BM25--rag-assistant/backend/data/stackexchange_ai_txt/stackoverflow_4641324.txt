Do a SHOW CREATE TABLE and check the TABLE's encoding. Then connect to the database with that same encoding (execute a USE 'that encoding';). Now when you retrieve the serialized string unserialize() it. The return will be whatever your application passed to serialize(). Once you get here you'll need to know what encoding the strings were inserted originally (e.g. ISO-8859-1, CP1252, etc...), so you can convert it to utf-8. Now that you have your Greek, no pun intended, converted to a utf-8 string you can put it back into the database. I would highly recommend you reorganize the database to NOT use serialized strings to store data. If you are storing BLOBS in your database consider moving them out of the database and storing them on your file system. Good luck.
