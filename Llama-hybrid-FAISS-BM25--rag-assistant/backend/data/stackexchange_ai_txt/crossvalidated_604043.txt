The intervals are informed by precision of estimates of $y|x$ , so for OLS regression the estimates near the lowest and highest $x$ values are farthest away on average from all the $x$ points, and thus less precise. In the GAM case, this is somewhat ameliorated by estimation weighted towards values of $x$ local to the point being estimated, so the narrowness of the intervals follow the tightest clustering of $x$ values.
