If you look at this article , you'll see that ideally the controller sits between the model and view. So I would perhaps reorganise your dependencies somewhat (there's some disagreement about this - see below) But the answer to your question (regardless of the domain) is that you can share these private references around. Ideally they should be references to interfaces , and the implementations can change without changing the dependent classes. So (for example) you would have a Model interface, and an implementation ModelImpl , and the shared references would be of type Model . You can then substitute different implementations at a later date without affecting the majority of your code.
