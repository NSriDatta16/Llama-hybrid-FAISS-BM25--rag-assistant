Interpretation of range(n) and boolean list, one-to-one map, simpler?

#!/usr/bin/python # # Description: bitwise factorization and then trying to find # an elegant way to print numbers # Source: http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=61300#p2195422 # bug with large numbers such as 99, but main point in simplifying it # def primes(n): # all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime. s = [False]*2 + [True]*2 + [False,True]*((n-4)//2) + [False]*(n%2) i = 3; while i*i Something I am looking for, can you get TRIAL to be of the extreme simplicity below? Any such method? a=[True, False, True] b=[1,2,3] b_a # any such simple way to get it evaluated to [1,3] # above a crude way to do it in TRIAL
