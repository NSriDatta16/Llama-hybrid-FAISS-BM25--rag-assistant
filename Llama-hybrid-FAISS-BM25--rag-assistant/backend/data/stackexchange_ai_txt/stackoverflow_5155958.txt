datagrid drag and drop styling

When I enter with a dragged item into datagrid, a bold line appears over the active row of the datagrid (which is fine to show the active row), but the problem is that even after I drop the item into datagrid, that line remains there. It goes only if I enter with a new item (in which case a new line comes to the respective row again). I am using custom handler for dragdrop event for this datagrid. Could anyone let me know how to get rid of this line? Thanks.
