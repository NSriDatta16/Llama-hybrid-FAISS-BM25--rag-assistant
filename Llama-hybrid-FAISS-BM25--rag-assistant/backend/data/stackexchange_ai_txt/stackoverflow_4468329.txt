gl_Color is undeclared identifier on WebGL

I am looking at http://www.swiftless.com/tutorials/glsl/3_glcolor.html which has the following code snippet: void main() { // Set the output color of our current pixel gl_FragColor = gl_Color;} I tried to use gl_Color on my WebGL. I got an error that gl_Color is undeclared identifier. What did I do wrong? Thanks in advance for your help.
