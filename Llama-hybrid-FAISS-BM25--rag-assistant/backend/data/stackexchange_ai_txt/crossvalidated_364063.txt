A paired t-test would probably not be robust enough, given that the data are bounded at zero. You could use a mixed-effects beta regression to model proportional data that are collected over time. A way to do this with free software is the gamlss R package. The beta distribution can be used to model dependent variables that are bounded between 0 and 1, making them perfect contenders to model proportions and ratios. However, you observe zeros, so you will need what is called a zero-inflated beta regression model. This can be used by specifying the family argument in the gamlss package as BEINFO for BEta INFlated at 0. The package also has a re() and random() functions to model random effects. You could make region a predictor and allow observations to be nested within time points, for instance. You will get coefficients telling you if region is associated with the probability that there is a zero rate or an above-zero rate AND if there is any differences between regions in the average above-zero rates. The gamlss package has a well-documented website and book associated with it.
