WinGrid™ is a component of the Infragistics NetAdvantage suite. It is a hierarchical data grid control with full support for bound and unbound data display that surpasses other .NET grids on the market and shifts your data-driven WinForms app into a new realm of more productive possibilities. The Windows Forms grid supports complex data entry scenarios, row edit templates, custom layouts, rich printing and print preview, easy interop with Microsoft® Excel™ and Adobe® PDF file formats, and an almost unlimited array of look and feel options. This control also permits building more modern applications for tablets and other touch-enabled devices with the touch-supported Grid control. The Grid also features panning gesture support like vertical, fast, slow, and multi-direction panning and flicking; and multi-gesture support like tap, double tap, tap & drag, and tap & hold. If you can't find help here, the Infragistics community forum for the WinGrid would be another great resource. Ref: Infragistics | Windows Forms Controls
