It looks like something external is blocking your stream files. You could try to use Process Monitor to see what blocks it. Another thing you can try is to open the stream in read-deny-write mode (please show us how you open the stream). Something like this: Stream := TFileStream.Create(FileName, fmOpenRead or fmShareDenyWrite) ; Edit 1: Disregard the strike through part: you are using TStringStream. I'll keep the answer just in case anyone ever gets this kind of error when using TFileStream. Edit 2: Yuriy posted this interesting addendum, but I'm not sure it will work, as the BlobStream is not initialized, just like Robert Love suspected: Function TCacheInMemory.CacheCheck(cName: String; Out BlobStream: TStringStream): Boolean; Begin Result := False; Try If Not IfUseCache Then exit; BlobStream.SetSize(0); BlobStream.Size := 0; StreamValue(trim(cName), True, BlobStream); If BlobStream.Size > 0 Then Result := True; Except On E: Exception Do Begin x.xLogError('LogErrorCacheInMemory.txt', 'CheckCacheOutStream:' + E.Message + ' ItemsCount:' + IntToStr( High(fItems)) + 'Memory:' + IntToStr(x.GetMemoryInfoMemory)); End; End; End; --jeroen
