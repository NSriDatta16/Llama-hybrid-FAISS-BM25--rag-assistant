Your predictor variable/independent variable contained NA/Missing value, auto.arima does not permit missing value I think, so I excluded them. when modeling predicting problems like yours, It is always nice to check predictive accuracy of the model, so I held out last 12 months of the data. In addition, it is always best practice to compare multivariate models with univariate (without predictor variables) in time series.Based on my experience, most of the times univarite models work better thank multivariate models. So I modeled your data both as univariate and multivarite ARIMA and compared the 2 models using mean absolute error(MAE). There are other error measures you could use to compare models. The MAE for multivariate model = 9020.995 The MAE for univariate model = 11515.52 In this case multivariate model had better predictive accuracy than univariate model. Please note that this type of model is called regression with arima errors. There is another type of modeling called transfer function modeling that you could use to incorporate lead and lag effects etc., A commercial package called AUTOBOX implements this automatically. You could also try SPSS or SAS. SPSS is automatic, SAS is is not. I don't know if there is an R package for transfer function modeling.
