You are looking for the distribution of your place in the race. It's normal, see this note . So, the simplest estimator is to get the percentiles from your data set for each race and average them. That would be your estimate of your place in the next race. You can weight the ranks by $\sqrt{n_i}$, where $n_i$ is the number of runners in races, this will wight the big races heavier. Here's MATLAB example for both simple and weighted means, and your place in next race with 100 runners: a=[10 120 2 135 23 131 560 810 1 10] % unweighted mean m = mean(a(:,1)./a(:,2)) %wighted mean mw = mean((a(:,1)./a(:,2) .* sqrt(a(:,2))) / sum (sqrt(a(:,2)))) % place in 100 runners race round(mw*100,0) Output: m = 0.213015738384695 mw = 0.070342921102228 ans = 7 This is assuming that you got to popular 5K races with significant number of runners, hundreds. In small races it's hard to argue that the runners would be similar race to race. In big races such as Kormen's pink run, the runners body doesn't change much.
