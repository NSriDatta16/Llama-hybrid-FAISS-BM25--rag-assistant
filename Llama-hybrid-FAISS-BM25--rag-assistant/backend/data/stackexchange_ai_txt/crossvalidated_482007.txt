More of an extended comment than an answer: The bad news: "Non parametric" + "Small data sets" = "very bad idea" - non parametric assumes enough data that you would have a very high signal to noise ratio, and you won't have that with 8 data points. If your data is that small, go with some domain based assumptions and use them to come up with as simple a parametric model as you can get. Run away from ML models like tree based methods or SVM as far as you can. "ML" + "8 data points" = "disaster" . Interpolating from 8 data points to 45 data points is very dangerous. You are effectively introducing a strong assumption into your model to cover for the large gaps in you measurements. As long as you know what you are doing (see the first bullet point w/r domain knowledge) you're fine, but if you're just assuming that linear interpolation can fill the gaps based on the data alone, that is not a good idea. You can't use lagged values since your data is so irregular/filled with gaps. Where did you get the idea that Holt-Winters is non parametric? I disagree with that. It very much assumes a fixed "Trend + Seasonality + Level" structure, and models them with $\alpha$ , $\beta$ , and $\gamma$ , ergo it is as parametric as it gets. Holt-Winters assumes a seasonal component, but you don't have enough data for any seasonality to be captured, and it is also irregularly spaced. Even Holts method (for modeling trend only) won't work, because with only 8 data points, you won't be able to tell the level from the trend. The good news: You do seem to have a very clear upward trend in your data, just fit a growth model against time, most likely logistic growth. This allows to leverage the dates in your data. I say logistic growth and not linear growth, because your data jumps from 9033000 to 24033000 between 11/2016 and 11/2017, but then seems to slow down, and goes from 24033000 to 27533000 between 11/2017 and 11/2019.
