why did they use causal_mask instead of padding_mask in the call method? Because the first block in the decoder needs the causal masking to work, in order for the transformer not cheat (look in the future) However, I have a sense you already know this, and your question might be "why is causal masking enough?" The answer to that question is also pretty easy to think if you consider the definition of causal masking, as it says (in poor words) "mask me and everything after me", so after the EOS token, you still will mask out the padding, as it will be part of the "me and everything after me" For example, consider this sample: "SOS Hi EOS PAD PAD" Now, think about the masking: for "SOS", everything will be hided, for "hi" everything apart from SOS will be hided... what about "EOS", well itself and everything after it will be masked, so the padding will also be hided In other words, "causal masking" already includes the padding mask
