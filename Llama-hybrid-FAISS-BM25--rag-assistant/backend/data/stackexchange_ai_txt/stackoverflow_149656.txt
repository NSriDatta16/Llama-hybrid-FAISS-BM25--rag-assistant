You can configure Eclipse projects to specify Access Rules. Access rules can specify "Forbidden", "Discouraged", and "Accessible" levels all with wildcard rules. You can then configure violations of either Discouraged or Forbidden to be flagged as either warnings or errors during builds. Kind of an old article on the idea (details may be out of date): http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t53736.html If you're using Eclipse (or OSGi) plugins, then the "public" parts of the plugin/module are explicitly defined and this is part of the model.
