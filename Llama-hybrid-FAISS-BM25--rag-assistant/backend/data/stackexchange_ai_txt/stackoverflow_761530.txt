You're right in that every public method in a controller becomes a "page". That being said, it's not necessarily a web page, an action could be a post of data and then redirect to another action/page so page does not necessarily mean "web page". MVC uses a lot of conventions to make things work. For instance, every controller must end with "Controller". So a set of user pages (create, edit, delete, etc.) would be in a UserController. In the Views folder, each public method or action within the controller class becomes a web page within a folder that matches the prefix of the controller (In this case, a User folder). So an action called "Delete" within the controller class would point to the Delete.aspx page within the User folder. It seems a little awkward to put all of those methods in one class, but it does a nice job of organizing like functionalities based on your object.
