Your design of the GROUP variable troubles me. Assume variable GROUP , as an example, containing the number of visits to a physician until a therapy is initiated. In that formulation, your ID1 case has a right-censored value for GROUP . It would have been at least 5 visits, and might have been more if the event hadn't already happened. That also leads to the uncomfortable situation of having 5 different FOLLOW_UP_TIME values for the same individual. The Surv(FOLLOW_UP_TIME, EVENT) formula depends on a consistent choice of time = 0 . In this situation that might be the time from study entry or the time when therapy began, but there should only be a single time = 0 reference for each individual. The setup in the OP thus seems to be inconsistent. It seems to use the time when therapy began as the time = 0 reference for those who started therapy, but the date of study entry (first visit) for ID1 who never started therapy, at least in the first data row. That could lead to substantial bias. A modification of the counting-process Cox model with Surv(start_time, stop_time, status) proposed by Lukas Lohse would be a way to handle this, if you wanted to use the date of study entry as the time = 0 reference. You would then define a row with (start_time, stop_time, status) for each individual for each interval between visits. The status would then be the status at the end of that time interval. One way to handle the initiation of therapy would be to add an indicator of whether therapy had begun at the start of the interval to each row, as a time-varying covariate. For ID1 that indicator of therapy would always be 0; for others, it would be zero for all intervals until the one at which therapy began. Other ways to represent therapy over time might be considered. If you want to use the date of starting therapy as a reference, you could use the GROUP indicator variable to represent the number of visits before therapy was begun and the Surv(FOLLOW_UP_TIME, EVENT) Cox model form. But then you should not include individuals like ID1 who never started therapy. Your model would then be conditional upon having started therapy. I sense additional problems with the design, as the choice of when to start therapy presumably represents an estimate of current disease status. Then the number of visits prior to therapy is perhaps just a measure of how early in the disease process an individual was first seen. You should try to get some experienced local statistical advice to help work through the possible sources of bias in this study and how best to formulate and text your hypothesis.
