Coming from another language myself (not C#) to Objective C, I found I had to spend extra time "unlearning" certain things. If you intend to write apps for the iphone and ipad as your tags suggest, you will have to learn the older reference counted (non-garbage-collected) memory model for objective C. The Hillegass book, and the Apple documentation are the two best sources of information. You should pay particular attention to the allocation and reference-counting "rules" advocated by Apple. This creates a "design contract" between you and the framework that you MUST observe. See this: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html
