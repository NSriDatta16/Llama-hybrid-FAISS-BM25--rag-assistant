Uploading to a Remote Server

I am working on a website, using PHP/MySQL, where users can upload videos, then, those videos are converted (using FFMPEG) to FLV and MP4 files. Now, the whole 'upload' and 'conversion' process takes place on a different (remote) server that is actually being hosted by a different provider. The reason I am using a different hosting location is because they offer more storage and the conversion features. My question is this: How (or what is the best way) that I can upload files to my 'video hosting site' from the main website where the users primarily interact? Additionally, when videos are uploaded, information is added to the database as well (Video Title, Description, etc), so how would I enter this info into the database? From the remote location or the main site? Also, how can I do this securely? Meaning, someone cannot just 'browse' to the video site and randomly upload a file. Or, if someone has a completely different, constructive recommendation, I'd much appreciate that as well. Many thanks!
