See SD Source Code Search Engine . This breaks source code into fragments corresponding to the elements of each language (keywords, identifiers, strings, constants, numbers, operators). You can formulated searches restricted to just one type (of code) file, to a particular set of files, to identifiers matching foo across all files, setc. The Search Engine pre-indexes the code to enable searches across thousands of files far faster than grep, It shows you hits in one GUI window, and the complete source code of a selected hit in another. You can launch your editor on the source code.
