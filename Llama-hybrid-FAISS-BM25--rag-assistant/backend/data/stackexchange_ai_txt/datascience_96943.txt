T-SNE with high number of features

If we have high number of features (more than 50), should we use T-SNE ? According to https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html : It is highly recommended to use another dimensionality reduction method (e.g. PCA for dense data or TruncatedSVD for sparse data) to reduce the number of dimensions to a reasonable amount (e.g. 50) if the number of features is very high. This will suppress some noise and speed up the computation of pairwise distances between samples It seems that if we have more than 50 features, it is better to work with PCA and not with T-SNE , Did I understand it correctly ? Why T-SNE is not good with high number of features ? Why the document suggest to work with PCA and not with other dimension-reduction (like UMAP ) ?
