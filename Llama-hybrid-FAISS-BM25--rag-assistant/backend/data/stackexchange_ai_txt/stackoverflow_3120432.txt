So, I think this is a bug in 4.0 or something, as I tried everything. The workaround is this though: ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(this, this.GetType(), "redirectFixOrg", string.Format("document.location = '{0}?orgID={1}'", this.ResolveClientUrl("~/pages/admin/addNewPopup.aspx"), this.OrganizationID), true); This worked for me but I dont know why response.redirect is not working. Thanks!
