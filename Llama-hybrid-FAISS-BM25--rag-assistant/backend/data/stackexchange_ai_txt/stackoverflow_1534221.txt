I've used the Net Beans profiler which uses the same underpinnings as Visual VM. I was working with an older version of Weblogic, which meant using the 1.5 JVM, so I couldn't do a dynamic attach. The application I was profiling had several thousand classes and my workstation was pretty much unusable while the profiler instrumented them all. Once instrumentation was complete, the system was sluggish but not completely unusable. The amount of slowdown really depends on what you need to capture. The basic CPU metrics are pretty light weight. Profiling memory allocation slows things down a lot. I would not use it on a production system. Aside from the potential for slowdown, I eventually ran out of PermGen space because the profiler reinstruments and reloads classes when you change settings. (This may be fixed in the 1.6 agent, I don't know)
