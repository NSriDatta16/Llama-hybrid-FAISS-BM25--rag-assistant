The canonical Good Way to recover a corrupt database is to dump it out as SQL and then read it back in to a new database. It's dead easy with the sqlite tool: sqlite in.db .dump | sqlite out.db ...but, of course, you need to do it in code, and I really don't know if .dump is available from anywhere. I'd suggest that you possibly want to look in to how it's getting corrupted in the first place --- SQLite has always been rock solid for me, although I've only ever used it on the internal storage. Can you check the FAT filesystem to see whether it's corrupt? I've seen, e.g., digital cameras which will thoroughly mangle filesystem on cards in various obscure ways...
