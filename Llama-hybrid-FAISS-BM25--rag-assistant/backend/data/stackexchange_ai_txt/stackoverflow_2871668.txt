lyx problem: ps, pdf "Authors not shown"

I'm trying to write a paper based on VLDB .cls and .tex files, it can be reached from here .It uses ACM SIG Proceedings Style.After fixing many errors, now i don't get any errors, However when i save my file as pdf or ps,i can not see the author names. The title and abstract are shown just not the code between these is not shown. i'm using lyx on Ubuntu. Here is the code for the authors. % ****************** TITLE **************************************** \title{A Sample {\ttlit VLDB} Proceedings Paper in LaTeX Format\titlenote{for use with vldb.cls}} \subtitle{[Extended Abstract] \titlenote{A full version of this paper is available as\textit{Author's Guide to Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX} at \texttt{www.acm.org/eaddress.htm}}} % ****************** AUTHORS ************************************** % You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement % and alignment' of the authors beneath the title. % % For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time' % i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title. % % NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of % "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict % the number of 'columns' to three. % % Because of the available 'opening page real-estate' % we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors % (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title. % More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed. % % Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names % and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors. % Add names, affiliations, addresses for % the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the % \additionalauthors command. % These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you % without further effort on your part as the last section in % the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices. \numberofauthors{8} % in this sample file, there are a *total* % of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting % reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section. \author{ % You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here, % e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three % and a second row of one, two or three). % % The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should % precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and % e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of % affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the % e-mail address with \email. % % 1st. author \alignauthor Ben Trovato\titlenote{Dr.~Trovato insisted his name be first.}\\ \affaddr{Institute for Clarity in Documentation}\\ \affaddr{1932 Wallamaloo Lane}\\ \affaddr{Wallamaloo, New Zealand}\\ \email{trovato@corporation.com} % 2nd. author \alignauthor G.K.M.

EDIT WHILE converting from .lyx to pdf or dvi i still don't see the authors however, by using shell commands everthing is fine. i think this is a problem of lyx, i spend 8 hours to solve it, seriously i set up windows 7 lyx and tried there, still same. thanks lyx:) You are good when you are working properly.
