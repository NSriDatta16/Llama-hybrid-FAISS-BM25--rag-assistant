Are the statements "normally distributed with same mean and variance" and "identically normally distributed" equivalent?

According to Rohatgi & Saleh [1], random variables X and Y are said to be identically distributed if they have the same distribution function, i.e. $F_X$(x) = $F_Y$(y). Moreover, the distribution function of a normal random variable is given by $F_X$(x) = $\frac{1}{σ\sqrt{2π}}\int_{-\infty}^xe^{-(x'-μ)^2/2σ^2}dx'$ [2] i.e. it is a function of only μ and σ². Therefore, I would assume that the statements "normally distributed with the same unconditional mean μ and unconditional variance σ²" and "identically normally distributed" are equivalent. Yet, wouldn't the following setting be a counterexample to above conclusion? Let $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ and $Y_1$, ..., $Y_n$ be normally distributed random variables with same unconditional mean and unconditional variance. According to above statement, they are also identically distributed. However, wouldn't it still be possible that there is conditional heteroscedasticity, i.e. the conditional variance of ${Y_i}$ given ${X_i}$, changes with i? And wouldn't conditional heteroscedasticity contradict the statement that $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ and $Y_1$, ..., $Y_n$ are identically distributed?
