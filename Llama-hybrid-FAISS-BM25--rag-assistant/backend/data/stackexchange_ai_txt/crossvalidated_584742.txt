Does dimension reduction in more than 2 (or 3) dimension make sense?

I'm using dimension reduction for data analysis (pca, tsne, umap...). Most examples I see project data in only 2 (or 3) dimensions, but I would naively imagine that by projecting in more dimension and visualize those dimensions 2 by 2 on multiple plots I could see more sub-characteristics of the data. For example, if I have a dataset of cats and dogs data, and that after projecting it in 2dim I see mainly two cluster corresponding two the two species: is there a chance that if I project my data in 4 dimension and plot 2 graph (one with embeddings dimensions 1 and 2 and the other with dimensions 3 and 4) I would be able to see 2 clusters corresponding to cat and dogs on first graph and clusters corresponding to dog sub-species (like Labrador and bulldogs) on the second graph ? So in other words, is it worth projecting my data in more than 3 dimensions with those kind of algorithms ?
