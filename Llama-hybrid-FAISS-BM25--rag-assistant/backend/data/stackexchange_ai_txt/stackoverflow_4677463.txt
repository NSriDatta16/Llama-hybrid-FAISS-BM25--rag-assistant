At the risk of being accused of not answering your question properly, why don't you use JQuery to solve this problem? You can not only reduce the code to just a few lines, but it will work in all browsers: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/ There are examples here of a mouseover/mouseout working exactly as you describe. My suggestion is to learn JQuery as it will save you a lot of time beating your head against the trials of working with raw JavaScript. I also want to point out that alt attributes typically hold text to be displayed in the event that your images don't load or a user agent is loading your page that doesn't render images. I also understand that it has SEO benefits when text on images cannot be scanned by the Google Bot. As for your question, I don't see the following functions, rollOutChild and rollOverChild, defined: thisImage.parentNode.onblur = rollOutChild; thisImage.parentNode.onfocus = rollOverChild;
