Model Comparison for Weighted Network

I have a weighted network data and I want to know whether this network possesses small-world features or the features of a scale-free network. I know for unweighted networks, I can create comparable small world networks and scale-free networks (same number of nodes and similar number of edges) via igraph and then compare clustering coefficients and average path lengths. However, I wonder for a weighted network, can I create comparable weighted small-world and scale-free networks? Thanks!
