Do periods count as numerics (COBOL)

I am working on a bit of code at home and that is suppose to find and identify errors is a input file. I got it just about right, but two little errors are hitting me. The major problem though is this. I have to make a code that identifies "3077.B22" as an error because the first 5 columns are suppose to be numeric, but my current code is letting it pass. It hits every thing else though so I have to believe that it is seeing the period as a decimal point. Here is what I got that concerns to this part. 01 PART-NUMBER-CHECK. 05 P-N-NUM-1 PIC X(5). 05 P-N-LETTER PIC X. 05 P-N-NUM-2 PIC XX. 300-VALIDATE-PART-NUMBER. MOVE 'NO' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH MOVE PART-NUMBER TO PART-NUMBER-CHECK EVALUATE P-N-NUM-1 WHEN 00001 THRU 99999 CONTINUE WHEN OTHER MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH END-EVALUATE IF P-N-LETTER IS NUMERIC MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH END-IF IF P-N-LETTER IS ALPHABETIC-LOWER MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH END-IF IF P-N-NUM-2 IS ALPHABETIC MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH END-IF IF (P-N-NUM-2 > 00 AND 77 AND My second problem is similar cause it is seeing an * in another field as a alphabetic. Here is the paragraph to that: 340-VALIDATE-INITIAL. MOVE 'NO' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH INSPECT INITIALS TALLYING I-CHECK FOR ALL SPACES IF I-CHECK > 0 MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH MOVE 0 TO I-CHECK END-IF IF INITIALS IS NUMERIC MOVE 'YES' TO FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH END-IF IF FIELD-ERROR-SWITCH = 'YES' MOVE 'YES' TO RECORD-ERROR-SWITCH MOVE 'Initials' TO FIELD-NAME MOVE INITIALS TO FIELD-VALUE PERFORM 400-WRITE-DETAIL-LINE END-IF. Please help, I am done as soon as I get over this little bump in the road.
