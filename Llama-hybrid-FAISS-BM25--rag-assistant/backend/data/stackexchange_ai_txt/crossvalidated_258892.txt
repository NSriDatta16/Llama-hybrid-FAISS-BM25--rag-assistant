Yes, feature standardization changes the result of PCA. Yet if you do not standardize, the feature with the highest variance will dominate your dataset. The absolute variance depends on scaling or units of measurements. Therefore standardization is allowing us to compare feature relevance independent of scale (in case of z-standardization, where the resulting variance is 1 and the mean is 0). Further details are to be found in these questions and answers: Why do we need to normalize data before analysis PCA on correlation or covariance?
