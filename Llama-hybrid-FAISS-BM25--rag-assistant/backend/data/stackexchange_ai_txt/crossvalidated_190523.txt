Regression and Time Series

I was posed a problem by a colleague that i am struggling with. He is interested in the relationship between 10 variables and a single dependent, continuous variable. This could simply be an OLS problem; however, he also wants to relate it to time. He has a hypothesis that the relationship between the 10 variables and the dependent variable change over a 7 year period. What model should I be looking into to help him answer his question? [EDIT] The independent variables are measures of a company structure (board size, etc.) and the dependent is firm value (eg shareholder return). By design these would have a level of autocorrelation I believe. If it were cross-sectional (ie a single year) an OLS seems like the appropriate approach. I am looking for the change in relationship over subsequent years. To add a wrinkle we are also trying to control for firm size.
