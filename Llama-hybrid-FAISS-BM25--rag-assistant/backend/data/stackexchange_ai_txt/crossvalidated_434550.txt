Kruskal Wallis test gives significance, multiple comparision table doesn't

I'm comparing physico-chemical properties of 8 different kefir samples like viscosity at different storage times. I have 4 viscosity measurements for each group. When I conduct Kruskal Wallis test; according to the test statics p value is smaller than 0,05. So there is a difference at least between two groups.But when I conduct post hoc test(Tamhane or Dunnet) there's not a significant difference between any groups as I read from the multiple comparision table. And also when standard error is zero there's no value for significance, which is shown with ' - '. How can I investigate which groups have a significant difference as it's reported at Kruskal Wallis? as an example: kefir/Mean Difference/ Std. Error /Sig. AC1/-,6500/ ,0500/,754 AC2/-,6000/ ,0000/ -
