Table with name and hash does not define an authentication scheme, it just defines a storage for the credentials. Authentication involves a protocol for the user to proove it's identity, like Kerberos or HTTP Digest. Organizations that deploy ldap don't, t deploy it for auth per se, they use Kerberos for that. Ldap is used for things like user organisatinal structure management (OU) or asset inventory. Once you deployed Kerberos for authentication and autheization it makes sense to use LDAP as your organization structure store, since most kern implementation will create an ldap anyway, eg. NT domain controllers.
