You ought to be able to use - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; See this question for more info. EDIT: That should help you handle the shake. If you're still needing help with basic things like incrementing counters and updating the UI, I'd recommend the Pragmatic Programmers' iPhone SDK Development book.
