No, the learning rate is not taken into consideration when deriving feature importance in XGBoost. The feature importance is calculated based on the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees, regardless of the learning rate. The learning rate in XGBoost is used to control the contribution of each new tree added to the model, but it does not affect the calculation of feature importance.
