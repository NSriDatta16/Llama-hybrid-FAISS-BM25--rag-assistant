As long as enterprises exist, they will have integration needs, systems will always have to talk. SOA seems to be a wise way to address such distributed issues. But unfortunately, it ignores performance concerns. To propose one possible solution, I have published an article on 'Fluid Services' to harness parallelism between clients and servers by using stream-oriented communication as an alternative to message-oriented communication. This article on SOA Maganizine describes the concept: http://www.soamag.com/I41/0710-2.php This is a more practical article that also includes sample WCF code on CodeProject: 'An Experiment on Fluid Services for Highly Responsive, Scalable and Reusable SOA Services' (Sorry, can't put the link)
