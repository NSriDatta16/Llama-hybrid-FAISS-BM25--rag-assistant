As for me C# is valuable not because of language but more of a framework you can use with it. So in that sense PHP is totally different from C#. I've been working in PHP for some time and then moved to C# and ASP.NET. And now there is no way someone can drag me to PHP again. I would prefer looking for another job rather that working in PHP. Nothing personal, and possibly I am too dependent on IDE but I won't trade Visual Studio's IntelliSense, C#'s strong typing and a lot of other features I love about .NET in general.
