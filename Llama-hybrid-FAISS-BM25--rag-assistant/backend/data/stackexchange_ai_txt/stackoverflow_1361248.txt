OK, I'll take a wild guess. I think the factor needed for success is "can it do Java's job?". The real thing that Java does is static typing. While this is annoying for small programs it allows the construction of large stable systems. It allows refactoring with confidence. Think about it: every language has kind of a maximum size program that it supports. To go over that size requires increasingly above-average design and implementation. As a secondary consideration, Java is quite fast and has a rather complete library. So, I'm guessing those are the criteria, and so Scala has a chance. The only negative is the difficulty of running cheap shared server web hosts with the JVM.
