This may not be what you're looking for, but you could embed a scripting language in your application, such as Lua. Lua was designed to be embedded in other programs and used as a scripting language for writing plugins. I believe it's fairly easy to add the Lua interpreter to your program, though I don't know Lua so I can't vouch for how effective of a solution this would be. Others with more experience with Lua, please add comments about your experience with embedding Lua in another application. This would, of course, mean that your plugins need to be written in Lua. If you don't like Lua then the de-facto standard Perl, Python and Ruby interpreters are all written in C, and can be embedded in a C program. I know of a number of programs that use these languages as scripting language extensions. However, I don't know what you're looking for, as your question is a little vague. Perhaps more information about what you want people to be able to do with said plugins would be appropriate. For some tasks, a full-blown scripting language may be a bit overkill.
