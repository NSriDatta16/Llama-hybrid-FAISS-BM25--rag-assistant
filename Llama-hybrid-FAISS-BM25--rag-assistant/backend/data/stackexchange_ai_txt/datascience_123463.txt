chainlit test failed

I am using windows OS. I created a folder named ABC under C. In command prompt, I typed cd C:\ABC and then typed the following commands: pip install huggingface_hub pip install transformers pip install langchain pip install chainlit The above commands completed with success (or at least it seems so.) Then I typed chainlit hello to test the installation. I get the error 'chainlit' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I added the path C:\ABC to "PATH" my environment variables, both for system and user. I still face the same problem. How can I resolve it?
