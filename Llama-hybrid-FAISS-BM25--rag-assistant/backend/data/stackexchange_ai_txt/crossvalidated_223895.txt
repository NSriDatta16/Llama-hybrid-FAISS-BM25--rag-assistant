a question about solving logistic regression

While studying the slides [Link] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/rdwzjjah9f2mb2j/Logistic%20Regression%20to%20ILRS.pdf?dl=0 ) on logistic regression, I faced a question. In slide 15 and 16 it is stated that "To maximize L(β), we set the ﬁrst order partial derivatives of L(β) to zero". When the derivative of L(β) is zero, the corresponding data point can either maximize or minimize the value of L(β). More precisely, the derivative to be zero is only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a data point to maximize the value of L(β) . How can we guarantee that they have the maximal instead of the minimal value? I will be grateful if you can provide me with some guidance.
