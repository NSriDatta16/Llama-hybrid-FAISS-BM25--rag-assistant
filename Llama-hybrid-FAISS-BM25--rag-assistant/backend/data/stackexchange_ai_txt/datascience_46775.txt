methodologies for ML algorithms audit

Is there any good reference for methodologies on quality assessment of machine learning algorithms design. The scope is wide and embraces each steps from data preparation to generalisability testing. Further, are there any automated "stress-test tools" for ensuring that the algorithms is not biased, that it fits the alledged performances?
