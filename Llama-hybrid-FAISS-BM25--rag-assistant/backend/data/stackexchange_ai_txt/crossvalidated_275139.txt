Is one-vs-all logit or multionomial logit regression more accurate?

What is advice of when to use one-vs-all logit or multinomial logit regressions? Most importantly, which one has a higher prediction power? Can one test hypothesis and estimate confidence intervals in one-vs-all approach? I came from economics and I have just recently started to dive into Machine Learning. I noticed that they use different approaches to estimate discrete choice models. However, I could not find any paper or website where somebody would compare those two approaches. I found this, but it does not answer the question of prediction power: Multinomial logistic regression vs one-vs-rest binary logistic regression
