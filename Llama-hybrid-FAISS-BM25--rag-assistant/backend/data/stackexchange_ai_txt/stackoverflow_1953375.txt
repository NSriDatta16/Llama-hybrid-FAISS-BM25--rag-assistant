Pragmatically, no there's not. If your server is adequately protected (i.e. behind a firewall, appropriate file permissions assigned to tomcat install directory, tomcat process not running as root/Administrator, you control what is deployed, etc.) then it's not. But if the answer to more than 1 of these questions is no, then you should do what it takes to make the answer yes to as many as you can (which is often easier) or configure and activate the security manager (which is a huge pain).
