I'm a junior employee, but my job title is "data scientist." I think Bitwise's answer is an apt description of what I was hired to do, but I'd like to add one more point based on my day-to-day experience at work: $$\text{Data Science} \neq \text{Statistics},$$ $$\text{Statistics} \in \text{Data Science}.$$ Science is a process of inquiry. When data is the means by which that inquiry is made, data science is happening. It doesn't mean that everyone who experiments or does research with data is necessarily a data scientist, in the same way that not everyone who experiments or does research with wiring is necessarily an electrical engineer. But it does mean that one can acquire enough training to become a professional "data inquirer," in the same way that one can acquire enough training to become a professional electrician. That training is more or less comprised of the points in Bitwise's answer, of which statistics is a component but not the entirety. Piotr's answer is also a nice summary of all the things I need to do wish I knew how to do in a given week. My job so far has mostly been helping to undo the damage done by former employees who belonged to the "Danger Zone" component of the Venn diagram.
