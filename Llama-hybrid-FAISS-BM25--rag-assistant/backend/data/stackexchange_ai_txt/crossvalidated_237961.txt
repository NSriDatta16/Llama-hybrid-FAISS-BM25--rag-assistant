Should we always do CV?

My question: should I do CV even for a relatively large data set? I have a relatively large data set and I will apply a machine learning algorithm to the data set. Since my PC is not fast, the CV (and grid search) takes sometimes too long time. In particular a SVM never ends because of lots of tuning parameters. Thus if I do a CV, then I need to pick a relatively small data. On the other hand the validation set should be also large, so I think that it is a good idea to use a validation set which has the same (or larger) size as the training set. (Namely instead of CV I use a large validation set for parameter tuning.) So I have now at least two options. do CV on a small data set. use relatively large training set and validation set without CV. other idea. What is the best idea? Theoretical or practical opinions are both welcome.
