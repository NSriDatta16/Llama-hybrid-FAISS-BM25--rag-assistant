Considering you have a number of features and you are looking to understand how the features affect the price, one straightforward way of doing this would be a regression method, with the following parameters... Latitude (continuous) Longitude (continuous) City (factor, encoded) State (factor, encoded) Number of bedrooms (factor) Number of bathrooms (factor) Year built (factor) Original price/price during year of building (continuous) These data would be organized (after being factorized, probably in R or Python) in a matrix, $X$ such that the rows correspond to observations (individual homes) and the columns correspond to the factors above. The $y$ vector would be made of the current home value . You may consider leaving out the city variables and focusing on longitude and latitude as a proxy for location. State could be enlightening, as taxes and home prices across state lines can vary dramatically. You could run a regression-based method (maybe not standard linear regression, but a derivative thereof), the coefficient values of which would tell you how each factor relates to the price movement.
