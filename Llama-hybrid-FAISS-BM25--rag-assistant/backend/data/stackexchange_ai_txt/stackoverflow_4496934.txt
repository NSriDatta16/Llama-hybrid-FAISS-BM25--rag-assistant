The more complicated the project, the LESS likely you'll want to just upgrade and continue as is. .Net provides so many more features than VB6 did, and while sure, it'll basically run vb6 code, there's no point in upgrading to .net if you're not actually going to USE .net and its features. If the app is as messy as you say, converting to .net is a great time to both redesign to remove old inefficiencies and logical goofiness, and leverage the new things you're allowed in .net. Even if it's not a TOTAL redesign, at least thinking about the app in terms of .net will improve it. Unless the application is trivial in size/complexity, redo it. And if the app isn't large or complres... redo it :)
