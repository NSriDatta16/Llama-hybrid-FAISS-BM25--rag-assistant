Correlation is a dimensionless quantity that is derived from the ratio of the covariance to individual variances; it gives the effect relative to the individual variations, not the absolute effect. The slope given in regression, on the other hand, is in terms of the units of the variables, and represents the absolute effect. If an increase of one unit of $X_1$ consistently increase $Y_1$ by .0001, while an increase of one unit of $X_2$ inconsistently increases $Y_2$ by 10 on average, the correlation in the first case is 1 but the effect size is tiny, while the correlation in the second case is small but the effect size is large. Hence, correlation is not a good tool to quantify the effect of $X$ on $Y$ , unless you are interested in consistency more than magnitude.
