Honestly, if its just a single reference or a handful, just add an explicit reference somewhere it will save you a lot of effort. //Use a static constructor somewhere appropriate. static someClass(){ new AssemblyYouCareAbout.Object(); } The alternatives are along the lines of hauling dlls manually to the bin of your running process or to add the dlls to the gac. I'd rather use the not-so-elegant static constructor and move on.
