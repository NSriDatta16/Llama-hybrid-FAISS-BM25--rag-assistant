The C++ standard says nothing about how specific signals must be handled - many implementations may not support SIGINT , etc. Destructors will not be called if exit() or abort() or terminate() are called. Edit: I've just had a quick search through the C++ Standard and I can't find anything that specifies how signals interact with object lifetimes - perhaps someone with better standards-fu than me could find something? Further edit: While answering another question, I found this in the Standard: On exit from a scope (however accomplished), destructors (12.4) are called for all constructed objects with automatic storage duration (3.7.2) (named objects or temporaries) that are declared in that scope, in the reverse order of their declaration. So it seems that destructors must be called on receipt of a signal.
