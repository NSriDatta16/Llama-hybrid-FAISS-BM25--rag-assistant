ASP.NET, JQuery - Sharing regular expressions

If you have a fair number of regular expressions used by both client (javascript) and server side code (C#, vb.net) and want to store them in one place to avoid duplication, where do you store them? I could use registerscript and write out the regex as strings, but just wondering if there is something more elegant.
