Based on my experience, premature optimization is most always "premature".. That is to say you should profile your code and determine whether or not there is a need for optimization or you are just creating more work for yourself in the long run. Also, it seems to me that the questions as to whether the optimization is worth it or not depends a lot on the size of the Bamboo class and the average number of Bamboo objects per Panda.
