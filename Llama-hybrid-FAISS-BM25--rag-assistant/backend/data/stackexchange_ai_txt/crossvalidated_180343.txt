Based on the data you provided let's see what the model you described above does. Note that the sample of data is very small and I can't get any statistically significant coefficients, but I'll ignore that (in this case) when I try to interpret the model's output. dt = read.table(text = "student sex age testScore education ageGroup 1 1 10 0.12 1 1 2 1 8 0.08 1 1 3 2 16 0.85 0 3 4 2 20 0.12 0 3 5 1 22 1.02 0 4 6 2 18 0.98 1 3 7 1 19 0.46 1 3 8 1 16 0.83 0 3 9 2 12 0.26 1 2 10 2 14 0.46 0 2", header=T) # create factor variables dt$ageGroup = as.factor(dt$ageGroup) dt$education = as.factor(dt$education) summary(glm(education ~ testScore+sex+ageGroup, data = dt, family = binomial())) # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) 19.2260 4612.1501 0.004 0.997 # testScore 0.3885 2.9652 0.131 0.896 # sex -0.6988 1.8748 -0.373 0.709 # ageGroup2 -17.9683 4612.1504 -0.004 0.997 # ageGroup3 -18.7778 4612.1502 -0.004 0.997 # ageGroup4 -37.4896 7988.5385 -0.005 0.996 You can see that ageGroup1 is missing because it's the baseline for comparions with the other groups. So, you can interpret the output as "when sex and testScore remain the same, ageGroup1 is correlated with a higher probability of having education = 1 , then it's ageGroup2, then 3 and 4". This is easy if you compare the coefficients. Eg. -17.9683 is the difference between ageGroup 2 and 1, so 1 is better than 2. However, this is not what you want. You said "investigate the relation between the education and test score for each of the age groups". To put that in a more statistical perspective, or in terms of how the model understands that investigation, this is the same as "within each age group is there evidence of a true (statistically significant) relationship between testScore and education ? Is it positive or negative?" The easiest way is to create a model for each ageGroup . As an example I'm considering ageGroup 3. summary(glm(education ~ testScore, data = dt[dt$ageGroup==3,], family = binomial())) # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) -1.246 2.294 -0.543 0.587 # testScore 1.268 3.085 0.411 0.681 So, within that group testScore is positively correlated with the probability of having education = 1 . For 1 unit increase in testScore the odds of having education = 1 increase by 255% {As exp(1.268) = 3.55}. Let me know if you have more questions and I can update my answer to be more clear. I'd suggest you spend some time on interpreting logistic regression coefficients of a continuous, or categorical, variable.
