prove has a very different set of command line arguments than perl, being a completely different program? prove's -M is, I believe, intended for enabling pragmas; Carp actually exports a forward reference to a verbose() subroutine, which interferes with prove's inner workings. You can create a small module like this: # Verbme.pm use Carp; $Carp::Verbose = 1; and enable it from prove: prove -MVerbme -v foo.pl though.
