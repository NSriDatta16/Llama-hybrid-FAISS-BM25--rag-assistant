How to make a dragging UIView decelerating?

I have a UIView that can be dragged with the finger which I've implemented by using a UIPanGestureRecognizer. This allows me to drag a view horizontally ; left or right. I make my view moving while receiving the following state from the UIPanGestureRecognizer (using the translationInView: method): UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged What happens for now, is the view stops moving as soon as the finger leaves the surface of the screen, which renders a non natural effect. What I would like, would be that the dragging view decelerates starting from the state UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded by stopping smoothly. Such a behavior is used by UIScrollView class and subclasses (UIWebView, UITableView, etc.). I've tried severals approaches by calculating from the velocity, the time the touch occurred and stopped a stop distance, etc. But honestly I have a feeling of going nowhere to get a natural behavior. I even tried to use physics engine like Chipmunk. But I find this to complicated for what I try to achieve, and I'm pretty sure there should be a better (if not easier) solution. Thanks a lot!
