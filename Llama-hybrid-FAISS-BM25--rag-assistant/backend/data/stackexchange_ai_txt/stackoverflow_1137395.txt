Best Linux variant for a Ruby on Rails app?

I'm interested in setting up my own website-based game (PBBG) as a hobby. Traffic shouldn't be too much, a couple of dozen users at a time on average. From all the reviews I've seen, Ruby on Rails is the best way to go as far as coding and platform. As far as OS goes, I've only used Ubuntu in the past and, while it worked smoothly, I didn't feel very comfortable in it. Is there a recommended version of Linux for a RonR app?
