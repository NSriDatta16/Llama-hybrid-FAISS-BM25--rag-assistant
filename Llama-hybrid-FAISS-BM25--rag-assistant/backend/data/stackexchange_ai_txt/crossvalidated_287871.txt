Q1: I'd think a bit harder about exactly how you might want to predict $y_1, y_2, y_3$. If you're only interested in the one with the highest value, you might re-code the independent variables into a single outcome column, where the value is Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3, depending on which of your $y$ is highest in each observations. Some pseudo-code: if max($y_1,y_2,y_3$) = $y_1$, then Outcome = Group 1... Afterwards, you can use any multivariate linear model and task it on fitting a model to your new outcome variable. Q2: You have two major options: feature selection and signal extraction. I'm a fan of feature selection with random forests, but many methods are capable of generating variable importances with supervised and unsupervised approaches. For signal extraction, you might use PLS, PCA, ICA, etc.
