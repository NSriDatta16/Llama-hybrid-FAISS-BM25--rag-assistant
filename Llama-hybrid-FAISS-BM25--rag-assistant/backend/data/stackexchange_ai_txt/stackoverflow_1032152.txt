Unmarshalling collections in JaxB

suppose I have this class: public class A { private HashMap map; @XmlElement private void setB(ArrayList col) { ... } private ArrayList getB() { ... } } When trying to unmarshall an xml document to this class using JaxB I notice that instead of calling the setB() method and sending me the list of B instances JaxB actually calls the getB() and adds the B instances to the returned list. Why? The reason I want the setter to be called is that the list is actually just a temporary storage from which I want to build the map field, so I thought to do it in the setter. Thanks.
