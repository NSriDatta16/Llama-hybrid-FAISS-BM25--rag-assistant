Estimating the Mean of a Function of a Stochastic Process

My question is about estimating the mean of a function of a stochastic process: A function $f(X_t, X_{t-1}, ... , X_{t-n})$ takes in a fixed number of events $X_t, X_{t-1}, ... , X_{t-n}$ from a stochastic process and gives out a number. Given an observation i.e. an observed sequence of values from the stochastic process $X_t$, how do I estimate the expectation $\mathbb E(f)$? If I see m observations of the stochastic process, is $\frac{1}{m - n-1} \sum_{t = n+1}^m f(X_t, ..., X_{t-n})$ a valid estimator? The reasoning would be that, interpreting $f$ as a stochastic process itself with sample paths $f(X_t, ..., X_{t-n})$, the mean can be estimated by simply averaging the observations, but I'm worried that the f values would be highly correlated, but I only use every observation $X_t$ just once, I'm afraid that I'm throwing away information. This is all very heuristic, what's the proper way to deal with this problem? In reality, f doesn't really have an interpretation as a stochastic process.
