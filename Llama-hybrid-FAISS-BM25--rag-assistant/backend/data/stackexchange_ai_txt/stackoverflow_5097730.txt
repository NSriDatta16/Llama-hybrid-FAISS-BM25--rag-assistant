How do I store URL fragments in a database?

How are URLs (fragments) stored in a relational database? In the following URL fragment: ~/house/room/table it lists all the information on a table, and perhaps some information about the table. This fragment: ~/house outputs: Street 13 and Room, Garage, Garden ~/house/room outputs: My room and Chair, Table, Window What does the Database schema looks like? What if I rename house to flat ? Possible solution I was thinking that I could create a hash for the URL and store it along with parentID and information. If I rename some upper-level segment I would then need to update all the rows which contain the given segment. Then I thought would store each segment along with information and its level: SELECT FROM items WHERE key=house AND level=1 AND key=room AND level=2 How do I solve this problem if the URL can be arbitrarily deep?
