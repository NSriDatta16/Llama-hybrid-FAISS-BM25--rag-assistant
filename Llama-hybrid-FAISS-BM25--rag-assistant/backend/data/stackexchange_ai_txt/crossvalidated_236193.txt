Understanding this PCA plot of ice cream sales vs temperature

I'm taking a dummy data of temperature vs Ice cream Sales and categorized it using K Means (n clusters = 2) to distinguish 2 categories (totally dummy). Now I'm doing a Principal Component Analysis on this data and my goal is to understand what I see. I know that PCA objective is to reduce dimensionality (obviously not in this case) and show variance of the elements. But how do you read the PCA plot below, i.e. what is the story you can tell about temperature vs the ice cream in the PCA plot? What do the 1st (X) and 2nd (Y) PCs mean?
