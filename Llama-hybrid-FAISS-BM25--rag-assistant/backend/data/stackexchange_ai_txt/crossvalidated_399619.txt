Each measurement occasion is nested with an individual. There are a variety of ways to handle this issue: mixed effects models and cluster-robust standard errors are a few of them. In a mixed effect model (aka multilevel model), you model each outcome value as a function of an intercept, (centered) age, and a measurement residual. You then model the intercept (and maybe also the slope of age) as a function of gender and an intercept (and slope) residual. The coefficient on gender is the effect of gender on the average outcome for an individual. The models look as follows: $$y_{it} = \beta_{0t}+\beta_{1i}X^{age}_{it}+\epsilon_{it}\\ \beta_{0i}=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}X^{gender}_{i}+u_{0i}\\ \beta_{1i}=\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}X^{gender}_{i}+u_{1i} $$ where $i$ indexes unit-ID and $t$ indexes measurement occasion for individual $i$ . The third line can be replaced by $\beta_{1i}=\gamma_{10}+u_{1i}$ if you don't think the effect of age depends on gender but varies for each individual or $\beta_{1i}=\gamma_{10}$ if you think the effect of age is constant for all individuals. To use cluster-robust standard errors, simply run the model $y_j=\beta_0+\beta_1X^{age}_{j}+\beta_2X^{gender}_{j}+\beta_3X^{age}_{j}X^{gender}_{j}+\epsilon_j$ where $j$ indexes each row in the data set, and then request a cluster-robust standard error with unit-ID as the clustering variable. If age is centered, $\beta_2$ will be the effect of gender on the outcome.
