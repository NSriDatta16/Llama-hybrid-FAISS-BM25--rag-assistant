If you do want the program information saved, where would you save it? It would need to be saved e.g. to disk. But this wouldn't help you if the disk failed, so already it's not disaster-proof. You are only going to get a certain level of granularity in your saved state. If you want something like tihs, then probably the best approach is to define your granularity level, in terms of what constitutes an atomic operation and save state to the database before each atomic operation. Then, you can restore to the point of that level atomic operation. I don't know of any language that would do this automatically, sincethe cost of saving state to secondary storage is extremely high. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between level of granularity and efficiency, which would be hard to define in an arbitrary application.
