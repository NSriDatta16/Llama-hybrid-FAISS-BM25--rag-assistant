The resources you consider to be "wasted" are, in fact, information gains provided by logistic regression. You started out with the wrong premise. Logistic regression is not a classifier. It is a probability/risk estimator. Unlike SVM, it allows for and expects "close calls". It will lead to optimum decision making because it does not try to trick the predictive signal into incorporating a utility function that is implicit whenever you classify observations. The goal of logistic regression using maximum likelihood estimation is to provide optimum estimates of Prob$(Y=1|X)$. The result is used in many ways, e.g. lift curves, credit risk scoring, etc. See Nate Silver's book Signal and the Noise for compelling arguments in favor of probabilistic reasoning. Note that the dependent variable $Y$ in logistic regression can be coded any way you want: 0/1, A/B, yes/no, etc. The primary assumption of logistic regression is that $Y$ is truly binary, e.g. it was not contrived from an underlying ordinal or continuous response variable. It, like classification methods, is for truly all-or-nothing phenomena. Some analysts think that logistic regression assumes linearity of predictor effects on the log odds scale. That was only true when DR Cox invented the logistic model in 1958 at a time when computing wasn't available to extend the model using tools such as regression splines. The only real weakness in logistic regression is that you need to specify which interactions you want to allow in the model. For most datasets this is turned into a strength because the additive main effects are generally much stronger predictors than interactions, and machine learning methods that give equal priority to interactions can be unstable, hard to interpret, and require larger sample sizes than logistic regression to predict well.
