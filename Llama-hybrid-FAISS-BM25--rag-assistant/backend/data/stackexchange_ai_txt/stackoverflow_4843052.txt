How to deal with duplicate target names in reStructuredText?

Example: foo is a tool used to do foo. Download_ .. _Download: http://example.com/foo blah blah blah (omit a lot of paragraphs) bar is another tool to do bar. Download_ .. _Download: http://example.com/bar Since Download points to different urls, docutilus gives this error report: Duplicate target name, cannot be used as a unique reference: "Download". While in markdown, I can specify different id for this two Download : [Download][download-foo] [download-foo]: http://example.com/foo [Download][download-bar] [download-bar]: http://example.com/bar How can I do similar things in reStructuredText?
