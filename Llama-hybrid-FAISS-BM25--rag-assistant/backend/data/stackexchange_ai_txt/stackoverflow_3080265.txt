This can be done using the comma operator , but in standard C you won't be able to declare a variable as part of an expression, so you will have to pass the name of var 's replacement to the macro: // C - comma operator but not able to declare the storage during the // expression. #define NM_PTR(type, var, value) \ (var = nm_malloc(sizeof(*var)), \ *var = value, \ (type * var))
