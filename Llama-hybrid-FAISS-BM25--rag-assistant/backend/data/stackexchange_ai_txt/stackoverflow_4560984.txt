Do you have some code above there which is subtracting an offset from nChar? Those values are the letters' places in the alphabet, but I don't think character codes normally work like that. (It has been a long time since I used any of this so maybe I'm just mis-remembering.) Anyway, the code fragment you have is effectively this (at least on architectures that use the ASCII character ordering, i.e. alphabetic): // Check for clipboard commands switch (nChar) { case ('X' - 'A' + 1): // Ctrl+X - Cut OnEditCut(); break; case ('C' - 'A' + 1): // Ctrl+C - Copy OnEditCopy(); break; case ('V' - 'A' + 1): // Ctrl+V - Paste OnEditPaste(); break; } As mentioned in my other comment, I'd expect there to be some other code checking for Ctrl being held down.
