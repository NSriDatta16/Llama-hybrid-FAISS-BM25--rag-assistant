Is it worth tu use svn if only one person (I) work now on project? Yes. Svn or some other source code repository (git, mercurial, cvs, etc) helps you keep a history of the changes you have been making, and allows you to wind things back to an earlier state if you make a big mistake. (Of course, if you never make mistakes, and always remember what you did and why ... forever ... version control is superfluous.) Svn repository/server should be on my computer or on internet? Either. If you implement the repository server on your own machine, make sure that you do regular backups. If you use a remote repository, make sure that you protect yourself against the repository crashing and losing your stuff, or being inaccessible for a few days. What other tools should I look at? Hudson, git? What is hudson for? Git is an alternative to svn ... Hudson is primarily a continuous build system. It is typically used to automatically run builds and tests; e.g. whenever you do a checkin. Which tools to use in development process to make this process even more pleasure and more professional. A test coverage tool such as Coberatura (in Hudson). Style checkers and bug checkers like CheckStyle, FindBugs, PMD, etc. A good coffee machine :-)
