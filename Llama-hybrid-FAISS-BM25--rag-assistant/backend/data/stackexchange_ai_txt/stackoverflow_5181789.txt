File API File Upload - Read XMLHttpRequest in ASP.NET MVC

I am trying to implement Gmail style drag-and-drop file upload in ASP.NET MVC. I have been following this article: http://robertnyman.com/html5/fileapi-upload/fileapi-upload.html and want to post uploaded files to an MVC controller action. To do this, I modified the sample JavaScript script in the link to point to my controller action: xhr.open("post", "/home/UploadFiles", true); Here is my controller action: [HttpPost] public virtual string UploadFiles(object obj) { var length = Request.ContentLength; var bytes = new byte[length]; Request.InputStream.Read(bytes, 0, length); // var bytes has byte content here. what do do next? return "Files uploaded!"; } I set a breakpoint, and when I upload a file, the breakpoint gets hit - which is good. But how do I extract the data from the uploaded (javascript) XMLHttpRequest object? I don't think its in the HttpRequest - is it the parameter? If so, what type should i expect & how do I extract the byte array and extract the uploaded file info from it? (I am using Chrome - I know it doesn't work in IE) Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
