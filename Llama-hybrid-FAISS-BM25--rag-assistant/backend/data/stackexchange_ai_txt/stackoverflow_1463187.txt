Sounds like your two webpages run from different domains. In that case, you need to use one of the Cross-Domain Communication tricks to break the walls. Read this article, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb735305.aspx This is my favorite approach. To summarize it, You need to create a simple webpart page on the applet domain which contains some Javascript to pass the URL fragment (after #) to the applet window. Let's call it xd_helper (cross-domain helper). When you have the URL in the other webpart, you call the xd_helper#querystring. The xd_helper can send the querystring to the applet because they are on the same domain. The xd_helper Javascript can be very simple. Look at the one used by Google Friend Connect, var u=location.href,h=u.substr(u.indexOf("#")+1).split("&"),t,r;try{t=h[0]===".."?parent.parent:parent.frames[h[0]];r=t.gadgets.rpc.receive}catch(e){}r&&r(h); Facebook uses a more verbose version, http://static.ak.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/XdCommReceiver.js?2
