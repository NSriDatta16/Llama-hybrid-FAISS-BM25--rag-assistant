I believe technology is cheap and science is expensive. You can learn R, Python, SQL and Hadoop pretty fast (considering that you know programming) but learning statistics, machine learning and the methodology of working with data is difficult and takes time. (which you know based on your background) In my eyes, go and apply for jobs with self-confidence. In the meanwhile, consider learning SQL and Python. They are necessary for jobs in industry.
