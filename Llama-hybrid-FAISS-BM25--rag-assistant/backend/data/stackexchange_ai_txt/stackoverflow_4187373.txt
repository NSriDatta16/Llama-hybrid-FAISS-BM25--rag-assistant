Given a centered DIV, the best I could think of would be to set the width in the callback. $('#divID').resizable({ handles : 'e,w' , resize : function (event,ui){ ui.position.left = ui.originalPosition.left; ui.size.width = ( ui.size.width - ui.originalSize.width )*2 + ui.originalSize.width; } }); The above simply calculates the difference between the final and original width and multiplies that by two, then adds that to the original width. I'm not sure this is the best way to do this. I, for one, don't like it since the width is being set twice on the object. I think the better way would be to accept some sort of ( xRate or X-Step ) and ( yRate or Y-Step ) option and include that in the _mouseDrag: portion of the jQuery function. To do this w/o editing jQuery, I think I'd have to create a plugin that overwrites the resizable's _mouseDrag function. I'll accept better answers! :)
