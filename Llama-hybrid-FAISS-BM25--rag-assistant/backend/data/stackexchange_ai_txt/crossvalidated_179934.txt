Stationary vs Stability

I am searching for an example of an unstable VAR($p$) process (its reverse characteristic polynomial has no roots inside and on the complex unit circle) which is stationary. I come up with this question as it is often stated in (multivariate) time series analysis that stable (VAR($p$)) processes are stationary, but the reverse is not necessarily true. So, what kind of process can be unstable but remains stationary?
