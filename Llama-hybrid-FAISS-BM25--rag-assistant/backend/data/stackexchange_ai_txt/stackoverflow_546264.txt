In the Netbeans GUI, set the layout manager to something like GridLayout or FlowLayout (just for testing). You can do this by going to the GUI editor, clicking on your panel, and then right-clicking and selecting a layout. Once you've changed to a different layout, go to the properties and alter the layout properties. For the GridLayout, you want to make sure you have 3 grid cells. Instead of myPanel.validate(), try myPanel.revalidate(). The more canonical way to do this is to create a custom JPanel (without using the GUI editor) that sets its own layout manager, populates itself with components, etc. Then, in the Netbeans GUI editor, drag-and-drop that custom JPanel into the gui editor. Matisse is certainly capable of handling the runtime-modification of Swing components, but that's not the normal way to use it.
