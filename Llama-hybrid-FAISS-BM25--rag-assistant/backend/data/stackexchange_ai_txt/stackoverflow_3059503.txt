The information about the port is stored on JBoss as an MBean property. The problem is that in order to read this property you need an access to MBeans, which requires the port number... I think that the only way to get this port number is to read the configuration file itself and extract the port number. It is not very elegant, so you may prefere to create in web.xml file for your servlet and store the port number there. You may also use JBoss HTTP invoker, which tunnels requests to 1099 port through port 8080 (default HTTP port), please note however that you need to secure this connector. In this case the port will be always the same as your HTTP port.
