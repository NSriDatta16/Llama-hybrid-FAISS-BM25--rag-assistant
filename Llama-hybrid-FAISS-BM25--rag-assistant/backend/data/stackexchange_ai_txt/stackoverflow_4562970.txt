One possible metric for coverage of a web application security assessment is the range of issues tested for. At a bare minimum, the OWASP Top 10 issues should be tested for, but a high quality assessment will properly assess business logic and application specific issues. Also, the tester should have an understanding of any specific technologies used by the web application (e.g. Adobe Flash, Google Gears). Penetration testing is a specialist activity, so get a trustworthy and respected company to perform the testing. In the UK, the CHECK scheme is highly respected, a list of certified companies can be found here: http://www.crest-approved.org/member_companies.php Full disclosure: I work for Verizon Business who offer penetration testing services.
