Expectation notations

In Statistical Decision Theory, one often studies the following two measures (from "The Bayesian Choice" ): Average loss (aka the frequentist risk): $R\left(\theta,\delta\right) = \mathrm{E}_\theta\left[L\left(\theta,\delta(x)\right)\right] = \int_X L\left(\theta, \delta(x)\right)f(x|\theta)dx$ Posterior expected loss : $\rho(\pi, d|x) = \mathrm{E}^\pi\left[L\left(\theta,d\right)| x\right] = \int_\Theta L\left(\theta,d\right)\pi\left(\theta|x\right)d\theta$ I am confused by this notation: What do subindices (e.g. $\theta$ in $\mathrm{E}_\theta$), superindices (e.g. $\pi$ in $\mathrm{E}^\pi$) and conditions (e.g.$x$ in $L\left[.|x\right]$ ) represent when defining expectations ? For reference, in the formulas above: $\delta(x)$ is known as the decision rule (i.e. the allocation of a decision to each outcome x $\sim$ $f(x|\theta)$ The value $\delta(x)$ is also known as the estimate of $\theta$ The function $\delta$ is known as the estimator $\pi$ is the posterior distribution of $\theta$ given $x$
