You may want to rewrite main.py as follows: import SomeUtils as util def main(): util.funct1() # Use funct1 without problem; aMyObj1 = util.MyClass1() # Use MyClass1 with error if __name__ == "__main__": main() A few quick notes: There is no need for semicolons in Python unless you have more than one statement on a line There is no need to wrap conditional tests in parentheses except for grouping from module import * is discouraged as it pollutes the global namespace
