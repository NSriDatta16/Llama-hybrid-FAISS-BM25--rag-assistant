exchangable variance covariance matrix

I was trying to learn how to estimate exchangable correlation matrix. I asked ChatGPT to give me an example so that I can learn the steps and ChatGPT gave me this example Lines I like to get references for this method of estimating the exchangeable correlation matrix 1 / (n - 1) * sum(resd[-1] * resd[-n]) / sigma , how do I identify the source for this formula ? Thanks.
