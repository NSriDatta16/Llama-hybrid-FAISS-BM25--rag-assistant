If I understand you correctly you want to classify something with 13 different classes. You have multiple observations for every class. If you want to be able to predict any new data you should train your classification model on all observations. Splitting it would result in multiple models that have no value on their own. Applying PCA reduces the number of dimensions of your dataset. In your case you have > 5000 features, i.e. >5000 dimensions. This can be problematic both for prediction accuracy and computation time. It can be useful to run PCA before you do anything with the data. If you want to use it, I would de it before you do k-means (or any other model) especially because the choice of your optimal K will be different after applying PCA. WHy do you want to apply PCA before using K-means? Condisering the fact that you have so many variables I would apply PCA first to and proceed as you suggested (apply k-means on the PC's).
