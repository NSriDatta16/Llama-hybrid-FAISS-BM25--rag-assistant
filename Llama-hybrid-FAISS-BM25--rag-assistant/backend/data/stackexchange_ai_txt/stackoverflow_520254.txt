Hang on, stack overflow does use query string parameters for sort, e.g.: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/518812?sort=oldest#sort-top /featured is different. In this case you are controlling what records are returned, not just how their sorted. URLs describe resources. Query string parameters described how the resources are presented. In general: Fragments which describe the nature of the data returned should be part of the URL. Fragments which describe how that data is presented should be query string parameters. Having query string parameters will not hurt your SEO.
