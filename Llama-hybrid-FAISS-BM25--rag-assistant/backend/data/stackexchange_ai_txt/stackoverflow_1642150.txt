I think the recommended way is to take html from your designers and turn in into wicket components - which means you'll split it into several files. Rendering those partial files won't work without any extra efforts. I'd recommend to setup a simple script, tool or anything along those lines that will start your webapp for your designers to work on. This way, they can modify the fragments and immediately see the updated rendering. You'll have to agree on a common structure and tell them how to use the and you should be fine.
