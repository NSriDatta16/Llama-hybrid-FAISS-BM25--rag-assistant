In php, my html prints out with � all over the place - is there a fix?

Hello I have two php file. One of them builds a report, the second contains the language text. When it prints, it keeps giving me the � special character everywhere, even if I am not using any special characters in my code. Why is that and how can I get rid of those? I am running Apache 2.2, php 5, Ubuntu 8.04. FILE 1 Arteries Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart . All arteries, with the exception of the pulmonary and umbilical arteries, carry oxygenated blood. The circulatory system is extremely important for sustaining life. Its proper functioning is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all cells, as well as the removal of carbon dioxide and waste products, maintenance of optimum pH, and the mobility of the elements, proteins and cells of the immune system. In developed countries, the two leading causes of death, myocardial infarction and stroke each may directly result from an arterial system that has been slowly and progressively compromised by years of deterioration.

All arteries, with the exception of the�pulmonary�and�umbilical arteries, carry oxygenated blood. The�circulatory system�is extremely important for sustaining�life. Its proper functioning is responsible for the delivery of�oxygen and�nutrients�to all cells, as well as the removal of�carbon dioxide�and waste products, maintenance of optimum�pH, and the mobility of the elements, proteins and cells of the�immune system. In�developed countries, the two leading causes of�death, myocardial infarction�and�stroke�each may directly result from an arterial system that has been slowly and progressively compromised by years of deterioration. Autoimmunity Autoimmunity�is the failure of an organism to recognize its own constituent parts as�self, which allows an immune response against its own cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an�autoimmune disease.� Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma�is the most common type of�skin cancer. It rarely�metastasizes�or kills, but it is still considered�malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement�by invading surrounding tissues. Statistically, approximately 3 out of 10 Caucasians develop a basal cell cancer within their lifetime. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck.�There appears to be an increase in the incidence of basal cell cancer of the trunk in recent years.
