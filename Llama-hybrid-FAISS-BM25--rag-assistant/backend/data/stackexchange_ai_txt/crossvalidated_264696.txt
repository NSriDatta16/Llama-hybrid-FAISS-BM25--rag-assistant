Understanding statistical hypothesis tests in paper

I'm a stats noob, so I don't really understand the statistic tests that the authors Ross, Greene, and House use to justify their results in their paper "The 'false consensus effect'" . For example, in their first study they are looking at how personal agreement affects how much a participant thinks other people would agree or disagree. It gives the counts for agreement and disagreement for four scenarios, the average estimated percentage of peers that participants would say that would agree or disagree, and a mysterious "F" value (page 283). Additionally, when discussing the results they say the following (page 284): When each story was treated as a “fixed” variable in an analysis of variance combining the data for all four stories, the main effect of Rater’s Choice was highly significant, F(1, 312) = 49.1, p .10. This is probably a very basic statistics question, but I have no context for what this "F" function is, and where they are getting the numbers they are feeding into it. Thank you!
