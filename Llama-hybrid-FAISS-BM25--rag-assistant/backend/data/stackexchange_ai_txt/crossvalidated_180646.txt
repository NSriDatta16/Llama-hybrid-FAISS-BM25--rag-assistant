Where I would START (since you mentioned Minitab) is with a seasonal decomposition. (Stat > Time Series > Decomposition) on the raw data. This will give you seasonal factors for each month, and you can save the deseasonalized data. Note that this should be used for seasonality ONLY. The trend from this procedure is often poor. But once you get rid of seasonality, then you can see how reliable the trend is. Plot your deseasonalized data and stare at it for a bit. If you are lucky, your trend is linear (or if it is linear after you transform the data in some way) then you can fit this in Minitab as well using a variety of procedures (see @Siddhesh's list). And R is a good choice (with a very good forecasting package), but with a bit tougher learning curve.
