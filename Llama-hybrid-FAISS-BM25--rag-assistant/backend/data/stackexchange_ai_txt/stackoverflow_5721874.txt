Adding one point to a flex line series without everything getting redrawn

I have an air app that collects live data from a user's action and graphs it. It records data every second and charts it on three different line series from the same array collection. This works out great at first, but it gets worse and worse as time goes by. When it gets close to an hour it's almost unusable. I'd like to be able to add a point to the graph and have flex JUST draw the new point and not invalidate the whole series and redraw it. Is this possible? I'm willing to override something to make this work. My last ditch effort is to take the average of 5 or 10 points and only adding those. This will still work poorly when the user is going for 3 hours or so, but I can't think of a better way.
