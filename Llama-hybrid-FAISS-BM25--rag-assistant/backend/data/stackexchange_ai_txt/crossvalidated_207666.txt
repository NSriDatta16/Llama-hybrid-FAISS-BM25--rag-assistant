This might be useful for the understanding of prediction errors (delta): R crossvalidation cv.glm: prediction error and confidence interval This answer from AdamO was particularly helpful: "Prediction errors are different from standard errors in two critical ways. Prediction errors provide intervals for predicted values, i.e. values which could be observed in the outcome controlling for some or all of the variation (through conditioning) in the predictors. Standard errors provide intervals for estimated statistics, e.g. parameters which are never truly observed. Continuously valued parameters such as log odds ratios in a logistic regression model can create "prediction intervals" for binary outcomes in the form of a confusion matrix (this is natural for Bayesians). Prediction errors do not vanish in large n whereas confidence intervals do. This is because no amount of sampling will reduce the variability inherent in a single observation drawn from the data generating mechanism. Prediction errors do decrease in large however, since the precision of the estimated predictive model improves. Confidence intervals do vanish in large as a result of the central limit theorem (usu.). This is because sampling the universe repeatedly would yield the exact same thing with 0 variation."
