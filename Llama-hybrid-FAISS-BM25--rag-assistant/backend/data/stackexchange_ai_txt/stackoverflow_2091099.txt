Usually, the first place to start for something like this is to look for prior related work from the academic community. In Minematsu et al. 2002 , they used Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) over mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to distinguish between old and young speakers. Presumably, if you have access to training data with both old and young speakers, you should be able to do the same. Even if you'd like to try another classifier back-end such as neural networks, it would probably be good to start with GMMs since you know that they should work for your task and they'll give you something to compare with whatever other classifiers you'd like to try to use. If you're just doing this for fun or as a research project, I would recommend using HTK, since I like how modular it is. However, if this is being down for something commerical, you should probably go with Sphinx, since it can be redistributed under a BSD like license.
