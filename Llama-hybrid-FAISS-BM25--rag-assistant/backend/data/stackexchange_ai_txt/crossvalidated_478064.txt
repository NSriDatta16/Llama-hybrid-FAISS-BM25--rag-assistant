What is bias in linear regression using NN

I am new in Deep learning. And was implementing linear regression NN from scratch I have seen y = X*W +b so i believe bias is for per node. Like layer haveing 4 node then number of biases will be 4. Per according to this formula it saying bias is for per layer. And all the nodes have that same bias Is that correct ?
