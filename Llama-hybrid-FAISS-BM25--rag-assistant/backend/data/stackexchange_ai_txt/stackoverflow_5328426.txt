I think you're referring to some kind of write-behind cache but it is not really that clear from your question. This is a common pattern for reading data slow a slow source (like a database/disk) and caching it in a fast source (like memcache/memory) for quick retrieval later. It is then your responsibility to empty out all the cached items when things change. See the first example on Using memcache
