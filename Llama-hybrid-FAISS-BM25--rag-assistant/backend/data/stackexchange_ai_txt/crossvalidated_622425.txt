Conformal prediction nonconformity measure

I want to implement offline inductive conformal prediction for a bianry classificstion task but I have an issue with finding an appropriate nonconformity measure. Shafer proposes the Nearest neighbor A(B, z) : = distance to z’s nearest neighbor in B with the same label / distance to z’s nearest neighbor in B with a different label while Dashevskiy in a traffic classification task proposed the nearest centroid Unlike the nearest neighbors algorithm, the nearest centroid (NC) algorithm (see [24]) does not require computing the distances between each pair of objects. Instead, it measures the distance between an object and the centroid (i.e., the average) of all objects belonging to the same class. Keep in mind that my X is a ~2000 bit vector that I would have to reduce to find the centroid. My datasets are in 1000-10000. Do you have any better way to calculate the nonconformity?
