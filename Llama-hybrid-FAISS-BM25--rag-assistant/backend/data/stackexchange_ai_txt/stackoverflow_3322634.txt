If you want the actual images to be uploaded (and not stored in the database - note that db storage is slightly more difficult to accomplish than your standard upload), you can create a field in the database for the image's location; that is how you are going to correspond your image data with your page content. Now, if you want a hyperlink to automatically be made, I suggest querying the database of all "Active" entries (again, could be another field unless you simply delete old entries). Each entry should have a unique ID associated with it. This way, when you give the list, simply include a tag similar to while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query_result)){ // Change this to whatever formatting you need print ' "> '; } Now that's just your loop to get the results. The actual page now should query the database based on the ID given. The query should grab the page content from the database. Something like this would work ". "Data Column 2: ".$row['DataRow2']." ". " "; } ?> Now, I haven't tested this exact code, however all of it should work as is. But you will need to adjust it appropriately to fit your requests; but this is one way to accomplish what you're looking for.
