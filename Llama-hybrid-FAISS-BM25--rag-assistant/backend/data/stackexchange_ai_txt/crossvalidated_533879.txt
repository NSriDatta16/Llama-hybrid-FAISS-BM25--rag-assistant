Your original idea was right, and your boss is overconcerned about a non-issue. It is very intuitive to try to compare fitted coefficients from stratified models, but that is a dominated strategy. By far, the best way is to include all data in a single model and test interactions. You state that your boss is concerned because the model "includes a lot of independent variables". This is silly. A basic rule of thumb states that you need at least 15 of the less commonly occurring outcome per variable in a logistic regression model. You state that you have 10k data with 60% success. That means you have 4k failures. That's enough for 266 variables, according to the stated rule of thumb. You have 4. Including interactions will double that. You're fine. Go ahead with your original plan.
