SQL Server maximum 8KB per row?

I just happened to read the Maximum Capacity Specification for SQL Server 2008 and saw a maximum of 8060bytes per row ? What the... Only 8KB per row allowed? (Yes, I saw "row-overflow storage" special handling, I'm talking about standard behavior) Did I misunderstand something here? I'm sure I have, because I'm sure I saw binary objects with several MB sizes stored inside SQL Server databases. Does this ominous per row really mean a table row as in one row, multiple columns? So when I have three nvarchar columns with each 4000 characters in there (suppose three legal documents written in textboxes...) - the server spits out a warning?
