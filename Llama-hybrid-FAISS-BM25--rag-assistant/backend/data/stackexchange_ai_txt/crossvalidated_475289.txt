confidence interval for 2-sample t test with scipy

from scipy import stats import numpy as np ts1 = np.array([11,9,10,11,10,12,9,11,12,9]) ts2 = np.array([11,13,10,13,12,9,11,12,12,11]) r = stats.ttest_ind(ts1, ts2, equal_var=False) print(r.statistic, r.pvalue) The null hypothesis is that the averages are equal. This code will give me the t statistic and the P-value. But what would be a simple way to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in average? Is there a way to do that with scipy? EDIT: Scipy is not mandatory. Python is mandatory.
