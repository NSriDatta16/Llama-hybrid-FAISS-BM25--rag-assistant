Global search operators for approximate MAP inference?

In complicated Bayesian models, like for instance a hierarchical nonparameteric one, often times it's intractable to do Gibbs or other MCMC sampling methods to convergence. Rather, people tend to do variational inference and use expectation maximization to find the approximate MAP parameters. Is there a reason people use a local search algorithm like EM rather than a global search algorithm like CMA-ES? It seems like the latter would require much less effort since you don't need to derive the E and M steps.
