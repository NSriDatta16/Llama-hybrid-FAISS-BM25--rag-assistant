GMail is not suitable for keeping generic files. Google offers Documents and Data API mechanisms for storing files. You might want to look at them. BTW we have products, which combined let you create a virtual drive with Google backend storage in a couple of hours. Callback File System offers a virtual drive, and CloudBlackbox lets you store data on Amazon S3, MS Azure and on GMail storages.
