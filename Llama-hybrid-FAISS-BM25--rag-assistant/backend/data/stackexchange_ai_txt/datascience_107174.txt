Applicability of ARIMA model on non stationary data

I have a time series dataset that does not have the stationary property. The dataset is monotonically increasing or sometimes showing no change over periods of time. Can I apply the ARIMA model to such datasets which do not have stationary properties? And if yes, what are the methods to process the data before feeding it into the model?
