Select * means the database has to take time to lookup the fields. If you don't need all those fields (and anytime you have have an inner join you don't as the join field is repeated!) then you are wasting but server resources to get the data and network resources to transport the data. You may also be wasting memory to hold the recordset to work with it. And while the performance improvement may be tiny for one query, how many times is that query run? And people who use this abysmally poor technique tend to use it everywhere, so fixing all of them can be a major imporvement for not that much effort. And how hard is it to specify the fields? I don't know about every database, but in SQL Server I can drag and drop what I want from the object browser in seconds. So using select * is trading less than a minute of development time for a worse performance every single time the query is run and creating code that is fragile and subject to very bad problems as the schema changes. I see no reason to ever use select * in production code.
