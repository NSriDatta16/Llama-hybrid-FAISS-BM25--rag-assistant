If you are doing Test Driven Development your code should be hitting at least 70% without trying. Some areas you just can't or is pointless to have test coverage, thats where NoCoverage attributes for NCover come in handy (you can mark classes to be excluded by code coverage). Code coverage shouldn't be adhered to religiously, it should simply be a useful way to give you hints at areas you have missed with testing. It should be your friend, not Nazi-like!
