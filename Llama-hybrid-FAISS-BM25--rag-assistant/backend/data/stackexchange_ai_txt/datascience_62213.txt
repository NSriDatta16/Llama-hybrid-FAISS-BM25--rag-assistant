SVM, which range to use when normalizing

I am using the SVM classifier from Scikit Learn. I was wondering is there is a know-best-practice when it comes to normalization. I'm using different normalization tecniques, but all my normalized data are now between 0 and 1. Using GridSearchCV, I always end up picking the linear kernel for the SVC. Would it be better if I were to normalize having my values between -1 and 1? I feel like the answer is yes, thinking about situations like this one: But I wanted to know if there is an official answer. Thanks a lot
