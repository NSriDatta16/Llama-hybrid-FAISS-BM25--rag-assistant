Asymmetric convolutional autoencoder?

The starting image size is 49x49 and therefore the encoder and decoder parts are not symmetric. Is it going to affect the ability of the network to learn? PS - By asymmetric I mean the filter sizes (kernel sizes), strides are not same for the encoder and decoder part of the network.
