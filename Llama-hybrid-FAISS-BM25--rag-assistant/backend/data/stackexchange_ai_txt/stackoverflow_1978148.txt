How does the website know which OS I'm running? Is it only via javascript or is there OS information in the request headers as well? That info goes in the User-Agent HTTP header each time you make a request to any server. Is there a way for me to bypass this check or "pretend" to be using Windows so that I can access the website even though I'm running an unsupported OS? Check this link for more info in User-Agent spoofing using firefox.
