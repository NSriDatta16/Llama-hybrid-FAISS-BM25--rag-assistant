A common pitfall when watching for a file creation is that you may recieve your event before the upload has completed, so you end up processing a file that is incomplete. Of course you can check for that, since the xml of an incomplete file will not be well formed. But a better solution IMO is to have the uploader write to a temp file, and after completion of the upload have it rename the file to *.xml. As for the FileSystemWatcher itself, well... I have come to distrust it when it is used on a network share ( delete event never got fired). So I wrote my own 'watcher' that has a similar interface to the FSW, but is just polling the directory for file creation/deletion/change. Not as elegant as the FSW, but more reliable.
