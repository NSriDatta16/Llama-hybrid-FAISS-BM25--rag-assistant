Credit attribution for prediction in recurrent neural nets

Consider a recurrent neural net, which has access two inputs sequences x1,x2,x3,x4.... and s1,s2,s3,s4... It emits a predictions p1,p2,p3,p4.... where pi = RNN(si,xi,hi) where hi is the hidden state formed after looking at s,x from t=0....i-1 I am interested in understanding how much of sequence s and sequence x from t=0..i had an effect on the prediction p at t=i. I want two scalars between [0,1] which sum to 1 to represent the effect of both the sequences. Say the scalars are 0.01 and 0.99 meaning sequence s was mostly ignored. Thanks!
