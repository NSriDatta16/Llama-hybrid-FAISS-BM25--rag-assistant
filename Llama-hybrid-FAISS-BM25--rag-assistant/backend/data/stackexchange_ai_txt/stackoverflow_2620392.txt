iPhone Development - Query related records using CoreData

I have a case where i have three entities with one-to-many and one-to-many relationships: Entity A (Entity B relationhip), Entity B (Entity A relationship, Entity C relationship), Entity C (Entity B relationhip) I have the reference of Entity A, and now i want to fetch all the related Entity C records. How can i do that? (with least amount of code) Edit: Here's another way to put it. Can we perform joins with CoreData. For example, (and this is a very crude example), We have a following entity-relationship: Grand Parent (1)---(m) Parent Parent (1)---(m) Child So, now if i have "Albert" the Grand Parent, and i want to get all his grand children, how can i do that?
