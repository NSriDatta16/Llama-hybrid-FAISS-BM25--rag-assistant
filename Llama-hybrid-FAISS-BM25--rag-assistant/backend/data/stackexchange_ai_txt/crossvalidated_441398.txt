Recursive or direct forecasting used in forecast/predict() in stats models

I am working on a time series project. I have an hourly series and I have to forecast the 24 next hours. I am facing a problem with understanding how both the stats models forecast() and predict() methods work. Because they give me different results, I think are they working differently. I want to implement a recursive forecasting (e. g. The last value predicted is used to predict the next one step prediction) to perform multi-step out-of-sample forecasts. Do I have to implement it or it is already done by these method ? I havenâ€™t found any explanations and details about it. I am using the SARIMAX model. Thanks you so much.
