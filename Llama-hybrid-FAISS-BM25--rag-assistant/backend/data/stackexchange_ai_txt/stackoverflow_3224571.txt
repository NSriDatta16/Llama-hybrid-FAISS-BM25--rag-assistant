MonoDevelop -- GTK Designer just shows a blank square?

I am having problems getting the GTK designer to work with MonoDevelop. I tried 2.4 on Arch Linux and it gave this problem. Then I tried 2.2 on OpenBSD and it gives the exact same problem. Both machines are 64bit. Instead of having a window to drag things on I just have a blank square: alt text http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/4766/monodevelop.png The tutorials I've seen look similar to this though: (source: monodevelop.com ) So what gives? With my blank square I can't drag anything onto it, not a VBox or other container even. It will not react to anything. Am I missing some sort of GTK# configuration or what? I find it highly improbable that both OSs' packages I tried are broken. Also, I've attached a (huge) bounty to this because this is a pretty big issue for me. The console output from the starting of Mono and including me trying to drag an element onto the gray box is here Update Ok, so I've finally gotten a bit closer to solving the mystery. I use Fluxbox as my window manager usually. Well I tried using both KDE and Gnome-Session and both of them cause MonoDevelop to work properly(though still missing the window border, you could at least drag components onto it). Now my question is what makes Fluxbox not work for it?
