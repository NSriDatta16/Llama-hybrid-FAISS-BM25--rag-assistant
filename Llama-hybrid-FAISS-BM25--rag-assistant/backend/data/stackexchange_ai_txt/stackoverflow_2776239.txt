Rails - dynamically adding to sortable_element

Am adding to a sortable list using Ajax, and to get the Scriptaculous effects to kick in after the add, the only way I have found is by re-executing sortable_element. Can anyone suggest a better way of doing this, at the complete code is a hack: > { :controller => "pages", :action => "add_fragment", :pid => pid, :index => index }, :complete => "eval(decodeURIComponent(#{sortable_element 'frag_list', :url => sort_frag_pages_path, :complete => visual_effect(:highlight, 'frag_list'), :handle => 'handle'}).gsub('//',''));" %>
