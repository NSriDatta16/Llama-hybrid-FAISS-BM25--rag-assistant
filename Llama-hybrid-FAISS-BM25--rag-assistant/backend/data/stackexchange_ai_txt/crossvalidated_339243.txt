R- Welch Two Sample t-test (t.test) interpretation help

I calculated a Welch two sample t-test in R and am very confused on how to interpret my results. The calculation was based off of a very small dataset (two groups each with 7 samples). The "alternative hypothesis" line is especially throwing me off. Looking to determine if there is a significant difference between the averages of the two groups. Welch Two Sample t-test data: lizard$cold and lizard$warm t = -1.7796, df = 10.147, p-value = 0.1051 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -4.2742915 0.4742915 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 5.894286 7.794286
