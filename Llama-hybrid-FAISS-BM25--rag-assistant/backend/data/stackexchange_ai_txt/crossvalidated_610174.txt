How do you find the KL Divergence between two multi-variable datasets?

Background I'm working on a tabular data model that performs a binary classification. The model has recently started underperforming and I'd like to know if that's due to a drift in the feature distribution of the model. The features in the model haven't changed. The model hasn't been retrained. There hasn't been a change to the data collection. With this in mind, I assume changes are due to a change in the underlying feature distribution. I'd like to quantify this change over a series of datasets that I have. The datasets are large, on the order of $10,000-100,000$ rows in size with $250$ columns. I've heard about KL Divergence and think it could be a good measure of the difference between the feature distributions of the new and old datasets. Question According to Wikipedia : In mathematical statistics, the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence (also called relative entropy and I-divergence), denoted $D_{\text{KL}}(P\parallel Q)$ , is a type of statistical distance: a measure of how one probability distribution P is different from a second... I've read that KL Divergence is a good way to calculate the difference between multi-variable datasets, please see related questions for an example. However, as KL Divergence explains the difference between probability distributions, I assume I'll have to transform my datasets into probability distributions of some form. I haven't been able to find a standard way of doing this, but I have two ideas: Compare feature by feature. Bin feature values and use the bin size to calculate the probability of each bin. Use the bins in both datasets to calculate KL Divergence. Compare everything. Cluster all the samples in each dataset and get a probability for each cluster. Use those cluster probabilities to calculate KL Divergence. Are these ideas sensible? Or is there a standard way of calculating KL Divergence that I haven't been able to find yet?
