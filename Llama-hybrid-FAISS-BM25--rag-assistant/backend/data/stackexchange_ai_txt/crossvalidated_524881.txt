I would say that this approach is used — giving the standard deviations is a useful measure of uncertainty — essentially because lots of quantities encountered in scientific measurements are approximately Gaussian (Central Limit Theorem, blah blah blah ...) and because the new/transformed quantities are still approximately Gaussian under reasonable conditions, so one may still be able to interpret $\pm 2 \sigma$ as an approximate 95% confidence interval, or $\pm 3 \sigma$ as an approximate 99.5% CI. More specifically, if the input $x$ values are approximately Gaussian, and the function $f$ is not too strongly nonlinear (i.e. $f(x) \approx f(x_0) + (x-x_0) f'(x)$ is reasonably accurate over the range of $x$ , where $x_0$ is the mean [or median or whatever] of $x$ ), then the $y$ will also be approximately Gaussian. There are lots of other approaches that will give more reliable confidence intervals/expressions of uncertainty (bootstrapping, Bayesian methods, likelihood profiles, "parametric bootstrapping" (i.e. drawing random samples from $\mathbf X$ assuming it is multivariate normal and propagating the error through $f$ ), calculations based on higher-order Taylor expansions ...), but a given researcher may not know how to apply these methods, or may not want to take the trouble (these fancier computations were a much bigger problem in the era before powerful computers and high-level programming languages were universally available); in many cases we are stuck knowing just the mean and SD of the original values (e.g. if we are synthesizing results from existing literature), which rules out a lot of the fancier approaches. Note by the way that your expression assumes that all the $X_i$ are independent , which is not true in all cases (and can cause serious headaches when you forget to include the covariance/cross-terms — ask me how I know!). The more general expression is $$ \sigma^2_y = \sum_i \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}\right)^2 \sigma^2_x + \sum_i \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} \cdot \textrm{Cov}(x_i,x_j) $$
