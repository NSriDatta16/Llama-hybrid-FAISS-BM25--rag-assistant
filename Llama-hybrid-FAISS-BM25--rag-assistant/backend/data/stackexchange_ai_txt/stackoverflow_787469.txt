Short description of a typical SNMP agent: Set the agent up. This usually entails telling it what server to send alerts to. Run it. Send appropriate SNMP messages to the configured server when things happen. Reply to requests from the configured server. All of the request/reply stuff is done using SNMP messages. If your company does not have a specially designed/assigned OID for the server software, you'll need to look into the standard MIB definitions to determine which OID(s) are appropriate. MIB: Management Information Block. These come in standard and custom flavors. Standard ones are defined by a standards body (IETF?). Custom ones are created by vendors to support information unique to their product(s). MIBs are basically collections of OIDs. OID: Object IDentifier - this is a dotted-notation number string that identifies the piece of hardware/software, and the bit of information you're looking for from it - for example, the number of TX collisions on an ethernet port might look something like: 1.5.82.316.8.4.3 (though that's not a valid OID, it's just a made-up example). More detail available at Wikipedia . Download a free MIB browser to get an idea of what OIDs look like, and how detailed they can get. Check the RFCs for more detailed information. Look at something like perl's Net-SNMP - you may even be able to use the snmpd software that's included with it to do most of your work.
