Here is an example of what ZippyV is talking about (with a twist)... copy and paste the code below into a new file with an HTML extension and run it! This is the title This is a paragraph Another paragraph $(document).ready(function() { $("#add-content").click( function() { var info = unescape('%53%68%68%68%2E%2E%2E%20%73%65%63%72%65%74%20%69%6E%66%6F%72%6D%61%74%69%6F%6E'); $("#hidden-content").html(info); } ); }); The twist is that the hidden content to be displayed is first escaped (using the Javascript escape() function). Also, you can place the javascript in a separate file!
