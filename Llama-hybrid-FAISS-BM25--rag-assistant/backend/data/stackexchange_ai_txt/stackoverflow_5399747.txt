it's easy (J/K!), auto and 0 are not the same thing.. well I mean most times they are auto is when the render agent (the browser) attempts to decide what you mean. in the case #1 above the render agent is smart enough to know there is a preceding element, so it allows for it as you rightly pointed out if you explicitly tell it to go to 0 it will do what it's told swapping the source order is the same, it's then smart enough to know there is no longer anything preceding it so auto will mean 0 in that case
