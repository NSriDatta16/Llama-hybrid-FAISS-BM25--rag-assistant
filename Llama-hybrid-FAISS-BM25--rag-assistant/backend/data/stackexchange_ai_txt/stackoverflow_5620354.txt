NSDATA writeToFile crashes without a reason

I am downloading images from a url using NSDATA and saving them to local file system using NSData *dataForStorage = [NSData dataWithData:UIImagePNGRepresentation(img)]; BOOL saveResult=[ dataForStorage writeToFile:jpegFilePath options:NSDataWritingAtomic error:&error]; NSLog(@"Write returned error: %@", [error localizedDescription]); My app crashes randomly without even giving a message, though some files are saved (again randomly). When I run the app in Debug mode, I frequently see "EXC_BAD_ACCESS" but continuing execution succeeds in saving some of the files. This code is executed in background from: [self performSelectorInBackground:@selector(loadImageInBackground:) withObject:arr]; Please suggest.
