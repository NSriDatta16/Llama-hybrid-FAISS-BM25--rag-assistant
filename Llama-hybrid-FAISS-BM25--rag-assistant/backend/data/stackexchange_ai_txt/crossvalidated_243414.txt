Zero inflated data. ordinal variable prediction. Insurance data

I have an insurance claims data with claim amount as a target variable. The claim amount has a lot of 0s . The output is to predict the high-risk customers. i.e., to preserve the order of claim amounts. I have planned to convert the claims amount variable to an ordinal value ( highest amount =1, second highest amount = 2.......) and perform ordinal logistic regression. Please let me know if my approach is correct. Also please help with any algorithms that deal with thid kind of data. The evaluation of the model would be done on gini index. How do i handle the high amount of 0s in data.
