Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to detect money or property being obtained through false pretenses. It is common in banking (e.g. use of stolen credit cards or money laundering) or insurance (exaggerating losses or causing an accident with the sole intent for the payout). Fraud detection can be done by classification and/or outlier detection algorithms of machine learning .
