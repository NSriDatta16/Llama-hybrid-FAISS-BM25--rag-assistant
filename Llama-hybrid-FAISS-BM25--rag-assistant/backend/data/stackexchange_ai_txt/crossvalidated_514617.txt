Can I transform percentage data using just the square root?

I have a data set with the number of larvae (out of 100) that have metamorphosed after 0,1,2, and 5 days. I want to perform a repetitive ANOVA on the results but they are not normally distributed. I've tried arcsine-square-root and logit but both don't produce a normal distribution. Can I just transform the data using the square root? Or is there a better way to deal with it? Any help would be great!
