Dillo is the lightest weight Linux web browser that I'm aware of. Edit : If it (or its rendering component) won't meet your needs, then you might find Wikipedia's list of and comparison of layout engines to be helpful. Edit 2: I suspect that dynamically loading and unloading parts of an HTML file would be tricky; for example, how would you know that a randomly chosen chunk of the file isn't in the middle of a tag? You'd probably have to use something like SAX to parse the file into an intermediate representation, saving discrete chunks of the intermediate representation to persistent storage so that they won't take up too much RAM. Or you could parse the file with SAX to show whatever fits in RAM at once then re-parse it whenever the user scrolls too far. (Stylesheets and Javascript would ruin this approach; some plain HTML might too.) If it were me, I'd try to find a simple markup language or some kind of rich text viewer rather than going to all of that difficulty.
