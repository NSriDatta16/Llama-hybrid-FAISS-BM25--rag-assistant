Will learning Django translates well into other applications?

Does anyone have experience using Python in different variaty of applications? A little background - I am a 3D artist in an animation studio. I do programming in PHP and use Zend framework for my personal project. Python has always been a language I wanted to learn because it can be used within many applications our studio is using (3D MAX, MAYA to name a few) My supervisor knew about my web background and wanted me to create a web base time line manager for the company. From the requirement I'm expecting quite a simple backend ... so it might be a good opportunity to finally learn Python. The bulk of the work will be on AJAX for the interactive front end. So if I learn Python with web application and Django in mind, will that limit my Python skill from applying it to other applications? a little curious about Django features as well. How well does the framework cover in terms of web application compare to Zend? Our application is pretty basic in the back end and I would love to know if Django will be able to cover them. authenticate against Windows active directory quick database update via AJAX interaction (drag and drop time line mostly) Other basic stuff like discussion forum and directory browsing/file manager
