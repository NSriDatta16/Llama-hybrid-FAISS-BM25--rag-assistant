Non-converging coefficients in hierarchial Bayes analysis of discrete choice

I am trying to analyse repeated responses from a discrete choice experiment. The DCE had one continuous parameter and five 3-level categorical parameters. I started with a multinomial logit and the model converged after 4 iterations. The estimated dummy-coded coefficients are as follows, calculated relative to the middle level: Estimate Pr(>|t|) LYg 0.0938639 Now I'm trying the same analysis using hierarchial Bayes to incorporate individual heterogeneity, but the coefficient estimates, illustrated below, don't seem to be converging, even after 500k replications. As I'm new to Bayesian analysis, I'm hoping someone can explain if this means that the HB model simply isn't going to converge, or if I need to run even more replications. At what point should I conclude the HB model is futile? I am also confused as to the size of the estimated coefficients -- as you can see in the figure, some of the unexponentiated coefficients are approaching 30! Is this simply an artefact of a non-convergent model, or is there something else going on? FYI, I'm using the ChoiceModelR package in R, but I don't think that this is a programming question. Thanks for your help.
