They are doing very similar things, so you should expect to see the same answer. In PSM the counterfactual for each treated observation is weighted average of untreated observations post-treatment. CausalImpact constructs the counterfactual to the observed post-intervention time series using a combination of all the control time series you feed it. If you have $N_C$ time series for the $N_C$ untreated units, you could use all $N_C$ of them as predictors. You can then plot the posterior probability of each being included in the model to see which ones were important (analog of being in the same PS bin). An even better way to approximate what PSM is doing would be to take each treated time series (rather than aggregating to a single one) and do an analysis using all the untreated time series as predictors. Then average the cumulative effect for all the treated units and compare that to the cross-sectional PSM estimate. Note that you can include lagged outcomes as pre-treatment variables to match on (assuming that lagged pre-treatment outcomes are not altered in expectation of treatment), so this will approximate what CI is doing even more closely since you are using the time series variation in a similar way. Both methods also make similar assumptions about SUTVA, which might be hard to swallow in many financial settings.
