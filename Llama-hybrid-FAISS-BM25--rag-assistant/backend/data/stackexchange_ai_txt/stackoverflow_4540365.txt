Magento custom options: success.. almost!

Alright, so I'm working on my own script that reads specific xml files, and imports products. Now, each of these products may have a set of attributes, (i.e. color for example). So, what I'm doing is importing each custom attribute, and generating a specific string, "Yellow, black finish wood" for example, and that would be a radio button you could select from when you go to order the product. Now, when I come to a product that has the same "parentid" but a different unique id, I need to generate a new row for the custom option radio button, so if there is another product where the color is red, I would have the following to select from: Red, black finish wood Yellow, black finish wood This is working great for the first product with the same parent id, in other words, if I'm creating a brand new product, and not just adding custom options to the same product. My question is, how do I generate a new custom option value, for the specific option? In other words, how do I add a new row to a certain option that is already created? Here is basically what I'm doing to generate the first option on a new product. $options = array(); $options[$ParentID] = array( 'title' => 'Option Title', 'type' => 'radio', 'is_require' => 1, 'values' => array() ); $options[$ParentID]['values'][] = array( 'title' => 'Option Value Title', 'price' => 0.00, 'price_type' => 'fixed', 'sku' => $UniqueID, ); foreach($options as $ParentID => $option) { $id = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getIdBySku($ParentID); $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($id); if(!$product->getOptionsReadonly()) { $product->setProductOptions(array($option)); $product->setCanSaveCustomOptions(true); $product->save(); } } this works out great, because magento generates an sku when they order a certain product in the format of $ParentID_$UniqueID, and then I can send the $UniqueID off to the vendor for the order. So again, I'm open to suggestions as to how to add a Option Value to an already created Custom Option
