Getting the hour from a datetime?

How can I select the hour from a datetime ? I'm looking for the equivalent of Oracle's TO_CHAR( d, 'HH24' ) , which would return 17 for 2010-06-23 17:22:31 . I tried to find out about the best time (best answer/question-ration) to ask an SQL -related question on StackOverflow, using Data Explorer . I got it to work, but I'm sure there is a more elegant version. Select Left( Convert(VARCHAR(10), creationDate, 8 ), 2 ) As hour, Convert(Float, Count(*)) / Count(Distinct p.parentId) As ratio From posts p Join postTags pt On ( pt.postId = p.parentId ) Join tags t On ( t.id = pt.tagId ) Where p.postTypeId = 2 And t.tagName = '##TagName##' Group By Left( Convert(VARCHAR(10), creationDate, 8 ), 2 ) Order BY hour BTW, the best time seems to be between 15:00 and 16:00 - guess I'm asking too late :)
