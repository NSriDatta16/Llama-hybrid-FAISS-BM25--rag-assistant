Just dive in. Hopefully whoever has been working on this project so far organized the code into logical groups (namespaces, class hierarchies, folders). I'll also second Matt J on learning how to use the IDE: I'm not familiar with Visual Studio specifically, but there should be contextual menu items when you click on a class or method to take you to the place where it was declared, and from there to the classes it was derived from. Get version control set up first though: you'll feel more comfortable poking around once you learn how to "revert" ;)
