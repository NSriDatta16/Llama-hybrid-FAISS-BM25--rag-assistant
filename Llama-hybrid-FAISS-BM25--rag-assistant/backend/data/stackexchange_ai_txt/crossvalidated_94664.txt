I suppose that higher stands for years of schooling . If this is the case, what you are doing is correcting for the endogeneity problem likely to affect the variable higher . That is, a variable is said to be endogenous when it is likely to be correlated with unobserved factors in the error term. Therefore you are instrumenting it by doing a 2 stages estimation. That is, your Stata command implicitly did the following: 1) It regressed higher on all the exogenous regressors plus the instrument father_education . That is, you assume that having more years of schooling depends on the education of father's. By doing this, you clean your endogenous variable of the endogeneity problem. 2) It runs your original regression using the instrumented (fitted values of the) variable higher as regressor, in place of the original one. By doing this, the coefficient on higher is now a consistent estimator of the true parameter. The interpretation of the results must account for the fact your dependent variable is in logs, while higher is not. Therefore, a year more of schooling increases (on average) the wage by exp(.2566441)= 1.292585 = 29% and this effect is statistically significant, since p-value . Note that this is true as long (1) there is a statistically significant relationship between higher and father_educ (you can test this by verifying that the coefficient on father_educ in the first stage is statistically significant (and positive)), (2) the instrument father_educ is not correlated with the error term.
