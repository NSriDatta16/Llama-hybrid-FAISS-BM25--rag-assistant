NLP: wit.ai. How to use confidence score?

I've created an application on Facebook's wit.ai . In my application, I have a single intent with the following phases: Hello Hi bud Hi Hey there Hey Hey bud !! How's it going ? Hey bud !! Hoss it going ? Now if I try the easy phase Hello , I get a confidence score 0.535. But now if I try the phase shut up , I also get a confidence score 0.535. Question: How does the Facebook wit.ai work? I don't understand why I would get the same confidence score in both cases.
