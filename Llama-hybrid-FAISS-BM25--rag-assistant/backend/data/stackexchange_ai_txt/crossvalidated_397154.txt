Yes, you are asking a lucid question. How does it make sense to assess the data while assuming the null hypothesis is true? Shouldn't we rather use the data to evaluate the hypotheses? Yes, the latter makes much more intuitive sense. The former idea --- what we often do --- is null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). You can read up on the history of NHST, and in what ways it is controversial. As to the question, I'm not qualified to answer, so you can consider this some idle conjecture. But I think some of the reasons why we use NHST is that some of the tests are well known, have been in use for a relatively long time, and are relatively easy to conduct. I also think that if you understand what the results mean, that they are useful. In my opinion, a lot of the criticism of NHST comes down to the fact that people often misunderstand the results of the hypothesis tests. You might look up Bayesian analysis, which could be thought of as a way to assess hypotheses based on the observed data. This makes intuitive sense, but is less straightforward to conduct than, say, something like a t-test.
