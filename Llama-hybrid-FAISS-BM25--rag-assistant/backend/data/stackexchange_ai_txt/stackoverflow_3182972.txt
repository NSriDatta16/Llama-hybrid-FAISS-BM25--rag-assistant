I did this without using .htaccess, but it does query a database. I wrote this a while ago so it uses PEAR DB, adjust to your database/connection method. I'll just copy my code and let you figure out what changes you need. $db=connect_db(); $name=substr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 20); $name=strtolower($name); $id=$db->getone("select id from user where login='{$name}'"); header("Location: /dragonart/profile?user=" . $id); If you store your information in a database this may be a nice alternative. The downside is that the the URL is not rewritten and the user is ultimately sent to a page with ending in a $_GET variable. edit: Just realized that using my method a simpler method can be used for the answer. Since my solution was used to find the id of a user using their username and then send someone to their profile (which requires the id) a better solution would be something like: $var=substr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], $length); header("Location: /path/to/page?p=".$var); where $length is the usual length of the URL without the variable at the end.
