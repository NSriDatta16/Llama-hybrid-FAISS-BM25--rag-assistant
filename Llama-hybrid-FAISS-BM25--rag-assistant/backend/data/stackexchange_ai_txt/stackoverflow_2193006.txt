jQuery reinitialize/refresh draggable/sortable elements dynamically

I have a few functions which I load in the ready() event. These basically make a list draggable, and other areas droppable/sortable. Eg. You can drag a clone into multiple areas (lists in divs), and within these multiple areas, you can sort/reorder them (but only within each area). This works perfectly. I have a button which dynamically creates a new area for items to be dropped into, then sorted. It creates the new area perfectly, but you cannot drop items into it, or then even make them sortable. I realise this is something to do with the fact I am making all areas droppable/sortable upon page load using the ready() event, and not actually re-running these functions dynamically. I have tried using 'refresh' on these elements inside the button's click function. Eg. $(".field > li").draggable('refresh'); $(".dragrow1, .dragrow2").droppable('refresh'); $(".dragrow1, .dragrow2").sortable('refresh'); But this doesn't work. I want to avoid repeating my code in any way if I can help it. Is there a way of making this work? I thought that if there was something similar to the 'live()' function that you can use with 'ready()', then that might be a solution, but there's not...! Thanks.
