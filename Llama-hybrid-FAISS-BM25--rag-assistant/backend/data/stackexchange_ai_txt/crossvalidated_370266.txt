If you have an outcome that is bounded, and you see that the normal distribution for the error terms does not seem appropriate, you may want to try a Beta distribution. In particular, say that your original outcome is the range $y \in [a, b]$ , then $y^* = (y - a) / (b - a) \in [0, 1]$ , and you could fit a Beta mixed effects model for $y^*$ . This can be done, for instance, using the beta.fam() object in the family argument of the mixed_model() function of the GLMMadaptive package. E.g., library("GLMMadaptive") fm You can also find more info in the vignette Custom Models . Model Fit To investigate the fit of your model to the observed data, you could use the idea of replication checks (in Bayesian posterior predictive checks). The code below illustrates how this could be done: x_vals
