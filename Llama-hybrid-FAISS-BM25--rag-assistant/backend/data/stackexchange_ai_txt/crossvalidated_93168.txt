Does BIAS equal to MEAN ERROR

Bias is defined as an average of all errors (without abs) and this is, IMO, what I want. However, I have been asked to give MEAN ERROR. Is this the same than bias and is it wrong to call bias as mean error? Just in case Iâ€™m messing these definitions totally, description what I try to do: Positions are forecasted and compared to absolute values. To give the error, RMSE and BIAS are calculated.
