How to run a script on linux from a windows service?

Does anyone know an elegant way to initiate a bash script (to run on a linux box) from a windows service written in C#? I can only think of some combination of putty doing auto-login and automatically running a command upon login. But this seems clumsy and a bit insecure. Security doesn't need to be very high as both boxes reside on the internal LAN inside the corporate firewall. And only sysadmins can login to the windows box.
