First things first, you should set up a test of your current solution and see if it reaches your desired level of accuracy. Success in your specific domain matters more than following a standard procedure. If your method needs improving, try weighting your stop words by the rarity in a large corpus of English and German. Or you could use a more complicated technique like training a Markov model or Bayesian classifier . You could expand any of the algorithms to look at higher-order n-grams (for example, two or three word sequences) or other features in the text.
