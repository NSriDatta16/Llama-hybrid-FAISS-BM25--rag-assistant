As you say, it is sufficient to show that, with probability $1$ , all proposed points $Y_t$ are distinct. Note that the fact that the $X_t$ come from a Markov chain is inessential to showing that the $Y_t$ are distinct. More precisely, assume that we are working in $\mathbf R^d$ , and that the proposal kernel has a density (e.g. a Gaussian random walk proposal). It is then simpler to show the following: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_N$ be arbitrary points in $\mathbf R^d$ . For $i = 1, \ldots, N$ , independently draw $Y_i \sim q ( X_i \to Y_i ) $ . Then, with probability $1$ , $Y_1, \ldots, Y_N$ are all distinct. The argument of @Taylor then works here: the probability that $Y_i = Y_j$ for any pair $(i, j)$ is $0$ , since the proposals have a density, and then by a union bound, one deduces that all of the $Y_i$ are distinct.
