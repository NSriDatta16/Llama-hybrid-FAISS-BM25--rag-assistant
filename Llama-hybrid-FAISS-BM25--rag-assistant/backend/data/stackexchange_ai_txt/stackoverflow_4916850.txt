Run MySQL and use the MEMORY storage engine. The table(s) will exist only in memory, will not be persisted to disk, and will not be "too slow" as operations are essentially at the speed of memory access. Whatever you do, don't reinvent the wheel. Lots of in-memory data stores exist with PHP drivers/interfaces.
