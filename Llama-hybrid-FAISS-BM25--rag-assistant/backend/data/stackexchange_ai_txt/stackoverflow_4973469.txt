Accessing ASP.NET MVC server-side data on selection of item in jsTree

I am using jsTree to display a tree structure of hierarchical data within my ASP.NET MVC application. So far, I am able to access the data (through a controller method which returns JSON data) and display the tree. I am also able to select nodes in the tree and that works correctly. Here is the jsTree code for doing this: $('#tree'). bind('select_node.jstree', function(event, data) { alert("Node is selected."); }). jstree({ "core": {}, "json_data": { "ajax": { type: 'POST', url: '/Scenario/TreeData', data: "id=" + , success: function(data, textStatus, xhr) { if(data.failed) { window.location.href = data.redirectToUrl; } } } }, "themes": { "theme": "default", "dots": true, "icons": true }, "ui": { "select_limit": 1 }, "plugins": ["themes", "ui", "json_data"] }); Here is my TreeData action: [HttpPost] public ActionResult TreeData(int id) { var tree = new JsTreeModel(); Scenario scenario = repository.GetScenario(id); if (scenario != null) { tree.data = new JsTreeData(); // [snip] Do the work to build the tree. [/snip] return Json(tree); } var jsonData = new { failed = true, redirectToUrl = Url.Action("NotFound") }; return Json(jsonData); } Where I am getting stuck is, once I click on a node, I am unsure of how to retrieve the data for that specific node from my application (via the Controller), display it (presumably in a partial view - all of which I have created at this time - strongly-typed partial views), and then offer the option to submit that partial view back to the server to update the data. I'm not really sure where to begin. One thought I had is to expand my TreeModel class (C# model which makes it easier to build the JSON data for the tree) to take more parameters in the "data" value which may allow me to know which model I am attempting to retrieve. However, this doesn't seem that elegant. Am I missing something obvious? Does anybody have any other suggestions? Thank you!
