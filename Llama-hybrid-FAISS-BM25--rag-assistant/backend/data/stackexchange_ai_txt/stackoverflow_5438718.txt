I've used NHibernate LINQ extensively in my current project, and I have some mixed feelings about it: Having used the former LINQ in the NH Contrib project in NH2.1, I can tell you that this new version is much more mature, and suitable for most real-world scenarios. But, and as soon as you start to do more complex queries, and/or need to be especially carefull with performance, some road blocks start to appear. It still has some bugs, and you'll see the infamous "Method Not implemented" a lot. Regardless, it is ORM agnostic, and allows some nice separation of concerns and you'll leverage your existing LINQ knowledge. It works pretty well... So, my sugestion is: IMHO, it is ready for real-world applications, but don't expect it to be the silver-bullet that solves every problem, and be prepared to use QueryOver/Criteria/HQL in some (or many) places. Just some side-notes on features that not work very well (from my experience): the "Any" method the "Fetch" method second level cache futures spatial extensions
