What is use of Tweedie or poisson loss/objective function in XGboost and Deep learning models

I am looking at few competitions in kaggle where people used tweedie loss or poisson loss as objective function for forecasting sales or predicting insurance claims. Can someone please explain the use/need for using tweedie or poisson instead of the regular mean squared loss as objective. Is it because of the distribution of the response variable ? If the response is variable is positive and right skewed, should we always use tweedie or poisson instead of mean squared loss ?
