You have defined field-like event: C# language spec: When compiling a field-like event, the compiler automatically creates storage to hold the delegate, and creates accessors for the event that add or remove event handlers to the delegate field. How compiler generates name for storage field is unspecified. Usually this name of field matches with the name of event, so you will have two members with the same name (SomeName in your example), but different member types and different visibility (event - public, field - private). Type.GetMember() : The GetMembers method does not return members in a particular order, such as alphabetical or declaration order. Your code must not depend on the order in which members are returned, because that order varies. If you take overload of GetMembers() without parameters then it should return only public members - event. However if you use another overload (that accepts BindingFlags) with BindingFlags.NonPublic - then it will return both field and event in unspecified order, so you can't rely that first element you get will be event.
