As a Front End Designer the key things that Backend Developers tend to not be aware of are: Internet Explorer can and will take totally valid HTML, CSS & JS and botch the most basic expected behaviors Develop / Test interfaces in (Firefox,Safari,Opera,Chrome,Arora etc.) first! then be sure to review in IE6, IE7, and IE8... Take the HTML, CSS, & ECMAScript Specs with a grain of salt. "Guideline" often seems like the more appropriate term vs. Spec. You've heard many a battle of Div's vs. Table's. Div's are great but sooner or later you will encounter a need to wrap something up in a table to stop browser X from wrapping your content when you clearly told it not to. It is ok to "give up" once in a while. Thus as an end result you want to pass information along to the Developers that help clarify what they really need to know (and hopefully save them the frustrating steps along the way). Although sites like A List Apart have great articles w/code, sometimes the solution gets lost in the story. For dealing with bugs I recommend this Knol which links back into this browser bug list . The Knol doesn't provide much info but it does provide an organized index to find what bug is causing you pain. Otherwise for general info check out the various developer blogs. Snook.ca , PPK's QuirksBlog , The Man in Blue etc.
