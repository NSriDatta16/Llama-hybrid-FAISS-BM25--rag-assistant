comparing linear and bayesian model

I have two models that predict a continuous outcome using the same 4 predictor variables. Currently I am using the RMSE to compare the models so I am comparing the predicted outcome vs. the actual outcome for both models. Can you advise on this method of model comparison? Are there more popular methods besides RMSe to compare linear vs. bayesian models. I like RMSE because it is interpretable for a lay audience. Thank you.
