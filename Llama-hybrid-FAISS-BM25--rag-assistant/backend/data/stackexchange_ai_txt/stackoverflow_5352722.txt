SQL weird error : Error converting value

When I do SELECT RecTime, CAST(ID as nvarchar(MAX)) AS Col, InitialValue FROM [dbo].[Changes] I've got no errors When I do SELECT RecTime, Col, InitialValue FROM [dbo].[XDeltaIntervals] I've got no errors But when I do SELECT RecTime, CAST(ID as nvarchar(MAX)) AS Col, InitialValue FROM [dbo].[Changes] UNION ALL SELECT RecTime, Col, InitialValue FROM [dbo].[XDeltaIntervals] Col from XDeltaIntervals is nvarchar(MAX) I've got Error Message : Message 245, Level 16, State 1, Line 2 Error converting value nvarchar "davl> 40" to the data type bit. Attention! NULL is excluded in the aggregate, or other operations SET. davl> 40 is Col from XDeltaIntervals and it's nvarchar and I can't understand where I'm trying to convert it to bit :S How can I avoid this request to convert Col from second part of union to bit ?
