Sharing Files in SVN

I am in the process of moving from VSS to SVN and I'm not sure how to share files in SVN. Basically we have the following structure in VSS $MOSS - Components - ComponentA - bin - ComponentB - bin - GAC Mirror GAC Mirror holds a shared copy of all the Dlls from the bin folders of the components to allow for easy copying to the GAC. In VSS all you do is drag the Dll from the bin folder to the GAC Mirror folder and it works it's life out. How would I do this in SVN? Thanks in advance.
