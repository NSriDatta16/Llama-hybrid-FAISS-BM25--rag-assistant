How to keep controllers out of xib

As a newbie, IB and all the possible connections is bewildering to me. Most tutorials I've found are what I'd call the reincarnation of spaghetti code, in which the entanglement is all the connections created by dragging. Of course, I want to use IB for layout of views (sizing & placing visual elements), that's what IB is great for. But a controller is not a view, so it's less confusing if all my controllers are solely code and don't appear anywhere in IB. I suspect this will minimize the spaghetti. It also encourages the one-xib-per-view admonishment. To that end, and here's the question, where can I find example projects that adhere to this strategy?
