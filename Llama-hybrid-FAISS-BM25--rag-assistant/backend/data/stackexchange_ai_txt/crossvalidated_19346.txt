Sounds like you want to do "Agent-based modelling" - if you are computing with the behaviour of individuals. [Personally I prefer the term 'simulation' to 'modelling' when it's not what a statistician would call a 'model'...] I suspect the simplest example is just to have a finite time-step, and rates of transfer between zones, and then pick which people move, they have infection probabilities and everyone has a susceptibility probability. Work out who catches the disease in the next time step. What you then get is a non-deterministic (because you have some random number generator) simulation that you can run hundreds of times to get simulation uncertainties on the spread of your disease. I'm not sure how easy it is to compare these kinds of models with reality though...
