Check the log of your statistical function. It usually spits out the coefficients before it gives you the p-value. I'm not familiar with the Phillips-Ouliaris test or your 'tseries' library, but for Engle-Granger test or ADF test, it will calculate a regression first in the background, and usually the econometrics software will spit out the results of that regression before testing the residuals for cointegration and printing the p-value. You would HAVE to do the regression first to GET the residuals. It takes the different between the estimated calculated value of the 2nd time series with the actual observed value to get the residual (uhat, รป) for that point. Once it has all those residuals, then it runs a test for unit-root or stationarity to see if those two series are cointegrated. And yes you can do it after also. The coefficients should match the ones discovered during the cointegration test.
