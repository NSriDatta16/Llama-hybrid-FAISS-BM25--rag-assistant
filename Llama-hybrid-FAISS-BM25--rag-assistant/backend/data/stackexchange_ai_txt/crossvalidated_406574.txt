Why is using keras ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation relevent?

I have used keras ImageDataGenerator to generate more data in my neural networks as I have had really small datasets and it has proven itself. As far as I understand, it generates new batches each epoch on the fly and so the neural network is trained on a "little bit" new data on each iteration. Why/how is this method relevant? Is there any research done on this topic? I just haven't seen it in my studies so far and want to know whether this is commonly used method or just some feature that keras offers?
