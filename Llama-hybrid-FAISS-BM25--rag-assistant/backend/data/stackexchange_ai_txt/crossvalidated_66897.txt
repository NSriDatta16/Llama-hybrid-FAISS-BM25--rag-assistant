Apply double non-negative constrain on Sparse PCA

In Non-negative Sparse PCA, we apply a non-negative constrain in the coordinate matrix. Here I'm up to apply non-negative constrains on both the basis matrix and the coordinate matrix. I'm wondering if there's any research on this. By the way, I'm using nsprcomp package in R and can I apply this extra constrain using this package?
