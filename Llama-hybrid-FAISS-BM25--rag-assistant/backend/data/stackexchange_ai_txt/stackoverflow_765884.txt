This is a way of backing into the indexes. You can use SHOWCONTIG to assess fragmentation. It will list all of the indexes for the database or table, along with statistics. I would caution that on a large database, it can be long-running. For me, one of the benefits of this approach is that you don't have to be an admin to use it. --Show fragmentation info on all indexes in a database SET NOCOUNT ON USE pubs DBCC SHOWCONTIG WITH ALL_INDEXES GO ...turn NOCOUNT back OFF when done --Show fragmentation info on all indexes on a table SET NOCOUNT ON USE pubs DBCC SHOWCONTIG (authors) WITH ALL_INDEXES GO --Show fragmentation information on a specific index SET NOCOUNT ON USE pubs DBCC SHOWCONTIG (authors,aunmind) GO
