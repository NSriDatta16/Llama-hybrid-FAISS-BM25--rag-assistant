Firstly, this topic is covered here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2258332/distributed-computing-in-c Secondly, a search for "C++ grid computing library", "grid computing for visual studio" and "C++ distributed computing library" returned the following: OpenMP+OpenMPI. OpenMP handles the running of single C++ program on multiple CPU cores within the same machine, OpenMPI handles the messaging between multiple machines. OpenMP+OpenMPI=grid computing. POP-C++, see http://gridgroup.hefr.ch/popc/ . Xoreax Grid Engine, see http://www.xoreax.com/high_performance_grid_computing.htm . Xoreax focuses on speeding up builds of Visual Studio, but the Xoreax Grid Engine can also be applied to generic applications. Looking at http://www.xoreax.com/xge_xoreax_grid_engine.htm quotes, we see the quote "Once a task-set (a set of tasks for distribution along with their dependency definitions) is defined through one of the interfaces described below, it can be executed on any machine running an IncrediBuild Agent.". See the accompanying CodeGuru article at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/showcase/Xoreax-Grid.aspx Alchemi, see http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/alchemi.aspx . RightScale, see http://www.rightscale.com/pdf/Grid-Whitepaper-Technical.pdf . A quote from the examples section of this paper: "Pharmaceutical protein analysis: Several million protein compound comparisons were performed in less than a day – a task that would have taken over a week on the customer’s internal resources ..."
