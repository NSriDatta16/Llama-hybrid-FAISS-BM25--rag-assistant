There's no delay in the recording of the change, but the getUpdate/getDeleted calls round down the specified time to the nearest minute, so a finish time of now, gets rounded down, and the just made change falls outside of the range. Also, if you're doing near realtime replication via these calls, then make sure to pay attention to the inflight transaction timestamp returned, otherwise you can miss changes (as the change timestamp can't be the actual transaction commit time)
