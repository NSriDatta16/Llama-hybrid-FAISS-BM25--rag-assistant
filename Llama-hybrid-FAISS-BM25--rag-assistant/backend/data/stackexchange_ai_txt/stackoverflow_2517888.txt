According to the Syntax and structure section of the JPEG page on wikipedia , the width and height of the image don't seem to be stored in the image itself -- or, at least, not in a way that's quite easy to find. Still, quoting from JPEG image compression FAQ, part 1/2 : Subject: [22] How can my program extract image dimensions from a JPEG file? The header of a JPEG file consists of a series of blocks, called "markers". The image height and width are stored in a marker of type SOFn (Start Of Frame, type N) . To find the SOFn you must skip over the preceding markers; you don't have to know what's in the other types of markers, just use their length words to skip over them. The minimum logic needed is perhaps a page of C code. (Some people have recommended just searching for the byte pair representing SOFn, without paying attention to the marker block structure. This is unsafe because a prior marker might contain the SOFn pattern, either by chance or because it contains a JPEG-compressed thumbnail image. If you don't follow the marker structure you will retrieve the thumbnail's size instead of the main image size.) A profusely commented example in C can be found in rdjpgcom.c in the IJG distribution (see part 2, item 15). Perl code can be found in wwwis, from http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~ark/wwwis/ . (Ergh, that link seems broken...) Here's a portion of C code that could help you, though : Decoding the width and height of a JPEG (JFIF) file
