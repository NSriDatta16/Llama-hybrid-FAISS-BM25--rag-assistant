Because a Normal-Gamma prior was used and it is conjugate, the posterior would be Normal-Gamma. This new posterior is the prior for the next points. You could add them to the prior dataset and calculate as if you had not performed the calculations already or you could treat the posterior as a prior and get a new posterior. The only exception to that rule is when the elements of the sample are not exchangeable. That is only an issue when the order of observation matters. You would now have a proper prior if you use the posterior as your prior. Unless the data is not exchangeable, it doesn't matter which way you do your calculations. One last picky note, Bayesian intervals are called credible intervals or credible sets instead of confidence intervals. The distinction is made because they do not imply the same meaning and do not have the same types of mathematical requirements on them. For example, credible intervals can be disjoint sets. Your textbook should have solutions for conjugate priors with slope and covariance matrix unknown.
