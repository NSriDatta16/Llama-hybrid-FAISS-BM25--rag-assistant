how do you decide how many will be used at each layer See Is there any method for choosing the number of layers and neurons? What is the effect of the filter size in a CNN? What are the state-of-the-art methods to determine parameters in CNN, NN, RNN, or any deep learning models how/are these kernels represented in the NN diagram You can think of a convolutional layer as a traditional feedforward layer with shared weights and fewer connections than if it was fully connected. By fewer connections, I mean something like: But dont understand how it is possible to have mutliple kernels run over the image in one layer. Looking at the first diagram I would have assumed that each layer would be responsible for one and only one convolution? Just add more hidden units.
