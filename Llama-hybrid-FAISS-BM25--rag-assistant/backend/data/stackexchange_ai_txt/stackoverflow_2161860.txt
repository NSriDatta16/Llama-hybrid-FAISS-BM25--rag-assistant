One you might want to look at is Werkzeug - it is a WSGI utility toolkit. It includes a runserver function that takes the wsgiref server and adds automatic code reloading (you can also configure it to reload when configuration files change) and an awesome debugger. On a side note, your disdain for frameworks makes it sound like you're planning to handle all the WSGI stuff from scratch, in which case I would recommend you use Werkzeug's utility functions to handle parsing requests and generating responses. It's a lot more fun than doing it yourself. (And for the love of Guido, PLEASE don't use cgi.FieldStorage !)
