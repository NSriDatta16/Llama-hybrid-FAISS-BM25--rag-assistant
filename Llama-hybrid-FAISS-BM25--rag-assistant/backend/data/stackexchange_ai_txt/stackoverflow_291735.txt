Jus some useful info, you can also use the #pragma push_macro/pop_macro to push and pop macro definitions. This is great if you want to override a macro definition in a block of code: #pragma push_macro("GetMessage") #undef GetMessage // Your GetMessage usage/definition here #pragma pop_macro("GetMessage") I suspect this is an MS specific feature though, so keep that in mind.
