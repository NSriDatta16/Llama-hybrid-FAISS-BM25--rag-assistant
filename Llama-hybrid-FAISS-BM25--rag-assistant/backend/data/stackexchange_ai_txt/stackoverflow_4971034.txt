Can one inspect the weights learned by a logistic regression classifier in weka?

I'm training Weka's logistic regression classifier and I'm trying to figure out what is going on under the hood. I know that I can use the classifier to look at the confidence distribution per instance using the logistic.distributionForInstance method but is there a way that I can look at the feature weights learned by the classifier? thanks
