I'm not sure what are you asking for, but if you wish to check if user entered correct id, you should try regular expressions. Look at Python Documentation on module re . Or ask google for "python re" Here's an example that will check user's input: import re id_patt = re.compile(r'^r[1-5]$') def checkId(id): if id_patt.match(id): return True return False HTH, regards. EDIT: I read you're question again, here's some more code: (just paste it below previous code fragment) validId = False while not validId: id = raw_input("Enter id: ") validId = checkId(id) By the way, it could be written in quite shorter way, but this piece of code should be easier to understand for someone new to Python.
