Using two different third party libraries gives linking error

I am using two different third party libraries in my VC++ project . When I compile them then its giving me linking errors. I have checked the sample applications with each of the library. Settings of sample application with first library (Lib1) 1)Use MFC in Static Library 2)Multi-Threaded Debug Settings of sample application with first library (Lib2) 1)Use MFC in a shared dll 2)Multi-Threaded Dll I am including first library in project by adding #pragma comment(lib, "./lib/abc.lib") statement Second library is added to project settings by adding it as Additional Dependencies. Now it works fine but when I try to use some functions from Lib1 the I get errors like 1>libcmtd.lib(tidtable.obj) : error LNK2005: __encode_pointer already defined in msvcrtd.lib(MSVCR80D.dll) 1>libcmtd.lib(tidtable.obj) : error LNK2005: __decode_pointer already defined in msvcrtd.lib(MSVCR80D.dll) 1>libcmtd.lib(dbgheap.obj) : error LNK2005: _malloc already defined in msvcrtd.lib(MSVCR80D.dll) 1>libcmtd.lib(dbgheap.obj) : error LNK2005: _calloc already defined in msvcrtd.lib(MSVCR80D.dll) Any solution how can I make my project compile with both the libraries. I dont have source code for those libraries so I can't compile them.
