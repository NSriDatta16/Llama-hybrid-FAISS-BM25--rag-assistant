regression for binary classification

Given a binary classification problem, is there any inherent difference (or advantage) to using a classifier (say a logistic regression) and a regression, where the classes are denoted by 0 and 1 (or any two numbers)? Further, say, after running the regression, one can learn to optimize the 'cutoff' point (maybe not 0.5 in this example, but it turns out better to cut at 0.45).
