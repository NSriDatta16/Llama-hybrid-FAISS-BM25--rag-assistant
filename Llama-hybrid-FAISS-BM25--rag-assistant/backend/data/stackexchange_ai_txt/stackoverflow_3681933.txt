You can look at each of the individual pieces of new char*[2] to understand what it does: new dynamically allocate new [ ] an array new [2] of two new char*[2] pointers to "char" objects So, it dynamically allocates an array of two pointers to char s. It returns a pointer to the initial element of the allocated array (this is what the array form of new always returns). That pointer is stored in charList . charList is on the stack (it has automatic storage duration) and points to the dynamically allocated array, which is on the heap. The two pointers in the dynamically allocated array, charList[0] and charList[1] , are set to point to the string literals, "abcde" and "fghij" , respectively. The string literals have static storage duration, so they exist for the entire time your program is running.
