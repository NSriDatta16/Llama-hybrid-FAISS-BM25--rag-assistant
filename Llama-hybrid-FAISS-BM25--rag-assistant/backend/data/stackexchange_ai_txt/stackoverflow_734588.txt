Why don't you use the WebDialogWindow in infragistics toolset itself. I support both, modal and non-modal modes and is a control container so you can put anything in there. You can handle the template open client side event, cancel the default one and show the WebDialogWindow, let the user name changes and once they are done you can take values from those editors and update the grid cells. You can learn more about the WebDialogWindow here . HTH. Taz.
