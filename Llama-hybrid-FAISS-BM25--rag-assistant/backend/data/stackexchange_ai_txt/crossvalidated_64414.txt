Differences between regression using base R and using rms package

OLS models can be created using the base R lm function. They can also be created using the ols function in the rms package. Unfortunately, I cannot find anywhere online (including in the ols help page) a summary of the differences between ols and lm, and what reasons there might be in practice to prefer one or the other in particular circumstances. (I assume that there are substantial differences, otherwise why should the authors of the rms package have created the ols function.) A similar question arises with the competing mixed model functions in the lme4 and nlme packages, amongst (I suspect) many others. There does not seem to be anywhere on the CRAN site where comparisons of the features of packages with overlapping coverage can be found. Are such comparisons available elsewhere online?
