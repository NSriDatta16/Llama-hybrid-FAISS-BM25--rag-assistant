Choppy Image on multithreaded android game

I decided to convert my spritesbased 2d game for android to use opengl-es to help with some render-related framerate issues. Currently the setup is as follows: Rendering tkaes place in its own thread, with rendermode set to continuous. Game logic updating takes place in a seperate threaad. Both threads interact with a synchronized drawlock class which ensures that they are never touching the game information simultaneously. So basically, the render thread waits for any current update to finish before drawing and the update thread waits for the current render to end before starting an update. Everything looks great except or some choppiness I've noticed in the picture when moving around the screen. I believe this is likely due to a lack of consistency in the number of updates that happen in between each render, on average twice as many updates happen because as of right now not a whole lot is happening in the update. But this lacks consistency so sometimes 1 gets through, sometimes 2, 3 etc so the delta in positions of items being drawn is also not consistent thus creating the choppiness. Anyone have an idea how I might rectify this? The update thread is regulated to 60 times per second with sleeps...maybe something similar needs to happen under render? I'm just not sure at this point.
