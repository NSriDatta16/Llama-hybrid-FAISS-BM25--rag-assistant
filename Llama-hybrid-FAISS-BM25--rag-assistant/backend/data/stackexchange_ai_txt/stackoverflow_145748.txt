Organization is key. If namespaces and intellisense is available, the right function can be narrowed down on, and eventually found. If they don't find what they want exactly, they may find something close or related. Code that is just mashed together in one huge group makes it easy to find, but people are never going to find the method they want fast enough. Consistency is also critical, both with naming and location. If you decide to change your style at some point during the project, go back and change everything to fit that style. It can easily be a very long and boring process, but it is better than trying to have to use an inconsistent library.
