what In think you're looking for is the client's user agent. I know nothing about php but it looks like $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; could help you. maybe it's better to allow all mobile user agents instead of blocking all other user agents because in the future other browsers are goint to be released and you'll have a bug. for instance IE9 is being release in a few weeks. Hope it helped, Cheers
