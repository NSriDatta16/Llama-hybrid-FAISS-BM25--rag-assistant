How to have favicon / icon set when bookmarklet dragged to toolbar?

I've made myself a bookmarklet, and it functions just fine, but when added to a toolbar in Opera or Firefox, it just takes on the default bookmark icon for the browser (a globe and a star, respectively). My site has a favicon, and the window, tab and even [site] bookmark uses the favicon I've specified. Just not my bookmarklet. How can I code my site or bookmarklet so that the bookmarklet gets the favicon, too? I'm aware of various manual hackery techniques users can use to set the favicon after the fact, but those are undesirable solutions.
