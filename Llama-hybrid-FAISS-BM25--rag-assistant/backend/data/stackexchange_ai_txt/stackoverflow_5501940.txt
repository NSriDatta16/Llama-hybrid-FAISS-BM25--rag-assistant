SageMath SageMath , formerly SAGE, then Sage , is computational mathematics free software. It includes python as the user language, also used in a lot of the source code maxima , sympy , ginac (via Pynac) for symbolic algebra numpy , scipy can be used for numerical computations jupyter-notebook for its notebook system, with its own jupyter-kernel SageTex to embed results into latex documents many more components , in various languages, but interfaced in Python for usage in Sage SageMath uses the Python language, with a tiny bit of syntactic sugar to ease definition of mathematical objects such as symbolic functions, number fields, polynomial rings. Some parts are written in cython or C/C++ for speed, but a typical user would only use Python syntax. Python wrappers help call other software included in SageMath pythonically. It is possible to use SageMath using texmacs . External links SageMath project home page , wiki , issue tracker , questions-and-answers site SageCell for one-off computations online, somewhat similar to Wolfram Alpha CoCalc (ex SageMathCloud), to use SageMath and other software collaboratively online Similar-sounding but unrelated tags Many other things are called Sage. Please use the appropriate tags. Use sage-one , sage-line-50 , sage50 , sage-300 , sagepay , sage-crm , sage-erp for various accounting and business management software by The Sage Group PLC. Use roots-sage for the WordPress starter theme by roots.io. Use amazon-sagemaker for Amazon SageMaker, a machine learning service by Amazon. Use sageframe for SageFrame, a "content management system" (CMS) on top of ASP.NET Only use the sage tag for questions about SageMath, the Sage mathematics software system. The TeX.SE website has a [sagetex] tag for SageTeX questions. MathOverflow also has a [sage] tag for Sage questions. Note also that Ask Sage , SageMath's questions-and-answers site, and sage-support , the user support mailing list, are very active and that questions asked there typically get answered faster than on the StackExchange network.
