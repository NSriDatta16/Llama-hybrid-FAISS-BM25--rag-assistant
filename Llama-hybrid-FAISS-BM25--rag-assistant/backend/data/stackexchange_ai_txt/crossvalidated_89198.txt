getModelInfo shows you the code for built-in models. grnn is not wrapped by this package, so you won't find code there. There are a lot of avoidable problems. First, you have your data mixed up: x tr[,-1] is x so y=tr[,-1] is wrong. For your code, there are a few things: the grid module should be a function instead of a data frame. That is where the attempt to apply non-function comes from. However: the arguments to the pred and fit modules do not include most of the required arguments listed on the help page. For this particular package: You might have to do something like this: grnnFit Also, for this package, you might have to use guess inside of apply . My impression is that you should slow down and read the documentation (it really looks like you did not). There are some weird things about grnn (to me) and it has almost no documentation. That should be the hard part, so read the caret web page and get the easy parts down. Max ** Update** As Max alluded to, grnn() guess() method can only compute a prediction for a single vector so this had to be wrapped in a for loop. The new working code: #Using caret() to determine the optimum value for grnn() smooth parameter grnnFit
