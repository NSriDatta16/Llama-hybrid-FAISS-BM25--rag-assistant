C# Linq-to-SQL Trying to recive multiple selects

I got this SQL code in a SP: (MS SQL 2008) DECLARE @type tinyint SELECT @type = Type FROM Contents WHERE ContentID = @ContentID SELECT [ParentContentID], [Headline], [ShortDescription], [CategoryID], [Type], [State], [DatePublished], [Name] FROM Contents INNER JOIN Users ON Users.ID = Contents.PublishedBy WHERE ContentID = @ContentID IF (@type = 2) -- Content with text BEGIN SELECT [Preamble], [ContentText], [FaceBook], [Twitter], [PrintPage], [TipAFriend] FROM ContentText WHERE ContentID = @ContentID END SELECT [ID], [ImagePath], [ImageType] FROM ContentImages WHERE ContentID = @ContentID SELECT [ID], [BoxID] FROM ContentBoxes WHERE ContentID = @ContentID I thought that i should be smart so i added a Linq-to-SQL class to my project and dragged the SP to the class. However, i can't seem to access the data from the second, third and forth select statement. I was hoping that the Linq-to-SQL class would produce 4 data tables with the information thus letting me access them like: data[2].Row[0].ImagePath. Do i have to create my own code to get the code from the SQL-server in order to get this functionality?
