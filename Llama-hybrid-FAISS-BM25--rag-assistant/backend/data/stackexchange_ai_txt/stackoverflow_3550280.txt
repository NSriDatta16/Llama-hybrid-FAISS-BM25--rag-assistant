It is not possible to "linearize" a 2D structure into an 1D structure and keep the relation of proximity unchanged in both directions. This is one of the fundamental topological properties of the world. Having that that, it is true that the standard row-wise or column-wise storage order normally used for 2D array representation is not the best one when you need to preserve the proximity (as much as possible). You can get better result by using various discrete approximations of fractal curves (space-filling curves). Z-order curve is a popular one for this application: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_(curve) Keep in mind though that regardless of which approach you use, there will always be elements that violate your distance requirement.
