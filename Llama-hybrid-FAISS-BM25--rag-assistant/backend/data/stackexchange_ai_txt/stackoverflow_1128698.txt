jQuery UI .dialog() method failing silently in IE6

I'm having some trouble with IE6 and jQuery UI. I have a popup dialog (modal, if it matters), that displays a "yes/no" dialog to the user with some information. In order to facilitate this, I build the dialog with autoOpen = false, and then I call $('#popup').show() later on as needed, in response to various different events. Now, in IE6 (and only IE6, as far as I can tell), the .dialog method will occasionally fail but STILL return the jQuery object. So, rather than show a popup, the .show() method just display a div container in the html page. What could be causing this, and how I can fix this behavior? Thanks. $('#myDialog').dialog({ autoOpen: false, buttons: { "No": function() { $(this).dialog('close'); //do stuff }, "Yes": function() { $(this).dialog('close'); //do stuff } }, draggable: false, modal: true, resizable: false, title: "Confirmation", width: "500px", zIndex: 2000 }); and later $('#myDialog').dialog('open').show(); Pretty standard. New information I'm loading the page that makes the dialog with ajax inside of another dialog, which can be repeatedly created and destroyed. Now, each time my page gets loaded with ajax, .dialog(opts) should re-instantiate the dialog div, correct? I've found that this is the scenario. 1.) An outer dialog uses ajax to replace its content with my content. 2.) My content launches a dialog that was previously created and set to not autoopen. 3.) The outer dialog is destroyed as the inner dialog is closed. 4.) The outer dialog is reopened. The inner dialog no longer is able to appear as a dialog in ie6. This ONLY happens in ie6.
