The problem with asking for a key is that it means that you'll have to prompt each time at startup (if you store the key, you have the same problem). This may be an OK tradeoff if what you're protecting is especially sensitive. In general, Chrome takes the philosophy of trusting the OS to protect the user's profile where this data is stored, so if you use local storage to store passwords, it's no different than what Chrome is doing today with password autofill, browser history, etc.
