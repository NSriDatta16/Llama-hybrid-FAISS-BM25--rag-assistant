Which tool is more suitable for visualizing the distribution of multiple real and synthetic image datasets, t-SNE or PCA?

I am doing a thesis on the generation of synthetic data for training a deep learning model and evaluating it on real data. I have a few different real datasets, and I generated multiple synthetic datasets with different parameters. I want to write a chapter with data description and would like to be able to visualize them. But I am wondering which tool would make more sense, t-SNE or PCA. What do you think?
