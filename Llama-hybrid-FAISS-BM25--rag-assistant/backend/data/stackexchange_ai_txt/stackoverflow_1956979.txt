One way you can approach analyzing you data is to try to match it too some model, generate a function, and then test its fitness to your data set .... This can be rather complicated and is probably unnecessary... but the point is that instead of generating acceleration/velocity data directly from you data you can match it to your model (rather simple for a rocket, some acceleration upwards followed by a slow constant speed descent.) At least that how i would do it in a physics experiment. As for generating some sense of velocity and acceleration during flight this should be as simple averaging the velocity from several different results. Something along the lines of: EsitimatedV = Vmeasured*(1/n) + (1 - 1/n)*EstimatedV. Set n based on how quickly you want your velocity to adjust by.
