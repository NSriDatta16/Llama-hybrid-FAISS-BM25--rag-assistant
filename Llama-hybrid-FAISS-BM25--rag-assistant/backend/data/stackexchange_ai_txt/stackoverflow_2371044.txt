Ruby methods and ordering of multiple default values

I seem to not be able to do this (which I used to be able to do in Python). Let me explain .. Suppose I have the following method in Ruby: def someMethod(arg1=1,arg2=2,arg3=3) ... ... ... end Now to call this method I could do someMethod(2,3,4) someMethod(2,3) someMethod(2) and the arguments are taken by their respective order.. but what if I want to give arg2 at some point in my programming and want the default values for arg1 and arg3? I tried writing someMethod(arg2=4) but this doesn't seem to work in Ruby 1.9. What it does is it still thinks that arg1 is 4. In python I could at least get away with this, but in ruby I am not sure. Does anyone have any elegant ideas?
