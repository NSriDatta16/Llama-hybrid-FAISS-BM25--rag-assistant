How to recode categorical variable into numerical variable when using SVM or Neural Network

To use SVM or Neural Network it needs to transform (encode) categorical variables into numeric variables, the normal method in this case is to use 0-1 binary values with the k-th categorical value transformed to be (0,0,...,1,0,...0) (1 is on the k-th position). Is there other methods to do this, especially when there are a large number of categorical values(e.g.10000) such that the 0-1 representation will introduce a large number of additional dimensions(input units) in Neural Network which seems not quite desired or expected? I am asking about general strategies.
