Your approach seems perfectly valid. Since you don't train your model on future data reserved for testing you avoid the problem of look-ahead bias. You don't have to shift your training window forward by the seven days covered by your test period because even when you walk forward by only one day you are not using any future observations for training and constructing the forecast (apart from deterministic features such as day of week etc.). A nice description of this procedure (also known as time series cross-validation ) is given in the blog post Cross-validation for time series by Robert Hyndman.
