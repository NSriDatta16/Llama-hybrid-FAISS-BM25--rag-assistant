Can I get LINQ to NHibernate for 2.1.2GA

I'm using NHibernate 2.1.2 GA. We want to use LINQ for NHibernate with it, so I downloaded LINQ for NHibernate 1.0 (the one linked to in the first paragraph of Ayende's blog http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/07/26/nhibernate-linq-1.0-released.aspx ) - but it turns out that only works with NHibernate 2.1.0 - so no good to us. Every search I do for a more up-to-date version seems to lead to links to download NHibernate 3.0.0.Alpha2 - but I can't justify using alpha software in our app, so that's not helpful either. Is there a suitable LINQ to NHibernate version?
