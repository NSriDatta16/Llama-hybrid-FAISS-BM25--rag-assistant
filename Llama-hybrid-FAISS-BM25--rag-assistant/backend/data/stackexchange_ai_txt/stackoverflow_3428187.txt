Can Selenium test my app for Mobile Safari and Android browser?

I need to test, with Selenium or a similar automated testing tool, how my webapp behaves on iPhone's Mobile Safari and on Android browser. How can I do that? I usually test my app by hand setting Safari 5 with User Agent = "Mobile Safari", I used iPhoney as well but it's too buggy IMO.
