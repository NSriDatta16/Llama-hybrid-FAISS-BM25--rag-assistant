how to detect which side of 3d cube was clicked?

I am writing a small 3d "engine" in canvas.. not really an engine, but more of an application based on code from Eric Pascarello's demo (hit number "7" a few times to see it rotating) it's all going very nice, I even added sorting by average z-value for each plane ("side") - so that I can use a body made of several cubes so that close to camera shapes are drawn last. now, I want to detect which side was clicked, when a mouse clickes the canvas. something like this hints: each side is defined by 4 (x,y,z) corners each corner is drawn to canvas using what I believe is regular "perspective projection" here's my code - it's cool: use the mouse to rotate //edit: see the code in my answer below
