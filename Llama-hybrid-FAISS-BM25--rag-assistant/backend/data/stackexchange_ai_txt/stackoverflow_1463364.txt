Smooth polyline with minimal deformation

I've got a 2D closed polyline, which is reasonably smooth. The vertices that define the polyline however are not spaced equally. Sometimes two will be very close, sometimes as many as four will be very close together. I'd like to smooth the polyline, but a regular averaging algorithm tends to shrink the area: for (int i = 0; i My polylines contain thousands of points and the angle between two adjacent segments is typically less than 1 degree. Is there a better way to smooth these curves, something which will space the vertices more equally, without affecting the area too much?
