For the moment I write my brute force calculation as a reference. Maybe there are smarter ways using more properly the properties of Bayesian Networks, but at least I get the correct answer $(d)$ . In case I find something smarter will update. We first define: $A=p(c_0,s_0,d_0,a_0)$ , $B=p(c_1,s_0,d_0,a_0)$ And note that the probability that we want is: $R=A/(A+B)$ Now: $A=\sum_{r,f} p(c_0,r,f,d_0,a_0,s_0)=p(c_0)p(s_0|d_0,a_0)\sum_{r,f}p(r)p(d_0|c_0,r)p(a_0|r)p(f|c_0)$ Note that we have $p(r)=0.5$ and $p(f|c_0)=0.5$ for every $r,f$ so that this simplifies: $A=p(c_0)p(s_0|d_0,a_0)*1/2*1/2*2*\sum_r p(d_0|c_0,r)p(a_0|r)$ Putting numbers inside: $A=0.6*0.6*0.5*(0.2+0.6*0.6)$ $B$ is a bit more cumbersome. We arrive at: $B=\sum_{r,f} p(c_1,r,f,d_0,a_0,s_0)=p(c_1)p(s_0|d_0,a_0)1/2 \sum_{r,f}p(d_0|c_1,r)p(a_0|r)p(f|c_1)$ and the four cases $(r_0,f_0),(r_1,f_1),(r_0,f_1),(r_1,f_0)$ must be considered seperately. Up to my calculations: $B=0.4*0.6*0.5*(0.7*0.2*0.3+0.1*0.6*0.7+0.7*0.2*0.7+0.1*0.6*0.3)$ UPDATE : If we first sum over $f$ due to normaliazation we can simplify further before plugging in the numbers: $B=p(c_1)p(s_0|d_0,a_0)1/2 \sum_{r}p(d_0|c_1,r)p(a_0|r)$ , leading to the simplified expression for B: $B=0.4*0.6*0.5*(0.7*0.2+0.1*0.6)$ which is equivalent to the previous one. Finally $R=A/(A+B) \sim 0.807$ , which is answer $(d)$ .
