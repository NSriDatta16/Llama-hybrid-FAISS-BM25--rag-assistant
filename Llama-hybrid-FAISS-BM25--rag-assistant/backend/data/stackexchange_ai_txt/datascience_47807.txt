Time depending images as input in a CNN

I'll try my best to be understood, thank you for reading. So this is the problem : I'm asked to predict cancer on X-ray as early as possible. The dataset is composed of images in this form img_patient1_week1,img_patient1_week2, img_patient1_week3 and that for a lot of different patient. Some of them did develop cancer and we can see the tumor growing with the weeks, and some of them didn't. I usually train a CNN for classification with images but here it's quite different since I want to predict if something is about to happen for a new patient as early as possible (week 1 or week 2) by detecting patterns while training. Maybe I should go for a CNN and a Recurrent Neural Network to create a link between the images of the same patient ? So I don't know how to do this or if it's the right way of handling it. Thank you for your help, b.
