Killing a thread

I have the following code fragment from a project I'm working on: public void Start() { Thread t = new Thread(NotifyIfNecessary); Threads.Add(t); t.Start(); t.Abort()); } What I want is that thread 't' should execute the method NotifyIfNecessary and abort only after the method has completed execution. In my current code, t.Abort() gets called prematurely.
