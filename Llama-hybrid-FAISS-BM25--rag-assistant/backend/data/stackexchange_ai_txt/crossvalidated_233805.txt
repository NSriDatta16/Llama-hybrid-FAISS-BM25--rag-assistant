You could try recurrent neural networks, where your input is a sequence of the letters in the word, and your output is a category. This fits your requirement such that you don't hand code any features. However for this method to actually work you will require a fairly large training data set. You can refer Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks by Alex Graves chapter 2 for more details. This is a link to the preprint
