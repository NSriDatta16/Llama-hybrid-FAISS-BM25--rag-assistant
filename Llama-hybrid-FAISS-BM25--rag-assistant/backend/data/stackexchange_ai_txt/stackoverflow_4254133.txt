Regarding an OR mapper, I came across OrmLite the other day. It is a general ORM tool for Java, but it also has some special adaptations that makes it work for Android . I haven't had time to test it myself yet, but it looks promising :) As for storing sensitive data on the phone, you really don't have the option of storing it only in memory (using some kind of singleton as you suggested). As soon as your application goes to the background, it can be killed instantaneously, so you have to persist what data you want to keep in some way. That being said, if you save data to Internal Storage , this will not be available for any other app on the phone (given that the phone is not rooted, because if is rooted this is easy to get around). I do believe that this same goes for data you store using SQLite, but I'm not 100% certain, so I won't guarantee it. But basically, if you are sure that your app will only run on non-rooted devices, you should be pretty safe saving your data to Internal Storage. And if that isn't good enough, there there is the javax.crypto package, but I've never used that so I can't really say anything about it.
