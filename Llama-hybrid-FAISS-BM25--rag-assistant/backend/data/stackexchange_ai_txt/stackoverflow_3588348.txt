At the root of it, STOMP appears to be TCP-based messaging with its set of commands and control characters. There's nothing in .NET that should give you any doubts about not being able to build an application or library using this protocol. If you were building a .NET STOMP library from scratch, you'd have to leverage System.Net.Sockets . Here's some sample C# code. Byte[] bytesSent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(someStringMessage); // Create a socket connection with the specified server and port. Socket s = ConnectSocket("192.168.0.101", somePort); // If the socket could not get a connection, then return false. if (s == null) return false; // Send message to the destination. s.Send(bytesSent, bytesSent.Length, 0); // Receive the response back int bytes = 0; s.ReceiveTimeout = 3000; bytes = s.Receive(bytesReceived, bytesReceived.Length, 0); string page = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytesReceived, 0, bytes); s.Close(); What doubts did you have? Perhaps edit your question with any concerns?
