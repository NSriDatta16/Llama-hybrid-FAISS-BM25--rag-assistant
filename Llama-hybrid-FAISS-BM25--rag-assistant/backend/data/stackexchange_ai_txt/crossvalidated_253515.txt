How to model a logistic regression with head to head data?

Preface I've looked at How should we convert sports results data to perform a valid logistical regression? and How to simulate head to head competition based on winning percentages? but I didn't get it to a 100%. Question We have 5 rows about head to head competition between elderly people playing bridge. We have competitor_home's age, competitor_visitor's age and the outcome (1 if home wins and 0 if visitor wins). (trying to simulate a table below). home_age visitor_age outcome 72 68 1 75 63 1 78 74 1 79 77 1 71 71 1 The question is how I would create a logistic regression model that would be able to predict who the winner is depending on home and visitor age when the outcome is always 1. My idea is to duplicate the table and switch place with visitor_age and home_age so that we get 5 outcomes with zero. Is that a valid approach? Like below. home_age visitor_age outcome 72 68 1 75 63 1 78 74 1 79 77 1 71 71 1 68 72 0 63 75 0 74 78 0 77 79 0 71 71 0 The variance is still the same.
