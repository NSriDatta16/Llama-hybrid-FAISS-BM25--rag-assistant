This stuff is really challenging to deal with. The real problem here is that you don't actualy have a process. The answer really depends on the political situation in your organisation and how much eneergy you have to drive change. In the past I have attempted to introduce process change to several organisations and it has always been a struggle. It is possible, however. I would have a look around at some methodologies for managing software development. I use and recommend Scrum, for example. In a situation with rapid change, working on short iterations that have clearly accountable goals can be really helpful. You will probably need to champion and manage your Project Manager, but it sounds like the current "process" is clearly not working, so selling a new process actually becomes easier - you have solid business case for improvement. A solid process will help you "push-back" on changing requirements. Rapid reactionary change is often a symptom of broader issues in organisational direction and strategy and it is in everyone's interest to fix this problem within the organisation.
