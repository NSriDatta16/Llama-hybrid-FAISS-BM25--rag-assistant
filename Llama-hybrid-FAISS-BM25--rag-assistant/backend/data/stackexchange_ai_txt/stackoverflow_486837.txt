As far as I can tell, tag, reviews and RSS can't be SEO. Only CMS, catalog are SEo'd But for each one you can change that in the configuration (url identifier) You should open a feature request or code your own class to do it. I don't know the core code of Magento (just enough to build small thing with it) so maybe I'm wrong.
