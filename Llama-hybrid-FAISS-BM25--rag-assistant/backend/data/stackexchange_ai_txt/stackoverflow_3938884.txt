Snow Leopard Terminal begins to execute Ruby installation upon launch

at some point after I installed Ruby on rails, my terminal on Snow Leopard began executing the configuration (?) procedure for Ruby. Last login: Thu Oct 14 21:39:51 on ttys002 /Users/Adam/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0, this may take a while depending on your cpu(s)... ruby-1.9.2-p0 - #fetching ruby-1.9.2-p0 - #extracted to /Users/Adam/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0 (already extracted) ruby-1.9.2-p0 - #configuring Any pointers will be appreciated =)
