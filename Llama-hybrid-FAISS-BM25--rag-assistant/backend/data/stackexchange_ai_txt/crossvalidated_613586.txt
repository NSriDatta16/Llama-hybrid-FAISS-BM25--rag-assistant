This answer applies for scikit-learn in python. Both logit from statsmodels and LogisticRegression from scikit-learn can be used to fit logistic regression models. However, there are some differences between the two methods. Logit from statsmodels provides more detailed statistical output, including p-values, confidence intervals, and goodness-of-fit measures such as the deviance and the likelihood ratio test. It also allows for more advanced modeling options, such as specifying offset terms, incorporating robust standard errors, and modeling hierarchical data structures. LogisticRegression from scikit-learn, on the other hand, provides a more user-friendly interface and is better suited for large-scale machine learning applications. It allows for easy cross-validation, regularization, and feature selection, and is generally faster and more scalable than logit from statsmodels. In this case, either logit or LogisticRegression could be used to fit the logistic regression model with the two indicator variables. The choice between the two methods may depend on the specific needs of the analysis, such as the desired level of statistical inference or the computational resources available.
