First off, please note that the implementation of Hook::AfterRuntime is quite fragile. While it works for many simple things, it's extremely easy to end up with very hard to debug errors. I'd recommend just writing the ->meta->make_immutable yourself, or using other approaches to get around writing it, like MooseX::Declare , for example. To answer your actual question: MooseX::Method::Signatures->setup_for($your_caller);
