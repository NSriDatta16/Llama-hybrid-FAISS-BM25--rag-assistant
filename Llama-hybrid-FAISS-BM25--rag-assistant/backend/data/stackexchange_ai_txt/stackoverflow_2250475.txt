Vacuum is like defrag, it's good to do if youve recently deleted a lot of stuff, or maybe after youve inserted a lot of stuff, but by no means should you do it in every transaction. It's slower than almost any other database command and is more of a maintenance task. We sometimes add/remove the majority of our db file, so then a vacuum would be a good idea, but I still would not consider it a part of the same transaction that did the work.
