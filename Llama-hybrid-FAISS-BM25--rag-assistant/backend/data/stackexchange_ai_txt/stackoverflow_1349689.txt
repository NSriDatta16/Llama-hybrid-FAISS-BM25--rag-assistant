Is there a nice simple & elegant way to make ICollection more fluent in C#?

Example: I would like to have the Add method of ICollection of a custom collection class to implement method chaining and fluent languages so I can do this: randomObject.Add("I").Add("Can").Add("Chain").Add("This"). I can think of a few options but they are messy and involves wrapping ICollection in another interface and so forth.
