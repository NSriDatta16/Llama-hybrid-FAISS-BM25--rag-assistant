Have a look a Vowpal Wabbit. It's an implementation of Stochasic Gradient Decent, which is very efficient for large scale datasets. If you choose the right parameters it can mimic a SVM (hinge-loss). It also includes a reduction called Error-Correcting Tournaments , which is quite efficient for multiple classes.
