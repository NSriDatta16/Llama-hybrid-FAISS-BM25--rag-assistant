Extracting intervals out of an unevenly spaced time series

I am having a list of unevenly spaced data points - just occurrences, no values - and want to split them into intervals grouping occurrences, which are close together like so: Currently I am utilizing a fairly simple approach and iterate over the ordered list of time stamps evaluating the distance to the next time stamp and place a cut at this position, if the distance is greater than a more or less randomly chosen constant. But it may happen, that there are just a few time stamps within a greater period of time, which could be treated as individuals or might get added to a prior or following group (like demonstrated in the image). Additionally occurences in the middle of two differently sized groups should be added to the bigger one in the best case, I guess, but I am currently not weighting anything as my simple algorithm only knows the past, but not the future items. The data represents single interactions of a user session and I want to estimate the count and duration of those sessions within a certain interval like a month or week without knowing, when actual breaks appear. I tried to manually optimize the splitting threshold to minimize isolated values without unrealistically stretching the intervals, but the results are not that satisfying. Could there be a kind of clustering method or another approach to this? Maybe for generating a more intelligent threshold. Any hint or literature is appreciated.
