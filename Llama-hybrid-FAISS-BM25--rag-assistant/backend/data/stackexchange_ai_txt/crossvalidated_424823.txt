Treatment effect in a balanced randomized experiment

In an ideal balanced randomized experiment where every profile's propensity score is 0.5 (under binary treatment), regardless of the value of the profile, the best we can know of the treatment effect(AKA uplift) of the given subject is ATE (Average Treatment Effect) of the entire group: This is my understanding. If this reasoning is correct, what is the point of using decision tree to estimate treatment effect of the subject with profile X because the ATE at the leaf node will be (statistically) same as that of the entire group. The following is the relevant survey paper, where I could not find answer to my above doubt: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf
