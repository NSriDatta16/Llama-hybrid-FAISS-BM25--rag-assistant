Creating New Variables in Regression

Suppose that you have daily blood pressures for each person (call this variable $x$). The outcome variable is binary ($1$ if person will have heart attack and $0$ if person will not). Does it make sense to create an $x_{\text{sum}}$ variable which is the sum of the daily blood pressures to improve the predictive power of a logistic regression model? Or would this coefficient be $0$? In general, does adding variables that are just sums/differences/products/quotients of other variables just introduce multicollinearity?
