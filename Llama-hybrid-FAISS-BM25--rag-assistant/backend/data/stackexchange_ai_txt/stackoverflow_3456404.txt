FileField.upload_to may also be a callable, per this comment in the documentation: This may also be a callable, such as a function, which will be called to obtain the upload path, including the filename. This callable must be able to accept two arguments, and return a Unix-style path (with forward slashes) to be passed along to the storage system. The two arguments that will be passed are: Since ImageField inherits all its attributes and methods from FileField , I think you could use: def update_filename(instance, filename): path_you_want_to_upload_to = "img" return os.path.join(path_you_want_to_upload_to, filename.lower()) class Foo(models.Model): poster = models.ImageField(u"Poster", upload_to=update_filename)
