Dataset and papers for baseline

I'm doing a project about Topic Detection and Tracking in text. I need to perform a baseline so I can compare existing results with mine. I read some papers where they use datasets that are not so easy to get, for various reasons. For example: They use some sort of API to get text from a website at a certain time; They use a dataset from many years ago and are nowhere to be found; They use a dataset of which they ask hundreds or even thousands of dollars for. Of course, to see if my recreation of their baseline was successful, I need the exact same dataset so I can compare mine with their results. I was wondering if someone can point me to a research paper (more is even better) where they use a dataset which is free and still available for download. And where they use it with different classifiers (Na√Øve Bayes, kNN, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.) showing their corresponding results.
