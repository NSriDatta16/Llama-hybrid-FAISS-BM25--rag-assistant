Data Science oriented dataset/research question for Statistics MSc thesis

I'd like to explore 'data science'. The term seems a little vague to me, but I expect it to require: machine learning (rather than traditional statistics); a large enough dataset that you have to run analyses on clusters. What are some good datasets and problems, accessible to a statistician with some programming background, that I can use to explore the field of data science? To keep this as narrow as possible, I'd ideally like links to open, well used datasets and example problems.
