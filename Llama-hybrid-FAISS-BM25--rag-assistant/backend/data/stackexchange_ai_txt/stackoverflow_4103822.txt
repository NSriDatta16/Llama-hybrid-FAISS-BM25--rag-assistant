Rounding down with a number. Finding the n in n.mp

Bit of an odd question. I'm using cocoa. I have a series of numbers e.g.: 0.87 0.32 1.12 2.34 8.82 12.66 and I want to get the bit before the decimal place, with no rounding. Like this: 0.87 -> 0 0.32 -> 0 1.12 -> 1 2.34 -> 2 8.82 -> 8 12.66 -> 12 I can round the numbers with no problem, but I can't figure out how to just take the 'rounded down' figure in an elegant and non complicated way. Can you help?
