Unique results from joined queries with NHibernate LINQ provider

I'm using NHibernate 2.1 with the LINQ provider and the results I get back from this query have multiple root nodes: public IList GetAllCountries() { List results = (from country in _session.Linq () from states in country.StateProvinces orderby country.DisplayOrder, states.Description select country) .Distinct() .ToList(); return results; } I know that using the Criteria API you can call DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer() to ensure that you get a unique root node, but I'm in the process of switching most of my queries over to the NHibernate LINQ provider, and I don't see an equavalient. http://nhforge.org/wikis/howtonh/get-unique-results-from-joined-queries.aspx
