Not altering the structure is certainly sound advice. I use liberal amounts of StructLayout attributes to specify the packing, layout and character encoding. Everything flows just fine. My issue is just that I need a performant and preferably generic solution. Performance because this is a server application and generic for elegance. If you look at the codeproject link you'll see that the StructureToPtr and PtrToStructure methods perform on the order of 20 times slower than a simple unsafe pointer cast. This is one of those areas where unsafe code is full of win. C# will only let you have pointers to primitives (and it's not generic - can't get a pointer to a generic), so that's why CLI. Thanks for the psuedocode grieve, I'll see if it gets the job done and report back.
