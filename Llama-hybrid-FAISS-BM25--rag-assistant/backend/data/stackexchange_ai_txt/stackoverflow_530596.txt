How to handle an error that throws an alert box and make it show an AJAX error message instead?

I'm using Django and django-voting in an app I'm making. If a user who is not authenticated tries to vote, an alert box is displayed telling them they are not authenicated. How can I catch this error and make it into a more elegant AJAX display so I can show it right on the page when it happens?
