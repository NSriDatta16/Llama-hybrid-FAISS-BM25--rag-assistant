[Completely a personal opinion] When the term 'Data Scientist' overtook 'Statistician', it is more towards sounding cool, rather than any major difference. Similarly, the term 'Deep Learning'. It is just neural networks (which is another Machine Learning algorithm) with a couple of more layers. No one can explain when a particular neural net can be called DL, rather than ML, cause the definition itself is fuzzy. So, is the term 'Data Scientist'. However, as companies are adopting the DevOps mindset to data science, the term ML Engineer evolved. What is the DevOps mindset to data science? This is where you build the model, deploy it and also expected to maintain it in production. This helps in avoiding a lot of friction in software teams. [PS: DevOps is a way of doing software, more like a philosophy. So, using it as a designation, again confuses me]. So, ML engineers are supposed to know the nuances of systems engineering, ML, and stats (obviously). A vague generalization would be Data Engineer + Data Scientist = ML Engineer. Having said that, the designations in this space are becoming vague day by day, and the term 'Statistician' is becoming more and more relevant (the irony!).
