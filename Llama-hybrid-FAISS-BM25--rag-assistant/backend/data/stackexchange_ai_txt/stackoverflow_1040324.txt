how to generate pseudo-random positive definite matrix with constraints on the off-diagonal elements?

The user wants to impose a unique, non-trivial, upper/lower bound on the correlation between every pair of variable in a var/covar matrix. For example: I want a variance matrix in which all variables have 0.9 > |rho(x_i,x_j)| > 0.6, rho(x_i,x_j) being the correlation between variables x_i and x_j. Thanks. Ok, something of a quick&dirty solution has been found, still if anyone know of a more exact way to get there, it'll be welcome. I lost my original login, so i'm reposting the question under a new login. The previous iteration got the following answer *you mean pseudo-random, that's the correct terminology for semi random – Robert Gould *Good point, but I think he meant semi pseudo-random (the pseudo is assumed when talking about computer randomness :-p) – fortran *With "correlation", do you mean "covariance"? – Svante *no, i really do mean correlation. I want to generate a positive definite matrix such that all the correlations have tighter than trivial bounds. – vak *See my answer. Do you insist that the sample correlations lie within the specified bounds, or just the population correlations that generate the sample? I do suggest an idea that may work if your problem is the former. – woodchips *woodship: no i'm afraid your solution will not work, please see my answer in the original threat (link above). Thanks.
