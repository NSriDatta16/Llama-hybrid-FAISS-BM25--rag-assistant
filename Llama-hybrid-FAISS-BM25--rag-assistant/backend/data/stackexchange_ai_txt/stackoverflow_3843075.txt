If it is a rails project, and have the ruby and rails plugin installed, it will automatically detect the rails folder as a project. Just select File -> Open Project... If it is a folder containing just ruby and javascript files, I suspect you might need to create a new project, it used to be really difficult to even open a single file in Netbeans without starting a project. You can drag and drop files from the OS into the editor, but you won't get the project overview down the left hand side.
