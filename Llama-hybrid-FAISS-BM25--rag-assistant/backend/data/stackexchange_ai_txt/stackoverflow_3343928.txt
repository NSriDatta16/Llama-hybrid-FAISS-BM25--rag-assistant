GWT doesn't work in Internet Explorer 8

Today I try to compile my first GWT project (using Eclipse). It has default 'en' location and also 'bg' location. I'm using ui.xml files with corresponding properties files. The only problem that I have is that project doesn't work in Internet Explorer 8. No problems with Firefox and Chrome. The start screen is ok, but when I upload file to my servlet and receive the response JSON something is happening and I get this JS error Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6.5; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C) Timestamp: Tue, 27 Jul 2010 12:57:53 UTC Message: Expected identifier, string or number Line: 754 Char: 26 Code: 0 URI: http://127.0.0.1:8888/infonotarywebservices/AD560C7F0D3FD1787F6B5CDB74891CDC.cache.html The row with error is: function Ox(a,b){var c,d;c=eval(b.a);d=Gv(new Bv);d.d.innerHTML=FD;(fd(),d.d).innerText=KH;Mx(a,c,d);Uu(a.d);Zv(a.d.g,d);Pv(d,true,true)} What I have to do know? P.S. The error is happening no mater what localization version I open in IE
