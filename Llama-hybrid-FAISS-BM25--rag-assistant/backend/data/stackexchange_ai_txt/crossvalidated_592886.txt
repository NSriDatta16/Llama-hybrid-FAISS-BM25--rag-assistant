Machine learning online course recommendation for self-studying?

I'm looking for more machine learning online self-study materials. I have taken Andrew's CS229 course , and participated few Kaggle competitions and found that they are very good self-studying materials, and love them very much. I want to go deeper into math and, at the same time, train myself to apply machine learning techniques well in more real-world problem practice (like Kaggle competitions and research). Books or projects are welcome as well! I really appreciate all of your suggestions!
