How to decide the padding size and stride size in CNN

In CNN in 2d, what situation is the size of the padding and stride changed in? So far, I could make sense of the basic concepts with padding and stride. Padding and stride can be used to adjust the dimensionality of the data effectively. https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/padding-and-strides.html On the one hand, the examples I had confirmed seemed to use padding = 1 and stride = 1 . My question is Using padding = 1 and stride = 1 is the basic and common method? What situation do we adjust padding and stride size to over 1 in?
