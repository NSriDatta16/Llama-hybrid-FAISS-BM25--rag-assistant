What is the intuitive sense of the expected value of the sum of two random variables

I completely understand what is the intuitive sense of the single R.V mean. However, I was solving a math problem to find the expected value of the sum of two independent random variable, which is can be found by $$\mathbb E[x+y] = \int (x+y) p(x) p(y)\, dx \,dy\tag 1$$ So I said, yes it makes sense, since we want to find the expected value for both of the two random variable. Then I criticized myself by two points What does both mean here? That two of the event occur? That is the product of the two R.V not the sum! So it makes sense to write an equation for $\mathbb E[x+y] = \int (x+y) p(x) p(y) \,dx\, dy$ If we write the equation $(1)$ as $\mathbb E[x+y] = \int x p(x) p(y)\, dx \,dy + \int y p(x) p(y) \,dx\, dy$. What does each term mean? What is the meaning (if we take the first term) of finding the average of random variable $X$ over the probability of $X$ and $Y$? I did not find answers to those questions.
