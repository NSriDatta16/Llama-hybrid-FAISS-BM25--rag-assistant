If you're primarily interested in blogs, what I think we need is a way to prioritize the information that we, personally , are interested in. There used to be an RSS reader called wTicker (now demised) that used Bayesian filtering to rate articles for you. Another product under development, Particls , would similarly watch what you read and highlight similar content. What about other types of information, though? For example, the tasks that OneNote or EverNote, or more obscure tools like Zoot aim to facilitate?
