Use #pragma for organization You can use: #pragma mark Foo ... as a way to organize methods in your source files. When browsing symbols via the pop up menu, whatever you place in Foo will appear bold in the list. To display a separator (i.e. horizontal line), use: #pragma mark - It's very useful, especially for grouping together delegate methods or other groups of methods.
