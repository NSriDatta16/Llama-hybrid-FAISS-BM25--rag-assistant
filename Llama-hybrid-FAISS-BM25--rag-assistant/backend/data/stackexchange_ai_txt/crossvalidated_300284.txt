Chebyshev's Inequality

A certain type of light bulb has an average lifetime of 10,000 hours. The SD of bulb lifetimes is 470 hours. What fraction of bulbs could last more than 10,705 hours? I think the correct answer should be 2/9. My reasoning: k = 705/470 = 3/2. So upper bound is 1 / (3/2) ^ 2 = 4/9. But then I divide it into 2 because it is the the fraction of elements that are k*SD from the mean. So I believe that 4/9 is the fraction of bulbs that could last below than 9295 (10000-470*3/2) or more than 10705 (10000+470*3/2) hours. But the book shows 4/9 as the correct answer. Why I'm wrong?
