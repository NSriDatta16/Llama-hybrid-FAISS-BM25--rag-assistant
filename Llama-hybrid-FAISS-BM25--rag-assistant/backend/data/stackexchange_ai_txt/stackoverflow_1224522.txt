If your ultimate goal is to make copy and paste of text more difficult, Javascript and CSS are not the right technology because you cannot disable the browser's view-source function. Some other ideas (none of them ideal): a java applet (you control both display and retrieval of text) same in a different browser plugin (flash, silverlight, etc.) server-side created images (poor performance)
