First off, have you verified the code is working with other email servers? Some time ago someone mentioned they were having problems with certain servers accepting http requests with the Indy TIdHTTP component. The reason was they had Indy included as part of the useragent: Request.UserAgent := 'Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Indy Library)'; When they removed Indy Library it worked. Evidently there have been some malignant web services created with Indy, so some sites will refuse connections from applications created with it. I am not sure if the component you are using has any sort of UserAgent property. But if it does, null out any references to Indy.
