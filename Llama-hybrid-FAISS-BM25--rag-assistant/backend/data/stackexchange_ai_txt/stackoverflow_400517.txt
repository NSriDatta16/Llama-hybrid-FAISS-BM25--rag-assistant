TFS Structure - Multiple Projects or Single Project?

Our small development shop is looking to migrate our projects from VSS to TFS, and we're evaluating TFS vs. others (haven't pulled the trigger quite yet). The nature of our software shop is such that we have 100+ projects in VSS ranging from small one-man-show projects to massive enterprise-wide applications. We are trying to determine how to structure our projects in the transition and have, for the most part, decided on putting everything into one project site/system with each project having a subfolder off the root. With this type of setup, we are concerned that we will lose a lot of the functionality that TFS provides (bug tracking, scrum burndowns, reporting, document storage etc.) because all the projects will be in the same portal/project space and it will be difficult to separate out individual project tickets/items. Does anyone have experience with this? What was your solution? Did you stick with TFS?
