I was able to solve this on my own, but not in as elegant a way as I wanted. Essentially, what I do is keep a member variable to track whether or not I have inserted SECTION_ACTIONS into the tableview. Then when SECTION_FILES is modified I do: [tableview beginUpdates]; [tableview insertSection SECTION_ACTIONS]; self.showingActionsSection = YES; [tableview endUpdates]; or [tableview beginUpdates]; [tableview deleteSection SECTION_ACTIONS]; self.showingActionsSection = NO; [tableview endUpdates]; Luckily, doing it like this allows me to get nice smooth animations as things are added and removed. However, it makes UITableView datasource behave a little differently than I am used to.
