The main point for doing this is so that objects created within the function's expression can be utilized from properties and methods attached to passed in objects, without exposing those objects publicly. This can aid in preventing variable collisions. It also allows for variables created to be accessed as private storage for anything that is attached.. (function($){ //jQuery is available here as $ var myPrivateArray = []; //this is private $.addItem = function(item) { myPrivateArray.push(item); } })(jQuery); //I can't access myPrivateArray here... //but I can use jQuery.addItem to add something.
