You could have a look at some of the tools that come with erlang/OTP. It doesn't have all the features other people suggested, but some of them are quite handy, and built with a lot of experience. Some of these are, for instance: Debugger that can debug concurrent processes, also remotely, AFAIR Introspection tools for mnesia/ets tables as well as process heaps Message tracing Load monitoring on local and remote nodes distributed logging and error report system profiler which works for distributed scenarios Process/task/application manager for distributed systems These come of course in addition to the base features the platform provides, like Node discovery, IPC protocol, RPC protocols & services, transparent distribution, distributed built-in database storage, global and node-local registry for process names and all the other underlying stuff that makes the platform tic.
