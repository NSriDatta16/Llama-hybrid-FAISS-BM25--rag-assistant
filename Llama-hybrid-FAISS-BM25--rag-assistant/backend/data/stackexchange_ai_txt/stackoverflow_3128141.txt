You need to handle IE differently for dynamic-generated content. See this article, http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;293792 In my code, I do this, if(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) AND ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']=='contype')) { header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); exit; } This problem may also explain slowness you mentioned because your page actually sends the whole PDF multiple times without this logic.
