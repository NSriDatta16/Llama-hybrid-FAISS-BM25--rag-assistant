PrivateFontCollection giving me symbols

I am adding the font using GCHandle pinnedArray = GCHandle.Alloc(data, GCHandleType.Pinned); IntPtr pointer = pinnedArray.AddrOfPinnedObject(); CustomFonts.Fonts.AddMemoryFont(pointer, data.Length); pinnedArray.Free(); But when I use it for a label, it just shows up as a bunch of letters(when running). I have turned on CompatibleTextRendering. I am trying to embed "Visitor". When I use it without embedding it, it works fine. But I want to embed it as it is not a standard font. Edit: Just tried using AddFile and that works. No idea why adding it from memory is failing.
