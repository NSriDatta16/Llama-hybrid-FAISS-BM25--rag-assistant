Please notice that your loss oscillates between 175 and zero. In which case I would look for potential problems in the code with respect to loss calculation batch size (increase) train/validation set split strategy (stratification wrt class) In a more general sense: size of your network may be small activation function saturation (avoid saddle points - use relu) learning rate normalisation before training I hope these are helpful as a starting point. I would like to also point to this resource wrt training and fine tuning a deep learning model . Hope this helps!
