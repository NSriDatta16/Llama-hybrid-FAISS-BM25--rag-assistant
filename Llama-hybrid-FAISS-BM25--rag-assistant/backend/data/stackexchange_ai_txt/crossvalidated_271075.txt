I just spoke to a great econometrician he informed me the following: In Granger test, we factor out the auto-correlation coefficients, and hence we only focus our attention on the cross-correlation coefficients. Therefore, we may find significance in the cross-correlation diagram but not in the Granger test because the cross-correlation does not factor our the auto-correlation. However, it would be better to test for significance coefficients in the VAR models.
