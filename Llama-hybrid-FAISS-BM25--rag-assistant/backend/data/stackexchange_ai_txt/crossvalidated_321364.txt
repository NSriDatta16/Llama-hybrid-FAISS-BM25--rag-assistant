spatial non-stationarity, spatial durbin model "in differences" and bounds testing

I have two spatially correlated series. Basic tests indicate spatial non-stationarity of both, but no cointegration ( Lauridsen & Kosfeld, 2006 ). Does anything speak against differencing all variables once spatially (including the lags), and then applying bounds testing to the "unrestricted" error correction specification in analogy to time series ( Pesaran et al., 2001 )? And would impact calculation ( LeSage & Pace 2009, pp. 275-304 ) still be necessary in such "in-difference" regression?
