Is it possible to plot decision boundaries for only a subset of features?

I have a sklearn Random Forest classifier with 59 features as input. I'd like to plot the decision boundaries of only two features at indices i1 i2. If I use the average/median values for the remaining features, the classifier ends up in a path that ignores the features i1/i2. I'd like to plot the decision boundary of i1/i2 while ignoring the remaining features. Is this possible? or useful at all?
