All of those methods have hyperparameters, are you sure you use reasonable values for the hyperparameters? Scikit-learn has nice article on them. Not much can be said without access to your data and actual results. What you could do, is to just produce a lot of all kind of plots and summary statistics for all of the parameters, grouped by the classification results to try to understand what is going on. It is useful to look at the raw predictions as well, you can just take something like ten least anomalous and ten most anomalous samples (as classified by the algorithm) and compare them, how do they differ? You can check the Interpretable Machine Learning book by Christoph Molnar that is freely available online for more ideas and description of most advanced methods for interpreting the results.
