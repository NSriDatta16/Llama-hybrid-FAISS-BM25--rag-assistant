How to compare two Bayesian networks?

I have two different datasets on which I've applied the same learning (K2) algorithm to learn a Bayesian network. I have the conditional probability table (CPT) of the class variable, for each of the two Bayesian networks learnt. I want to compare the two CPTs, and want to be able to say that there is no significant difference between the distributions, something along the lines of statistical significance. I've heard that computing p-values might be a good way to quantify the difference, but I'm not sure how to implement it for this case. What method would one recommend for this?
