I think this is very subjective, and you are likely to receive lot's of different opinions, so here's mine! :) Nested namespaces - good . One large namespace - horrible . The above is with real world in mind (i.e. very large code bases). For the sake of preventing RSI, consider short namespace names! ;) EDIT: An example, and it's highly subjective, other people will have different approaches... let's say you work for company foo, in Java, typically you start with com, so instead use foo namespace foo { } Now all your company's code is in one namespace, next consider any shared stuff: namespace foo { namespace com { // any communication stuff goes here namespace msg { // let's say you have some form of messages that you send } // msg namespace con { // wraps all your connectivity } // con } // com namespace util { // utilities // you may not need to break this up further } // util } // foo Now let's say you have project bob, give it it's own namespace in projects namespace foo { namespace proj { // all projects are here namespace bob { // all bob's stuff is here, break it up as you need (though I wouldn't bother unless you have hundred's of classes where collisions are likely), I'd rather organise the files in the file system appropriately and keep the classes in the same namespace. } // bob } // proj } // foo
