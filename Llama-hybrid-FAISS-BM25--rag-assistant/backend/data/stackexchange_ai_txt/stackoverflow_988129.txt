Where do I read about the "Value Pattern" and other typical "low level" design patterns?

The Gang of Four, Uncle Bob, Extreme Programming and Alt.net are great for high level enterprise level programming methodologies. However, I find they refer to these "primitive" design patterns for which I need a learning source. Where would I read about these primitive software engineering concepts? For example, a " Value Pattern " would typically use an operator like "==" for primitive data types and .equals() for objects. The Value Pattern will have other standard stubs like .hashvalue. It would be nice to fill in the gap between C# programming and learning these higher level design patterns like Abstract Factory. Either that or these concepts are pieces of other bigger patterns like the "Iterator Pattern".
