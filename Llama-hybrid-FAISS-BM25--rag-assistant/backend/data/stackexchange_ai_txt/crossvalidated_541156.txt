From the ACF and PACF, what are the non-seasonal and seasonal part of the model here to find an appropriate ARIMA model?

I am working on a monthly average dataset and would like to do forecasting. I had used the codes ndiffs() and nsdiffs() to check how many differences are required to make the series stationary, which gave an output of ndiffs(y) [1] 0 nsdiffs(y) [1] 1 then the seasonal difference at lag 12 was taken. diff(lag = 12) %>% # seasonal difference ggtsdisplay() The ACF and PACF that was displayed are attached here. Can you explain how to interpret the ACF and PACF and what are the P,p,Q and q values here?
