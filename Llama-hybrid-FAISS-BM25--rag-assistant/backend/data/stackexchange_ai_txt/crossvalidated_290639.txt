Clustering a list of similar categorical words and phrases in python

I am trying to cluster a list of words/phrases in the context of similarity (not semantic). I have a large dataset of categorical variables. In a perfect world, the categorical variables would have a limited number of unique types ( WASH DISHES, CLEAN HOUSE, REMOVE GARBAGE ) and this would be easy to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise as people have entered the data in a sloppy way. For example the entries could be variations of those words such as ( DO DISHES, WASH DISHES, CLEANUP, CLEAN HOUSE, THROW AWAY GARBAGE, etc ). The noise can also include spelling mistakes and symbols/numbers. My current approach is to see the by value count breakdown of words and phrases, and essentially see what the most common ones are throughout the dataset. I then use this knowledge to manually determine the rough categories and compare the individual entries to the general categories using a string comparator metric and cluster in this way. This works relatively well. My question is whether there is a more elegant solution where I do not have to manually analyze the most common words/phrases and be able to cluster autonomously. I have considered using KNN, but would it be possible to apply it in this case? If so, then how would I go about it?
