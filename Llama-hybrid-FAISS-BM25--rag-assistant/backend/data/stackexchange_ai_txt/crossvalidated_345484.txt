I disagree. In ARIMA modelling "parsimony" is important/key so it becomes necessary to knock out highly insignificant AR/MA terms. Also helps to guard against overfitting. If diagnoses of pacf/acf reveals a large spike at 12 and at 1, why would you estimate a full AR(12) with 10 insignificant parameters with all the knock on effects on the SE's and coef estimates? I always knock out highly insignificant terms using the AIC/BIC and residual diagnostics as a guide and haven't really had many problems at all. It does take longer to fit though, but that is worth it in my opinion, to obtain a parsimonious model. (I'd be less concerned (slightly) if I was forecasting.). So, IMHO, it's not bad practice to knock out AR terms etc ....and you can develop a sensible model as long as you go about it sensibly. Or you could just switch to Structural Time Series Models instead.
