Personally, I'm not a fan. I agree with most of what Charles Miller says about it being broken by design . It does solve some problems, but it also introduces others . Ant is far from perfect, but it is a lot more robust and far better documented. It does take some discipline to use it in a modular way though (which is one of the things Maven is trying to address). I think that inventing something better than both Ant and Maven wouldn't be that difficult, but that tool doesn't seem to exist yet. If you like Maven's dependency management but not Maven, you can get something similar in Ant using Ivy . My problem with this style of dependency management is that is fragile due to factors outside of your control. The one use case where it does make some sense is if you have lots of projects internal to your organisation that depend on each other. In this case everything is under your control and it might work quite well. EDIT : I forgot to add that even if you don't like Maven, you can't ignore it. If you write open source libraries that other people use, they will expect them to be available in a Maven repository so that they can use them easily from their Maven builds. EDIT2 : Since you've clarified that your main interest is in providing an Open Source library to other Maven users, it's worth noting that you don't necessarily have to use Maven to achieve this. There is a set of Ant Tasks for publishing to a Maven repository . So, if you want to continue using Ant to build your project, you can do but still satisfy your Maven-using users.
