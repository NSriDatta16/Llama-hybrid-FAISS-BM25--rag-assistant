I can't speak for all organizations, but as a hiring manager where I work, yes. I am really interested in experience with MVC in general. The specific technology / framework doesn't concern me as much as the fact that you understand what a model/view/controller framework is good for, and when to use it. That said, if I see RoR and Python/Django, I'm probably going to pigeon-hole you as a front-end developer and push you towards the web apps division as opposed to our infrastructure division.
