What more are you after? The general idea is that the ListBox will call into your IList when it needs data. it will ask for an item at a specific index and you pass back an object. it then, presumably, calls ToString() on that object and displays the result in the list. What that actual object is and where you pull it from is completely up to you. You might be using a really large array in memory. You might be pulling from IsolatedStorage or a web service. You could certainly use it to pull file info, but I don't suspect anyone has a ready-built IList implementation so that's the part that you will have to implement based on your specific project.
