Well, I do processing.js in pure javascript code without bothering with the Processing syntax but it should go something similar: Make the objects that you want draggable adhere to a Draggable interface, the draggable interface indicates what is draggable and provides a method to move an object When drag starts, see if there is a Draggable object under the mouse that you want to drag, store it locally and use the Draggable interface method to move the object around. This way your local dragging code is generic to any Draggable object and objects handle their own movement. On drag end, remove the Draggable object from your local store (and stop calling its move method). You could pull out this entire dragging logic into an external file as well, as long as you hook it into the correct mouse events.
