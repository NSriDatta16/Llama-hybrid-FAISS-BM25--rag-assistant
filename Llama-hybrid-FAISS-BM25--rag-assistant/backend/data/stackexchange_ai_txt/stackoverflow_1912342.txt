Does it have to be pure software? If not, you could look at a solution which does decryption and storage of the key on a hardware device, e.g. a USB dongle. You can also potentially prevent the whole problem by having your software retireve the data from a web-service instead of a data file. In this case you can control access to the data much more tightly (i.e. who gets how much of what and when). This might or might not work for your application. Otherwise as others pointed out, there is no known good pure software solution.
