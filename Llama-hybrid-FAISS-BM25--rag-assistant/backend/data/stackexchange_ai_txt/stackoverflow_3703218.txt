Is there an AJAX function that can just GET a rails partial?

My controller is shared by links from a search result page that needs a layout, and from the profile page itself that does not need a layout. What I would like to accomplish is a single controller method show that is both capable of drawing the partial by AJAX from the profile page, and draw the partial and layout from the search results. The most important restriction I have is that I can not set the dataType: to script . It has to be html . So I can't use that spiffy AJAX script call that renders the JS without the controller's format.html getting involved. tabs_controller.js def show @organization = Organization.find(params[:organization_id]) @tab = @organization.tabs.find(params[:id]) respond_to do |format| format.html { render :partial => 'tab', :layout => 'myHQpage' } format.js end end javascript $.get($(this).attr('href'), null, null, "html"); show.html.haml = render :partial => 'tab' What AJAX function can I use here that just draws the partial, and not the entire layout?
