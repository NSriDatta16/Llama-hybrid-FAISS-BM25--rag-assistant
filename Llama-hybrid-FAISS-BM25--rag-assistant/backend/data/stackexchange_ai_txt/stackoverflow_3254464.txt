Depending on your dialect of SQL, using a subquery along these lines might be what you're looking for, in case I understand correctly what the numbers mean: SELECT tt.hometeam as team, avg(tt.odd1) as average, max(tt.odd1) as best, tt.bookmaker as best_odds_bookmaker FROM 2_team_table tt INNER JOIN ( SELECT bookmaker as maxbookie FROM 2_team_table ORDER BY odd1 desc LIMIT 1 ) as a ON tt.bookmaker = a.maxbookie UNION ALL ..... ( same thing with awayteam and odd2 ) UNION ALL ..... ( same thing setting the first col to "Draw" and using oddX ) BUT REALLY you're much better off doing something like this in some scripting language, and it'll ONLY work like this if your table only contains two teams, one event, which is very unrealistic.
