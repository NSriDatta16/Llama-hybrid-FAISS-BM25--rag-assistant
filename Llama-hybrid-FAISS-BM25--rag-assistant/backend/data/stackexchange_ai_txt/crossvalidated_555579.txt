I don`t agree that seasonality is a type of non-stationarity because the concept of stationarity in natural systems already incorporates the idea of fluctuation within an unchanging envelope of variability (Milly et al., 2008). Speaking about hydrological time-series, even though they are stochastic (random process) and commonly have seasonality, that is, they contain wet and dry periods, they will always be stationary if the mean and the variance do not change over time. So, ignoring the uncertainties of the effects of climate change, a hydrological time series should normally be stationary even though it still has seasonality. This is why stationarity is a widely accepted concept for civil engineering design, and because of this concept hydrologists are able to calculate the recurrence time of floods, for example.
