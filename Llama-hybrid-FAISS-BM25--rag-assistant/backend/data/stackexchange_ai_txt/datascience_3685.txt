Based on my cursory understanding of the topics, associated with your question, I think that Gephi (the original gephi.org link redirects there) should be able to handle neural network dynamic visualization . It seems that, in order to achieve your goal, you need to stream your graph(s) with corresponding weights. For streaming , you most likely will need this plug-in . UPDATE : You may also find useful SoNIA software .
