This is not a keystroke you can simulate. It's called the "Secure Attention Sequence". Here's how to invoke it FROM A REMOTE DESKTOP (XP+ solution): include IShellDispatch4 *pShell; CoInitialize(NULL); HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_Shell, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_IShellDispatch, (void**)&pShell); if(SUCCEEDED(hr)) pShell->WindowsSecurity(); CoUninitialize(); The only solution to invoke it from the local desktop is to use SASLib. It's not public. Write a note to saslib@microsoft.com to request it. EDIT: Wait! You want to lock the machine? Just call LockWorkStation() !
