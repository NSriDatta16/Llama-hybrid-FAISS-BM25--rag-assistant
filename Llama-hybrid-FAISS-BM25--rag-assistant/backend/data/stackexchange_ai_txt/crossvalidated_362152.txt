The data, responses, that you have can be modeled more generally than a probability distribution. A probability distribution is always normalized to 1 while your data contains more information, it also has a magnitude. I think that a more general type of function would also be better since in that case (if the function stems from good arguments well) the model seems to link closer to a physical interpretation (which is more intuitive) rather than using a phenomenological model (Note: The Weibull distribution does have a physical interpretation when applied to processes that generate size distributions, e.g. a process that randomly breaks bigger pieces into smaller pieces, but in the case of the application here, the shape of a response impulse in a time series, it has no clear meaning) Modelling with simple exponential function. Your data can be reasonably described by using a series of exponential functions. $$Y(day)_{response} = 286*e^{-\frac{day}{3}}-269*e^{-\frac{day}{7}}$$ more precise coefficients are 286.254*exp(-0.1536516*day)-268.6887*exp(-0.3326013*day) For your information the Weibull function in the graph is a = 163.7235 k= 1.4914 l=0.1098 weibull found by using the nls function Physical interpretation These kind of exponential expressions may be interpreted in terms of a differential equation with two parameters ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-compartment_model ). E.g. you can imagine a (auxiliary/not measured) variable $X$ which is the amount of people that do not know about the campaign which slowly decreases once the campaign advances. $$\dot X = -c_1 X$$ and the variable $Y$ is the amount of people that create a response. Which gets filled up by a fraction $f$ from the people from $X$ that get to know the campaign but decreases because people loose interest: $$\dot Y = fc_1 X -c_2 Y $$ these have the solution: $$\begin{bmatrix} Y(t) \\ X(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Y(0)-Q \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} e^{-c_2 t} + \begin{bmatrix} Q \\ X(0) \end{bmatrix} e^{-c_1 t} $$ with $Q = f X(0) \frac{c_1}{c_2-c_1}$. Note: you may, of course, argue for different models as well based on other (better) ideas about the change of $Y$. E.g. the decay of $X$ is not necessarily exponential as prescribed by the equations here, or other factors than this $X$ as the pool of people that do not know about the advertisement might be included (I just came up with this model after making the exponential fit and as a possible physical explanation). Temporal effect In the above figure I have marked every sixth day of the week in the color red. This is to emphasize that on top of the exponential model there seems to be some weekly pattern. You can see this by the red marked dot being the relatively low point in a weekly (7 day period) pattern that moves around the trend which is the modeled function. It could be possibly to incorporate this pattern or temporal variation into the model as well (I do not think it is possible with some simple auto correlation and moving average model, although I might be mistaken, and I would model it with some additional correction function on top of the exponential function or by fitting some computational model, ie. solving the differential equations with $c_1$ and $c_2$ being time varying parameters). You should be more clear about the data for this to work out. For instance is the average done on time sequences that always start on the same day? Or if it is corrected then how is this done. Describe more exactly the data, and make some plots or show some descriptions (possibly it is out of the scope of a Q&A to get to the bottom of this). Splitting the data The analysis would greatly improve when you fit to the individual curves instead of the average. In that way you can see better the validity of the model increase the complexity of the model (currently the degrees of freedom is low since the large amount of data is reduced to only a single time series) obtain information about the variation/distribution of the parameters and the error distribution (which provides more insight than the variation of the output, and this is what you can use to make predictions with estimates for error) and also you might group the data and investigate how the model parameters may be a function of other variables, for instance the type of campaign.
