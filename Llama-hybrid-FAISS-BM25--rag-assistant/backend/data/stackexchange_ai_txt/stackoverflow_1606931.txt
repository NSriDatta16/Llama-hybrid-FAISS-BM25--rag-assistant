$options = array( 'http' => array( 'user_agent' => 'Firefox wannabe', 'max_redirects' => 1, 'timeout' => 10, ) ); $context = stream_context_create( $options ); $content = file_get_contents( $url, false, $context ); Take a look at stream_context_create and HTTP Context Options . The above code will set a timeout on the connection, and will allow for one redirect. This should prevent reaching the timeout. The long delays may be caused by the network or by the remote server having a firewall denying you to grab too many files at once or by a flaky DNS server or router on the path to the remote host. As a suggestion, you should cache locally the downloaded files, so on the next refresh files will be handled locally instead of the big wide net.
