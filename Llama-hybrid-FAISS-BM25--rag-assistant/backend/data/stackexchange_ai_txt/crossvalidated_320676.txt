What dimension mean in context of convolutional layer?

This table describe neural network architecture and I don't understand what exactly dim (dimension?) column means for convolution and residual layers. Is this just multiplication of dimensions of layer? Like 4x8x64 -> 2048 ? Then how such network can preserve constant dim after all these conv layers with stride 2x2 (which cut in half 2 dims)? Also is this correct Stack Exchange site for such questions?
