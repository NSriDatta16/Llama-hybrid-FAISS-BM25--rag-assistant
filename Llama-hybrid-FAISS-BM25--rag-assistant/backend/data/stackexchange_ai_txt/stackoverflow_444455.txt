FindControl in Infragistics webDataGrid

I have ig:TemplateDataField that contains label. In InitializeRow event handler I try to find that label with e.Row.FindControl but I get null. I was not able to find another way to find my label. How to look for controls in WebDataGrid rows during InitializeRow event?
