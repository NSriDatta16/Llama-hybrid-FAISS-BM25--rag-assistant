For what you seem to be trying to do, image replacement is an extremely outdated method. All the ninja-devs are using technology called @font-face for their fonts and font replacements. It's simpler, doesn't require anything to happen on the server and text on the page can be modified dynamically. You can use services like http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ or http://code.google.com/webfonts for ready made font packages. If you have a custom font (that you have a license for) you can create an @font-face package for it, using fontsquirrel's @font-face generator: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator And then you just define your fonts in the CSS. Simple, elegant and works in 99% of browsers (yes, even IE6) Cheers!
