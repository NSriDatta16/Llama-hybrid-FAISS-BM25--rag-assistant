When LASSO selects only parts of a categorical variable?

I want to use LASSO to construct a model and then run a logistic regression on the variables LASSO selects. However, LASSO selects only parts of some categorical variables that I put into it. Does that mean I should dichotomize the categorical variables and only use those that LASSO selected or should I include the entire categorical variable in my regression model?
