Error Handling flexibility

We all know that we can use exception wrapping (and catch it later where needed). However, what I would like to implement (and elegantly) is distinguishing the types of errors after the stored proc is invoked. I have p_error field where stored proc dumps its errors. It could be validation error(where validating against DB can't be avoided), or authorization error (we do that in 2 places, one of which is DB), or a SQL error. In short I need a pretty and elegant mechanism to distinguish between the type of error before throwing an exception. Two approaches I thought of: On the database level have 3 error fields: 1 for authorization, 1 for SQL error and 1 for any other errors. This could get hairy. Creating an error struct (enum?) where error messages are stored and later can be compared against. Again, too wordy. what if a error message in db changes...to hard to maintain. Any other ideas?
