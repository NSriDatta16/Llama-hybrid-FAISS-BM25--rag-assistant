You want to have 2 different .gwt.xml files - one used for development and one used for production. There is a good example on the 'Renaming modules' section of Developer Guide/Organizing projects . The gwt.xml file used for development would inherit from the gwt.xml file used for production and set the user.agent property as well. e.g.: Now, when doing development, you would use the development gwt.xml file, and when doing a production build. you would use the production gwt.xml file. The easiest way to achieve this with Maven is to activate the development module using a profile. I've written in detail about this at Maven Recipe : GWT development profile .
