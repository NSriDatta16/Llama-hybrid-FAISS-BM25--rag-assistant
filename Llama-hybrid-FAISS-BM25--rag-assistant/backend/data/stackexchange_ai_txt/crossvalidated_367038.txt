When I was new to Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMCs), I always started by drawing the Transition Diagram before the Transition Probability Matrix . I still find it helpful. Perhaps this will help. Edit: For completeness, the Transition Probability Matrix is straightforward from the picture. Let the state space be ${0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$ . $$P = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & p & 0 & 0 & 1-p \\ 1-p & 0 & p & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1-p & 0 & p & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1-p & 0 & p \\ p & 0 & 0 & 1-p & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$
