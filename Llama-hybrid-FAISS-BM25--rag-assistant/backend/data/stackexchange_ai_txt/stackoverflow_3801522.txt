My answer to the original question and to anyone else that may have this problem: I was having this same problem, images in my app that people saved to the SD card were not showing up in their Gallery immediately. After some searching I found this one line of code inserted after my 'save to sdcard' code that fixed the problem: sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED, Uri.parse("file://"+ Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())));
