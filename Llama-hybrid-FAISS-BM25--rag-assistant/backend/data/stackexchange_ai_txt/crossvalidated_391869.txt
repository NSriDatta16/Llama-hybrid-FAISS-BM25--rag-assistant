How to interpret probability of an outcome in a multivariable logistic regression?

I am modeling a binary outcome with multivariable logistic regression, where all predictors have been found significant, but I am particularly interested in one (continuous) predictor. I would like to plot/make conclusions about the probability of the outcome as a function of this predictor. How do I take into account the other predictors when I try to make a plot or an interpretation of the result?
