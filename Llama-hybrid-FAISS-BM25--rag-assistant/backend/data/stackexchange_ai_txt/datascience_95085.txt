Just doing another online course, reading some stuff online or adding stats knowledge to fill your self-perceived gaps is not expected to solve anything. On the one hand, almost all online classes teach only the basics and probably not add anything for you. On the other hand additional stats knowledge or fancy stuff like self-driving cars is often of limited practical relevance. My general advise is to start with the goal in mind . That is, think about your career and personal development path first and then find the right building blocks supporting that path. A mentor or good career coach(*) can help with this. Similarly, I'd discuss with your employer what your development plan is. Having said that and generally speaking, I think digging into recent research papers in relevant areas or participating in data science competitions are 2 (not mutually exclusive) potential paths to pursue. However, beware that current research might be of limited practical relevance to your work but it brings you up to speed with regards to state-of-the-art methods. While competitions have a strong feature engineering- and model-focus, they are highly practical and can add something to your portfolio/CV. (*) Beware that the coaching market has been flooded with many not well-trained amateurs
