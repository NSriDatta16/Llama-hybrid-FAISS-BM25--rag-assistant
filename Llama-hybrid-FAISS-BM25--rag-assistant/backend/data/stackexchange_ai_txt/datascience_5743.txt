I haven't seen this mentioned, but it's important to keep in mind that you may see a decrease in salary. I say this without knowing how much you make, but moving from (I assume) an experienced IT professional to an entry level data scientist level may not earn you as much. Here's a link to the a portion of the 2015 Burtch Works study on Data Science salaries: http://www.burtchworks.com/files/2015/05/DS-2015_Changes-in-Base-Salaries.pdf As you can see, the median salary for level 1 individual contributors is 90k (across the nation). The full report has the breakdown based on region but again, assuming you're an experienced IT professional, you're probably making more than that. Anecdotal story with n=1: One of my classmates in my DS masters program was an experienced Java developer with a house, family, etc. Although he was very interested in data analytics (paid for the program out of pocket) his potential salary doing data analytics wouldn't be able to support the lifestyle he currently had as a Java developer. As a result he essentially "wasted" his degree and went back to development. I would really hate to see that happen to more people.
