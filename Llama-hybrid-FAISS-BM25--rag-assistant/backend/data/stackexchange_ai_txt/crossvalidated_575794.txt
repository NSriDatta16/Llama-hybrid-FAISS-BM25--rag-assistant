Probability for a bin in a binned histogram

This question is very basic, but I cannot figure the error in my thinking. According to the author of the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", we can get the Probability Distribution Function of a distribution in the form of histograms by "simply divide $n$ (the number of observation for one bin) by the total number $N$ of observations and by the width $\Delta_i$ of the bins to obtain probability values given by" $p(x) = \frac{n_i}{N\Delta_i}$ I simply cannot get my head around how this give me the probability for a specific bin. $N\Delta_i$ is basically the sum of the area of every histogram. To calculate a relative frequency of one specific bin, why do we ignore the width $\Delta_i$ in the nominator, which would equal to the division of the area of one bin over the whole area.
