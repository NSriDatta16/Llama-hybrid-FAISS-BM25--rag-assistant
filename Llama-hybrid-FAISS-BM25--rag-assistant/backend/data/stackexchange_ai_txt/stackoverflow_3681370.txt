Does anybody know of a really good 3rd Party Treeview Control for C#

I am involved in a project where I have the need for a really rich treeview control. The application is written using WinForms in C#. The treeview control in .net seems to be fairly limited. It is lacking in several ways: multiselection, can't select multiple nodes at the same time poor drag support for repositioning items Poor label editing support Poor support for control over how all the elements are drawn & custom painting(everything from the + next to the node, the little dots that make up the tree, icons and text) I will likely end up having to write my own from scratch but before that happens I though I would check to see if any 3rd Parties have seen an opportunity here and beat me to it.. Thanks for any advice.
