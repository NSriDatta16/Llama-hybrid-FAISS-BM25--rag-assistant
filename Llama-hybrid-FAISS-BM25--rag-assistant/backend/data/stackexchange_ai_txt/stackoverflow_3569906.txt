Infragistics HOWTO:UltraWinGrid Layout Initialization http://devcenter.infragistics.com/Support/KnowledgeBaseArticle.Aspx?ArticleID=1692 From the article: "When the DataSource property of the grid is set to a source of data, the InitializeLayout event fires. The UltraWinGrid expects grid layout initialization to be performed inside this event. This does not mean that you canâ€™t tweak the layout at other times, but most of the layout-related properties should be set inside the InitializeLayout event."
