Will something terrible happen if my data points aren't independent?

Suppose I run a bunch of experiments, and get a bunch of datapoints, but several of the datapoints were derived from the same experiment. (In the extreme case, I just repeat the same datapoint 10 times.) Suppose I want to perform a statistical analysis on these datapoints, like a linear or logistic regression, or something more sophisticated. How would the non-independence of data affect my analysis? What steps would I have to take to correct for this effect?
