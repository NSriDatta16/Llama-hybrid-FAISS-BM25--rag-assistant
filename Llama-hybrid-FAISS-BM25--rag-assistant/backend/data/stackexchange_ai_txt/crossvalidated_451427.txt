Original source of often used pic for deep learning

I wrote a blog post on neural networks some time ago: https://blog.ephorie.de/understanding-the-magic-of-neural-networks In it, I used the following pic: It is a pic that is used quite often, with varying sources... none of which seems to be the original source. Does anyone know who created this pic?
