The naming guidelines are available here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002.aspx As Mehrdad said, prefixes are specifically discouraged . That said, they are just guidelines more than hard rules. Personally, I use an '_' prefix, but only for private members that directly provide the backing store for a public property, and then the names will otherwise match exactly. There's no specific guidance for constants, so the Capitalization Conventions rules probably still fit.
