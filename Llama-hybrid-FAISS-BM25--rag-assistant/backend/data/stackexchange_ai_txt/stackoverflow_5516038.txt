I know this sounds silly, but the only way to open a file for writing and not to truncate it is to open it for reading as well: if you're really doing ios::in | ios::out | ios::binary , it should work. (But since you obviously reentered the code, and didn't copy/paste it, I'm not sure if this is really what you did.) Other points you have to pay attention to when trying to seek: The file must be open in binary mode, and imbued with the "C" locale. (IMHO, a file opened in binary mode should ignore the locale, but this isn't what the standard says.) Both `seekg` and `seekp` have the same effect; using either changes the position of the other. The only function which allows seeking to an arbitrary location is the two argument seek; the one argument form can only be used to seek to a position previously obtained by a tell.
