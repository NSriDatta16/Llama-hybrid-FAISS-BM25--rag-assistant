No. To make it easier for comprehension, we may consider the discrete case, where 'p(x) is maximum' refers to the event that takes place most, while 'Most probable value of x weighted over p(x).' (expectation) refers to the average value. In a extreme case if you have a dice with four '0's and two '1's, the value of x for which p(x) is maximum is clearly $0$ and the most probable value of x weighted over p(x) is $1/3$ , which is even not a value you would ever see in any cases. Also, it's actually a bit confusing when you say "Most probable value of x weighted over p(x)", for the term "Most probable value" itself means value of x for which p(x) is maximum. I guess you are trying to refer to the expectation.
