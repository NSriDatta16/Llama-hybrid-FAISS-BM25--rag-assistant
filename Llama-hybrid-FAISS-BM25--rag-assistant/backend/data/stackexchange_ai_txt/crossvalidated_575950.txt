Find a linear scale factor and offset that minimizes total variance between two observed data sets

I have two discontinuous observational datasets that should roughly match up after linear scaling is applied to one and its offset is adjusted. They will not follow any kind of trendline, so techniques like linear regression may not minimize total variance. For example, 1,2,3,2,1 and 102,104,106,104,102 have zero variance if the first set is scaled by 2 and then an offset of 100 is applied. My goal is to find the formula producing 2x+100 among two wandering real-world datasets. Currently I linearly regress both sets and use the difference in x value and offset to rescale one of the sets to match the other, but I'm not sure if this is ideal as neither set is linear and goes up and down like a moving average.
