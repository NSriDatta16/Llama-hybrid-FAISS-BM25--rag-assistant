If I understand your question correctly, you have 2 sentences and you converted those sentences into 2 vectors, you want to know how those sentences are similar. If this is the case use cosine similarity between 2 sentences and cosine similarity is a scalar not a vector its the dot product of your 2 embedding vectors. from numpy import dot from numpy.linalg import norm cos_sim = dot(a, b)/(norm(a)*norm(b)) where a and b are your vectors. There is direct formula as well: from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity cosine_similarity(vector1,vector2)
