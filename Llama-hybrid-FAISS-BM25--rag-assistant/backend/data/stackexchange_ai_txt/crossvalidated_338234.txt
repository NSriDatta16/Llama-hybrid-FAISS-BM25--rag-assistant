what's the difference between seq-to-seq and many-to-many?

I'm trying to build a model to forecast multi-steps ahead time series data like stock market data. And I found out that many precedents projects are done with many-to-many RNNs, not seq-to-seq. Is there any reason for that? And what's the difference between those two algorithms?
