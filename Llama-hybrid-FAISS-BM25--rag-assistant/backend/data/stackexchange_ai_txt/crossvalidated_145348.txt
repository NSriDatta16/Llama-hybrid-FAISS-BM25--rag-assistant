If your outcome variable has only 2 possible values, then you should consider logistic regression . This procedure uses the log of the odds of one of the 2 possible outcomes as the equivalent of a dependent variable in standard linear regression, with your other variables (age, sex, ethnicity, status of SNPs, etc) as the independent variables. As in standard linear regression, the independent variables can be continuous or categorical. Unlike standard linear regression there is no closed-form formula to calculate the regression coefficients; programs to calculate logistic regression optimize the coefficients to best match the observed data. The glm function in the R computing environment provides tools for logistic regression. This page shows some examples of how to proceed. As @Tim notes in a comment, however, you will not be able to identify causal relations, only correlations.
