$H_{ii}$ is small for large $n$ The magnitude of the diagonal of the hat matrix $H$ decreases quickly with the increase of the number of observations and scales as $1/n$ . If we have the matrix $X$ such that the columns are perpendicular then $$H_{ii} = \frac{X_{i1}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^n X_{j1}^2} + \frac{X_{i2}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^n X_{j2}^2} + \dots + \frac{X_{ip}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^n X_{jp}^2} $$ The mean of the diagonal will be equal to $p/n$ *. So the size of the inhomogeneities that are due to the contribution of the diagonal of the hat matrix $H_{ii}$ , is of the order of $\sim p/n$ . Diagnostic plots are often with large $n$ For a diagnostic plot one often has a large $n$ (because few points do not really show much of a pattern) and then the contribution of $H_{ii}$ to the variance of $e_i$ will be small and the variance of the $e_i$ will be relatively homogeneous. Or at least the $H_{ii}$ won't contribute much to inhomogeneity. The effect of $H_{ii}$ is negligible and the reason to not use studentized residuals is simplicity. *The trace of the projection matrix equals the rank of $X$ , and since the rank is often the number of columns $p$ we have $$\sum_{i=1}^n H_{ii} = p$$ Which means that the average $H_{ii}$ is equal to $p/n$
