In addition to the already excellent references provided above, I'd like to suggest the paper Markov chains for exploring posterior distributions (with discussion). by L. Tierney. It is one of the most influential MCMC theory articles of the 1990s, which carefully studies the assumptions needed to analyze the Markov chains and their properties (e.g. convergence of ergodic averages and central limit theorems).
