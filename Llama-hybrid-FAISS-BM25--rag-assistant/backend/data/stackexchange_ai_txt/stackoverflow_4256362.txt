That's going to depend on the OS and filesystem but generally speaking you won't see a performance hit if you reference the file by the full path. Where you might have problems is with maintenance scripts and such having to read a giant directory listing. I always find it better in the long run to organize a large amount of files into some kind of logical directory structure.
