The "Output File Folder" under Properties->Devices is greyed out, but the [...] button just to the right of it isn't. Adjust it there. NOTE: To clarify, You click on the [...] button and you get a dialog that allows you to select a folder from the device ("Location of output on device") and enter an additional subfolder ("Subdirectory"). Now it may seem that you're forced to use a specific folder here, but one of the dropdown options is "Root Folder" which is "\". You can then add your folder, like "Storage Card" as the Subdirectory and get a deployment folder of "\Storage Card". Intuitive? No. But you can construct any output folder you want.
