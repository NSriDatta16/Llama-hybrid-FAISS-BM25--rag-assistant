You can imagine there is a probability distribution over all possible sentences. The goal of language modeling is to accurately model $p(x)$ , for any sentence $x$ . In other words, if I randomly draw a sentence from this distribution of all sentences, what is the probability that it'll be sentence $x$ ? (I say sentence here, but you can language model anything from trigrams to entire books.)
