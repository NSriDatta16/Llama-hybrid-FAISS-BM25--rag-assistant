I think you have to assume some sort of distribution. It seems reasonable to assume that ACT ability is normally distributed (that's a good guess as to the distribution of a variable like this) but yours is clearly truncated. That is, you've got too many scores at the top and the ACT is too easy a test to accurately distinguish a lot of the students. And the results are rounded. You can do this with the truncnorm package in R. It requires the mean, sd, and upper and lower cutoffs. The mean should be the same as the median (32) but you'll have to play around with the sd to get approximately the right distribution. Here's a start on such a program: install.packages("truncnorm") library(truncnorm) set.seed(1234) roundset1 However, I played around with this a bit and did not find anything close to your desired distribution, so maybe it isn't normal after all. In addition, any attempt at estimating the lower ACT scores will require a huge sample size. Even at the largest universities, most of those scores will have no people. EDIT: The comment says the mean ACT is 20 and sd 5 for the whole population of test takers and that it's normally distributed. Now, your school is clearly way above average. So, first, let's generate a large sample with mean 20 and sd 5, then take samples the size of your college class that are random samples from a specific portion of the sorted version of that class. Let's say there are 1,000 people in your class, then something like this: set.seed(1234) pop You might have to pick a non-random sample from the population.
