Have you tried using periodogram methods, such as Welch's method? If the 'other stuff' is variable in frequency over time, where as the desired signal stays constant in frequency over time, then there are better estimates of the spectrum than DFT on the entire dataset. Welch's method takes several DFTs on a sliding window of your data, and averages them together. I don't know enough about your data to answer your second question. Perhaps you should post an example plot? If you have several step functions then the nonlinear least squares model will take forever to solve unless there is another relationship in your data that I am not aware of.
