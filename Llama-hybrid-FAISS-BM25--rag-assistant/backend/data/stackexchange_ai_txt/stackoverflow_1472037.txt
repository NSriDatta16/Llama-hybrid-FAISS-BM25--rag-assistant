Parsing \"–\" with Erlang re

I've parsed an HTML page with mochiweb_html and want to parse the following text fragment 0 – 1 Basically I want to split the string on the spaces and dash character and extract the numbers in the first characters. Now the string above is represented as the following Erlang list [48,32,226,128,147,32,49] I'm trying to split it using the following regex: {ok, P}=re:compile("\\xD2\\x80\\x93"), %% characters 226, 128, 147 re:split([48,32,226,128,147,32,49], P, [{return, list}]) But this doesn't work; it seems the \xD2 character is the problem [if I remove it from the regex, the split occurs] Could someone possibly explain what I'm doing wrong here ? why the '–' character seemingly requires three integers for representation [226, 128, 147] Thanks.
