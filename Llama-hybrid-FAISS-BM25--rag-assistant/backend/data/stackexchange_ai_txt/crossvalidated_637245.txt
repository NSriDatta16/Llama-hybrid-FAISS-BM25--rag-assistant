Missing data and maximum likelihood

I've heard it said that maximum likelihood estimation is an alternative to imputation methods for missing data. Does that mean any model fitted using maximum likelihood such as logistic regression, Poission regression, generalised linear model etc.? If that is so, then is a complete case analysis (i.e. retaining only rows with no non missing values for all variables in the model) followed by any model fitted using maximum liklihood robust to data missing at random? This is how most software would run the analysis anyway. It doesn't seem that simple to me as then, why do all these fancy imputation methods exist?!
