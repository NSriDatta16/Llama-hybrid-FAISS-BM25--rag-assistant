The db server isn't the only thing that caches data. The operating system has it's own caching system as does the hard drive you're accessing. That's the reason you're seeing performance increases on subsequent calls. To establish a baseline you could go from cold booting to running the query. This is a tedious process (I've done it myself on large, complex queries) but a cold boot will make certain that no data is cached. You can also simply throw out the first query, run ten or more of your test queries back to back and take the average as your performance benchmark. You can also run the query many more times in sequence, even after cold boot and take the average. This is a good idea anyway to see what changes under different circumstances such as page faults, spikes from other applications (which you would want manually replicate) etc.
