time series in R multiple companies yearly sales data

I have 2010-2017 annual sales and total assets data for 100 different companies from pharmaceutical, dyes, chemicals industries. I have following questions: kindly help with the best way to fill the missing values (for example some companies do not have data for 2009 and 2016, some companies do not have data for 2011 etc) how can i use time series modeling in R to fit a model for how (i) this year's sales depend on previous years' sales data for all industries and differences across industries and (ii) this year's total assets depend on past year's data for all industries and differences across industries lastly to fit a model sales at time t being dependent variable and sales of previous years+total assets of this and previous years as independent variables can we use normal sales and total assets values or normalize it through some ways Thanks, IP
