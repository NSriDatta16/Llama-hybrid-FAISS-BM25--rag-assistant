Why does the formulation of the SVM problem has the bias (something we try to optimize) as a part of the constraint?

The common formulation of the SVM problem is $$\min_{\theta, \theta_0}\frac{1}{2}||\theta||^2$$ $$\text{ subject to: } y^{(t)}(\theta \cdot x^{(t)} + \theta_0) \geq 1, \ t=1,...,n,$$ However, it seems to be unnatural that $\theta_0$ (something we try to optimize) is a part of the constraint, but it doesn't appear in the objective. Is this natural?
