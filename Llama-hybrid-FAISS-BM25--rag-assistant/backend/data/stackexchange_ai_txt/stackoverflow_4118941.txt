Flight Simulation is one of the more complex examples of real-time simulations. The understanding of fluid dynamics, control systems, and numerical methods can be overwhelming. As an introduction to the subject of flight simulation, I recommend Build Your Own Flight Sim in C++ . It is out of print, but seems to be available used. This book is from 1996, and is horribly dated. It assumes a DOS environment. However, it provides a good overview of the topics, covers numerical integration, basic flight mechanics and control systems. The code examples are simplistic, reasonably complete, and do not assume the more common toolsets used for graphics today. As with most things, I think it is easier to learn the subject with a more basic reference. A more advanced text (college senior, first year graduate school) is Principles of Flight Simulation provides excellent coverage of the breadth of topics involved in making a flight simulation. This book would make an excellent reference for anyone seriously interested in flight simulation as an engineering task, or for more realistic game development.
