Chi-square and R: Calculate matrix of statistical significances between results

First of all, I would like to apologize if this is an duplicate of an earlier question. I find it hard to believe that I am the first person to ever have this sort of problem, but I am so far out of my comfort zone that I do not really know what to search for (I have tried of course). Me and my partner are a doing bachelor thesis, where a part of it have been creating an artefact in the domain of information retrieval and natural language processing . We have run a series of experiments with this artefact with several components or flags activated. In total, 32 experiments were conducted since five different flags were set on of off in all possible permutations ($5^2 = 32$). Originally, we would have thought that we should only test if any result was statistically significant compared to the setting were all flags were disabled. Our supervisor told us however that we should compare all results to each other, to see which of the flags would generate a statistically significant difference to each other. Since this would make 496 comparisons ($31^2/2$), this is far more than what could be done by hand. Our supervisor recommended using R or pystat for simplifying the task. We have however no previous experience of either of these, all tough getting into R didn't seem to complicated, but we still don't know how to get the requested data. Our current results from the experiments are in the following form (not all experiments); True Positives False Positives False Negatives True Negatives No Flags 174 879 2541 13224 E 303 2051 2412 12052 EF 301 1955 2414 12148 F 219 1211 2496 12892 S 224 1332 2491 12771 SE 304 2112 2411 11991 We want to see if certain flags yields an improvements in F1-score over others, in other words, if true positives increases and false positives and false negatives decreases. When calculating out F-Score, we use an unweighted F1-score were precision and recall are equally weighted I have come as far as exporting the results into a CSV file and loading the file in a R script, but I do not know how to process it from there. How would we go about this? It can be worth mentioning that we will display the results as their F1-scores, but as far as we understand we cannot compute statistical significance directly on a F-score compared to an other F-score.
