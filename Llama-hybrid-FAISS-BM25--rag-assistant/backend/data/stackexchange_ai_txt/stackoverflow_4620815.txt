Adding a click event to each of the paragraph tags created by the lettering script will give you the element that was clicked on. Then you can use either prev or next method to get the letter before or after the letter that was clicked. $(document).ready(function(){ $("h1 p").click(function(){ alert($(this).prev().html()); }); }); I worked up an example that will show an alert with the previous letter. http://jsfiddle.net/5n5vJ/
