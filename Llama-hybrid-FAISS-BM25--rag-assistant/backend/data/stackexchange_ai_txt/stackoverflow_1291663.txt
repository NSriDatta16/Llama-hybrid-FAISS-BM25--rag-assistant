If it's just you that will EVER maintain the stuff, it's a matter of when the complexity gets to the point where you find yourself searching for things. That would be the time to refactor and reorganize (there's a cost to reorganize, just as there's a cost to not reorganize). If it's POSSIBLE that anyone else will maintain a project that includes your utils, you have to consider THEIR pain point when deciding when to reorganize. Theirs is MUCH lower than yours.
