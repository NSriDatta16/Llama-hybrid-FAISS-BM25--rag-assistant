I think this is language and implementation specific. I know in C++, if you do a #include, that's as good as doing a copy and paste of the file it is #including. So when you do that you're essentially bringing in any imports... as long as it doesn't clash with the entities in the namespace it should be fine. Just make sure that each *.h file you have has a #pragma once or that #ifndef section to it. In Java, you'll have to be explicit. From my personal experience it will require declaration of all types been used. Not sure about the backend but at least my IDE complains, which I believe comes straight from javac.
