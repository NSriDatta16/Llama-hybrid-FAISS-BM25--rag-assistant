What Model would best be suitable for my dataset?

I am kind of overwhelmed with the amount of models there are so finding the one that best suits my dataset is proving kind of difficult. The Dataset I have is as follows , its produced by a Radar, which outputs a row of values for a signal that it detects for a target. Plotting across the row gives me the following wave, and as we go below the rows, we get the translation in the x-axis suggesting movement of the target, my dataset that I want to feed the model will have the following features: The average value of the two peaks for signal strength, the x-axis average value (multiplied by .77 meters), this will be the case for all of the waves for each target as each # of target will have these waves associated with it, tracking the movement of these waves shows the distance change, the change in amplitude and so on Shows the translation of x-axis showing movement I am currently working on a script that will try and get all the times when the radar detects something and get the amplitude column values and fill in the dataset, if I can't get the script to work I will just do it manually: Link to what the Radar outputs https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJOebiXuScjLPytemulcXph7ZB1X65wU/view The model that I will use will be different than what the radar outputs This is how I want to set the dataset for the model Reference images to what I referred https://i.stack.imgur.com/hZ1gp.jpg I might also add another column that gets the average velocity of those points since we have time, distance given by the Radar. I will have a similar dataset for pedestrians as well, the first dataset was for vehicles, but there will be one for pedestrians as well, I want a model that can predict, once the training is done if the target was either a pedestrian or a vehicle given the features. What model would best fit this sort of data, a top 5 list would be super appreciated! Thank You
