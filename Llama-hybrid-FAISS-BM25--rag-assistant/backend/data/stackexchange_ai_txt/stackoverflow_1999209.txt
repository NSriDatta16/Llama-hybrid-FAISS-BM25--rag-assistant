GAC'ing 4.0 assemblies

I have built a dll with VS2010 targeted for framework 4.0. When I try to gac the assembly (either by drag drop the assembly into the GAC folder or by command line using gacutil), it does not give me any error. It says that the assembly was successfully added to the cache. But I am unable to see the assembly in the GAC folder. Wont it show up in GAC? Have they changed the GAC structure with VS2010? The assembly is signed properly.
