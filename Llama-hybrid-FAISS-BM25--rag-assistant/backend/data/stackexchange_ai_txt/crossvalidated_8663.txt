Chi-squared versus logistic regression

I used summary.formula from Hmisc with continuous Age and binary outcome O with test=TRUE . This returned a p-value for Age predicting O (if I understand this correctly). I then ran a glm using Age and O (univariate logistic regression), which returned a different p-value. I thought that the p-value should be the same? Edit: library(Hmisc) summary.formula(Outcome ~ cut2(Age, seq(15,75,10)), method="reverse", test=TRUE) p-value = 0.8 x = glm(Outcome ~ Age, family=binomial(link="logit")) p-value = 0.4 (I'm getting quite confused: the example above which gives the 0.8 p-value is binning the ages, but I was told that the p-value it returns is for all the ages. However, if I run the summary without the binning, the p-value is 0.5.)
