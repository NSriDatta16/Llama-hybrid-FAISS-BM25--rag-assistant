How would I determine whether the differences I see in accuracy are actually significant?

I have a machine learning based NLP system. I run this system on set of sentences I obtained from different groups and I then measured my system's within group performance. Table summarizes these results: GROUP_NAME TruePred FalsePred Accuracy GROUP1 87 32 73.11 GROUP2 8 5 61.54 GROUP3 27 3 90.00 GROUP4 9 0 100.00 GROUP5 19 5 79.17 Well, system achieves 79% accuracy on sentences obtained from GROUP5 but for example it only gets 61% accuracy for group2. I want to know if those pairwise differences are statistically significant or not. What am I supposed to do to determine this ? Thanks in advance.
