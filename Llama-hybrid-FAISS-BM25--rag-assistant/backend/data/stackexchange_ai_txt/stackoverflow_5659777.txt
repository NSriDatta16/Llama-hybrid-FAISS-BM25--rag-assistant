From Ragepotato's answer and your comment about needing to see roughly what the interface would look like while resizing, as long as you don't have your objects dynamically re-locating themselves (like a Wrap Panel ) - you could take a screenshot of the window contents and fill your frame with it. Set it to stretch both height and width, and you'd get a (slightly fuzzy) idea of what a particular size would be. It wouldn't be live while resizing, but for those few seconds that probably wouldn't matter..
