Negative lower confidence limit in beta regression?

I fitted a beta regression on some proportion data using the betareg() function from the betareg package. The proportion was scaled using the ad-hoc scaling procedure recommended in the betareg vignette (Section 2; 1st paragraph): vignette("betareg", package = "betareg") My sample size is $n = 4$ , which I know is very limited. After plotting the residuals I saw evidence of heteroskedasticity and decided to include the precision parameter $\phi$ into the model. After that the residuals looked fine and I wanted to get the estimated marginal means of the model using the emmeans() function from the emmeans package. There I saw that one of the lower confidence limits extends into the negative (only for the model that includes $\phi$ though). My question is, is that possible given the beta distribution? Below a reproducible example: df m2 Note the negative LCL for P2 : emmeans(m2, "A") #A emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL #P0 0.2044328 0.03557230 Inf 0.13471239 0.2741532 #P1 0.3453680 0.07860826 Inf 0.19129859 0.4994373 #P2 0.1722369 0.09659308 Inf -0.01708209 0.3615558 #P3 0.2335368 0.07133364 Inf 0.09372545 0.3733482 #Confidence level used: 0.95 For comparison the emmeans for the model without $\phi$ : emmeans(m1, "A") #A emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL #P0 0.2386583 0.07473188 Inf 0.09218648 0.3851300 #P1 0.3506016 0.08650745 Inf 0.18105014 0.5201531 #P2 0.1157728 0.04966404 Inf 0.01843309 0.2131125 #P3 0.2407182 0.07502464 Inf 0.09367255 0.3877638 #Confidence level used: 0.95
