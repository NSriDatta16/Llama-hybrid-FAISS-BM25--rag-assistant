I tried the web-view test, and unfortunately it seems the same as the browser. Here is some data for captured touchmove events drawing a letter a. The duration of both is similar (663 vs 672) and all units are in miliseconds. "iPhone_via_browser_times": // (in ms from the touchstart event) [0,104,125,136,151,167,183,199,215,231,247,263,279,295,311,327,347,357,372,391,407,423,439,455,503,519,535,551,567,583,603,615,631,647,663] "Android_via_webview_times": // (in ms from touchstart) [0,56,140,195,252,336,392,449,531,615,672] "Android_via_browser_times": // (in ms) [0,105,161,217,300,356,413,497,553] Android via webview polls on average every (672/11) 61ms Android via browser polls on average every (553/9) 61ms iPhone polls on average every (663/35) 19ms But I have other data from other Android devices where the polling is worse.
