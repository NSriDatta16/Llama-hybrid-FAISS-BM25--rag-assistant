As far as I can tell, in your example you run the function once without snow , and twice with snow . There is an added overhead in running processes in parallel, especially when you add the infrastructure of foreach . So the average time per execution is less than if you ran them serially, but you can't expect the same overall time when you split things up. So you are incorrect in saying "result is even longer than without using doSNOW". In fact, if you ran the first one twice, it would take almost twice as long. So snow has indeed improved the performance. This is a fair comparison: system.time(for(i in 1:2) process(table)) system.time(foreach(j=1:2 ) %dopar% process(table)) Think of it this way: suppose you have two people who can each independently do a task in 1 minute. Let's assume that if one person does multiple tasks, there is additional overhead. But if you ask them to work independently, it takes a little longer for them assemble their results together. If you ask one person to do two tasks, it will take 2 minutes. If you ask each person to work separately, then it will take a little more than 1 minute in total because they need to communicate at the end.
