Of course, yes. I'd prefer to create a function: function isMobileBrowser($user_agent = '') { foreach (array('Windows CE', 'PPC', 'Smartphone', 'IEMobile', 'Opera Mini') as $mobile_browser_ua_snippet) { if (stristr($user_agent, $mobile_browser_ua_snippet)) { return true; } } return false; } You suggest to extract array of substrings of mobile browsers user agents from the foreach Then, in your code, depending on what do you use to output HTML, you do a simple condition like: if (isMobileBrowser($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) { include 'mobile_navi.inc.php'; } I'd also suggest to create mobile version of your whole website. Let's say your sites domain name is mysite.com, you create mobile version at m.website.com and then you just redirect your mobile visitors to m.website.com just like this: // THIS CODE SHOULD REMAIN **BEFORE** ANY OUTPUT!!! if (isMobileBrowser($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) { header('Location: http://m.website.com'.$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']); } Or you can do it in apache's mod_rewrite (You will have as many RewriteConds as mobile brosers user agents substrings). I believe it's able to be done in nginx configuration file as well.
