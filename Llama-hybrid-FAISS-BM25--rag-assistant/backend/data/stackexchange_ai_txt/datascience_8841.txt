oversampling plus down sampling using smote not working on random forests

I am trying to solve a classification problem on a highly imbalanced data set. I am using SMOTE to over sample the minority samples and down sample the majority ones. After creating a balanced data set, I applied the random forest model. But, the prediction error for the minority class is extremely high even after using a balanced data set. What could possibly be going wrong? library(DMwR) new.data
