Ranking algorithm of different weighted resources

I have a list of items that represent cells, now i query each cell value to get a set of possible categories that this cell might belong to, these categories are weighted. For Example: Microsoft is: {Software=83.543266, Video Game Platform=132.297455, Degree=71.624733, Organization=208.17038, Programming Language=66.998901, File Format=67.159828} apple is: {Physicist=50.008327, Organism Classification=145.239532, Video Game Platform=86.5653, Computer=60.457172, Organization=199.53299, Record label=53.477039} Banana is: {Musical Group=27.214769, Organism Classification=136.063583, Writer=27.566528, Musical instrument=29.285137, Organization=36.962833, TV Program=32.693085} Blackberry is: {Software=23.69421, Organism Classification=64.572891, Operating System=90.257011, City/Town/Village=16.836142, Computer=34.484653} The weights that i get for each result are independent at cell level, so Microsoft having a very high confidence as an organization does not relate to the confidence score of Apple organization confidence. Now i have two problems, the first is to compare two different cells and compute a similarity score, for example how similar apple is to Microsoft having these possible categories for each. Second, i want to deduce a global common category for the column that represents these cells, for example if i run a simple algorithm that will calculate the number of categories occurrences and the average of their confidences will not be accurate. I will appreciate any help.
