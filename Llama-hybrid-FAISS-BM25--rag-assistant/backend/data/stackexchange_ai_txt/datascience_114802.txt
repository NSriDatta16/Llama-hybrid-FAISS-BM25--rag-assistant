Your question does not necessarily apply to transformers but to machine learning in general. A question I can answer is: What is the difference between feature selection and machine learning? The distinction is that humans might not know what features are important, and algorithms may also not be able to understand what information is relevant, so we let the model attend to what it finds important. (What it finds important is implicitly learned through the training objective). Side Note: What a model finds important can be affected by its architecture. Convolutional Neural Networks have a locality bias because they use kernels that run over the input, calculating a value based on other nearby values. While transformers have no bias, and attend to everything equaly (again due to the architecture, i.e. how values are calculated). If your task requires looking at the importance of nearby values then a CNN might train faster and need fewer data since it already has the bias, while the transformer will have to learn it.
