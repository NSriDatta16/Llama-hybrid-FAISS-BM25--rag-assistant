How to run XGBoostregressor using reg: tweedie as objective?

I installed XGBoost for anaconda on windows 10 based on the instructions provided here . It seems that xgboost 0.6 is already installed. It performs well using " reg:linear ". However, if I use " reg:tweedie ", this error is reported: xgboost.core.XGBoostError: b'[23:08:27] src/objective/objective.cc:21: Unknown objective function reg:tweedie'
