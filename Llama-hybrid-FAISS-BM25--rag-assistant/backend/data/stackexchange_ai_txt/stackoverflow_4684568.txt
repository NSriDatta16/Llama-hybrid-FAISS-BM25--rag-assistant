How to connect draggable divs

I have some divs that I clone and can drag and drop in a area, now, I want to connect by lines the divs and if I move the divs, this lines must move too. Something like a flow diagram, I clone the divs using drag and drop, but still don't know how to do this lines. Thanks!
