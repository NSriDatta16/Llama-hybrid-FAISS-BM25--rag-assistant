modify BuddyPress adminbar only in admin pages

I have modified the buddypress admin bar by creating the following plugin which adds a simple text link to the bar: function bp_adminbar_currentsite_menu() { global $bp; ?> EXAMPLE LINK TEXT However, I do NOT want the above link to be shown when logged into the wordpress admin backend (so for example when an admin is editing a post). I thought about just doing a php_self check to see if it contained "/wp-admin/" but figured that there has to be a more elegant wordpress/buddypress hook here. How can I get the above code to only show when you are viewing a normal blog page, NOT in the admin area? Thanks
