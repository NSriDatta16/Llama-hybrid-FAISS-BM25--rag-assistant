Embedding the css into the webpart is fine if you never ever plan to change the CSS for the webpart. I would recommend you include the css in either a separate file stored in the style library or change a css file linked in the page layout or master page (such as core.css). Just define unique classes for your webpart if required and leave the definition of how that renders to each website. This allows different areas of your SharePoint implemenation to show the same webpart in different ways. The means you will never have to release a dll in order to change a minor look and feel issue.
