I only saw this question today, but if you can, send me some tests that throw the ClassFormatError when running with EMMA, and I will try to find the bug in JMockit. By the way, have you tried to use JMockit Coverage? Just add jmockit-coverage.jar to the classpath, and see what you get. Typically, this will produce (without any extra configuration) a nice HTML coverage report in the "coverage-report" dir under the working dir. It can't get any easier than that!
