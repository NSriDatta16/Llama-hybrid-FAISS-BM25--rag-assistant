When can we exclude random effects?

Random effects are useful for accounting for variance between groups (e.g., students within schools; patients within hospitals) or avoiding cases of pseudorelication with repeated measures data. But, technically, one could imagine many ways in which data could be grouped even if the intent wasn’t a blocked or repeated measures design. For e.g.: If you measured every school in the province on some average metric, but didn’t have in your dataset some geographical variable to delineate where these schools were, would one need to worry about this? My point is that there are potentially numerous random effects that could be included in any design (as data can often be seen as grouped), but to me this is different than an explicit multi-leveled sampling design (patients > hospitals > counties > states). At what point does one “draw the line” on including a random effect?
