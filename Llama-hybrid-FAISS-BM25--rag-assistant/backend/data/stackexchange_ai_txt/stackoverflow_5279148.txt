android honeycomb menu button target

I am trying to get my app to be backward compatible so i need to show the menu button since we used the menu button in our app on previous versions. So I was reading and it says that if your target is 11 (3.0) than you don't get the menu button but it your target is 10 they you do. But the issue is I am using fragments so my target has to be 11. Any thoughts.
