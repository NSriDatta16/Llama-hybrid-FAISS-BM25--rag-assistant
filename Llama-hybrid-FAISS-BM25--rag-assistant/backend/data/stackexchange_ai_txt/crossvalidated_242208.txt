A time series at the very least requires a time measurement, as well as measuring a dependent variable that changes as time passes. In your case, your variable of interest would be the occupancy rate. You would need to reorganize the dataset into something like the following: Time # of Cars in Parking Lot Parking Capacity % Parking Capacity Filled Price 7:00 10 100 10 15 Then you would have a table of each time stamp and its respective measurement of occupancy rate, which is a time series. Then you can use time series modelling. So yes, it is possible.
