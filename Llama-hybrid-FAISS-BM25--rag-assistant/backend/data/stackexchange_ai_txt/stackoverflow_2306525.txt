This page (from the Flex docs) has one approach: Loading style sheets at run time . By loading style sheets at run time, you can load images (for graphical skins), fonts, type and class selectors, and programmatic skins into your Flex application without embedding them at compile time. You might also find something useful here: AS3 Runtime Font Loading .
