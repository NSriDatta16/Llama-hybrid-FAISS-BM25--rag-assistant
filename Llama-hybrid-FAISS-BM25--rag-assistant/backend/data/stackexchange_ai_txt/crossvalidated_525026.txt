How to convert high to low frequency data

I have data for a macroeconomic variable, and it has monthly frequency but I need to work with it in quarters. Is there a statistical method to perform this frequency conversion that ensures the least possible loss of information? Something like a "temporal aggregation" (if that means something). My time series is unemployment rate, i.e. it is a ratio. Or an average will make it good? If so, which type of average should fit best? Also, my purpose is to be as statistically rigorous as possible with the treatment of data. Thanks!
