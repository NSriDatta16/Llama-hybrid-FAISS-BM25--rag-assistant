Calculate the Probability of a call being answered

We do B2B telemarketing and our main goal is to call someone at a time when the person actually answers the call. I have divided 8 to 6 workday into ten one-hour blocks. Some people tend to answer the calls in the morning and some in the afternoon. So, I have created following features to calculate the probability of each one-hour block: 1) Day of the week 2) Season (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) 3) Job Role of the Person 4) Job Function 5) Timezone (Only US) 6) Account Size (based on Employee count) 7) Ten One-Hour Block (Target Variable) I have tried various algorithms to get the probability from Bayes' Classifier to Random Forest. The output probability of these classifiers make sense but the probabilities of few one-hour blocks are very close to each other and I would like to know the way to distinctly identify the probability of a person to answer the call given a call block. Here, I need your advice on feature engineering or problem formation. Also, if anyone has done any research on in this area of behavioral analytics, I would really appreciate your suggestions.
