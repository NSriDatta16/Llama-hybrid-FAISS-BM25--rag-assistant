Mobile Safari is known to enlarge certain parts of the text (especially in paragraphs). This is to make the content of your pages easier to read without having to zoom in too much. You can try using an iPhone-specific media query together with html { -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; } to stop this from happening, but that's going to make your text really hard to read without having to pan in all directions.
