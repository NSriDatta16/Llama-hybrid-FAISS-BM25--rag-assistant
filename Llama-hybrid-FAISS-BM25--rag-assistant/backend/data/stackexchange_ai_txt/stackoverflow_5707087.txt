You problem description is quite confusing. Let me repeat it to make sure I've got it right: you need to extract an image from a password-protected site, but you are not logged in into that site (user may be logged in, but not your server-side code)? Then I'd suggest to user HttpClient to provide the correct credentials and download the file to local storage where you can process it the way you like. Note that if the site uses MS SSO, the task could be quite complicated, as your code would need a service account with AD/Kerberos.
