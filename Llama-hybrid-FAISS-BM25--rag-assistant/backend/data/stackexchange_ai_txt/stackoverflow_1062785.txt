You're asking for a parser, use one: http://www.pcre.org/ http://www.complang.org/ragel/ sscanf boost::lexical_cast and plenty of other alternatives... Also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_generator Now how do I handle complexity for this kind of problems ? Well if I can, I reformulate. In your case, using a parser generator (or regular expression) is using a DSL (Domain Specific Language), that is a language more suited to the problem you're dealing with. Design pattern and OOP are useful, but definitely not the best solution to each and every problem.
