Post Type in Database - INT or VARCHAR

I'm building a forum type site in which posts will have different types: Discussion, Question, and Comment. What would be considered the preferred method of storage for both performance and readability? For instance: Id | PostType | PostTitle 1 2 Example title or Id | PostType | PostTitle 1 Question Example title Performance is my main goal, so my first idea was to store it as an INT. However, to get the post type name (which I need every time) I have run a rather unenjoyable if/else statement. I would prefer the VARCHAR type, as it avoids the if/else business and remains readable, but I am uncertain.
