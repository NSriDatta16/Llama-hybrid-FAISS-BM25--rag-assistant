Bogus Eclipse warning for web.xml: "No grammar constraints (DTD or XML schema) detected for the document."

The top of my web.xml file looks like this: But I still get the warning from Eclipse (Ganymede) that no XML schema is detected, and schema violations are not being warned about. Other XML files in my project ( Spring Framework configuration files for example) don't have the warning and do give correct warnings about schema violations. How do I get the schema checking working and hopefully the warning to go away? The server does run correctly. It just appears to be an IDE issue.
