I have no idea. Probably the same way you get good at composing music. When I try to prove something I'm not following some fixed strategy, I just think about the problem. Then [undefined amount of time] later, my mind returns a result and I jump up to write it down. But practicing definitely helps. When I started trying to prove extremely simple statements, like DeMorgan's laws, I was completely hopeless. So I sat down and did the fifty or so optional example problems on a worksheet we were given. Now it feels natural to prove something.
