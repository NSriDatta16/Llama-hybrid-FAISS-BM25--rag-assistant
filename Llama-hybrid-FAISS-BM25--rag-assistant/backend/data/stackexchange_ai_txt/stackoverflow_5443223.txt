You are probably debugging a version of your program compiled with optimisation enabled. In optimized code, some variable may not be accessible via the debugger, because when compiling the compiler found that in this current function the variable scope can be reduced without changing the semantic and it did just that to improve the code (reduce register usage or memory access, ...). You can try to recompile it with optimisation disabled. Depending on the compiler, it is possible to disable optimisation for just a part of a file with some #pragma (for GCC this was introduced in version 4.4).
