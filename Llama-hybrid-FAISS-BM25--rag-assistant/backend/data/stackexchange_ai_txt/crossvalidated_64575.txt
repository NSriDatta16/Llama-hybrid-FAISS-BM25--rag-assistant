Influence of a time series on another one/clearing up trend or seasonality

I've got data as follows | Date | Turnover | Day of week | Max Temp | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | 2013-07-08 | 133 | Monday | 22 | | 2013-07-09 | 150 | Tuesday | 23 | | 2013-07-10 | 161 | Wednesday | 22 | | 2013-07-11 | 127 | Thursday | 18 | Now what I need to do is to find out how much influence the Max Temperature has on the turnover. The effects of the time series like trends and day of week (periodicity) should be cleared up before. So that in the end I want to be able to tell that the max temperature influences the turnover either positive or negative when it is between 10-15, 15-20, etc. What I already did with R is to do a time series decomposition. My next plan was to then take the irregular "noise" component from the time series (which as I understand is without any periodicity or trend) and see how the temperature influences the turnover. But here I don't know which statistical method is best suited for this. I need some method to cluster the data maybe. Any hints?
