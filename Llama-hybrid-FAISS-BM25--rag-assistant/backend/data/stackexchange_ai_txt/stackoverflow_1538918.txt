It sounds to me you want a list, not a graphics view. A list can be set to display things wrapping around like you desire. See the puzzle example , paying attention to the list of puzzle pieces on the left. It looks pretty simple to set up for the case presented. Of course, if you really want it in a graphics view, I suppose you could add a list to the view and use it there.
