Might it be possible to create a meta-analysis for machine learning methods predicting something?

I am working on a study trying to create a framework for tool selection for machine learning predicting a phenomenon. It should help researchers/practitioners choose the right algorithm for their case. I am reading about meta-analyses and I am not sure I understand it throughout. Might it be possible to end up with such a framework through a meta-analysis of previous studies? P.S. I am stuck because it all makes sense if there it would be just one algorithm predicting the phenomenon and such I would organize the studies and create the analysis. With different methods, I am not sure how this can be done. Thanks and sorry for a long post.
