I understand where you are coming from. In my field of psychology, there are a lot of resources that present statistics in a superficial way. This is fine for many students, yet such books do not provide the prerequisites for reading more sophisticated books. It sounds like you need to (a) get a better picture of the range of statistics books out there and the necessary prerequisites that different resources imply. (b) define your learning goals; (c) identify your current knowledge; and (d) put it all together to create a learning environment. A. Develop sense of the statistics resources landscape Perhaps this provides a rough sense of the introductory statistics resource landscape organised on a continuum of rigour and mathematical sophistication. Cookbooks : Some resources have a cookbook style, showing how to use software and providing tips on when to use and how to interpret statistical output (e.g., SPSS Survival Manual ). These books serve a purpose for people who have standardised data analysis needs, and don't have the time nor the inclination to engage in deeper learning. Standard introductions to statistics : There's also a wide range of introductory statistics books that vary in the degree of mathemtical rigour. For some the only prerequisite is that you can perform basic algebra. HyperStat provides one online example. More sophisticated introductions to statistics : While arguably on a continuum, other introductions to statistics are a little more mathematically rigorous. It seems to me that a big difference is whether the textbook assumes the reader is familiar with calculus and linear algebra. As @iterator has noted, the online Handbook of Engineering Statistics is one example of such a more sophisticated resource. Mathematical Statistics : At the next level of rigour are resources that one might classify as mathematical statistics. Check out for example Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics , course notes for this MIT subject on mathematical statistics , or some of the video courses here on mathematical statistics . B. Define your learning goals What is it that you want to do with this statistics knowledge? How important is mathematical rigour? Do you need to understand mathematically sophisticated descriptions that might appear on Wikipedia? C. Identify your current knowledge For many students in the social sciences, engaging with mathematically sophisticated textbooks effectively requires learning or refreshing a large amount of mathematics. However, if you have an engineering background, then I imagine that engaging in a more mathematical treatment should not be a major issue. D. Put it all together Once you've defined what you want to learn, what you already know, and the prerequisites required to learn the new material, the challenge is to find the best resources for you. Does the resource need to be freely available on the Internet, or are you willing to buy or borrow a book? Are you able to learn sufficiently from a textbook style resource or do you want or need a classroom environment with a lecturer verbalising the material and the structure that a course provides? If you are after a textbook on a particular, what textbook do you find clearest, best, and so on? Once you have answers to the above questions, you may have more specific questions that would be suited to this site. E.g., "I know x, y, z, and what is a good textbook that explains a, b, c?"
