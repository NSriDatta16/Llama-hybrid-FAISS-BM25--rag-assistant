If you want anyone to catch and recover from your exceptions, it's probably best to use a small hierarchy of custom exception types, probably organized by the expected degree of recoverability (e.g. have an exception type indicating 'something unexpected happened, but the socket is probably still good', another for 'the socket state cannot be trusted, but starting over with a new socket connection might work', and another for 'the host says what you're doing won't work; don't even bother retrying unless you have reason to believe something has changed'). The particulars of what caused an exception are often less important to the 'catching' code than the nature of the violated post-conditions.
