Got a response from Mike@infragistics, I didn't know about ValueListResolved Answer from Mike There are a number of events you could use. I would probably use BeforeCellUpdate or maybe BeforeExitEditMode. Either way, what you would do is use the ValueListResolved property on the cell to get the ValueList and then you can use the GetValue method to try to find a matching item on the list. Use the cell.EditorResolved.Text to get the current edit text in the cell for your search.
