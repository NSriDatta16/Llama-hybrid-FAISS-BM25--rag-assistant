Conditional probability given only the converse conditional probability, and the average of one variable

I’ve been working on this question for a few days now. Full disclosure: this is from a homework problem set. This is one of the exercises of Barnett's book on quantum information . A particle counter records counts with an efficiency $\eta$ . This means that each particle is detected with probability $\eta$ and missed with probability $1-\eta$ . Let $N$ be the number of particles present and $n$ be the number of detected. Then: \begin{equation} P(n|N)=\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}\eta^n (1-\eta)^{N-n} \end{equation} I know the mean number of particle present is: \begin{equation} \bar{N}=\sum N P(N) \end{equation} I know that I’m supposed to use Bayes’ Theorem, but I don’t see how I’m supposed to use the fact that $\bar{N}$ is known. Every effort so far has yielded an unwieldy fraction that can’t be simplified. For completeness, here is a screenshot of the question in question:
