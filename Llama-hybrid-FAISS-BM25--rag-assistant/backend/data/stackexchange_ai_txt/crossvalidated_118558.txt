The area of statistics that you are looking for is changepoint analysis. There is a website here that will give you an overview of the area and also have a page for software. If you are an R user then i'd recommend the changepoint package for changes in mean and the strucchange package for changes in regression. If you want to be Bayesian then the bcp package is good too. In general you have to choose a threshold which indicates the strength of the changes you are looking for. There are, of course, threshold choices that people advocate in certain situations and you can use asymptotic confidence levels or bootstrapping to get confidence too.
