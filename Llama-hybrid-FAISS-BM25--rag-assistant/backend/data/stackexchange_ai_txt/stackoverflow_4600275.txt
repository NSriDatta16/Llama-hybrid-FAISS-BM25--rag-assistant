Styling A select form (dropdown)

I've searched around google and various web design sites and haven't had much luck finding information on a elegant solution to designing a nice select drop down box within a form. My text input fields are very large (50px in height) and I'm looking to get the same height/feel out of the select boxes as well. My concerns are having 2+ sets of images for the box to match each systems native form element. Any suggestions? Thanks.
