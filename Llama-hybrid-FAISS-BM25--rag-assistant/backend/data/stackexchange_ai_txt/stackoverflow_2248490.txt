How to organize integration tests?

When writing unit tests, I usually have one test class per production class, so my hierarchy will look something like that: src/main -package1 -classA -classB -package2 -classC src/test -package1 -classATests -classBTests -package2 -classCTests However when doing integration tests the organization becomes less rigid. For example, I may have a test class that tests classA and classB in conjunction. Where would you put it? What about a test class that tests classA, classB and classC together? Also, integration tests usually require external properties or configuration files. Where do you place them and do you use any naming convention for them?
