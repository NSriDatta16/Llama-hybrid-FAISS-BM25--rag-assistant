How can I format an integer to a specific length in javascript?

I have a number in Javascript, that I know is less than 10000 and also non-negative. I want to display it as a four-digit number, with leading zeroes. Is there anything more elegant than the following? if(num I want something that is built into Javascript, but I can't seem to find anything.
