Since you're mentioning a RESTful web service and not any web service, I would strongly go for what is supported by underlying standard - HTTP 1.1 and its content negotiation that relies on Accept HTTP header. As I've explained in my answer to Can I change the headers of the HTTP request send by the browser , address (URI) and representation are two distinct pillars of a RESTful design and they do not need to be mixed. One should not abuse URI for embedding acceptable representations when there's Accept header . Only if your web application is potentially run and used in an environment where's some HTTP header filtering involved by intermediate nodes, then you should support URI-based content negotiation. Truth be told, such intrusive or improperly functioning proxies should be replaced if anyhow possible and feasible. Cheers! Shonzilla
