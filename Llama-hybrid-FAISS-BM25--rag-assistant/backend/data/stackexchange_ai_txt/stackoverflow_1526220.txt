web programming language benchmarks?

I'm thinking that as more and more programming moves to the web with similar and a variety of tools and techniques, has anyone come up with a good set of benchmarks for a programming language? I'm thinking server-side languages, like Java, PHP, ASP.net, and C# are the big ones. Though it could be anything like C or perl, I don't want to go there because it's not mainstream or even fast. When I buy a new CPU, I can benchmark the floating point, integer, and multi-task numbers. I can bench things like rendering times. I would think someone could develop a standard bench for simple programming tasks, and practical web serving scenarios. Preferably an independent organization. Of course you can always tweak code for performance, but I am talking simple things that can be done identically in every language. I bet it could be robust as well. At some point for scalability, performance will be an issue for web languages. I would like to have a way to tell if a language, or better yet, the latest release of it, stacks up against the competition. Anybody doing this yet, or should I come up with my own business? EDIT: yes I know benchmarks are subjective, even more-so for web pages. I didn't say it would be easy, or even necessary now.. Clearly benchmarking my video card on Crysis versus Far Cry is subjective, but it is a useful real world test. That's what I'm aiming for, and for the mainstream languages. Could we see a resurgence in C if performance becomes a focus point down the road?
