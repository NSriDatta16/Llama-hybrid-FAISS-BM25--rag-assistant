How to create common effect size estimate for meta-analysis based on a mix of mean changes and raw group means and standard deviations?

I am trying to do a meta analysis, involving continuous data. I am trying to do this meta analysis in Stata using the metan command. However, this data is organized in different fashions, where I have some studies with data listed as change in means with their standard errors and other data which is listed as the raw means and standard deviations. Is there a way to combine this data and proceed with the analyses?
