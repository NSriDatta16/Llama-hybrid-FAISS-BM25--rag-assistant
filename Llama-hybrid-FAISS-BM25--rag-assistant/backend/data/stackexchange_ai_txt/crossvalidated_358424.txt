You should try to apply differencing. Maybe even several times - #1 - seasonal, because when looking at your time series it's obvious there is a seasonality here. Also, you may need to apply Box-Cox transformation for the dispersion equalization. After all , apply Dickey-Fuller test together with visual control for to make sure that the time series satisfies stationarity requirement.
