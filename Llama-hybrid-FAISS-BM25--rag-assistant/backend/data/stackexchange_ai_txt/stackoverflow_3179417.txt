User agent based output by Drupal CMS/

I need to develop an online service layer that will provide multi-role interactivity to end users on the behalf user agent/device/application (desktop or web widget) or output type (XML) they use. So... How is drupal as choice? Is it possible to develop output templates for each output type required? How to switch theme or output mode on the behalf of user agent?
