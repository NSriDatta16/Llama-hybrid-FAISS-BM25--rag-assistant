Softmax regression bias and prior probabilities for unequal classes

I'm using Softmax regression for a multi-class classification problem. I don't have equal prior probabilities for each of the classes. I know from Logistic Regression (softmax regression with 2 classes) that the prior probabilities of the classes is implicitly added to the bias ($\log(p_0/p_1)$). Usually what I do is to manually remove this term from the bias. My question is, what is the corresponding term in softmax regression bias? Thanks.
