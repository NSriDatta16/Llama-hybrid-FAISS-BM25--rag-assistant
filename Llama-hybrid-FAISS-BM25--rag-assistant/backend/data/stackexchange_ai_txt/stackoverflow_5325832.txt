First of all, whether a number is 'hexadecimal' or 'decimal' is just a matter of outer representation, it doesn't change the storage format. Using strings of numbers as database indices is obviously inefficient and may prevent certain db features and optimizations, though. Therefore, convert the hex strings to plain integers and use them as database indices and you'll be fine.
