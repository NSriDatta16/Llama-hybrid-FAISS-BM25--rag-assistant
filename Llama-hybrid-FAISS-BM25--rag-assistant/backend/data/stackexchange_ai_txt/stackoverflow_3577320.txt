Using reference libraries (dll) stored in a different folder from the main program?

(This might be a obvious question but I wasn't sure what to ask Bing/Google) In a VS2008 (C# Winforms) project there are numerous third party libraries that are referenced. The project uses 'Copy Local = True' so that the various DLL files end up in the same folder as the compiled application. To clean things up I would like to modify the program so that the libraries are all under a subfolder. For example: C:\MyProgram\ -> main program folder C:\MyProgram\Libraries -> DLL storage folder How would I do this?
