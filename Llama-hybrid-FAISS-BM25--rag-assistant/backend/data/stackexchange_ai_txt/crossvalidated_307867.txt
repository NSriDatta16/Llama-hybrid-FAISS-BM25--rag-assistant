The basic strategy would be to assume that the activity is distributed according to some family of distributions, and then estimate the parameters based on the data. This wouldn’t really be regression, since the feature variables and the response variables are basically the same. Also, the really basic analysis would base the estimate for each customer only on that customer’s activity, although a more advanced analysis might adjust what family of distributions is expected, or weight towards an expectation of the parameters based on what the average customer is doing. If you have other variables, such as the dollar amounts of the transactions, or if you don’t assume independence (perhaps people who buy a lot on the weekend have behavior that’s different from other people, for example), then you can do regression analysis between those factors and the parameters.
