I have made the following changes to it: Enabled magento caching Enabled APC MySQL Query caching GZip compression of html,css,js The shop is still incredibly slow, around 10 secs and over for rendering the homepage. Is there any obvious things I am missing out. Please share your tips to improve Magento performance
