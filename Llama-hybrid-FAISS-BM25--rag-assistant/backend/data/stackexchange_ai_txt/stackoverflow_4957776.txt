lhf is correct, you can refactor your code and it will still work. Keep in mind, though, that while everything in this particular example script is global, it is often a good idea, if working with variables that are effectively temporary (say, within the scope of a loop or single function), to declare them as local . In regards to the third question about embedding in C/C++, there is no difference in scope rules within the Lua script, as the application would create a single Lua state, and load your script files. Any files that perform a require do so within the scope of the state they were loaded into during the C/C++ application initialization.
