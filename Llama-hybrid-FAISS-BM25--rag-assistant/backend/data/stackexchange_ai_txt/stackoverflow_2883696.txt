Solving the problem of finding parts which work well with each other

I have a database of items. They are for cars and similar parts (eg cam/pistons) work better than others in different combinations (eg one product will work well with another, while another combination of 2 parts may not). There are so many possible permutations, what solutions apply to this problem? So far, I feel that these are possible approaches (Where I have question marks, something tells me these are solutions but I am not 100% confident they are). Neural networks (?) Collection-based approach (selection of parts in a collection for cam, and likewise for pistons in another collection, all work well with each other) Business rules engine (?) What are good ways to tackle this sort of problem? Thanks
