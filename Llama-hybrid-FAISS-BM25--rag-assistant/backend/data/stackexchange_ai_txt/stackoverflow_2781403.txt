Changing dropdownlist selection causes full postback. (it's more interesting than it sounds)

Here's the scenario. I have a search page with a TextBox that allows someone to type in a search term and press enter. (Which fires TextChanged). I have a DropDownList that specifies the kind of search that will be performed. It is defined in the markup as follows: Last, First Last First Liberty ID E-mail Telephone Birthday (exact m/d/yyyy) SSN (exact ###-##-####) Address As you can see, AutoPostBack is set to false, and there is no event hookup. Pressing enter fires the OnTextChanged event for the TextBox, which performs a search and updates a GridView in an UpdatePanel. This UpdatePanel has its UpdateMode set to conditional and has one trigger: the TextChanged event of the search TextBox. It's very simple. And it works beautifully, almost. Whenever I change the search type, the very next search does a full postback. All subsequent searches do partial postbacks (as desired) unless I change the search type again. There is one exception to this rule: if I load the page and immediately change the search type, it doesn't do a full postback. So the first change of the DropDownList before any postback (full or partial) does not trigger a full postback. Full Disclosure: I'm doing a lot of JavaScript to change the appearance of the gridview during async requests. I don't detail it here because it seems unrelated. This problem only occurs when a DropDownList with no JavaScript wired up is changed. Any ideas? This is driving me crazy. Everything else is working. Thanks in advance, Clif
