MVC using Linq to Entity w/ sql encryption

Currently i am using sql encryption and would like to continue using it through Linq. I have all my CRUD stored proc's created and wired up to the table in the model in order to handle the encryption/decryption through sql. Main problem is that my database model see's a field type of varbinary(max) which is used for the sql encryption storage. Problems: A. Configuring the Entity Model - Cannot assign the varbinary field of the encrypted table to the CRUD stored proc's parameters, which are of type varchar. The stored proc's take the varchar value, encrypt it and then store it in the encrypted tables varbinary field. B. Outside of the Entity Model creation - When referencing the encrypted entity table it expects a varbinary field, when in essence it really is a varchar field. This in turn causes coversion issues when trying to assign values to that encrypted field. How does one get around this. I need the application to view this field as being decrypted like it is when it comes back from my stored proc. The CUD statements would then take the string values and the stored proc's tied to them in the entity model would do the encryption. Thanks in advance.
