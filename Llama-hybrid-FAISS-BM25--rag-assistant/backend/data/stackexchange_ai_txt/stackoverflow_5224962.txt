More than one NSFetchedResults Controller allowed in iOS COreData?

Sorry if this is a newbie question. I'm trying to wrap my head around Core Data. I have a Tab Bar application where each tab contains a navigation controller. The top level of each navigation controller is a table that shows a specific and different view of the same set of data, which is in a Core Data store. This is sort of like iTunes where one Tab shows songs organized by Artist and another shows them organized by title. My question is where does the NSFetchedResultsController need to live? Can each navigation controller have its own NSFetchedResultsController and perform fetches in its own unique way or do I have to put the FRC in the app delegate so that both tabs have access to it? I know the context is in the app delegate so I was thinking this had to be the case here as well. Thanks for any help.
