Well, clearly, if you were to perform PCA on a dataset, and then perform PCA on the result, you wouldn't get any benefit over just performing PCA once. So if your original dataset already had the properties of a PCA result (i.e. orthogonality), then applying PCA to it won't produce any further benefit. The more orthogonal a dataset is, the more it's already "PCA optimized", and the less further PCA helps. You should check the correlation matrix of the original dataset and see how much correlation there is between the variables.
