The easiest way to identify if a timeseries is additive or multiplicative will be decomposition. Also it depends on which kind of additivity and multiplicativity you are looking for ? is it trend or seasonal ? Below steps to be followed: 1) Decompose the time series using stl() or decompose() functions in R 2) Look seasonality component(if looking for seasonal additive/multiplicative) or trend(if looking for trend additive/multiplicative). 3) IF the variance in the graph is constant through out from central line then its additive else multiplicative. Simple.. isn't it? ..... :) Hope this will help.
