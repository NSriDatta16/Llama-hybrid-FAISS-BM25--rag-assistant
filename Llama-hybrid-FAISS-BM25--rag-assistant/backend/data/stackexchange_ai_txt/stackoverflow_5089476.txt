robots.txt with Disallow and meta tag that allows

I am responsible for a site with a base URL such as: https://hello.world.com/my-site/ There is a robots.txt file in https://hello.world.com/robots.txt with the following content: User-agent: * Disallow: / There is no way for me to edit or delete or affect that file in any way. I can, however, put tags in all the pages under https://hello.world.com/my-site/ . I know I can add, for example: My question is: will Google and other search engines give more preference to my meta tag under https://hello.world.com/my-site/ , or to https://hello.world.com/robots.txt ?
