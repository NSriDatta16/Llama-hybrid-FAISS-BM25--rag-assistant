The statement in the first video appears to be wrong. In particular, (1) is wrong while (2) is correct. (3) is also correct, and it agrees with (2) . The second video regarding (1) is not wrong, but the relationship is more subtle than indicated by (1) . To see what happens if one tries to use (1) instead of (2) , look at the graph in my answer in the tread "Does GARCH( $p$ ,0) make sense at all?" . Generally, if you are unsure about a video, it may be a good idea to cross check with a respectable textbook. That could be Hamilton "Time Series Analysis", Tsay "Analysis of Financial Time Series", Zivot "Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS" or some other one.
