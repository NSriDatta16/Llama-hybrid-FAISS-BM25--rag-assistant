Time-series stationarity

If I difference a time series and take out trend and seasonality ... does it mean we are left with only irregularity on which we plot the acf and pacf to arrive at the MA and AR order? Do 1st difference, 2nd difference always detrend the series, or do we need to detrend separately?
