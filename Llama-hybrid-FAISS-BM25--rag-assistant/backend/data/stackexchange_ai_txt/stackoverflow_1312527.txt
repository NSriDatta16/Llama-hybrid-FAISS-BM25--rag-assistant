Separating MySQL content via PHP on a "per-country/user preference" basis

Okay, I'll lay this out simply: I have one database that has content in it but I need to set up a conditon where if the user has selected Britain instead of the U.S. or vice versa -- some content will not show. This condition can be applied via a checkbox in the backend like so. "Hello, I'm a paragraph" show in [x] Britian [x] U.S. I'm not looking into actual IP Addresses or anything of that sort as the site will simply redirect to root/uk or root/us subfolders upon the user's selection on the index page. What kind of a unique parameter would I have incorporate in the db or php? Thank You!
