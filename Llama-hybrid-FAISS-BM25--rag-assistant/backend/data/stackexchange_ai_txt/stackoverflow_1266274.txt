In addition to the excellent answers already given, unless you really need to switch to Native now, I would recommend waiting until you migrate to Oracle 11g. Here is a relevant paragraph from the documentation: Starting with Oracle Database 11g, PL/SQL Native Compilation does not need a C compiler. Therefore, if you presently use a C compiler only to support PL/SQL Native Compilation, you can remove it from the machine where your database is installed (and from each node in an Oracle RAC configuration). We have switched to Native compilation in our 11g database, but we don't do a lot of computationally intensive PL/SQL, so our performance gains have been almost insignificant. We hope to have code in the future that will take greater advantage of it. On the plus side it hasn't caused us any problems and was easy to do.
