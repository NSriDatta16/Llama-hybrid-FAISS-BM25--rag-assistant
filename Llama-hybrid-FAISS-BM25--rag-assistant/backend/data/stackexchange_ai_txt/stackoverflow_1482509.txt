Server.Transfer has the ability to maintain form data (POST values) in transition, because it is essentially transferring the same request sent by the user to a new endpoint. Request.Redirect cannot persist POST data because a redirect is essentially sending a response back to the end-user which says "go here instead". The client then initiates a new request to that new endpoint. The client does not re-submit the POST data on the second, separate request. However, neither POST nor GET alone are more or less RESTful - both are strings of data, just in slightly different parts of the request. Having clean, querystring-less URLs might "look REST-y", but it is cosmetic. Here's a diagram of how the two different approaches work. As you can see, in the Redirect case, changing the POST data simply isn't possible because it's in the client's hands to form the new request to the target URL; and in the Transfer case, it makes no sense to (even if it was technically possible) because if you do need to pass additional data to the new handler, you can do so yourself: alt text http://rexmorgan.net/rr_vs_st.jpg
