.NET and COM (ActiveX) objects perspective

We are using a software library from a major US manufacturer. For years the library had mainly two interfaces, a bunch of C API DLLs and a collection of ActiveX controls which encapsulate the DLL functionality. The ActiveX interface worked pretty well back in the old days of Visual Basic 6 . Then .NET appeared with its COM Interop compatibility interface for the now old ActiveX technology. This had a few pitfalls, like dynamic objects never removed ( link ) or problems when using multi-threaded applications (cross apartment calls, etc.). Now the manufacturer decided to discontinue the ActiveX interface because "of the growing migration from COM (i.e., ActiveX control) to .NET technology within the WindowsÂ® development community". What is some more information about that? Are there plans from Microsoft to drop the COM Interop interface in future .NET releases or are there other huge current and future issues I haven't thought about? Or is this more a matter of taste, like buying a new TV because it looks better? Also, is there is some kind of ActiveX RAD replacement, where from the user side I drag and drop a control to my form, set all parameters graphically and are almost done with that?
