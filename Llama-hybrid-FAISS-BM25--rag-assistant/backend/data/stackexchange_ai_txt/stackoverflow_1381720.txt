You sure can. In programming you can do anything. I mean it. Anything. Just give it a try and you will be amazed by what js can do for you. I would recommend taking a gander at the amazing js libraries out there: http://demos.mootools.net/ http://www.noupe.com/jquery/50-amazing-jquery-examples-part1.html http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/demos But basically you would want to click and drag elements right to make the page move to the next page? Or is this a firefox plugin?
