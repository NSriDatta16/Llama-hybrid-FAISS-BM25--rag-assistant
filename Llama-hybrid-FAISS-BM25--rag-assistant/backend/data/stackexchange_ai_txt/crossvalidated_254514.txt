Complete separation in logistic regression with only one direction

In this paper Dealing with Separation in Logistic Regression Models some various types of complete separation are discussed: direction of the separation is positive if and only if $s_i = 1 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ or $s_i = 0 \Rightarrow y_i = 0$ direction of the separation is negative if and only if $s_i = 0 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ or $s_i = 1 \Rightarrow y_i = 0$ I'm wondering if this can be also called complete separation: $s_i = 0 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ AND $s_i = 1 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ I call this one direction to distinct it from the other two. Here I have the corresponding showcases to make it clear: posivite direction: out group 0 1 ctrl 20 0 treat 0 20 negative direction: out group 0 1 ctrl 0 20 treat 20 0 one direction out group 0 1 ctrl 0 20 treat 0 20 My questions are: Can this be also called complete separation? May I use the same tools (for example bayesglm from R) to analyze this kind of complete separation?
