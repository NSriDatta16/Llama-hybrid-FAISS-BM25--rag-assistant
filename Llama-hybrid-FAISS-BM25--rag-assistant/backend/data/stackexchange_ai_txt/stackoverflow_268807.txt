If you want it accessible from multiple pages you should pull it off that individual page class and put it in a more globally accessable place such as the Application collection. Given the naming of the variable, is 0SearchHandler a delegate? I'm not as familiar with VB.NET as much or the terminology. Update: Steve Morgan mentioned using the Session collection, when "static" or "shared" was mentioned, i was thinking more globally. Depending on how your using the variable you can use the "Application" if it will be shared between users and sessions, or the "session" if it will be used by one user in one session. In VB.NET they are both easy to use: Session("yourKey") = YourObjectYouWantToSave Application("yourKey") = YourObjectYouWantToSave Very simple stuff. 'search.aspx Public Function oSearchString(ByVal oTextBoxName As String) As String For Each oKey As String In Request.Form.AllKeys If oKey.Contains(oTextBoxName) Then Session("searching") = True Session("search-term") = Request.Form(oKey) Return Request.Form(oKey) End If Next Return "" End Function ' theMaster.master.vb In PageLoad Method: ... Dim bSearching as Boolean bSearching = IIf(Session("searching") is Nothing, False, Session("searching") ) ulSearch.visible = bSearching ... 'theMaster.master Ok, that is some extra code but I think you would have less problems with it. Plus my VB is a bit rusty. Actually, If the master page is the page you will be using it on, I would put the variable as a public property on that masterpage. You can access the pages master page with this.Master (at least in C#, I think it's Me.Master in VB.NET).
