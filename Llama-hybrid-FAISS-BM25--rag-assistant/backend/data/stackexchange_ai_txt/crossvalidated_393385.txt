What statistical tools are available to remove bias from a dataset?

Three managers report to me. They have done appraisal of staff under them giving them a percentage. I have to sign-off those ratings but I face two major issues: The managers have a certain way of rating their staff. One manager consistently ranks his staff higher: most of his ratings are 87% - 95%. The other manager is more conservative and rates his staff more stringently i.e. 75% - 85%. I know from my personal experience that quality of staff under both the manager is homogeneous so it's not the factual representation. Second issue is that managers have their likings and dislikings. They will rate certain staff more favorably than the others. I have historic ratings on their both liked and disliked staff (I know that their productivity is at par). Without going into the discussion of how the appraisal system should work, could someone point out if there are any statistical tools available to detect and remove such bias from the data? (I remember vaguely that in college teachers used to apply some averaging technique to bring whole class's grade up depending upon who the highest scorer was. I am looking for something like that.)
