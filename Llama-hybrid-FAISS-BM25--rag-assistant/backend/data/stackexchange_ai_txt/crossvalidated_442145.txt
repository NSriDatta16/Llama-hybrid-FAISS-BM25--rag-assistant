I have not studied this but as far as I can tell statistical learning and machine learning are the same thing. One can make inferences and predictions in both statistical learning and inferential statistics, but the goal in statistical learning tends to be prediction over inference, whereas the reverse is true of inferential statistics. The main difference between statistical learning and inferential statistics as I understand it is the method. In statistical learning data are split into a training set and test set, and the model learns from the training set how to maximise the accuracy of prediction of the test set. This may involve cross validation etc. In inferential statistics there is no splitting of data and training of models in any formal way.
