SPSS Binary Logistic Regression - intercept (baseline) model not significant

I am working with a binary logistic regression in SPSS and my current issue is that my baseline model is not significant (0.440) (Block 0 "Variables in the Equation), my Omnibus-test however is and the Chi-squared value is pretty high (171.162 for 15 df). When I include my independent variables I get some pretty good results that are significant and have interesting odds-ratios for my analysis (Block 1). Does the non-significant value of my baseline model mean that I can't make any significant implications for the analysis, or can I disregard the insignificance in the baseline model? Is there any way to make it significant? It's a social science research project with 988 respondents.
