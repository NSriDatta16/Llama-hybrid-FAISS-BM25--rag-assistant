What would cause linq to sql to think that a parameter is nullable?

I have a stored procedure that declares a input parameter @BatchNumber uniqueidentifier This field in the table is set to not allow nullables. When I drag in the stored procedure and it hooks everything up it says the parameter is nullable. I don't understand why. Is this normal for it to think that the parameters are nullable?
