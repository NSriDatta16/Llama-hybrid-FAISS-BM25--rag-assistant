As already mentioned Random Forests are a natural "upgrade" and, these days, SVM are generally the recommended technique to use. I want to add that more often than not switching to SVM yields very disappointing results. Thing is, whilst techniques like random trees are almost trivial to use, SVM are a bit trickier. I found this paper invaluable back when I used SVM for the first time (A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classication) http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf In R you can use the the e1071 package for SVM, it links against the de facto standard (in free software at least!) libSVM library.
