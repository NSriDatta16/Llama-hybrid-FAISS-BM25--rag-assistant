Actiavation function isnt a parameter. But here is general formula for counting weghts: Suppose for neural network with two hidden layers, inputs dimension is "I", Hidden number of neurons in Layer 1 is "H1", Hidden number of neurons in Layer 2 is "H2" And number of outputs is "O" weights = (I+1)*H1 +(H1+1)*H2 +(H2+1)*O
