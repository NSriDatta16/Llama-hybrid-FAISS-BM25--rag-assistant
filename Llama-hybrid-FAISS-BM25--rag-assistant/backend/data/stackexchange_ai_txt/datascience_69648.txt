If you know the decision boundary(14000) then why you need an ML algorithm? You can apply an if the condition on that. ML algorithms are developed for finding a decision boundary? If you really want to experiment on this dataset then you have to know what type of classification you are doing? From the artificially labeled dataset, I can see you have two classes(1, -1). But you are using OneClassSVM. That's the mistake! Just remove OneClassSVM and use normal linear svm. And no need to use 'rbf'. 'rbf' is for nonlinear separation. Your classification boundary is linear. It just a line going through 14000. from sklearn import svm clf = svm.SVC() clf.fit(train_data, train_target) Note: If you want to do outlier detection then don't label the data by ( OneClassSVM to find the outlier by looking training features only.
