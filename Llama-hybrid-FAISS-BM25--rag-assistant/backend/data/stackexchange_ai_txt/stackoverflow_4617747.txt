Regular expression issue when using Generic Views in Django

I am a front-end developer currently dabbling into Django to build a simple portfolio site to display my work. I used Django quite regularly in my previous job but its now been over 6 months and unfortunately I do have old work to look over. My site consists of: A homepage with links to featured "projects" A project list page A project detail page I am trying to take advantage of Django's Generic Views to create the latter 2 pages for me. However I am encountering issues when editing my urls.py file. Here it is: from django.conf.urls.defaults import * # Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin: from django.contrib import admin from django.conf import settings admin.autodiscover() from django.views.generic import list_detail from homepage.models import Project projects_list_info = { 'queryset' : Project.objects.all(), 'allow_empty': True, 'template_name' : '../templates/project_list.html', } projects_detail_info = { 'queryset' : Project.objects.all(), 'template_object_name' : 'project', 'slug' : 'slug', 'slug_field' : 'slug', 'template_name' : '../templates/project_detail.html', } urlpatterns = patterns('', # Example: # (r'^howelltocode/', include('howelltocode.foo.urls')), # Uncomment the admin/doc line below to enable admin documentation: # (r'^admin/doc/', include('django.contrib.admindocs.urls')), # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin: (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), (r'^test','homepage.views.viewTest'), (r'^$','homepage.views.viewHome'), (r'projects/$', list_detail.object_list, projects_list_info), (r'^projects/(?P [-\w]+)/$', list_detail.object_detail, projects_detail_info), (r'^site_media/(?P .*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}), ) The projects list view page successfully navigates to '/templates/project_list.html' when I type the url 'http://localhost:8000/projects'. However if I type 'http://localhost:8000/projects/htc-wildfire-facebook-application/' to view the "../templates/project_detail.html" page I get a 404 page with a "No project found matching your query" message. I see this as encouraging as it obviously looking for a project but I think my regular expression could be wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks James
