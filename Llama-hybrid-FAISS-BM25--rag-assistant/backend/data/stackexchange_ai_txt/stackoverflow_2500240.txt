Using OnNcHItTest for a CWnd not CDialog

I have a CWnd Derived object used in a dialog. I need to be able to drag it anywhere in the dialog. I have a code overriding OnNCHitTest for moving a dialog dragging it from a place other than the title bar. Is there any equivalent code to do the same to move this CWnd. The following code isnt working. UINT CBaseSliderBtn::OnNcHitTest(CPoint point) { UINT ret=CWnd::OnNcHitTest( point ); if (ret == HTCLIENT) return HTCAPTION; } If this isn't the right way, please suggest other optimum method to drag the slider. Thanks
