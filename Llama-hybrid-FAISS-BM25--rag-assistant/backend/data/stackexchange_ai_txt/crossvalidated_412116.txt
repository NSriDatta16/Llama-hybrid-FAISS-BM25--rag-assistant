Dynamic poisson-time series regression

Basically, my question is similar to Time series dynamic poisson regression , yet I didn't get any clue by its answer. I'm modeling dengue incidents with GLM (poisson regression; because the response was count data). But the explanatory variables is time-dependent. Let Y(t) as the response in time $t$ , $X(i,t)$ be the $i$ th explanatory variable (or predictor) in time $t$ . $X$ is continuous variable. Let's say we have 2 predictors ( $i=2$ ). So we can write the model be Y(t)~intercept+Y(t-1)+X(1,t)+X(1,t-2)+X(2,t) , how could I estimate its parameters? I have read so many papers (publications) like PEWMA method, PAR, VAR(p), GMM, etc, but still don't understand which is the right method for my problem. Please help immediately, I really wait for your answer, masters!
