If you don't want persistent storage of user data (just additional session data) have a look at: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/sessions/ The sessions framework will most probably be already enabled if you use django.contrib.auth. If you want persistent storage of additional user data (not only in a session, but in the database), you will store them in another "profile" model: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#storing-additional-information-about-users
