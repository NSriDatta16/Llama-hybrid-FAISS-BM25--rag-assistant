As the great US philosopher L.P. Berra might have said : "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future." That's particularly true for tumor sizes. Very often, a patient's tumor seems to respond initially to treatment as the large percentage of cancer cells sensitive to the therapy are killed, but then a fraction of therapy-resistant cancer cells takes over to re-grow a (now resistant) tumor. I am thus skeptical that you will be able "to predict the tumor size for periods 4 and 5" successfully. That said, there are a few statistical issues to address in your analysis of tumor size through time period 3. Most important, you say in a comment that "tumor size does change over time but the magnitude is different per treatment group." Your model, however, doesn't allow for that possibility. (I assume that by Experiment you mean "treatment group.") The model has additive effects for Experiment and Time . Thus you allow for different baseline ( Time = 0 ) values among Experiments ,* but no differences over time among the Experiments . For that you need to have an interaction term between those predictors. Second, if you are treating Time as a continuous variable (0 through 3, which would be one way to try to predict values for Time values of 4 and 5), then you are implicitly assuming a linear change in Tumor over Time . In addition to the issues I note in the first paragraph, that will depend on how you measure the Tumor value: is it a linear dimension, the cross-sectional area in an image, or an estimate of tumor volume? Not all of those can necessarily be expected to change linearly with time. Third, your random effect only allows for differences among subjects in terms of estimated baseline Tumor values at Time = 0 , and even that seems to be posing problems for you. You might consider alternate approaches to handling repeated measures on the same subjects, for example multivariate regression as explained by Fox and Weinberg in Section 3, or generalized least squares with a flexible model for changes over time, as explained by Harrell in Chapter 7 of his course notes . Before you jump ahead to writing a new model, however, first spend some time looking at what the data tell you about what your model needs to capture. *One of the advantages of a randomized trial is that it will tend to average out any differences in baseline tumor size among Experiment groups, making this term potentially less important than in other designs.
