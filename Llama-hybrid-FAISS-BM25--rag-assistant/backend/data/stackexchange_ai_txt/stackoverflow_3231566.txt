How can I access the CFFileServlet directory on a ColdFusion Web Server using multisite.dll?

I am using the multisite.dll ISAPI filter ( http://www.hairy-spider.com/post/Multisite.aspx ) in order to develop on several websites simultaneously on my Windows XP Professional/IIS 5.1 workstation. I am developing both HTML and ColdFusion websites. On the ColdFusion websites, when I use CFIMAGE to create an image in memory - a CAPTCHA image, to be exact - it is not viewable. I know the image is being created in the correct directory - ColdFusion8\tmpCache\CFFileServlet_cf_captcha - and the ColdFusion is generating the correct code to display the image: But I can't get the image to display. I've tried adding a virtual directory to the Default Website in IIS, as well as adding a mapping in the ColdFusion Administrator, but neither helps. Does anyone have any suggestions that don't include upgrading Windows? Thanks.
