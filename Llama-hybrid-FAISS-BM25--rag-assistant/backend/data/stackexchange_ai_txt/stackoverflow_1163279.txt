Clustering uses shared storage of some kind (a drive cage or a SAN, for example), and puts two database front-ends on it. The front end servers share an IP address and cluster network name that clients use to connect, and they decide between themselves who is currently in charge of serving client requests. If you're asking about a particular database server, add that to your question and we can add details on their implementation, but at its core, that's what clustering is.
