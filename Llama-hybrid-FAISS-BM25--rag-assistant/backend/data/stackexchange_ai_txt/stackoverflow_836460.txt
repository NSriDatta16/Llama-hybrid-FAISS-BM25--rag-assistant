JSLint can be run offline with either WSH or Rhino: http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#try Edit : In the two years since this question was asked, JSLint has dropped support for Rhino and WSH. I encourage anyone interested in linting their code to also check out JSHint . It's a fork of JSLint which aims to be more flexible than the original, but also happens to support Node, Rhino, and WSH (in addition to browsers, of course).
