You need to set .userInteractionEnabled on your view: myView.userInteractionEnabled = YES; From the docs: New image view objects are configured to disregard user events by default. If you want to handle events in a custom subclass of UIImageView, you must explicitly change the value of the userInteractionEnabled property to YES after initializing the object. http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImageView_Class/Reference/Reference.html I also think you probably need to subclass UIImageView and use that for your member variable, instead of a straight UIImageView. If you want to detect touches on the UIImageView, you should set up the touchesBegan delegate method for the UIImageView subclass, not your UIView subclass. Though, you could detect touches in your UIView and then use CGRectContains to see if they are touching the appropriate UIImageView
