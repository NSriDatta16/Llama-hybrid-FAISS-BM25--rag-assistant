Why random forest performs better when converting categorical attributes to numerical ones?

I have a dataset with 15 attributes, 6 are numerical and 9 are categorical. Among the categorical ones, some have about 3 levels, some about 10 levels and 2 of them about 500 levels. I'm training a model for binary classification. When I convert the categorical attributes to numerical ones (using the so-called dummy coding technique), my performance results get better, to a fairly considerable extent. Is this something expected to happen based on my dataset information or if not, what are some potential reasons that could cause that?
