Actually no one ever conviced me (at least directly), to use one programming language or another. I used to have a certain need for clearness (if you might call it that way) and some other criteria, a language and its ecosystem should meet. And you definitively will end up using some stdlib, and third-party resources, so you might want to look into them as well (and use them as arguments). I am a fan of both, ruby and python (and these languages conviced me both by their design, their constant progress and their communities). The general notion of a scripting language makes them equally appealing. I found gem to be one of the slowest software I ever used. And personally, I think pythons stdlib is better organized than rubys. But I like Ruby Mixins, they are elegant and safe a lot of time. In short: You could point your colleagues interest to some current hot spots, where coding is just hard, then show some alternatives in ruby. Rake is a great tool as well, demonstrate it ... Just be rationally passionate about it .. The rest will come ..
