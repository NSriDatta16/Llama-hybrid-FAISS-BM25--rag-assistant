If you are predicting continuous values, averaging is a common method. Of course you should try another methods (like take max, min, value with smallest CI, ..). If your models are classifiers, there are a lot of other methods, except averaging (raw propensity averaging). Most common are voting and confidence-weighted voting. If you know the performance of your models, it would be useful to make weighted averaging. I mean: $$ {A\cdot P_1 + B\cdot P_2 + C\cdot P_3}\over{A+B+C} $$ where $P_{1..3}$ is your model's prediction, and $A, B, C$ are the weight coefficients. To find these weight coefficients, you can use confidence of each prediction. Sometimes it is better to use one model on specific parts of data, one on another, etc...
