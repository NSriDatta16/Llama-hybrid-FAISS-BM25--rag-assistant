What is the value of m_strPhoneNumber and phonenumberstring at that point. Is phonenumberstring being set correctly? To remove the first bracket why not use stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"(" withString:@"" etc. it would seem less brittle. Infact, I would suggest stripping out all nonnumeric characters - even the hyphens. It's probably overkill, but try something like: m_strPhoneNumber = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"tel:%@"]; NSArray *numberTokens = [phonenumberstring componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:[[NSCharacterSet decimalDigitCharacterSet] invertedSet]]; for (NSString *token in numberTokens) { m_strPhoneNumber = [m_strPhoneNumber stringByAppendingString:token]; } As a small style aside, I would suggest phoneNumberString is more readable. I would also recommend using more variables - the optimiser will make sure they don't have an impact and it will make debugging much easier.
