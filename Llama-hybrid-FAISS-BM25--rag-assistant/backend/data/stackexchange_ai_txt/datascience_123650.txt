SVMs are powerful models that work well for small to medium size datasets, but they can be computationally intensive, especially on larger datasets. This is because the complexity of training an SVM typically scales between O(n^2) to O(n^3), where n is the number of samples. In your case, with 12,000 images, it's not surprising that training an SVM is taking a long time. If possible, try using models such as CNN . CNN can perform well on image data. And you can make use of GPUs with CNN.
