C#: Form templating system

I want to create a form templating system in a c# winforms application. Admins could create and manage forms whereas users could fill them out (Like in Lotus Notes or Access). This needs to be in a user control. I've been playing with solutions such as XSL and possibly dynamically creating HTML, but these seem pretty ghetto. Is there a more elegant solution?
