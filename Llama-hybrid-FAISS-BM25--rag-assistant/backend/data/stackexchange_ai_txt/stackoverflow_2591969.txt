how to create partition on windows CE device

Is there any tool to create a new partition on windows CE device? Device has a NAND flash memory and initially there were two partitions. Using Storage manager in Control Panel I was able to delete one partition but when I want to create it again, I get an error message: "Unable to create partition".
