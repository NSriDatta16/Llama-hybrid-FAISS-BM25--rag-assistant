What is this syntax and how to debug it?

I am currently working on moving an expression engine site from one server to another and i noticed one issue i am having a hardtime debugging. When i upload an logo image all seems fine but the index.php page that the logo is displayed on it has this code {embed="shared/head"} {embed="shared/masthead"} {if logo !=''} {organization} {if link} {if:else} {/if} {/organization} {title} {pub_date} {organization} {if link} {/if}{exp:php_text_format type="lowercase"}{if url_text != ''}{url_text}{if:else}{name}{/if}{if link}{/exp:php_text_format} {/if} {/organization} {if file} PDF {/if}{if web_link !='' AND file !=''}&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;{/if}{if web_link} HTML {/if} {if:else} {title} My question is this, I see curly brackets {} around if statements and i want to know first what language it is and second is there a way to debug like php print_r() because the code always goes to the else with the no_logo class and i want to know what and how i can test these variables "segment1" and "logo" and "organization" and "url" How do and where do i inspect these variables
