I believe you can do it in a more elegant way, take a look, ... ' /> Then you don't have to add the buttons and the images in the code and takecare of adding them each time the row is created, you just need to fetch the data from the database and set the DataSource of the gridview, and I think you can also get rid of the code fetching the data and replace it with a SqlDataSource. Take a look at this article about the GridView, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479353.aspx
