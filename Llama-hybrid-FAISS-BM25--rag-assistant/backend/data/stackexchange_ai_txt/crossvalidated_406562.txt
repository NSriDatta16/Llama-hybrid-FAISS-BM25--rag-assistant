[First, your time axis is confusing (at least for Europeans), I take that it covers july, august, september)?] This is a kind of time-series plot of marginal distributions , not of an actual time series, so it gives no information about time dependence, autocorrelations, and such, which also could be useful in describing climate. So any discussion of this plot should make that clear. So the plot tells you how the median temperature, quartiles, and so on varies with calendar time. Some of the short-time variability in the plot is probably caused by noise, and do not make sense as climate description, so a better plot would use some smoothing. From the plot we can visually compute a measure of variability such as inter-quartile range , which is remarkably stable. That seems interesting to comment. You could describe in words how the median varies with time, how the quartiles vary with time, ..., and so educate your readers in reading the plot.
