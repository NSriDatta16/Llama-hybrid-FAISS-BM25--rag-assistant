Simple Applet question : About jar dependency

I am developing a small applet appliaction using JNLP. I have total 3 jar's. one is main and 2 are supporting. using few classes from supporting into main jar. So my question is, 1) Do i need to mention all 3 jar's in jnlp file ? 2) Do i need to sign all these 3 jar's ? Right now I am mentioning only main jar in resources tag of JNLP. Also supporting jars are not signed as well. When I run my applet it is working fine. but gives lots of messages in java console as follows, JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass.....try again.. for almost all the classes in main jar Any help on this much appreciated !!! Thanks In Advance . test test Is this valid jnlp ?
