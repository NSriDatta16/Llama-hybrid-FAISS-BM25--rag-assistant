Calculating cosine similarity between 3D arrays using Python

I have two matrices with multiple columns and three rows each. I calculated the cosine similarity (sklearn) but it gives the result as a matrix. How can I obtain one single value? The matrices are the embeddings of two words each, obtained from BERT.
