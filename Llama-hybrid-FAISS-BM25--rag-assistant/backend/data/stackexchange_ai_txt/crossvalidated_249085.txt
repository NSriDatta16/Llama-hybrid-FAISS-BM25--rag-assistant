Calculating p values for data that is less than 1

I am using Origin to run a two sample t-test for conductance for two different ionic solutions. One ionic solution has a sample size of 69, an average of 20 µS and a standard deviation of 0.7 µS. The other ionic solution has a sample size of 21, an average of 22 µS and a standard deviation of 0.7 µS. When I run the two sample t-test, it gives me a p-value of 9E-12. This p value seems too small; might it be because the data I'm using is less than 1? Is there another way to calculate p values in this case?
