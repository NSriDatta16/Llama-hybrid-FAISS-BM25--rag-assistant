Linearity assumption violated - can I still draw conclusions from my model?

I am using Multiple Linear Regression to assess the impact of two predictors on Y and, especially, whether during a certain time there is an impact on Y that cannot be explained by X1 and X2 . Y , X1 and X2 are physical measurements. Season is a variable for the Seasonality of Y, also derived from physical measurements. Xbinary is a binary variable that is 1 for the specific time I am interested in and 0 for all other times. The timing of Xbinary is derived from a theoretical assumption. My assumption is that during Xbinary=1 something is happening to Y that we are not measuring. The relationship of my predictors and Y look like this: The Multiple Linear Model looks fine: Call: lm(formula = "Y ~ I(Season^3) + X1 + I(X1^2) + X2 + I(X2^3) + Xbinary", data = df) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.5271 -1.2125 -0.0326 1.1987 5.7848 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -8.239e+00 4.730e-01 -17.418 But this looks troubleful: As far as I understand, the assumption of Heteroscedasticity and Linearity are violated. As far as I understand, the first causes lower p values and imprecise coefficients, the second causes wrong coefficients? As the data are real-world physical measurements, the true relationship is very likely to be non-linear. Still, I chose the linear regression because the coefficients are easy to interpret. I know my model is wrong, but does it mean I cannot draw any conclusion from it? Can I interpret it as a rough estimate of the real relationship? I know the assumptions are violated, but it does not look completely wrong to me. Here is an interesting side note: As I know that the linear model is not well describing the true relationship, I put the same data into a random forest and extreme gradient boosting. I used Xbinary=0 as training data and Xbinary=1 as test data. The average predicition error of both machine learning models is roughly the coefficient of Xbinary from the linear model. That cannot be complete coincidence, can it?
