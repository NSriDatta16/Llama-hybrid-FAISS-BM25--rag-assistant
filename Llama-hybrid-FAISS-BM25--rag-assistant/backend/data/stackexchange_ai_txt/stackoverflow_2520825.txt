I'm not sure I fully understand the question but if you are sure that your int fit into a short (you number is between 0 and 2^16) you can always cast your int to a short: int i = 65536; short s = (short) i; And to get the unsigned value back: int i2 = s & 0xFFFF; System.out.println(i2); The s & 0xFFFF will upcast s to an int and the bit mask will "convert" the negative number to it's unsigned value (sort of). Remember that FFFF in a short variable -1 not 65536.
