Should my residuals have the same distribution as my likelihood function in a Bayesian linear regression?

If I have a standard linear regression model: $$ y \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0 + \beta_1X + ..., \sigma) $$ With whatever priors on $\beta$ 's and $\sigma$ . Does that imply that my residuals $r = y - (\beta_0 + \beta_1X + ...)$ should be $r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$ ? I know that in a traditional least-squares setting, this is a common check. Is it relevant in a Bayesian setting? Further, in traditional least-squares, not meeting the check means prediction intervals would be off as well as confidence intervals for parameters. I can understand how the prediction interval issue would be relevant in the Bayesian context as well, but does the parameter issue apply as well? Are the posterior estimates for the parameters potentially off because my data doesn't match my assumed likelihood distribution? Ultimately, I'm curious about the relationship between residuals and the likelihood function in a Bayesian context.
