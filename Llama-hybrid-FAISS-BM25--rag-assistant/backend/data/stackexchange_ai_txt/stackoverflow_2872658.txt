Albert - I found the answer by accident some time after asking. It seems that this is ccnet's behavior out of the box . So by default it does not show the compile results in the web dashboard. You need to locate the file \CruiseControl.NET\webdashboard\dashboard.config and in the buildReportBuildPlugin section, add compile.xsl. It will look like this when added: xsl\header.xsl xsl\unittests.xsl xsl\modifications.xsl xsl\NCoverSummary.xsl xsl\compile.xsl The documentation was extremely bad, and I only found this by accident when looking for something else. I was not happy that I wasted so much time when a little documentation or an example on the ccnet site would have solved this in minutes.
