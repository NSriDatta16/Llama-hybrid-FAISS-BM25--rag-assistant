In my experience you can try any kind of feature transformation you want as long as you are consistent across all the subsets of your data (i.e. the test set and all the training subsets including holdout). This can be done most easily by putting together the whole data set (into one DataFrame if you are using Python Pandas for example) and do the transformation on the whole set. You can experiment with different ways how you collapse or combine the values of the ordinal feature by doing the transformation and measuring the classifier's performance in a cross validated run. Maybe some collapsing helps the classifier by reducing complexity but too much collapsing takes away useful information. Experiment with it, this is the most fun part of classification in my opinion. Remember, the most important thing is consistency across training, holdout and test data when you are doing feature engineering.
