Order of preprocessing steps in a binary classification problem

I have these stages (ordered) for preprocessing in my binary classification problem. Dividing data based on criteria (class1 and class2 databases) Outlier detection (removing X - mean(X) >= 2*std(X) based on every feature) data balancing ( in every year - I have financial data and I'm balancing data based on some features of samples - database consisted of 5 years and I'm doing this step separately in every year - now i have equal samples in every class) Data normalization Dimension reduction ( PCA etc.) Is this ordering true? You know that normalization , dimension reduction and outlier detection generate some parameters that we must apply these parameters to new database that will import to our created database in future( out sample in real using of the model raw data without any balancing) . I know that outlier detection should be before normalization . Is this two preprocessing steps ( outlier detection and normalization ) should be before balancing of after balancing of data?
