add photos to iPhone simulator

I need than on button click opens iPhone's default album and I'll can chose a photo. I read a lot about this, but still don't works. I do the following: ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ I'm storing two pictures IMG_0000.JPG (300 on 300 px) and IMG_0000.THM (75 on 75px) In my app I do the following on button click: - (IBAction) btnOpenAlbum { album = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; album.delegate = self; album.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary; [self presentModalViewController: album animated:YES]; } I tried also UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoAlbum and still no photos in album. AI solved it in such a way: Opened iPhone simulator. Drag there photos. And it automatically copy it to folder ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.1/Media/DCIM/100APPLE and named them as IMG_0001.PNG IMG_0002.PNG and so on. After that all works fine, but: When I tried to copy item directly to that folder, and give them suitable names, iphone didn't recognized them. And also, when I deleted them from that folder and run simulator - photos where on simulator, but in folder they were not. What it can be? Thanx.
