Simplify this python code

I've written a program to check if my thought about solution on paper is right (and it is). The task: how many zeros is in the back of multiplication of all numbers from 10 to 200. It is 48 and it is a simple to calculate manually. I never write on python seriously and this is what I get: mul = 1 for i in range(10, 200 + 1): mul *= i string = str(mul) string = string[::-1] count = 0; for c in str(string): if c == '0': count += 1 else: break print count print mul I bet it is possible to write the same more elegant in such language like a python. ps: yes, it is a homework, but not mine - i just helped a guy ;-)
