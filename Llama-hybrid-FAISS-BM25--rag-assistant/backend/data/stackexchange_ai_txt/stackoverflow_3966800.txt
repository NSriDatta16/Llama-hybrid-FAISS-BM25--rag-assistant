I sent this tutorial on NUnit for beginners to some juniors I work with http://www.dotnetspider.com/tutorials/NUnit-Tutorials.aspx also coverage is something I wouldn't quite worry about for now until you get to grips with unit testing. There are more things involved in unit testing like dependency injection and mocking frameworks to make sure that code gets covered and is testable. personally id work on integration and unit testing first and then move in coverage - just my 2 cents hope it helps paul
