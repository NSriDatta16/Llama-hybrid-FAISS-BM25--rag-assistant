you can leverage your knowledge in Java writing simple unit tests that emulates random client behaviour: too many data too many connections open and close other corner cases Pure Java tests, without native code and other tricky configuration are a huge win. As starting point I recommend JMeter : Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects, Data Bases and Queries, FTP Servers and more). It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types. You can use it to make a graphical analysis of performance or to test your server/script/object behavior under heavy concurrent load. Take also a look at JUnitPerf website.
