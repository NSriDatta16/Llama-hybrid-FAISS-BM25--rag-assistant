I would say first that doing pairwise comparisons of all combinations of those four factors is certainly ill-advised. Even if each of those factors has only 2 levels, you are already proposing to test 16x15/2 = 120 comparisons. Most likely, it is hugely more than that. You should first do emm (omitting pairwise -- and I advise you to always omit that and instead do contrasts/comparisons in separate step(s)). (The additional lmer.df argument is discussed below.) I would suggest that you do well-chosen simple comparisons based on what is needed for interpretation of effects. e.g., contrast(emm, "pairwise", simple = "Group") # and probably other contrast statements There is also such a thing as interaction contrasts, e.g. contrast(emm, interaction = "consec") # or contrast(emm, interaction = "consec", by = c("Group", "Age")) The first will provide 4-way interaction contrasts equal in number to the number of degrees of freedom for the four-way interaction. The second one obtains 2-way interaction contrasts of Block and SeqType for each combination of the other factors. Again, the above are examples, and you should choose what contrasts to test based on considerations like which interactions are not so important. You can also get a graphical overview of the model predictions, which may p[rove helpful for understanding what is going on: emmip(emm, Group ~ Age | Block * SeqType) (though you may want to organize these differently by switching factors around) The message you got is another issue altogether; it has to do with the computations needed for degrees of freedom based on the Kenward-Roger method. The computational burden for this method becomes prohibitive for large datasets -- that's why you get the warning message. I suggest just adding lmer.df = "asymp" (as is done above) to bypass those computations. See a discussion of d.f. issues for these models and also the Models reference .
