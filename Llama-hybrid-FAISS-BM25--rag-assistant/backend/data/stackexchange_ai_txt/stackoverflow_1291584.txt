Is JDBC secure?

I am new to JDBC, and the new project require me to use JDBC. What I want to know is, is the JDBC secure? How to prevent "Mysql Injection"-like problem? What are the security issues that I need to pay attention when I use JDBC? And how to ensure, I mean optimize the security, in order to prevent from hackers to hack the database? EDIT: I tried google, if I google: "php mysql security problems" => it gives a lot of result if I google: "jdbc mysql security problems" => hardly see any related pages Does it mean, using jdbc is secure? Dont need to worry about being hack?
