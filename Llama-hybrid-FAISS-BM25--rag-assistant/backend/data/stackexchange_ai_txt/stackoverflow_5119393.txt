Word: SyncScrollingSideBySide and ScrollIntoView

One feature of our Word add-in shows two document windows side-by-side. The user can double-click a paragraph in the left-hand document to scroll an associated paragraph in the right-hand document into view. When we do this, we want to re-enable Synchronous Scrolling if it was enabled before the double-click. We're doing something like this: private void LineUpParagraphs() { // Unlock the views so we can scroll them independently. bool wasSyncEnabled = this.originalDocument.Document.Windows.SyncScrollingSideBySide; this.originalDocument.Document.Windows.SyncScrollingSideBySide = false; // Scroll corresponding original paragraph into view. this.originalDocument.Document.Windows[1].ScrollIntoView( this.CurrentOriginalParagraph.Range); // Re-enable synchronous scrolling if it was enabled before. if (wasSyncEnabled) { this.originalDocument.Document.Windows.SyncScrollingSideBySide = true; } } After doing this, the desired range is in view in the original (right-hand for our app) document, but as soon as you scroll either window, the right-hand window jumps back to its original position. Things we've tried that didn't work: Set the SyncScrollingSideBySide property on all of the Application windows rather than just one of the two compare documents. Toggle the property an additional time. We've resorted to SendKeys to simulate a click on the Synchronous Scrolling button. (If you don't re-enable the sync programatically, then click the button yourself, the right-hand document doesn't jump back to its original position when you scroll). This isn't really an acceptable solution, though--it is inconsistent for example depending on whether our add-in's tab is active. Sometimes it works, sometimes it toggles the sync scrolling an additional time which will annoy the customer. Is there a better way? Note: The issue occurs when the left-hand document is longer than the right-hand document (the one being scrolled).
