If this is about an HTML element, you will not be able to determine the width in PHP with 100% reliability. You would have to actually render the element in the client browser to find it out, and that is possible only using JavaScript. Plus there are many factors on client side that can play into the result: The operating system's text size level The browser's zoom level The availability of the font used on the client machine You may be best off manually determining the element's width in an average web browser with normal zoom (or if it's dynamic text, maybe use what @Jared proposes)
