Publishing multiple versions of one app on Google Market

I have an Android app that I would like to display high quality images with. However there are many different screen sizes and ratios. I know there are filters to show apps in Market only for devices with small/medium/large screens. If I put images of both sizes in 1 app it will double the size of the app, right? Is it a good practice to make multiple versions for different screen sizes? I would like to make 1 app in 3 versions for such devices: medium screen mdpi medium screen hdpi + large screen mdpi large (tablets) If it's possible to do it how can I specify them in manifests? Or is it somewhere in market?
