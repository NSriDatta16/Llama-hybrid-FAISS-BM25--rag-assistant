A standard Unix command-line tool for piping to a socket

I have some applications, and standard Unix tools sending their output to named-pipes in Solaris, however named pipes can only be read from the local storage (on Solaris), so I can't access them from over the network or place the pipes on an NFS storage for networked access to their output. Which got me wondering if there was an analogous way to forward the output of command-line tools directly to sockets, say something like: mksocket mysocket:12345 vmstat 1 > mysocket 2>&1
