How to specify applet libraries in JNLP file

I'm trying to deploy an applet using JNLP. The file structure is thus: / dbstats.html dbstats.jnlp dbstats.jar lib/ substance.jar trident.jar guava-0.7.jar Here's my HTML: Dreambearstatistieken var attributes = { code:'dreambear.stats.viewer.DBStatsViewer', width:900, height:600 }; var parameters = {jnlp_href: "dbstats.jnlp"}; var version = "1.6"; deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version); And the JNLP file: Dreambearstatistieken Weber As far as I can see, everything should be ok, but it's not. I get a ClassNotFoundException on org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceNebulaLookAndFeel , which is in substance.jar . What am I doing wrong? And wider, is there a good tutorial or book about using applets and JNLP in the 2010s?
