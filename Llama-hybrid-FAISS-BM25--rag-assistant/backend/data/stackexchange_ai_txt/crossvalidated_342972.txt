Deciding to the clustering algorithm for the dataset containing both categorical and numerical variables

I am a newbie in machine learning and trying to make a segmentation with clustering algorithms. However, Since my dataset has both categorical variables (such as gender, marital status, preferred social media platform etc) as well as numerical variables ( average expenditure, age, income etc.), I could not decide which algorithms worth to focus on. Which one should I try: hierarchical clustering, fuzzy c means, k-medoids, or latent class to compare with k-means++? which ones would yield better results for these type of mixed datasets? Bonus question: Should I try to do clustering without dimensionality reduction? or should I use PCA or K-PCA in any case to decrease dimensions? Also, how can I understand and interpret results without visualization if the dataset has more than 3 dimensions?
