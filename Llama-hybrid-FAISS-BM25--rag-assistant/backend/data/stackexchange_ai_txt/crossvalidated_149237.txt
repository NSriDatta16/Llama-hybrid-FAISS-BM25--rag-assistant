Fit multidimensional feature into design matrix

I'm having trouble understanding how I can have a multidimensional feature in my design matrix. I understand the concepts of PCA, but I'd rather avoid it. I have the feeling that I'm missing out on some knowledge here, since this seems to have a trivial solution that I wasn't able to find or figure out. $X$ is my sample x feature matrix, where the class label is also added. The features are $f_1$, $f_2$ and $f_3$. $$ X = \begin{bmatrix} \text{class} & f_1 & f_2\\ 1 & 0 & 3 \\[0.3em] 1 & 0 & 6 \\[0.3em] 2 & 4 & 3 \\ 2 & \dots & \dots \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ and $$ f_3 = \begin{bmatrix} a & x \\[0.3em] b & y \\[0.3em] \end{bmatrix} .$$ I don't know how to fit $f_3$ in there. I want to use this kind of structure for classification with an SVM, where $f_3$ would be a SIFT/SURF/HOG/or-something-else-that-I-don't-know-yet descriptor. I'm using libsvm or the SVM in matlab; I haven't decided yet.
