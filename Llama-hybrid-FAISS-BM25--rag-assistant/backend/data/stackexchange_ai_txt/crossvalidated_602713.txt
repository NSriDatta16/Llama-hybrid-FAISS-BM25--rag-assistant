There are different correlation coefficients ( Pearson , Spearman , ... ) and broadly they measure whether as variable X increases, variable Y tends to increase/decrease as well. This requires that for both X and Y we have a concept of "ordering". Otherwise we won't be able to say what it means for the variable to "increase" or "decrease". You have countries and artists. There isn't an obvious way to impose an order on either, so I would say that the correlation between countries and artists is not well-defined, or at least it's not obvious how to define it. Here is how I might consider analyzing this dataset in your place. I can take any two countries and look at how often the same artists are mentioned (in local publications about the music industry). I would compute the similarity (or perhaps the dissimilarity) between the pair of countries, and cautiously interpret this as a measure of similarity/dissimilarity in musical preferences. Once I calculate this measure for all pairs of countries, I have a square (dis)similarity matrix that I can analyze further. For example, for each country, I can find its "closest musical neighbor". Or I can cluster the countries to visualize patterns of shared musical tastes... I can do a very similar analysis of the artists by looking at the coverage they receive in different countries. And once I have done this I would probably ask if the patterns of similarities/dissimilarities I've discovered are associated with characteristics such as: continent, national language, popular musical styled etc. (for countries) and primary language of lyrics, number of albums, origin, preferred genre etc. (for artists).
