Mobile devices using CSS3 media queries and "handheld" :) I like the idea of being able to provide a viable alternative to mobile users; smartphone users (media queries related to screen size filter these) deserve attention as a rule. Focus on information structure and content design become more important with the difference between the different representations. I wonder to what extent "print" really is a good idea: should we encourage people to print content from the web? I can see the validity of this in a few cases, but not as a general rule.
