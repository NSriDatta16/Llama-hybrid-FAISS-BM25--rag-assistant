where to save a jpeg file from an applet

I have a java applet that creates a JPEG file. I want to pass that file to a Javascript where it can display and print it. The only way I can think of doing this is to save the jpeg to a temporary storage area on the user's computer and then pass the path of the file to the javascript which picks it up and displays it. This raises a two questions: Where should the applet store the file. If you suggest the temporary internet files folder, then how do I find that path to that folder? Is there a better way to do this? Can I pass the JPEG directly from java to javascript without first writing out to a disk? Thank you in advance for your help.
