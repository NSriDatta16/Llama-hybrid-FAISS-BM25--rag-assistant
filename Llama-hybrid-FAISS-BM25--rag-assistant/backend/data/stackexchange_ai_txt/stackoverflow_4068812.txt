Do use OOP : to have logical representations of both stateful and stateless "things" that may be manipulated, have attributes, or be used in a variety of ways because you see the benefit in data encapsulation because you get that a Tacoma is a Toyota is a PassengerVehicle is a Vehicle because you want to provide people who will develop with this class easy to use interfaces Do not use OOP : just to group a seemingly related set of functions together just because someone here says you should if you think it will make your boss happy until you've at least looked over the Gang of Four's design patterns - the benefits become more clear
