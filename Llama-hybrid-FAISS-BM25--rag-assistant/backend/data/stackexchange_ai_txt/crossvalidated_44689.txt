Regression with missing covariate data

My question is related to regression with missing covariate data. I have a sample of count data representing number of explosion incidents at each year. First $M$ observations were made by considering one criteria and the last $K$ were made considering two criteria. E.g. for the first $M$ years explosions were recorded if there were some human injuries and then, due to the change of regulations, explosion were recorded if they caused human injuries OR the damage were higher than, say, $D$. I introduce two binary covariates: $X_{1}$ for human injury criteria and $X_{2}$ for damage criteria. So, I get that the first covariate $X_{1}$ is always observed and equal to 1 for the first $M$ years but not for the next $K$ years. The second covariate $X_{2}$ for the first year is not observed at all (so it might be 0 or 1), while for the last $K$ years both covariates are not observed but I know that at least one of them is equal to 1. At first I though that I just put a Bernoulli distribution on these two covariates and integrate out them. Then I perform Bayesian analysis. So, at first I state the model (for simplicity, assume we have just one covariate) $$Y|\theta_{1},\theta_{2}\sim \mathrm{Poisson} \left (\mathrm{exp}\left [ \theta_{1}X_{1}+\theta_{2} \right ] \right )$$ $$X|p\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$$ Then perform integration over $X_{1}$: $$\pi(Y|p,\theta)=\frac{1}{Y!}\left ( \mathrm{exp}\left ( -e^{\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}}+Y\left ( \theta_{1}+\theta_{2} \right ) \right )p + \mathrm{exp}\left ( -e^{\theta_{2}}+Y \theta_{2} \right )(1-p) \right )$$ Having this, I form likelihood, state priors and obtain estimates. As I understand, such approach is a so called "Missing completely at random or MCAR". However I understand that in my problem the missingness model is different from MCAR, but I do not know what model would be more appropriate. Any advise would be appreciated.
