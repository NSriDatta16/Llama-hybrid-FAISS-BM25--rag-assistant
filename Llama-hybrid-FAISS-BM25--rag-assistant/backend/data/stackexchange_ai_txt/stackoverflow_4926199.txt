As others have noted, there are an infinite number of ways of combining values. You've tagged the question machine-learning and artificial-intelligence, which suggests you might want to find the optimum way of combining them? Eg. come up with a "goodness" metric, and try to model this from the others. Then there are a range of machine learning algorithms - eg. a Bayesian Model would be a good start: Fast, generally performs well if not necessarily the best.
