I have a problem in bayesian networks get p(E|A)

I'm doing this book "Modeling and reasoning with Bayesian Networks" and I have this problem: ConsidertheDAGinFigure4.14: (a) List the Markovian assumptions asserted by the DAG. (b) Express Pr(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) in terms of network parameters. (c) Compute Pr(A = 0, B = 0) and Pr(E = 1 | A = 1). Justify your answers. (d) True or false? Why? - dsep(A, BH, E) - dsep(G, D, E) - dsep(AB,F,GH) I have done almost all the question, but I'm missing c) p(E=1|A=1), I have tried p(E and A)/p(A), but this does not seem correct and for p(A=0, B=0) is this correct p(A) p(B)=(0.8)(0.3), any help?? Thanks.
