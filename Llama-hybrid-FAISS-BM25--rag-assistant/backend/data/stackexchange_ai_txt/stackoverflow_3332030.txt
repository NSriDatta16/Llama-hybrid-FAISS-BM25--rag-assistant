I think that you are going about this problem the wrong way. Writing a half-decent style checker is a difficult task, especially if you are going to cope with all of the possible "trivial" variations of constructs (e.g. different modifier orders) and all points of potential fragility (e.g. "hits" on stuff in comments and string literals). IMO, a better approach would be to use an existing source code checker and define your own style checking rules. This is easy to do in PMD . PMD has the advantage that its rules operate on a parsed AST. This makes them much less sensitive to syntactic variations, etc than anything implemented using regex matches on source files.
