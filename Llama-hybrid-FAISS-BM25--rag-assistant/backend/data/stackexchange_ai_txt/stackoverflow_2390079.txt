Java Swing and Windows XP touch events

I'm trying to find a concrete yes for some assumptions I have about developing a Java Swing app to be run on a Windows tablet device (I believe it'll be running Windows XP). We have a demo we are writing and we're leveraging previous experience with Java Swing to write the UI and I just want to make sure that touch events in Windows are treated like mouse clicks, is this true? Does anyone have any direct experience writing Swing apps for Windows tablets? The target device is http://www.amazon.com/Promotion-X70EX-3GP-Accessory-Standard/dp/B002MZZX76 . Also, wondering if the soft keyboard will automatically be activated when focus is given to a JTextField and other Swing data entry fields. Thanks!
