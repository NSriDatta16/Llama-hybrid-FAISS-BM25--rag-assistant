Reinforcement learning reward waiting list

In reinforcement learning (RL), we design the reward function so that the agent can learn the optimal policy. In my problem the agent is the manager of a waiting list, I have T ressources that i want to allocate to N subjects each one at stage j. How can i specify the reward function in this context so that the the utility of all the customers is maximized ?
