Is it fine to get this results in binary logistic regression?

I wanted to check whether the level of satisfaction relates to the level of support to the value of democracy. Dependent variable (support) is binary variable (Good/Bad) and independent variable is ordinary variable (level of satisfaction). After doing binary logistic regression, I got this “strange” figure. Is this result correct? Or how can I fix it? satisfaction Here is a part of data: satisfaction support 1 7 1 2 8 1 3 8 1 4 8 1 5 10 1 6 6 1 7 7 1 8 7 1 9 7 1 10 8 0 11 8 1 12 7 1 13 7 0 14 1 1 15 7 1 16 8 1 17 6 1 18 7 1 19 8 1 20 8 1 [Added 1] Based on the first answer, I got this results: > satisfaction_j chisq.test(table(satisfaction_j,support)) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: table(satisfaction_j, support) X-squared = 2158, df = 2157, p-value = 0.4899 > t.test(satisfaction_j~support) Welch Two Sample t-test data: satisfaction_j by support t = -2.7775, df = 459.931, p-value = 0.005703 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.57390716 -0.09829989 sample estimates: mean in group 0 mean in group 1 7.164214 7.500317
