The APPEND hint is only useful for a heap-organized table. When you insert into an IOT, I suspect that each row has to be inserted into the real index structure separately, causing a lot of re-balancing of the index. When you build the index on a heap table, a temp segment is used and I'm guessing that this allows it to reduce the re-balancing overhead that would otherwise take place. I suspect that if you created an empty, heap-organized table with the primary key, and did the same insert without the APPEND hint, it would take more like the 18 hours. You might try putting an ORDER BY on your SELECT and see how that affects the performance of the insert into the IOT. It's not guaranteed to be an improvement by any means, but it might be.
