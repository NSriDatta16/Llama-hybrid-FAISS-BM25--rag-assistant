In my experience, using accuracy alone as an evaluation metric for solving class-imbalance problems. It is better to tune the cost function and the hyperparameters considering few metrics, including the overall accuracy, precision, recall, average precision, etc. Sometimes there exists a tradeoff between accuracy and average precision in class imbalance problems. There is no "one right way," so you have to rely on heuristics to some extent. For more information refer to these papers regarding class imbalance problems: Longadge et al 2013 , Guo et al 2008
