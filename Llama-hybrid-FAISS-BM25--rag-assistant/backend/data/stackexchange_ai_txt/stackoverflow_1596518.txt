Automated link-checker for system testing

I often have to work with fragile legacy websites that break in unexpected ways when logic or configuration are updated. I don't have the time or knowledge of the system needed to create a Selenium script. Besides, I don't want to check a specific use case - I want to verify every link and page on the site. I would like to create an automated system test that will spider through a site and check for broken links and crashes. Ideally, there would be a tool that I could use to achieve this. It should have as many as possible of the following features, in descending order of priority: Triggered via script Does not require human interaction Follows all links including anchor tags and links to CSS and js files Produces a log of all found 404s, 500s etc. Can be deployed locally to check sites on intranets Supports cookie/form-based authentication Free/Open source There are many partial solutions out there, like FitNesse , Firefox's LinkChecker and the W3C link checker , but none of them do everything I need. I would like to use this test with projects using a range of technologies and platforms, so the more portable the solution the better. I realise this is no substitute for proper system testing, but it would be very useful if I had a convenient and automatable way of verifying that no part of the site was obviously broken.
