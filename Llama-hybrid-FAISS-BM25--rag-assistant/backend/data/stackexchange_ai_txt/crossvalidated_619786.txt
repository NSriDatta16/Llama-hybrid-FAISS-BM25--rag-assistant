Way of estimating the parameters of a distribution that encourages samples not to try to game the system?

There is a distribution $D(\theta)$ , where $\theta$ represents the parameters of the distribution. To sample from the distribution, a bunch of people are called to give their samples $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ . Given those samples, one can estimate $\theta$ , and we'll all be on our merry way. However, a lot rides on what $\theta$ ends up being. So while person $i$ 's true sample is $x_i$ , he wants $\theta$ to be estimated to be $\theta_i$ (his preference), and he has reason to believe that $\tilde{\theta}_i$ will be what the ultimate estimate ends up being. So he strategically says that his sample is $\tilde{x}_i$ , instead of the $x_i$ he truly believes it to be. The simplest example would be a friend that once told me that, if they see the rating of a movie lower than they'd like, they rate it a 10 (to get the average closer to the value they want). And vice versa (rating a movie a 0 to lower the rating to what they truly believe). I'm not sure there's any decent mathematical methods to prevent my friend's psychopathic behavior, but in certain cases, I wonder if there actually might be hope. Namely, I want an estimator (not necessarily maximum likelihood) that prevents people from trying to game it (i.e. $\tilde{x}_i = x_i$ no matter what $\theta_i$ and $\tilde{\theta}_i$ are). And the particular example I had in mind as I came up with this question was for the Dirichlet distribution $D(\alpha)$ . A bunch of people want to decide how to allocate a finite resource (e.g. water) across $K$ places. But each person has their ideal distribution $p_i$ , what they think the ultimate distribution will end up being $\tilde{\alpha}_i$ , and the thing they say $\tilde{p}_i$ to get the final answer closer to their ideal. Is there any way to estimate $\alpha$ so that people don't feel incentivized to lie about their true feelings to game the system? My hunch is "no", as a lot of voting theory proves that a perfect un-gameable voting system doesn't exist . That being said, there are "better" voting systems that are "less gameable", and so I was hoping for a better estimator that was less gameable. If there's no clear answer, I'd also like to know if there are any research buzzwords that are relevant to this.
