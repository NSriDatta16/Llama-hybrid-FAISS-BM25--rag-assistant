While you could use NSUserDefaults this way isn't the most elegant solution. Defaults are a place to keep application settings not application data . A good guideline is to think of your data item as appearing in your app's settings and whether it is valid there. In your case the number of times the app has been opened is not a user setting; it isn't something that the user will be able to change, is it? A better way would be to write the data to a plist, which is a simple and fast way of storing application data. Have a look at the instructions here for example (there are others available with a quick search), which should get you started.
