How the browser interprets the target is browser dependent - each vendor will specify what they want. Firefox decided to use a new tab, IE decided to use a new window. The html 4.01 spec has this to say on "_blank": The user agent should load the designated document in a new, unnamed window. The spec predates the wide usage tabbed browsing now has, so doesn't mention the concept anywhere.
