My answer to your initial question is that you shouldn't worry about the message, because (1) it is telling you that the minimum expected count is greater than 5 (the table in your question shows observed counts), which is the usually accepted cutoff for when it's OK to do a chi-squared test and (2) even if it were below 5, an exact test like Fisher's isn't harmed by this. (FET makes fixed-margin assumptions that may or may not be problematic , but you probably don't need to worry about this ...) However, I have more to say about your analysis: since your three columns are "total", "cured", and "not cured" (the first is the sum of the second and third), it really doesn't make any sense to analyze this as a 4x3 table (where there are 4 predictor [row] categories and 3 response [column] categories). It would be better to analyze a 4x2 table with only "cured" and "not cured". Although it's a very popular approach, I would not recommend modeling by first screening for significant predictors in a series of univariate analyses and then incorporating the significant variables in a single multivariate analysis. I would only do this kind of two-stage process if I had a very large data set, so large that it wasn't computationally practical to run the model with all of the predictors, and if I only cared about prediction rather than inference. Otherwise, this is a recipe for overfitting and overconfidence (confidence intervals that are too narrow and p-values that are too small). My suggestion would be to fit a single multivariate logistic regression with a reasonable subset of predictors selected a priori , and to read Chapter 4 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies about modeling strategies for analyses that are focused on exploration, prediction, or inference. your Gram-positive observations (18 cured, 0 not cured) will indeed be a problem, leading to complete separation in a logistic regression; you can read about possible solutions here or here (although I'm not sure the best solutions will be available in SPSS ...)
