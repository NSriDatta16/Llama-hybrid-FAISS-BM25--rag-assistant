disableUndoRegistration is still allowing undo operations

I want to disable undo registration for an operation on an NSManagedObject but it still records the operation even though I explicitly call disableUndoRegistration. Is there something obvious I am missing? I also tried to enable/disable in the viewWillAppear and viewWillDisappear methods, respectively. Here is some example code... #pragma mark - #pragma mark NotesViewControllerDelegate methods - (void)notesViewController:(NotesViewController *)controller didFinishWithSave:(BOOL)save { if (save) { [undoManager disableUndoRegistration]; [book setNotes:[controller getDataFromText]]; [undoManager enableUndoRegistration]; } }
