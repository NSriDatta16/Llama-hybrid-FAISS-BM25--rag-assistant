Uniqueness of SVM solutions in term of l1 and l2 losses

I have been reading several articles to find reasonable answers for the difference between L1 (hinge loss)and L2 (squared hinge loss) in solving the primal and dual SVM problems. I need help to find out answers for these questions: When the solution of the dual problem is not unique, with respect to L1 loss? When the solution of the primal problem is not unique, with respect to L1 loss? Does non-uniqueness affect the performance of classification (in terms of accuracy)? How can we make the primal and dual solutions unique? What is the relation between uniqueness solution and the bias b, “ I read that the solution is not unique if and only if b is not unique”? How do we know the unique value of the bias b? Why non-uniqueness solution only happens with hinge loss not with squared hinge loss? Many thanks for any help.
