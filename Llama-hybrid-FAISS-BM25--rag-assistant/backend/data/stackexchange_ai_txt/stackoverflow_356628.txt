That looks suspiciously like an LDAP or Active Directory distinguished name formatted according to RFC 2253 / 4514 . Unless you're working with well known names and/or are okay with a fragile hackaround (like the regex solutions) - then you should start by reading the spec. If you, like me, generally hate implementing code according to RFCs - then hope this guy did a better job following the spec than you would. At least he claims to be 2253 compliant.
