How to calculate the standard errors of the variance components of a mixed model using glmer with a Poisson distribution in R?

I have a set of count data, and want to find out how the variance is partitioned among random effects. Let’s say I counted the number jumps that animals did. In my model, I included (apart from three fixed effects: trial number, species, habitat), two random effects: individual and population. I want to know how much variance in the data is caused by differences between individuals, differences between populations and differences within individuals (i.e. residual variation). I fitted a generalized mixed model, using the function glmer from the package lme4 : myModel The part of the output dealing with the random effects looks like this: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. individual (Intercept) 4.933e+00 2.2210832 population (Intercept) 5.243e-07 0.0007241 This output does not give the residual variance, as I was used from the outputs of lmer models with a Gaussian distribution, see here: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. individual (Intercept) 4.947e-01 7.034e-01 population (Intercept) 1.522e-10 1.234e-05 Residual 1.144e+00 1.069e+00 If I correctly understand Nakagawa & Schielzeth 2010 (Biological Reviews), I can calculate the residual variance from my Poisson model using: ω · ln(1 / exp(β0) + 1) ω being the dispersion of the model, β0 the grand mean. However, this formula will only result in an average value of variance, but not its standard error. The same for the variances of the two random effects individual and population. So, my question: Is there a way to calculate the standard errors of both the variances of the random effects and that of the residual variance?
