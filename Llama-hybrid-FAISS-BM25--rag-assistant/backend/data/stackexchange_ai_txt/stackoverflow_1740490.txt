in app purchase timeout error (-1001)

i get a timeout error (-1001) when trying to make an in app purchase. this began happening suddenly after in-app-purchase had been working fine for a while. what happens now is that i see my inventory, complete with prices retreived from apple, but after i attempt a purchase and the following code is executed: SKPayment *payment = [SKPayment paymentWithProductIdentifier: product.productIdentifier]; [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] addPayment: payment]; all i get is a timeout error. i created a test project with nothing but the storefront supplied by a reliable third party (urban airship) which i'd been using successfully with some alterations in my app. i got the same in app purchase timeout error, which strongly suggests some kind of issue on apple's end (it seems that either my device or my app id have gotten blackballed somehow -- perhaps after i'd uninstalled the app a bunch of times to reset its state -- at least with the sandbox servers). so now the question is what to do about it. any help would be appreciated.
