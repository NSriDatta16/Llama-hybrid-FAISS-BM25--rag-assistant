From POD::Parser Please note that POD has the notion of "paragraphs": this is something starting after a blank (read: empty) line, with the single exception of the file start, which is also starting a paragraph. That means that especially a command (e.g. =head1 ) must be preceded with a blank line ; END is not a blank line. see perlpodspec also, you will find the reason why blank lines needed.
