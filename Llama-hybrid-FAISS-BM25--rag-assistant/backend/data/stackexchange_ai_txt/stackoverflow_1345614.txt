I have thought about this problem too. It is theoritically possible and there are some research papers on this topic. there used to be pretty cool tool at www.dbtools.cs.cornell.edu. This was developed by the famous author Raghu Ramakrishnan. He is currently at Yahoo Research. You can refer to the following papers for more information Diederich,T. and Miton,J.,(1988),"New Methods and Fast Algorithms for Database Normalization ",ACM Transactions on Database Systems, 13(3),339-365. Bernstein, P. A.(1986),"Synthesizing Third Normal Form Relations from Functional Dependencies",ACM Transactions on Database Systems , Vol.1. No. 4, pp 277-298. JMathNorm: A Database Normalization Tool Using Mathematica, Lecture Notes In Computer Science; Vol. 4488, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Computational Science, Part II, Ali Yazici, Ziya Karakaya The third link is very interesting. Here is the abstract of the paper: This paper is about designing a complete interactive tool, named JMathNorm, for relational database (RDB) normalization using Mathematica. It is an extension of the prototype developed by the same authors [1] with the inclusion of Second Normal Form (2NF), and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in addition to the existing Third normal Form (3NF) module. The tool developed in this study is complete and can be used for real-time database design as well as an aid in teaching fundamental concepts of DB normalization to students with limited mathematical background. JMathNorm also supports interactive use of modules for experimenting the fundamental set operations such as closure, and full closure together with modules to obtain the minimal cover of the functional dependency set and testing an attribute for a candidate key. JMathNorm's GUI interface is written in Java and utilizes Mathematica's JLink facility to drive the Mathematica kernel. I am also very interested in an answer to this question. If anyone has come across a tool, please let us know!
