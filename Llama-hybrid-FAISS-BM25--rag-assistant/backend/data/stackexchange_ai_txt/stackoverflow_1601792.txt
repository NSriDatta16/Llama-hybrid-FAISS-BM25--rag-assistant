In our team... It is our pratice to usualy make a new branche in the repository for new developpments, and then merge them in the trunk to be tagged, when ready to be deployed in production. So we checkout all the branche we are working on. Also, using SVN, multiple coder can work on the same file as SVN do not lock the file and let you merge them after, but that's a relly rare case. Auto-merge won't always work and you'll have to do some "manual merging". First tests are done localy, then deployed in a developpement environment, then acceptance environment. The code tested in the DEV and acceptance enviroment is builded by Luntbuild/ANT and delpoyed in our ApplicationServer via Jythons scripts. We never deploy or build manualy outside of the local environment. When possible, we ask other people of the team to test those deploy. Cactus API let you "warp up" jUnit test for servlets/struts/web app. We do some stress test with JMeter, and Selenium (nice firefox plugin) for some other tests. You can also run coverage tools (like EMMA) that let you know what percentage of the code is covered by your jUnit/Cactus tests.
