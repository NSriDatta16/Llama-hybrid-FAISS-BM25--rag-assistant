Generalized likelihood ratio test - discrete data

Let $X_1, \dots , X_n$ be a random sample from an exponential distribution with the density function $f(x \mid \theta) = \theta \exp(-\theta x)$. Also $H_0 : \theta = 1$ versus $H_a : \theta \neq 1$, level of significance $\alpha=5\%$. Solution : Applying the likelihood ratio test I got the following for my ratio: $$(\theta_0 \overline{X} \exp (-\theta_0\overline{X} + 1))^n \,,$$ so we have a rejection region of: $$ \overline{X} \exp(-\theta_0\overline{X}) \leq \theta_0^{-1}ec^{1/n}\,,$$ since $\theta_0=1$ simplifies to: $$\overline{X} \exp(-\overline{X}) \leq ec^{1/n} \,.$$ Question: if given a set of $n$ data points, how do I determine whether I reject $H_0$ and how do I determine the p-value? Is there any way to verify the solution in R? Edit : I understand that the exponential is a continuous distribution. The problem asked to derive the generalized likelihood ratio test given the above information, from which I got the first equation. It notes that when $\theta=1$ than $\Sigma_iX_i$ follows $\Gamma(n,\frac{1}{\theta})$. The part I am asking about, states that we observed $5$ data points: $0.33, 0.24, 0.33, 0.44, 1.72$, would we accept or reject our $H_0$ and to find the p-value. Looking at the above inequality we know all variable but $c$, I think we can use the fact that it follows the Gamma and that the significance level is $5\%$ to find our value of $c$. So that $95\%$ coverage is attained, $2.5\%$ on each side. If the inequality proves true, we accept the hypothesis, reject it otherwise.
