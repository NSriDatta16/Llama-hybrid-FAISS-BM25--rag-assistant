Why is spawning threads in Java EE container discouraged?

One of the first things I've learned about Java EE development is that I shouldn't spawn my own threads inside a Java EE container. But when I come to think about it, I don't know the reason. Can you clearly explain why it is discouraged? I am sure most enterprise applications need some kind of asynchronous jobs like mail daemons, idle sessions, cleanup jobs, etc. So, if indeed one shouldn't spawn threads, what is the correct way to do it when needed?
