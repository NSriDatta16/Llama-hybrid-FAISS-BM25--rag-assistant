If you're trying to compute an average, then you don't need to save the numbers. Save yourself the work of worrying about the array. Simply accumulate (add) each number to a single total, count each number, then divide when you're done. Two variables are all that you need. With this method, you aren't in any risk of overflowing your array, so you can use a while loop... while (temp != -1)
