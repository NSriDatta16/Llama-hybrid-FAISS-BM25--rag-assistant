Why is the PPO agent in RL giving negative rewards after each iteration during the training process and what are the possible hyperparameter values?

I am using the mujoco simulator as my training environment. I loaded Ant-v3 for the agent to train on. It is persistently producing negative rewards after each iteration performed.
