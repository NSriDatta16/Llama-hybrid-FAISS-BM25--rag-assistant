The whole concept of cloud services is to abstract away the gory details of hosting applications and services over the internet. If you've ever run your own web server you can appreciate the pain and suffering this avoids. In order for a cloud to be useful for your typical application, it must provide services for storing files, hosting websites, and data services at a minimum. Sql Azure provides the data services for Azure. Why not just a sql server? Well, you can always host your own database on some server somewhere and consume it from a website hosted on Azure... but what happens when your website becomes popular? Your Sql Server now isn't serving data fast enough, so you have to move all your stuff to a bigger server, buy more bandwidth, etc. And then when you get more popular, you go through the same thing again. All you have to do is read the posts on the StackOverflow blog about Jeff dealing with the hardware and software trials of handling the load this site is generating. Its called a pain in the ass. With Sql Azure, as your website grows the bandwidth and storage for your data increases dynamically. If you serve a gig a month or a hundred, you pay for what you use and you don't have to worry about upgrading your servers. That's the power of cloud computing.
