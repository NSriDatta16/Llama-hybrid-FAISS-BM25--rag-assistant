Exercise about exponential distribution

My textbook has this exercise, in the section regarding exponential distribution: Given an arrival process with $\lambda = 8.0$ , what is the probability that an arrival occurs in the first $t = 7$ time units? I used this formula: $F(t)=1-e^{-Î»t}$ To give this solution: $P=1-e^{(-8)(7)}=1-e^{-56}\approx1$ But the suggested solution was this: $P=1-e^{(-\frac18)(7)}=1-e^{-\frac78}\approx0.58314$ Could you kindly explain me why I was wrong? I really don't get why the book used the mean instead of using lambda in the formula. To me it made sense that, if there's an average of 8 arrivals every $t$ , the probability of a single arrival occurring in the first 7 $t$ should be almost 1. Thanks!
