Statistically correct to apply Multi-dimensional scaling or PCA to cosine similarity matrix?

Supposing I have a document-term matrix as scripted below: library(tidytext) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(stylo) library(ggplot2) txt1 % unnest_tokens(output = word, input = texts) %>% group_by(doc, word) %>% summarise(totals = n()) %>% ungroup %>% spread(word, totals, fill = 0) %>% select(-doc) %>% as.matrix %>% scale(center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) %>% dist.cosine %>% cmdscale %>% data.frame a1$name Q1. Is it Statistically correct to apply Multi-dimensional scaling (in R , this is via cmdscale ) or PCA on a Cosine Similarity matrix? I think it is not, since Cosine Similarity is not a proper distance metric. If the application is incorrect, could you please state why? If the application is correct, could you again, please, state why? Q2. Could you also state if z-score transformation is at all required for computing the cosine similarity?
