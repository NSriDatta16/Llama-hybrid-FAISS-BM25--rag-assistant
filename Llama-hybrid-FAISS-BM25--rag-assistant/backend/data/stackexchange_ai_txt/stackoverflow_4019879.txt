Recording website load times?

I am trying to record the time it takes to load my website on an average (say 10 runs) from various locations in the world. For this, I was thinking of using a list of proxies to achieve this and am not sure this is the perfect way of doing this. Is there a Firefox add-on that lets me time this perhaps using Firebug itself? Is there an alternate way of running this test? Any tips from the testing community would be awesome.
