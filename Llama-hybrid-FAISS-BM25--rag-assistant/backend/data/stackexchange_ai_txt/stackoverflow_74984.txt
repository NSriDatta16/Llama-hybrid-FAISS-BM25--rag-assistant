With Outlook 2007, Microsoft decided to stop using the IE engine for rendering the HTML, and use the Word engine instead. This means you are severely restricted with the styling you can apply if you need to make your emails work for Outlook 2007 users. Unfortunately, float is one of the features that Outlook 2007 does not support - for column layout you are forced to use tables. :( Note, to get IE working better, make sure you have a valid DOCTYPE so it does not revert to Quirks Mode. The simplest DOCTYPE that works best across all user agents is the proposed HTML5 DOCTYPE, which is simply: That's all there is to it - none of the other stuff is needed. (Note, whilst it works in browsers, the W3 validator will complain about this doctype - you can use the override DOCTYPE feature if you want to use the validator.) Back to what CSS you can use in emails... There is a PDF showing which CSS attributes are supported across different clients here: http://www.campaignmonitor.com/reports/Guide_to_CSS_Support_in_Email_2007.pdf And here are some further details about what is and isn't supported: http://www.email-standards.org/clients/microsoft-outlook-2007/ http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/04/a_guide_to_css_support_in_emai_2.html
