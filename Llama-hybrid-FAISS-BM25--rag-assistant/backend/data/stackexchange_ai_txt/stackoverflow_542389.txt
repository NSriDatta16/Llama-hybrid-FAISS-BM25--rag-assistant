ASP.NET MVC - handling multiple objects in one form

I have a scenario I'm stuck on - I have a domain object that has a collection of objects attached to it. Something like this: public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } public IList PhoneNumbers {get; set; } public IList Addresses { get; set; } } The UI the client wants has a single input form for adding and editing. A user could enter 0 to many phones/addresses for each person. How do I handle posting the collection of values back to the controller? I can think of a couple of approaches, but they all seem brute-force and not very elegant. Is there a best practice for handling this sort of problem?
