Dismissing a UIAlertView on any touch

I am trying to use a UIAlertView essentially as a label (no title or buttons, just display text) for aesthetic purposes. I want to be able to continue to use everything else in the app (touch other buttons, etc.) while the alert view is being shown. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to invoke touchesBegan or a selector using a UITapGestureRecognizer while the alert view is shown. These both work when the alert view is not shown, but it seems like the alert view disables detection of any touches (other than touching its own buttons if it had them). Does anyone know a way I could work around this? Even if I was to create a UILabel and set its background to the alert view image that would work. Thanks for your help.
