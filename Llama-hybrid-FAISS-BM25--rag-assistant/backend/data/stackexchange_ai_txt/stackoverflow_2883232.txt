If you allow the column to store more than 21 characters, then some day some joker (or maybe just a program bug) may come along and load a value that is more than 21 characters, and fun and games will ensue. If they can never store an invalid-length value in the talbe, then a query against the table will never return an invalid-length value. Oh, and varchar(x) will require (x + 2) bytes of storage per row/column, with that extra 2 bytes indicating the length of the string actually being stored in that row/column.
