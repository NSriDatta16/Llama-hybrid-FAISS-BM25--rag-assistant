Here are a few options: You could use a mixed effects model where patient is the random effect and right/left is the fixed effect. This would assume a normal distribution and it is not obvious how much non-normality would affect the conclusions, some type of simulation would be helpful to asses your trust in the results, or perhaps an adjustment to make them more trustworthy. You could do a Bayesian hierarchical model. You would not need to assume normality, but some form of distributional assumption would be needed. You could do a permutation test. One way to do this would be to take the mean of all the right values minus the mean of all the left values, then randomly permute the values within each patient and find the difference again, repeat a bunch of times and see where your original difference falls in the distribution of permuted differences. You could also fit the mixed effects model and use the permutation approach to do the test on the differences. I personally would probably favor one of the permutation approaches.
