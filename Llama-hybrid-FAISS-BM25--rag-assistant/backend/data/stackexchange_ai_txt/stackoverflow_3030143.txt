JavaScript should be unobtrusive . That means that you use your JavaScript like CSS - target selectors on the page. The only 'hooks' you need are HTML classes and ids. So keep all your JavaScript in separate files. It doesn't matter if you have it all in one file or in separate files, whatever works for you. This isn't quite true, there are technical reasons why you might choose one JavaScript file or lots of separate ones, but probably for now organise the files so they make sense. You can always use a tool to compile all your JavaScript into one file and minify it at the same time.
