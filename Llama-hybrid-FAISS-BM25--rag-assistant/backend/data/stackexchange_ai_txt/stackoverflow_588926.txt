As stated in other posts, you can use the break keyword. One thing that was hinted at but not explained is that the keyword can take a numeric value to tell PHP how many levels to break from. For example, if you have three foreach loops nested in each other trying to find a piece of information, you could do 'break 3' to get out of all three nested loops. This will work for the 'for', 'foreach', 'while', 'do-while', or 'switch' structures. $person = "Rasmus Lerdorf"; $found = false; foreach($organization as $oKey=>$department) { foreach($department as $dKey=>$group) { foreach($group as $gKey=>$employee) { if ($employee['fullname'] == $person) { $found = true; break 3; } } // group } // department } // organization
