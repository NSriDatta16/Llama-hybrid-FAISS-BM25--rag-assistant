Compojure has been working very well for me so far. I like the simplicity of the design, the flexibility and the fact that it encourages a nice idiomatic functional style. Sample server: (use 'compojure) (defroutes my-app (GET "/index.html" (html [:h1 "Hello World!!"] [:body "This is some text"])) (ANY "*" [404 "Page not found"])) (run-server {:port 80} "/*" (servlet my-app)) Note that Compojure uses Ring internally.
