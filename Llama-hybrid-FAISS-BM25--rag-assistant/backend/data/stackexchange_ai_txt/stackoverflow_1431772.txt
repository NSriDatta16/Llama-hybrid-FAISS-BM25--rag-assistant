If you consider the fundamental building blocks of the web you will realise that the iframe should never be removed. I have the feeling that many web developers do not properly understand the concepts of data centric systems and prefer to work in a procedural, top-down, application centric manner. There are many things done with async HTTP requests and Javascript that should simply use an iframe. There are two fundamental concepts when it comes to linking content in a data centric world like the web - cross referencing and embedding. Hyperlinks are used to cross reference data while iframes are used to embed data. URLs are used to reference data in both cases. A simple example is linking to an image. Cross referencing an image would be done as follows: Link to the image While embedding an image would be achieved as follows: Of course you could use the "img" element to embed an image instead, but that is specific to images... I vote that the "img" element be removed in favor of using the more generic and flexible iframe.
