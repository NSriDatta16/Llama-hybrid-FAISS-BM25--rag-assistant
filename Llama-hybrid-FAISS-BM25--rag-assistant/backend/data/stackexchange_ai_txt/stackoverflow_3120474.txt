I am making the assumption that the human cannot see the computer agent playing the game. If this is the case, here is one idea you might try. Create a list of all the possible point combinations that can be scored for any given move. For each move, find a score range which you would like the agent to end up within after the current turn. Reduce the set of possible move values to only the values which would end the agent in that particular range and randomly select one. As conditions change for how far behind or ahead you would like the agent to get, simply slide your range appropriately. If you are looking for something with some kind of built in and researched psychological effects for the human, I cant help you with that. You will need to define more rules for us if you want something more specific to your situation than this.
