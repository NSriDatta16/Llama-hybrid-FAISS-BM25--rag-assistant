Here is a Bayesian approach that uses a posterior-predictive simulation: Estimate a binomial parameter for all 14 brands, i.e. for each brand, 410 is the number of trials and column "Freq" is the number of successes. Using the conventional Bayesian conjugate-prior approach, binomial parameters will be Beta distributed. In cases where credible intervals do not overlap, you are done: The results are statistically significant. For each pair of brands where the credible intervals do overlap, run the following posterior-predictive simulation, i.e... Combine the observations for the two brands into a single aggregate category, and calculate its binomial parameter. Use the results to specify a posterior-predictive distribution of beta-binomial form (note this is one of the few cases where the posterior predictive distribution can be calculated in closed form). Now, generate random pairs of simulated observations from your beta-binomial posterior-predictive distribution. Compare the difference (or ratio) of the simulated results to the difference (or ratio) of the observed result, and determine in what percentage of cases the simulated result is larger. That is your measure of statistical significance.
