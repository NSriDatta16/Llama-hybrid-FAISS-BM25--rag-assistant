Keyboard friendly light weight UML modeling tool?

I'm looking for a free UML tool that runs on Windows and lets me create simple diagrams very fast, with as little mouse fiddling as possible. I have no need for code generation or fancy stuff, just UML style boxes with arrows. What I would like is something that for example lets me add a new class with a keyboard shortcut and lets me enter the name without having to double click the added class or something like that. Just a simple app that let you model efficiently without getting the urge to eat your desk... What I don't want is to have to drag an item from a toolbox to the surface, double click the item, enter the name, grab the mouse again, click the ok button, rince and repeat. For Eclipse there is TextUML that lets you create diagrams using a textual notation, but I want it for .Net development and I don't want to run Eclipse just for a tiny diagramming plugin. I have tried quite a few of the open source tools out there, but most of them have quite an awful user experience. So, is there a tool that fits the above description?
