TFS 2008: How do I sync build names with version numbers?

Currently my TFS build agent using the current date as the build name. For example, "Intranet_20100707.1" would be today's first build. Currently I use "1.2.*" as my assembly version number where 1 and 2 are manually incremented. How can I sync the build names with my application's version number?
