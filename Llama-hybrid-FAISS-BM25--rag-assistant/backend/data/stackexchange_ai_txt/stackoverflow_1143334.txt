Porting from WAMP to LAMP

Completely developed in WAMP and I need to deploy it on a LAMP setup in the organisation. I want to make sure the deployment goes of smoothly and takes as little time as possible. What are the thing I would need to change before deploying it in LAMP? Also is there any way I can test it in some simulated LAMP environment? Edit: I use perl for server side scripting and very little PHP. Thanks...
