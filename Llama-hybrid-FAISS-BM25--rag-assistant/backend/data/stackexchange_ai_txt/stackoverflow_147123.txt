We have played with Xinc, but we stuck with phpUnderControl for now. It seemed a bit more mature, when we evaluated the different solutions. phpug came with the obvious support for phpUnit, also generates docs (phpDocumentor) uses xdebug code coverage and project mess detection and even checks on CS (through phpcs). As for phpUnit, you can now even run phpt -style tests with it which makes it for some people easier to write tests. And even though phpug adds CruiseControl and Java to the game it hasn't been much of a hassle for us. Not as much as I assumed anyway. :) I mean, that's the advantage with a Java-based service. (Assuming you have the JDK) You just download and run it. That easy. I am not familiar with Java on Debian, but last time I checked it wasn't an issue. As for commercial solutions I know a bunch of PHP shops that use Bamboo (along with the complete Atlassian suite).
