If you are using eclipse, just unjar the source files into the source folder of a temporary project. Then, create a new project (the real project you will be working on), and under the java/src directory, create the package structure you want. Then it's just a simple matter of drag-n-dropping the source files from the temporary project into the correct packages in the real project. Eclipse will take care of changing the package declaration of each class for you.
