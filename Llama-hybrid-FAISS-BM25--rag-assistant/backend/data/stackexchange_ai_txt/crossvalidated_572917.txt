How to calculate the within-pen standard deviation?

For my research, I am investigating the occurrence of tail biting in pigs. I would like to calculate both the overall standard deviation of all pigs, and the within-pen standard deviation. I am not sure how the latter should be calculated. Should I first determine the SD of each pen, and then take the average of those, or is this a wrong approach? Thank you in advance.
