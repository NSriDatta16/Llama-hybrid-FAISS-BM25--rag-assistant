Wikipedia rainbow tables entry

Wikipedia page for rainbow tables says: "this use of multiple reduction functions approximately doubles the speed of lookups." Assuming the "Average" position in the chain, we take a hash and run it through a 9 iteration chain... The original table runs it through 4 reductions and 4 hashes and finds the end of the chain, then looks it up for another 5 hashes 5 reductions... total 9 hashes 9 reductions The rainbow table runs it through Rk-1, Rk-2, Rk-3, and Rk-4 calculations to find the end of the chain, then another 5 hashes 5 reductions to get the plaintext: total 15 hashes 15 reductions... What am I missing here? By my math the only time a rainbow lookup is even the same speed as a normal table is when the hash just happens to be at the very end of the chain... In fact the RT should be incrementally slower the further towards the beginning the hash lies... A 5k chain with the hash at the beginning should be approx 2500 times slower with rainbow tables than with normal hash tables... Am I missing something or did Wikipedia make a mistake? (The paper referenced on that page (Page 13) would also be wrong, so I'm leaning towards the former)
