How do you implement 'EXIT_CODES' in python?

Initially i thought to do something like: #EXIT CODES class ExitCode(object): (USERHOME_INVALID, \ USERHOME_CANNOT_WRITE, \ USERHOME_CANNOT_READ, \ BASHRC_INVALID) = range(-1, -5, -1) But than I've realized that I'll have to know exactly the total number of EXIT_CODES, so that I can pass it to the range() function. Let's suppose I'll have 87 (arbitrary) EXIT_CODES... I don't want to count to 87 (not that it's hard) but I am looking for a more elegant solution. Any suggestions ? EDIT: EXIT_CODE is a negative int that will be passed to sys.exit . Instead of writing the number I prefer to use some sort of constants (something like #defines or enums in C, or enums in Java).
