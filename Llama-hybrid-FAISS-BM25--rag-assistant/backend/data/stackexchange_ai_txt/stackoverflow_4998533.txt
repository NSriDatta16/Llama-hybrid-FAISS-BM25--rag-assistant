Android Live Wallpapers with OpenGL ES 2.0?

Has anyone managed to get OpenGL ES 2.0 working in a live wallpaper? I have a class that uses OpenGL ES 2.0 and runs fine as a Renderer for a GLSurfaceView. However, I want it to function as a live wallpaper. I found Robert Green's GLWallpaperService, but that is based on an older version of GLSurfaceView and does not support setEGLContextClientVersion, which is needed to run OpenGL ES 2.0.
