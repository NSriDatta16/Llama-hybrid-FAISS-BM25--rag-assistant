You can use only two splits, use train data for building your model with cross validation. For instance in the case of KNN with 10-fold crossV you evaluate your solutions 10 times, one for each fold, and finally you might consider the average error. This is really more time consuming though. As such, you may benefit from proportionate data sampling from each class of data for evaluation set. So you are to take benefit of both better time complexity and take advantages of contributing all classes for building your model.
