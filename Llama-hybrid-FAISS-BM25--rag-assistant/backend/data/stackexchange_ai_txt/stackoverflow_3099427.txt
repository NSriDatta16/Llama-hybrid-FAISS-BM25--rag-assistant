If this is regarding the dynamic "unloading" of a js file, you could apply Jonathan Sampson's approach. Basically "script.js" could be encapsulated in an object and upon "click", dynamically loaded. On the next click event, different button click or event of your choice, you can set that object to null, removing that script's capabilities. Edit: Rebecca Murphy's slides on code organization.
