Spatial Transformer Networks and Data Augmentation

We are all familiar with the famous Deep Mind paper STN . Upon implementation, such as here , did anyone still use input data augementation such as affine transformations ? There are used to make CNN robust to rotation, transformation etc. I wonder how these/lack of these affect the output of STNs.
