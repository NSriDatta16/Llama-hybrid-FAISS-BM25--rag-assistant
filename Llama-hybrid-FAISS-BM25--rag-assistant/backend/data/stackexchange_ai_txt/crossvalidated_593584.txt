If logistic regression is not linear why/how is the ordered logit regression family with GLM?

I'm very confused right now. I'm studing the ordered logit and ordered probit regression and I just read that logit is not a linear model but it is logistic model but I also read that both ordered logit and ordered probit are family with Generalized Linear Models. But if logit or ordered logit is not a linear model how can it be categorized into Generalized Linear Model? Can any one explain this in an easy way to me how it makes sense? I would really appreciate if you also could give any source/reference.
