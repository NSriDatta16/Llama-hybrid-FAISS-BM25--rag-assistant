So here's the deal: Apparently, there's an issue with the "cy-GB" culture comparer, which in turn caused the odd fif/gif issue. More info here: http://forums.iis.net/p/1175210/1979005.aspx and https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/661862/system-web-mimemapping-static-constructor-crash-due-to-incorrect-string-comparer-use What caught my attention was that that culture was being picked from the application, and the reason is because of a FirstOrDefault() where two letter ISO code == "GB". Now that's been resolved, and the issue no longer happens, but the "cy-GB" culture bug is still to be fixed (MS Connect link provided above). Hope this helps anyone else with a similar issue.
