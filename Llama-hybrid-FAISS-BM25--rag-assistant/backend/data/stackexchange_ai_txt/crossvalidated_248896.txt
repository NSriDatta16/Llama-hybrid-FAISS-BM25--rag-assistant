Does adding START/END tokens improve classification performances when doing sentiment analysis with neural networks?

I wonder whether adding START/END tokens improves classification performances when doing sentiment analysis of the text (i.e., classifying the text into some sentiment classes, e.g. negative/neutral/positive) with neural networks. For example, the input sentence I like this movie would be replaced by I like this movie .
