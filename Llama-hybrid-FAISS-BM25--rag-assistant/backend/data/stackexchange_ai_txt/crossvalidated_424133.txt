Bayesian update for Beta distribution

I'm wondering how to find a posterior of a beta distribution when the "new information" is not an outcome of a binomial trial. Let $p$ be the probability of Head of a (biased) coin toss. As usual in Bayesian inference, let $$p\sim Beta(a,b).$$ When the "new information" is Head or Tail, we can simply update $p$ by adding number of heads or tails to the shape parameters. However, suppose that the new information I have is $$p\geq \frac{1}{2}.$$ If this is the case, how should I update the posterior in a Bayesian way? In relation to the above question, and possibly more interestingly, for a Dirichlet distribution, if $$(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\sim Dir(a,b,c,d)$$ , what kind of Bayesian inference can be made out of the new information?: $$p_1+p_2\geq p_3+p_3$$
