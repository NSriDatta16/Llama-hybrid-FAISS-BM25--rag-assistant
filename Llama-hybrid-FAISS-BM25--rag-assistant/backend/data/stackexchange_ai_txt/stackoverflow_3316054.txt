I don't think that this will work using the standard MVC Ajax scripts. I believe that the MVC javascript is created to use an element by default. On a different note, embedding a div tag within an is not valid XHTML. What are you trying to achieve? Using Jquery is probably the easiet way you want to go. As an example: some div content function SomeAjaxFunction() { $.get(' ', function(data) { $('.result').html(data); // assuming a partial view alert('Load was performed.'); }); } However, if you are dead set on using MS Ajax, to work with divs, you need to possibly look at the Sys.Mvc.MvcHelpers._asyncRequest function and do some of your own re-wrapping to make it usable. I have not tried or tested this, so use at your own risk. (Stick with the Jquery, there is far better help and support available.)
