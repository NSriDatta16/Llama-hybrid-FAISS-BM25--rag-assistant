No, the likelihood ratio is not the only way to construct hypothesis tests, but it often is optimal. In one flavour of the frequentist paradigm you can construct a hypothesis test from any arbitrary test statistic that can generate a p value ie a probability of observing the data, given the null hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis does not need to be formally stated (other than "not null") and hence a likelihood ratio cannot be constructed. Even when we do have a formal alternative hypothesis there are multiple ways of constructing tests, but the Neyman-Pearson lemma shows that in many situations the likelihood ratio will be the most powerful. We are often seeking the most powerful test; or the "uniformly most powerful test" if the alternative hypothesis is composite (eg takes in multiple possible parameter values); or uniformly most powerful unbiased test if there is no clear uniformly most powerful. So we often end up with a likelihood ratio test. There are situations where likelihoods simply don't work - no density exists in the model for example. The Bayesian paradigm gives an entirely different approach again, usually involving the calculation of a "Bayes factor" rather than a likelihood ratio.
