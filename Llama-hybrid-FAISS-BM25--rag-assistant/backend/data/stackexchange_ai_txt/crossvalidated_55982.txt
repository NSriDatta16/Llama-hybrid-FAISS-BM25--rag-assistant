The way you define New , which in the standard PCA terminology is the direction of the largest variation in your dataset, is just a linear combination of your existing data. Your question (1) is answered by your question (2) practically. Yes, you can use the projections generated by PCA. Yes you can use the equivalent linear combination of your original values but make sure you are using zero-centred data to begin with. (Usually PCA acts a bit like "eigendecomposion(covariance(data))" to get the eigenvectors that represent the principal modes of variation in your dataset and then it projects your original (zero-centred) dataset on the space defined by the eigenvectors.)
