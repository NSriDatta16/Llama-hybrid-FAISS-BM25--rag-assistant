Visual C++ can be many things, including: Microsoft's C++ compiler (cl.exe, link.exe etc) The IDE (Visual Studio in C++ mode) The C runtime (MSVCRT) Other libraries (less so): MFC, ATL As for compiling old C++ code: Visual Studio is now a fairly compliant C++ compiler. This was not always the case, such as with Visual C++ 6 or earlier. It is likely your code is not standards compliant or uses deprecated behavior, which simply doesn't work on newer compilers. Note: this paragraph is outdated: Visual C++ is unfortunately a poor C compiler, as it does not support C99 (and never will), unless features overlap between C++ and C99. The most notable issue for many people is the lack of stdint.h. Visual C++ supports C11 and C17 starting with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 Preview 3 For many years Visual Studio has only supported C to the extent of it being required for C++. Things are about to change now that a conformant token-based preprocessor has been added to the compiler. With the advent of two new compiler switches, /std:c11 and /std:c17, we are officially supporting the latest ISO C language standards.
