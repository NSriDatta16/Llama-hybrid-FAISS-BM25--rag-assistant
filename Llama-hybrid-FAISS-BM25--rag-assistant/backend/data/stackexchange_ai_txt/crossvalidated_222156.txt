Short time series forecast

We have a series of monthly data for 20 months (it is not possible to obtain more data). These are the number of medical consultations encoded in a public hospital and we only have monthly data for two years. We would like to predict some future values for this series since our goal is to see if doctors are adopting the coding system. Which method do you suggest to use to forecast this kind of series?
