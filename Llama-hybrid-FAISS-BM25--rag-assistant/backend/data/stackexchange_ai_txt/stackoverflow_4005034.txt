Yes UITextView has a delegate protocol you should implement. The delegate protocol is naturally named UITextViewDelegate . You should notice by browsing the documentation that there is a pattern; For any class Foo that has a delegate protocol the protocol is always named FooDelegate , there are no exception. Now you can as James pointed out intercept text changes using the UITextView s delegate and dismiss the keyboard. I would however discourage you from doing so, because it violates the Human Interface Guidelines. A UITextView is intended for editing text with multiple lines of text, intercepting the enter key to mean something elsa than line breaks is not advised. If you want a text field with only a single line of text, or being dismissed by enter key, then you should instead use a UITextField , which also have a delegate protocol UITextFieldDelegate . This protocol has a method intended for what you want: -(BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField*)textField { [textField resignFirstResponder]; return NO; }
