Validate cyclic organization unit

I have a object Organization Unit and I have a self reference to it in the same object public class OrganizationUnit: IOrganizationUnit { private string fName; public string Name { get { return fName; } set { SetPropertyValue("Name", ref fName, (string) value); } } private OrganizationUnit fManagedBy; public IOrganizationUnit ManagedBy { get { return fManagedBy; } set { SetPropertyValue("ManagedBy", ref fManagedBy, (OrganizationUnit)value); } } } I need a method that will throw an exception if it finds a child organization unit in the third level is referencing a parent Organization unit, or to say cyclic parent organization. A is main B managed by A C cannot be managed by A
