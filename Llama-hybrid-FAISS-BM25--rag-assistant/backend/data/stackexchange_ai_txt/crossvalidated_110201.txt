ARIMA, adjustments and intervention analysis

I have very little knowledge of time-series analysis (despite my stat master - didn't do anything else than an introductory course) but now I'm facing a statistical problem whose answer is this very kind of analysis - so would really need a helpful hand. In a nutshell, I have account monthly sales. In only some of them (1 to 10 or so), a marketing project has been conducted (I call them the Affected accounts); the other accounts remain unaffected (called the Control accounts). The question that I have to answer is basically "did the project have an impact in the Affected sales (but here's the part that annoys me) compared to the Control sales?" So, as I have a time-series analysis (and a seasonality) I guessed that I had to perform a proc ARIMA (I'm using SAS - and its fantastic feature that I discover and displays an automatically fitted model, Time Series Forecasting System). Here are my questioning: How is an adjustment variable accounted for, in an ARIMA model ? If I make an educated guess from the linear regression model, I assume I just have to enter the variable in the INPUT, as independent / explanatory variables ? Also, if I am to enter my variable "Control_Sales" like that, is my adjustment correct ? Shouldn't I do a preliminary transformation of my dependent variable, for example redefining it as (Affected_Sales/Control_Sales) or (Affected_Sales - Control_Sales) ? Besides, I have another series of questions around the Intervention analysis - because the conduct of the projects is never a straightforward, pulse intervention and I cannot really pin them down to a precise type. Here's the best explanation I can provide: The projects, as I already said, are not carried out in all accounts, but only in a very small portion of them. Moreover, the projects can be regarded as marketing campaigns that last several months. They have a start date and an implementation(=end) date. But even from my supervisors, there is disagreement on when we should be starting to assess an effect on the sales - sometimes, the sales start to increase during the campaign, most of the time, the effect is seen after the end of the project, but not straight after, perhaps from 2 to 9 months after... So I'm getting very confused when it comes to modelling the type of intervention (a ramp ? several pulses ?) and I am wondering if it wouldn't be better if I performed an Intervention Detection, to see where the impact actually took place, and in the discussion part of my analysis compare it to the reported, "theoretical" implementation date. I deeply believe this idea would be the most appealing, due to the fact that nobody is able to be clear about the Intervention start point (statistically speaking). What do you think ? How would you do ? But there comes the most challenging part: I have no clues whatsoever how to perform an Intervention Detection... I could really do with some piece of advice ! PS. I also meant to say that I am happy to provide the data if it can help with the discussion. Update Here is my data, if that can help. Ideally I would stick to the ARIMA (or other, best-fitting time-series model) because I not comfortable at all with this field and this is something I am currently capable of doing (don't know anything about VAR or Granger causality). Moreover, I have only collected the sales from Jun-13 onwards, as I had fixed myself a 6-month limit for the "sale sbefore", but I can have figures back to 2011... I don't know however how relevant it is to include them in the analysis - and if that couldn't "dilute" the impact of the intervention ?
