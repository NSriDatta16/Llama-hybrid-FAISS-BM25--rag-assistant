You can include a main effect of GED and an interaction between GED and parental income without including parental income. This is equivalent to encoding the restriction that for those without a GED, there is no relationship between parental income (PI) and income, which is a strong assumption to make. Here's the model you would fit: $$ E[income|GED, PI] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 GED + \beta_2 GED \times PI $$ You would use the mean-centered version of PI. The interpretation of the coefficients would be the following: $\beta_0$ - the expected income for those without a GED $\beta_1$ - the difference between the expected income for those with a GED and those without a GED for those with an average level of PI $\beta_2$ - the slope of PI on income for those with a GED Typically, a model would also have a main effect term for $PI$ , which represents the effect of $PI$ on income for those without a GED, and which changes the interpretation of $\beta_2$ to be the difference between the effect of $PI$ on income for those with a GED and the effect of $PI$ on income for those without a GED. In R, you would fit this model using the following syntax: fit You must use a robust standard error for the tests to be valid because you are by definition explaining more variance in income for those with a GED than for those without, so the residual variance differs between groups. To estimate the robust standard errors, you could use the following syntax: lmtest::coeftest(fit, vcov. = sandwich::vcovHC) I don't recommend you fit a model like this unless you were unable to measure PI for those without a GED. The assumption you make is a strong one and almost certainly false, so the rest of the model may not be valid.
