One option for finding the prediction interval or the posterior predictive distribution is to use one of the *bugs software packages (winbugs, openbugs, jags, etc.) or something similar, then include an additional datapoint with the value missing. You will probably need to include a diffuse prior for the missing value. Then each iteration of the McMC algorithm will estimate the missing value from the likelihood using the current estimates of the parameters. This takes into account the uncertainty in the parameters and the variability within the distribution of the individual points. The realizations for the missing value can be used to estimate the posterior predictive distribution for a new observation and an interval (HPD or other) from that distribution will give the prediction interval.
