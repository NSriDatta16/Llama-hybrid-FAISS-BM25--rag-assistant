Why does the density function has product of variance and covariance for higher model order time series

In my previous question Density function for AR model , the density function of AR model has the covariance-variance matrix given as $\sigma^2 *V_p$. In multivariate Gaussian distribution , the pdf contains no $\sigma^2$ term. I have conceptual questions based on this. (1) Does AR or ARMA or MA model of order greater than 1 when excited by white Gaussian noise, qualify as multivariate Gaussian distributution? (2) Why the scalar variance is multiplied with the covariance and why do we need the covariance matrix? Why are these 2 expressions (in the links) of pdf different? In Tutorial1 Sec 3, the joint pdf for AR(p) model contains the variance of white noise multiplied with the Covariance Matrix. But, In Tutorial 2 Page#9 THE ARMA model is presented, there is only the covariance matrix in the expression !! This is confusing. For AR(1) we only consider the scalar $\sigma^2$ but for AR(p) why do we need covariance matrix as there is only 1 random variable and the correlation or covariance for 1 random variable does not make sense. Please correct me if wrong. Will appreciate intuitive and detailed answer. Thank you
