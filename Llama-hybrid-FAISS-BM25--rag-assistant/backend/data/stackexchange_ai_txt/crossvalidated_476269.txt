You've asked whether you can do this -- sure, nobody can stop you. Your real question is probably: is this a good idea? I don't think so. I'd feel comfortable using an approach like this to break a few ties, but you don't have a few ties, you have a data set built almost entirely out of ties. If there are (for instance) 20 instances of the number 2, then you have 20!, or about 2 quintillion, ways to break those ties, and you're choosing one at random. This choice could be hugely consequential, though, depending on the way that the data are linked to the other variables in the same observations. Since you've only provided this column, it's impossible to know whether this is an actual problem or a theoretical problem, but given the tremendous number of ties in what you've got, I'd be rather suspicious of breaking ties in this way. Of course, the fact that you're interested in ties at all suggests you're doing something that's suitable for ordinal-level data -- that is, you want to know which numbers are bigger than others. You've said you want to assume that these data are continuous, so you might shop around for an alternate way to solve whatever your problem is that really uses continuous data; OLS (ordinary least-squares) regression or logistic regression are two very common examples that would be safer to use on these data without resorting to any strategy correcting ties. Short answer: I'd suggest not to break ties in this way and instead to shop for a method that avoids tiebreaking altogether.
