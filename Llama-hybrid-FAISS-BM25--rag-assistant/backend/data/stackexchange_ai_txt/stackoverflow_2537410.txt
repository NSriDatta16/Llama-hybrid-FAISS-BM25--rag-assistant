I was dealing with a similar problem earlier this year. One important input parameter for a decision however is the expected number of nodes. I decided to use the Browser as the GUI and therefore looked for nice Javascript libraries, one i came across was wireit , it is very well suited for technical layouts (and also editing with drag and drop and "on the fly" layouting). You could easily connect that to your c++ by running a small webserver in a thread (You will need some kind of eventloop/thread thingie for GUI anyways). Well just my 2 cents.
