There are a number of different things you can do to aid in the organisation of your CSS. For example: Split your CSS up into multiple files. For example: have one file for layout, one for text, one for reset styles etc. Comment your CSS code. Why not add a table of contents? Try using a CSS framework like 960.gs to get your started. It's all down to personal taste really.
