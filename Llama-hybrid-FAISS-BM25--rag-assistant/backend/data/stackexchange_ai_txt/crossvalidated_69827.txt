Rather than using PCA, you might want to look into using an autoencoder if reconstructing the data is necessary. Autoencoders are basically neural networks that can do dimensionality reduction, and if necessary, "decode" the original encoding. The decoded data will still be corrupted, but in all likelihood it will be better than trying to reconstruct data from PCA. http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/dA.html
