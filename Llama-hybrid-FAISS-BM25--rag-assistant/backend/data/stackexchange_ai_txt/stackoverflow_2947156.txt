MDI model or Dock Windows?

In the QT application we develop we need to display several 'Viewer windows' (to display data in XY plane, YX plane, XZ plane and in 3D). We were hoping to use MDI application model, but later the client asked for a requirement to drag and view 'Viewer windows' in multiple desktops (using multiple monitors). This can not be done using MDI window model, because we cannot move MDI window outside the Main Application Window. Only possible way is to use Dock windows because they can be undocked from Main Application Window and move into other desktops, but Dock windows primary used for tool-palettes or utility windows. ( http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qdockwidget.html#details ) Is it a good practice to use Dock window for our requirement?
