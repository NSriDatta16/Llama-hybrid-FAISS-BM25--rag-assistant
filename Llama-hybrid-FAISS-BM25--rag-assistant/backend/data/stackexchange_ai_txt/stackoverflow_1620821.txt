When using JNDI, you're using an API that requires a specific configuration underlying it in order to connect to the server (see the Javadoc for details on what that configuration is). For example, java.naming.factory.initial is the property which indicates which implementation of JNDI you want to use. Now, when running code inside a JavaEE server, this configuration is available implicitly, and all you need to do is what you have done in your code - instantiate InitialContext , and perform a lookup. However, when running outside the server, this implicit configuration is not present, and so you need to configure your InitialContext explicitly. Your sample code uses a main() method, which suggests that you're running outside the container. The config you need will depend on your specific application server, you'll need to look up that documentation to see what config to supply.
