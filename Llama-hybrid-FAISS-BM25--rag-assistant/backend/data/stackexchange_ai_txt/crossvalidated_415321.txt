The Markov blanket of a node in a Bayesian network consists of the set of parents, children and spouses (parents of children), under certain assumptions . One of them is the faithfulness assumption , which, together with the Markov condition, implies that two variables $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given a set of variables $Z$ if and only if they are d-separated by $Z$ in the graph. Deterministic relationships violate the faithfulness assumption. For example, in your case $either$ is conditionally independent of all variables conditional on $\{tub, lung\}$ , although they are not d-separated.
