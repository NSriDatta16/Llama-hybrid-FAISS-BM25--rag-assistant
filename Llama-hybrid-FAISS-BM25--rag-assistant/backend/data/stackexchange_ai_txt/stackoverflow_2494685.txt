There -- the answer is in the snippet that you added. The integers listed show that the space after the word STRING is ASCII character 160, which is &nbsp; , instead of character 32, which is the ordinary space. Edit your original string, replacing the spaces within STRING TOKENIZER CLASS with actual spaces instead of shift-spaces. Just a side comment, from the 1.4.2 Javadoc: StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.
