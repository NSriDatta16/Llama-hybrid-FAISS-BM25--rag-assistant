The concept of nearest neighbour classification does not require a reference time series. For each incoming, new object (here time series) you will compute the distance (here DTW) to all known and labelled time series. Then you assign the majority label of the k closest labelled time series. Using a reference time series would lead to a big loss of information that will negatively affect the accuracy in most cases. If you yet think that you need a reference time series, please expand your question with further information. Update 1: For efficient and fast computation of DTW Distance between two time series, I recommend this paper Stream Monitoring under the Time Warping Distance Update 2: As reference time series, you could either create a mean time series for each class (they would have to be of equal size) or you identify the prototype time series for each class as the one which has the least distance to all other time series in its class. Yet using reference time series for each class neglects the fact of class imbalance . Further you disregard intra-class variance which I assume is not equal among all classes.
