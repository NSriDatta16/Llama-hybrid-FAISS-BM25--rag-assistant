Recover the Top Dimensions in PCA and Their Weights

I have a matrix of users each with his/her page view counts over 50 pages. So, I have data points with 50 dimensions each. What I wanted to find was --> what combination of pages explains the user data the most? I did PCA and got that the first component explains 80% of the data's variance. But I can not figure out how do I get which dimensions contribute the most to that component? i.e. their weights in the linear combination. Since, PCA component is just the linear combination of individual dimensions, I should be able to do that somehow. Is my approach wrong or is any method better suited to extract the particular information? Thanks for your help.
