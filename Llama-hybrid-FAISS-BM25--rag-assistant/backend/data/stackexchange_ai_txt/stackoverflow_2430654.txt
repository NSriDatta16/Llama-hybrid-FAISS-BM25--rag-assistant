XML to WordML basics

I'm new to the world of XML. I'm not sure which way to build the XML so I provided 2 examples below. My question is: Given the XML, how do I transform either Example#1 / #2 to the WordML Result ? What technologies do I need to accomplish this? Example#1: Paragraph one. Example#2: 1 Paragraph one. After transformation... WordML Result: Paragraph one. If there is a way to transform the XML to WordML, maybe I can opt to save the data in XML format in the db instead of building both XML and WordML on the fly for 2 different formats.
