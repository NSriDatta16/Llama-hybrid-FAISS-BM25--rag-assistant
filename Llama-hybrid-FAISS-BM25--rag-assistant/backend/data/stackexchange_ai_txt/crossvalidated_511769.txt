I am measuring airborne bacteria in a new high-risk room; how do I determine sample size?

I am measuring airborne bacteria in a new high-risk room. The bacteria are measured with Petri plates that have area 19,5 cm $^2$ . I have 30 old measurements results, that give average bacteria counts 2,8 CFU/plate from other High-Risk rooms. The probability of the bacteria count is somewhat Poisson distributed. I want to use the old measurements to determine how many samples(plates) I need to use to show with 95 – 97% confidence that the new room conforms to the old ones. Max bacteria allowed is 50 CFU/plate for a High-Risk room. When I started looking into your answer I noticed that you used 3.8 instead of 2.8 from the original question. So, I recalculated your answer with 2.8 instead and tried to figure the whole thing out. I wanted to ask you if my recalculations are in the vicinity of correct and if not, where I might have faltered? Test. Suppose you decide to use n=8 plates. Assuming a Poisson distribution, you currently have λ=2.8 CFU per plate, which would be λT=8(2.8)=22.4 CFU per 8 plates. You could test H0: λT=22.4 against Ha: λT>22.4 at the 5% level of significance. To do so, you would reject H0 in favor of Ha, if the number T of CFU per dozen plates has T≥30. That is, P(T≥30|H0)=1−P(T≤30|H0)=0.043 ppois(30, 2.8*8) [1] 0.951017 1 - ppois(30, 2.8*8) [1] 0.04898297 Then the power against the particular alternative λa=8(3.75)=30 is P(X≥31|λa=)=0.99. So, if the true rate per plate is λ=6 CFU, our test has a 99% chance of detecting that much increase. 1 - ppois(30, 6*8) [1] 0.9963514 In the plot below, the null Poisson distribution (blue bars) is sufficiently different from the alternative distribution, for a satisfactory test using critical value 34 (dotted vertical line). R code for plot: t = 20:100; PDF = dpois(t, 22.4); PDF.a = dpois(t, 48) plot(t-.1, PDF, type="h", lwd=2,col="blue", main="Null and Alternative Distn's") lines(t+.1, PDF.a, type="h", lwd=2, col="brown") abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v = 34, lwd=2, lty="dotted") Confidence interval. A reasonably accurate 95% confidence interval for a Poisson rate based on T observed counts is of the form T+2 ±1.96T+1−−−−−√. If you observe T=48, then a 95% CI for λT is (22.4, 48) and a 95% CI for the rate λ per plate is (2.8, 6). 38 + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(37) [1] 26.0 - 49.9 (38 + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(37))/12 [1] 2.17 - 4.16
