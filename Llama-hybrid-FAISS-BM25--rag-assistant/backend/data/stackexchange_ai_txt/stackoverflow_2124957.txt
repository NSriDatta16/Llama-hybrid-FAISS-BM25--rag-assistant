Using structs or multidimensional arrays in C

I want to create a fault log. The fault log should be able to store the last 10 faults. A fault has 3 piece of information: 1. Number of fault. 2. Fault name. 3. Date time of fault. How can i do this using structs? Or should i do it using arrays and if so how? The fault log is for storage in memory only.
