Another possibility is to include all variables in the logistic regression model, and account for the multi-collinearity issues using ridge regression. This will appropriately penalize the coefficients of the correlates predictors and give you more stable results. I don't know which software you're using, but in R this is, for instance, available in the glmnet and arm packages.
