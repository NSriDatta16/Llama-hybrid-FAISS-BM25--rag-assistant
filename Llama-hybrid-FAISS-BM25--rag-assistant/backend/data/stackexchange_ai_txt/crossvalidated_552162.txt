Indicator function with equal sign for probability integral

In the beginning of the book Train ( 2009 , p.4) on "Discrete choice methods with simulation" we read: Deﬁne an indicator function $I[h(x,ε) = y]$ that takes the value of $1$ when the statement in brackets is true and $0$ when the statement is false. That is, $I[·] = 1$ if the value of $ε$ , combined with $x$ , induces the agent to choose outcome $y$ , and $I[·] = 0$ if the value of $ε$ , combined with $x$ , induces the agent to choose some other outcome. Then the following statement is presented. $$ P(y | x) = Prob(I[h(x,ε) = y] = 1)\\ = \int I[h(x,ε) = y] f (ε) dε $$ My question is about ( $=$ ) inside the indicator function under integration. (In the rest of the book all examples are with inequality , because disctrete choice models are built on comparisions of utilitites of different alternatives, like $u_j>u_k$ , for all $k\neq j$ ). Perhaps, I'm missing something, but I thought that indicator function just trancated the intergral function (change its bounds), so equal sign in expression must lead such integral to $0$ value. What am I missing? A counterexample is welcome.
