static int crit = 0; public bool isCritical() { crit = crit++ % 5; return (crit==0); } if you still want some randomness, alter the modulus using another static variable each time a crit is performed. varying it will equal probability from 3 to 7 should keep the average time between crits at 1 in 5, but never less than 3 or more than 7 hits between them.
