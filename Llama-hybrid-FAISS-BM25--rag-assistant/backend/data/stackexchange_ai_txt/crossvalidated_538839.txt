First, consider that we don't know what is the true distribution of resistance (you might want to look here ). But, for simplicity (and to go well with the $3\sigma$ assumption), let's say it has a normal distribution. That is, if we have a $100\Omega$ resistor with a silver tolerance band (10%), then $P(R\in[90\Omega,110\Omega])=0.997$ . That is the meaning of confidence intervals and the $3\sigma$ notation: It means that no more than 3 out of 1000 resistors produced in this manufacturing line had resistance of more than $110\Omega$ or less than $90\Omega$ . Now, we can decompose this CI in order to get an estimate of the average resistance, but spoiler alert: we'll get that the average is exactly $100\Omega$ . The middle value of the CI is obviously $100\Omega$ . We assume $3\sigma=10\Omega$ so the SD for a resistor from this production line is $3.33\Omega$ . You can try finding which value of $\mu$ would minimize the equation $ \sqrt{ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (x-\mu)^2 f(x)dx } - \sigma$ (where $f(x)$ is the normal PDF with parameters $\mu,\sigma$ ) but then again you'll get that the minimizer is $\mu=100\Omega$ . Should you find any alternative distribution for the resistance of a resistor (I mean, other than the normal), we can try constructing a CI fitting it using the delta method . Regarding the RMS approach - As far as my knowledge goes (in both electronics and stats), we use RMS to get an approximation for a bunch of measurements, whether it's a dataset or the response to a wave input. I don't think it belongs here, and if you insist on using it then keep in mind that taking $(x-\delta)$ alone is not enough, you should also take $(x+\delta)$ into calculation.
