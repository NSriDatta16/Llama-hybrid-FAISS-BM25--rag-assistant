How to automatically determine text quality?

A lot of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and libraries have a hard time working with random texts from the web, usually because they are presupposing clean, articulate writing. I can understand why that would be easier than parsing YouTube comments. My question is: given a random piece of text, is there a process to determine whether that text is well written, and is a good candidate for use in NLP? What is the general name for these algorithm? I would appreciate links to articles, algorithms or code libraries, but I would settle for good search terms.
