Private javascript widget

I'm considering embarking on a new project. The premise of the project is generate a widget on my site, then copy a piece of javascript into your site and viola you have your widget. It's a new spin on existing services such as polldady.com, twiig.com and addthis.com. Many of these such services are designed to be publicly accessible. Meaning the widget supplier doesn't care you is posting data back to them. In fact they encourage spreading the widget as far and wide as possible. However my services has a unique twist. In my case, although the widget will be open the general public, I need to be sure that originating post requests are coming from the expected site only. Due to xss issues with these javascript widgets, I need to dynamically create an iframe where my widget will be rendered. Is there an authentication model to handle this type of interaction?
