Most elegant isNumeric() solution for java

I'm porting a small snippet of PHP code to java right now, and I was relying on the function is_numeric($x) to determine if $x is a number or not. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent function in java, and I'm not satisfied with the current solutions I've found so far. I'm leaning toward the regular expression solution found here: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Determine_if_a_string_is_numeric Which method should I use and why?
