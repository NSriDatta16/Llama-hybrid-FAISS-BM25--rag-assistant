Creating "holey" median filter in Matlab

What I need to do is to create a "special" kind of median filter for image processing in Matlab - the "holey" median filter. This is a filter that excludes the element at the center of the area. For standard median filter I use the medfilt2 function, but I can't pass the mask (kernel) for it as a matrix (it's not a linear transform). For example, using standard averaging filter 3x3 I create the mask (kernel) as: h = ones(3,3)/9; And for "holey" averaging filter: h = ones(3,3)/8; h(2,2) = 0; How to do the same thing with median filter? Is there any way to modify the medfilt2 or do I need to implement a running median on my own?
