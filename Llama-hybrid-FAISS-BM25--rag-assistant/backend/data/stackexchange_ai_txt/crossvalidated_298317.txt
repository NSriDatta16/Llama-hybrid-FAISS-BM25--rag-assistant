Using mean values for principal component analysis (morphological data)

I have a potentially dumb question that I've been having a hard time find an answer to. About my data: I am working with a set of morphological data (external cranial measurements of bats), using museum specimens. I am looking to reduce my variables into principal components so I can ask questions about how morphology can predict certain ecological variables (such as diet) across a bunch of different species. For each species, I measured up to 11 individuals. Running my analyses using R. I have run a principal component analysis on the entire dataset (all 295 data points, which means up to 11 rows of data per species). My question is, would it be valid for me to combine my up to 11 observations for each variable into an average (which would mean only one row per species), and use that for the principal component analysis? My thought is it would make it easier to interpret my principal component outputs (such as identifying where each species falls along each PC). Thanks!
