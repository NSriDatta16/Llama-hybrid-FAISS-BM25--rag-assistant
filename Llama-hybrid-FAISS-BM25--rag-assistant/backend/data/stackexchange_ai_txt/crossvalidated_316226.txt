While Matlab certainly remains a primary tool in much of academic science and engineering, I do not see it used extensively in data science . The primary reason, as I see it, is R's (and Python-Pandas) extensive use of data frames and reference-by-name ecosystem. Matlab is designed to work with matrices, and while you can get Matlab to work with tables and group by categorical variables (e.g., varfun), it's often terribly cumbersome and less intuitive. R and Python employ a syntax that is conducive to thinking-and-coding-as-you-go, almost like writing a data story. Matlab becomes quite verbose in this context, and often requires multi-line solutions for problems R/Python can attack with a fraction of text (though perhaps double or triple the time). To Matlab's credit, that isn't its primary use case. If you want to do serious optimization and simulation, you'll age waiting for R to complete, while Matlab barely sweats. But if you want to explore and model your data in a thoughtful, principled way, R and Python are often better suited, in my opinion. To each their own, but Matlab just wasn't designed for the types of tasks data scientists face.
