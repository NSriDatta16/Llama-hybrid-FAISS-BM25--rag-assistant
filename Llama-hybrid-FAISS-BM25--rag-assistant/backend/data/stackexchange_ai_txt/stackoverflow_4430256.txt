I would do it using a compiler. Youtube probably does that too, considering the amount of traffic and the response times. The principle is easy to understand. You log every every view or rating in a page_view table. You define periods at which the compilation occurs (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). Every time you hit the good time (e.g.: end of the day), you execute the compiler, which essentially execute a query Ã -la... SELECT * FROM page_view WHERE date > $from_date AND date ... and store the result. This probably works better in a cron job. The next time you need to display the information, you can just fetch the stored result and display it without re-computation. There are a variety of storage methods you can use: a MySQL table (e.g.: page_view_compiled ), memcached, etc.
