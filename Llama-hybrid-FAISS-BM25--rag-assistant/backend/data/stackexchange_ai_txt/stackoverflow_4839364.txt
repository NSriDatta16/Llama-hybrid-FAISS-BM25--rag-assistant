Exports are for DLLs; it's not likely that your EXE is doing any exporting. TLS, on the other hand, is thread-local storage. If you have any threadvar variabled declared somewhere, that might be causing it. Also, I think TLS is uses in the built-in exception handling, but I'm not clear on all the details. If that's it, then you might not be able to use this packer at all.
