combined mean without population

I have been given data consisting of means and I would like to calculate the combined mean but I don't have population for none of them. For example, the average exam score for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students are 68, 72, 69, and 70, respectively. What is the mean score of all students? But in this case I haven't been given the population for each year. Can I calculate the mean score of all students?
