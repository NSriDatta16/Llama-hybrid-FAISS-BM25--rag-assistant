How to design a VAE for a given image dataset?

I have a dataset with texture images of the size 512x512. I tried to train a VAE with 3 "blocks" (Convolution , Activation and Batchnormalization) in the encoder and in the decoder and a bottleneck layer of the size 512. The reconstructed images seemed really blurry and I was wondering if there is a guide out there which gives advises to designing these Layers for a given dataset. I do not really have a problem with the reconstructed images being blurry, I just do not really know if my designed VAE (and the layers that I used) did a "good enough" job. I would really appreciate if somebody can give me some advise on this!
