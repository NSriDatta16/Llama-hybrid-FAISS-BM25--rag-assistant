Bertrand et al. propose collapsing so that you don't have to cluster your standard errors. Just use a common t -statistic comparing two groups with unequal variances for your test: $$\begin{equation*} \frac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat \sigma^2_0}{N_0} + \frac{\hat \sigma^2_1}{N_1}}} \end{equation*}$$ See that this assumes no correlation between observations within the pre- and post-periods and no correlation between pre- and post-periods. The first is a common cross-section assumption and Bertrand et al. show that the latter is reasonable in the panel context. The above works when you have a balanced panel with all individuals experiencing the intervention at the same time. If this is not the case, perform the following regression. For each individual, get a pre-period average of the outcome $y$, $\bar{y}_{i0}$ and similarly a post-period average $\bar{y}_{i1}$. Now, for each individual, there are two observations: before and after. Turn this into a panel with $2N$ rows, where $N$ is the number of individuals. Run a regression on these data, including individual fixed effects and a treatment indicator.
