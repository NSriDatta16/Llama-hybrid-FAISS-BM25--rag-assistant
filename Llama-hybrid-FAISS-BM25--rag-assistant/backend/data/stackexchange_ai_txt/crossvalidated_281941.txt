Solving ODEs using Neural Network

I am trying to solve some Ordinary Differential Equations using Neural Networks. I have read quite a few papers and even some dissertations on the same. However I am a little unclear on how the neural network itself is trained - what are the inputs, what are the target outputs, do we need to write the backpropogation algorithm or can we use some pre-existing libraries for it. Basically can someone clarify with an example the role of the neural network in solving ordinary differential equations? Thanks in advance!
