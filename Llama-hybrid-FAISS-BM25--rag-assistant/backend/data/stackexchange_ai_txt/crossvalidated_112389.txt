Several ideas and references are discussed in: A simple generalization of the area under the ROC curve to multiple class classification problems . Multi-class ROC (a tutorial) (using "volumes" under ROC) Other approaches include computing macro-average ROC curves (average per class in a 1-vs-all fashion) micro-averaged ROC curves (consider all positives and negatives together as single class) You can see examples in some libraries like scikit-learn. See also this other thread in CrossValidated: How to compute precision/recall for multiclass-multilabel classification?
