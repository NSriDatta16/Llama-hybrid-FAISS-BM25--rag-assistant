How can I protect a key against other applications?

Setup I have a SQLite database which has confidential user information. This database may be replicated on other machines I trust the user, but not other applications The user has occasional access to a global server Security Goals Any program other than the authorized one (mine) cannot access the SQLite database. Breaking the security on one machine will NOT break the security on other machines The system must be updatable (meaning that if some algorithm such as a specific key generation algorithm is shown to be flawed, it can be changed) Proposed Design Use an encrypted SQLite database storing the key within OS secure storage. Problems Any windows hack will allow the person to access the key for all machines which violates goal #2 Notes Similar to this method, if I store the key in the executable, breaking the security will comprimise all systems. Also, I have referenced windows secure storage. While, I will go to an os specific solution if I have to, I would prefer a non-os specific solution Any idea on how to meet the design goals?
