I beleive, the S estimator[1] (and it's algorithm, FastS[2]) is the closest parametric equivalent to the Theil-Sen estimator. This is because the S estimator explicitly adds a parametric assumption on the distribution of the residuals (through the tuning constant $c$) to get better efficiency at uncontaminated samples. The FastS algorithm is implemented in the robustbase R package[3] distributed through CRAN. There are some differences between the two approaches: FastS is more robust to outliers than Theil-Sen (the latter has a breakdown point of 0.29, the former 0.5) FastS can be computed efficiently for moderately sized dataset, including when there are more than one regressor. Theil-Sen is only defined for univariate regression. These two differences explain why the Theil Sen estimator is essentially deprecated. Rousseeuw, P.J. and Yohai, V.J. (1984).
