I'll add the following plot to illustrate visually the difference between PCA-whitening and ZCA-whitening : the only thing you need to understand is what a rotation matrix is (aka orthonormal matrix), and that PCA-whitening and ZCA-whitening are just one rotation appart. First plot is the raw data, along 2 arrows on X and Y axis, and a circle to better understand the transformations. Second plot is PCA-whitened data, and the same transformation is applied to the arrows and circle points Third plot is ZCA-whitened data You can then notice that : Covariance matrix is identity matrix in both PCA and ZCA cases PCA-whitened and ZCA-whitened data are indeed a rotation appart (rotate the second plot about 60Â° countclock-wise and you get the third plot) ZCA-whitened data has an orientation similar to that of the original data (that is red is basicaly on lower left side, and blue on upper right side). We say that ZCA-whitened data "ressembles" the most the original data. On the hand, PCA could have had any orientation. Also, I found Optimal whitening and decorrelation, Agnan Kessy, Alex Lewin, Korbinian Strimmer (arXiv:1512.00809) to be a great ressource on whitening.
