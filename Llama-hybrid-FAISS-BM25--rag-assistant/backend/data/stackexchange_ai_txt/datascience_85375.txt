I guess you have a confusion here. The None part represents the number of samples. For example if you have a neural network with architecture 100-50-10, it means that you have (None,100) : input layer shape (100,50) : shape for weights connecting input to hidden layer (None,50): shape for hidden layer given by (None,100)*(100,50) matrix multiplication (None,50): shape after nonlinearity application. (50,10): shape for the shape matrix between hidden and output layer (None,10) : output layer shape (None,50)*(50,10) matrix multiplication So if youre feeding a single input sample the shapes would be: (1,100)[Input] => (1,100)(100,50) = (1,50)[Hidden Layer] => (1,50)*(50,10)=(1,10)[Output Layer]
