Trying to reformat these panel-type data to fit into the survival package functions in the way you propose isn't the best way to go. The functions in the survival package generally treat time as a continuous variable, with special attention needed when there are ties among event times (of which you have many). Furthermore, some of its more popular functions (e.g., coxph() ) assume that any indicated events occurred at the end of the corresponding time interval. What you have are considered "interval-censored" data: you know that certain deaths occurred within the indicated time periods, but don't know exactly when. If you simply assign all of those deaths either to the start time or the end time of the corresponding interval you will be biasing your results. Although interval-censored data can be complicated in the most general case when each individual might have a different set of time intervals, here you have a relatively small set of intervals shared among all individuals still at risk during each interval. This situation is better handled by what is called "discrete-time" survival analysis, which effectively is a set of binomial (logistic, or complementary log-log) regressions for the time intervals. That can be done pretty easily without reformatting the pooled data into the one-line-per observation format that you are struggling with. This web page has links to several papers on discrete-time analysis. This UCLA web page has links to some lecture notes. There is a textbook on these methods, and an R package providing the needed tools.
