Inline Javascript in rails partials

When writing partials in Rails I sometimes feel the urge to use inline Javascript for basic DOM manipulation functions that will only ever be relevant to the HTML in the partial. Should I feel bad about this? My thoughts are that separating out 20 lines of JS into a separate file won't save more than a few KB of bandwidth (in fact it'll probably cost due to the latency of the extra req) and will be hard to organize since I'll have a JS file full of miscellaneous functions separated from their context. Every one says never use inline JS, but I feel like there's something I'm just not getting here, can someone set me straight?
