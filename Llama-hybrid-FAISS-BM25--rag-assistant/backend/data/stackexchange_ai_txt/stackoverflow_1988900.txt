You can layout a custom UITableViewCell in Interface Builder, where you drag two UILabel views onto the Content View and set their size appropriately (Notice that the letters may vary in width, so even though you know it's 10 chars in length, you don't know the maximum width, please keep that in mind) Then you just fill the open space at the right of a cell with another UILabel , layout it to cover the open space and set it to autoresize it's width and set the right margin to be fixed. There are quite a few tutorials available on how to use the custom cell in your tableView, I can recommend you this screencast . It explains how you can initialize the custom cell and how you can access the custom labels.
