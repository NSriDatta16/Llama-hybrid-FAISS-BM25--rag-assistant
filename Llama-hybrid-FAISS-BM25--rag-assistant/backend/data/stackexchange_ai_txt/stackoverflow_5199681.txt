I'm afraid that embedding a real browser is your only option, if you need JavaScript capabily and AJAX etc. look at JavaXPCOM API in order to see how easily you can embed FireFox. There is also JDIC , that will allow you to embed IE in Windows environments. You will need some DLL files but the procedure is straight forward with both APIs and well documented. Let's admit that JEditorPane is fine, but mainly for HTML you have control over. I use it only to render HTML help files into my application. Once you start visiting sites with it things start getting nasty.
