Flowdocument isnt using the full width/height

I have a FlowDocument which I want to fill the entire width and height of my window. I have tried using the FlowDocumentPageViewer (no luck) and am now using a DocumentPageView . I still can't get it to dock/fill the entire space; it's just sitting in the middle, in the minimum size it can create (does it make sense?) Here is my code: public DocumentPageView GetPage() { FlowDocumentPageViewer viewer = new FlowDocumentPageViewer(); StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(location); string data = reader.ReadToEnd(); reader.Close(); string xamlData = HtmlToXamlConverter.ConvertHtmlToXaml(data, true); FlowDocument result = (FlowDocument)System.Windows.Markup.XamlReader.Load(new MemoryStream(System.Text.UnicodeEncoding.Default.GetBytes(xamlData))); viewer.Document = result; viewer.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center; viewer.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center; DocumentPageView pageView = new DocumentPageView(); pageView.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center; pageView.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center; pageView.Stretch = System.Windows.Media.Stretch.Uniform; pageView.PageNumber = 0; pageView.StretchDirection = StretchDirection.Both; pageView.DocumentPaginator = ((IDocumentPaginatorSource)result).DocumentPaginator; return pageView; } Please note that this code contains the combination of my two methods but only the DocumentPageView is currently used. This is the Xaml that is created from my HTML source: Test Paragraph Test second paragraph If I resize the fonts the content is only resized vertically (please note that the stretch direction is set to both). Any ideas?
