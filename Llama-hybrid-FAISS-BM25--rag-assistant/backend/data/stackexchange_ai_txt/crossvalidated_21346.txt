Reference book for linear algebra applied to statistics?

I have been working in R for a bit and have been faced with things like PCA, SVD, QR decompositions and many such linear algebra results (when inspecting estimating weighted regressions and such) so I wanted to know if anyone has a recommendation on a good comprehensive linear algebra book which is not too theoretical but is mathematically rigorous and covers all of these such topics.
