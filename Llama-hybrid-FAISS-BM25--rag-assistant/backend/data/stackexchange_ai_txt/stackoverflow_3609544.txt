Mapping Windows drive path to a RESTful API for cental file storage

Is this possible? Is there a programme that will allow this to happen? I have a program that needs to access a lot of data from a central storage, but the likes of Amazon S3 only allows access via RESTful API which is no good for this program. Only UNC or drive letters are acceptable... Help! Bernard
