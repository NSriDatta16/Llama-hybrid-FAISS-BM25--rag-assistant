What machine learning/deep learning technique to use for a data set consisting of 2D plane

I'm new to machine learning/deep learning field. In an assignment I've been given a data set of 1000 data points. Each data point is a 2D place of dimension 1024 x 1024. In each plane there are some points marked as class-0 ( x ) and some points marked as class-1 ( o ). A simple diagram below. data point #1 (0,1024) (1024,1024) |--------------------------------| | x | | xx | | x | | x o | | x | | x x | | o | | | | | | | ---------------------------------- (0,0) (1024,0) data point #2 (0,1024) (1024,1024) |--------------------------------| | | | xo | | o | | x | | | | x | | o | | xxx | | | | | ---------------------------------- (0,0) (1024,0) etc. We know the Cartesian coordinate (x,y) of each labeled point. What ML/DL technique should I use to make prediction for unlabeled data point like this. unknown data point (0,1024) (1024,1024) |--------------------------------| | . | | .. | | . | | . | | . | | . | | . | | | | .. | | . | ---------------------------------- (0,0) (1024,0) Any help is appreciated.
