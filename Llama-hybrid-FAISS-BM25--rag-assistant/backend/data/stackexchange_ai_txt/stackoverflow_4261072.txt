It was probably done that way for historical reasons; i.e. earlier versions didn't have autoinc variables. I've written code that uses manual autoinc fields on databases that don't support autoinc types, but my code wasn't quite as inefficient as pulling a count(). One issue with using autoinc fields as a primary key is that moving records in and out of tables may result in the primary key changing. So, I'd recommend designing in a "LegacyID" field up front that can be used as future storage for the primary key for times when you are moving records in and out of the table.
