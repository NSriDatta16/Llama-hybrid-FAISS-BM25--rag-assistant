As others have mentioned, three seconds seems unusually long. While testing the SURF implementation in the Mahotas library, I found that it took on average 0.36sec, even with some fairly large images (e.g. 1024x768). And that's with a mix of Python and C, so I'd imagine some other pure-C implementations would be even faster.
