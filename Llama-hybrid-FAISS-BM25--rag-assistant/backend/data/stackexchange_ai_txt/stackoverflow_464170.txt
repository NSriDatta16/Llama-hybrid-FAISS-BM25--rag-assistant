FYI: There is such a thing as "embedded" domains in Grails now, but it has problems. This is where you can logically include one domain as part of another and have its fields all occur physically in the one DB table. For example, if you find that you have the same subset of fields appearing in multiple tables, like street address/city/state/zip, you could define a StreetAddress domain and embed it. One of the current problems is that Grails will still create a street_address table in addition to embedding its fields in the other tables (unless you play tricks). There are submitted patches pending for this, it seems.
