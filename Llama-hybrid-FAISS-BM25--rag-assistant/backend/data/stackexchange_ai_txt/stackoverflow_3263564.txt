I'm going to go with "because VS is developed in a vacuum, where ideas from the outside world don't often intrude. Organizing build files in this way worked acceptably in the first versions of Visual Studio (or its non-Studio precursors), and since that's the way it's always been done in-house, and no one ever came in from the outside and said "you know, the rest of the world would really like to separate intermediate junk files and their actual source code", the VS team never figured it was an issue. It's just a guess, but I can't think of a better explanation.
