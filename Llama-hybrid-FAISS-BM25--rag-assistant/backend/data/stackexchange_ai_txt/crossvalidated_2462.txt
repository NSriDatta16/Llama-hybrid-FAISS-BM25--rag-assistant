The definition of a markov process says the next step depends on the current state only and no past states. That is the Markov property and it defines a first order MC, which is very tractable mathematically and quite easy to present/explain. Of course you could have $n^{th}$ order MC (where the next state depends on the current and the past $n-1$ states) as well as variable order MCs (when the length of the memory is fixed but depends on the previous state). $n^{th}$ order MCs retain the explicit formulation for the distribution of the stationary state, but as you pointed out, the size of the state matrix growths with $n$ such that an unrestricted $n^{th}$ order MC with $k$ states has $O(k^{2n})$ entry in its state matrix. You may want to have a look at recent papers such as Higher-order multivariate Markov chains and their applications as this field is advancing quiet fast.
