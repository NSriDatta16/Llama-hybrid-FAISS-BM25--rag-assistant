So your problem is primarily a data storage issue, and how to store and retrieve edges in your graph. Applying some simple graph terms to your problem: Node/Vertex: In your case each person will represent a node. Edge/Link: The relationship between nodes, in this case 'friends', will create an undirected edge between two nodes. So you will need to maintain a data structure in your DB that allows you to resolve the edge relationships between friends. Some useful information can probably be found in this question: challenge-how-to-implement-an-algorithm-for-six-degree-of-separation Also, something you should consider when deciding how to store your edge list is how many edges you think your site will generate. This will probably effect the storage mechanism you decide on. Hope those pointers help.
