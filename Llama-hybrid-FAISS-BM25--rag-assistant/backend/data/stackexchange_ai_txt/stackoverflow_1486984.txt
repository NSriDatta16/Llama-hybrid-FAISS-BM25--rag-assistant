EDIT: Ah, I see your edit. Unfortunately those backticks explain a lot, in bash (cygwin's default shell) backticks is instructing the shell to execute the string as a shell command. So all your command is doing is telling the shell to run freecell. just pass freecell.exe unquoted and that will actually be passing the string to the program. Though, you should take a look at the link I posted in the below paragraph, as it might give you an idea of an exploit you can run on case 8. Old Answer: I'll have to leave a more in depth answer to someone who has better knowledge about the windows architecture, as I don't see how your command line could possibly cause freecell.exe to be launched (btw, does "freecell.exe" also get printed to the console?). However, at a high level case 8 is vulnerable to Format string attacks , which can take advantage of the fact that print assumes that the first argument is a format string, which dictates {whether or not it has arguments, the type of the arguments}. This can be used in a variety of exploits depending on the buffer you pass it. Again, I don't see how it would lead to the launching of a process in your case.
