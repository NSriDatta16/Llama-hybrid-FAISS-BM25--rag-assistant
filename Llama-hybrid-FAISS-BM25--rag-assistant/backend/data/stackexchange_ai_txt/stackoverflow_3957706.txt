Several differences: Apache CouchDB is written in Erlang CouchDB is a document store, it's not optimized for binary data It's also locally hosted unless you want a provider like http://www.couchone.com/ Google Storage is only open to USA developers Don't need a Google Account to use CouchDB Authentication will probably be provided by Google & by a Google Account, with CouchDB you'll be looking at your own authentication measures Plus others, like the fact that you can use distributed data & replication very easy with CouchDB.
