I undertand your point, this does indeed seem like a bit of a backward step... Actually I would probably steer away from LINQ to SQL and look more at LINQ to Entities, your entities model your conceptual data model and I personaly feel more comfortable embedding queries agains a conceptual model in my code. The actual physical model is abstracted away from you by an entity framework. This link (excuse the pun) discusses LINQ to Entities and the Entity Framework: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386992.aspx This is an interesting article discussign the pros and cons of both approaches: http://dotnetaddict.dotnetdevelopersjournal.com/adoef_vs_linqsql.htm Edit Another thought, if you don't want wait for EF, have a look at NHibernate, you can LINQ to that too...
