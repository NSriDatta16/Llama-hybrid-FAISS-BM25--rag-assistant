Pseudo R-squared of averaged model

I am working on model averaging of data collected about bird species and habitat vegetation. I have been using the MuMIn package in R and have taken a subset of all possible models and then averaged the variables in those models to create the coefficients from the subset of models but now I need to find the pseudo r-squared of this averaged model. Does anyone know how to accomplish that?
