Loading/initializing secondary UITabBarController from/with nib

In the application I'm trying to develop I have UINavigationController as a root controller. I initialize views using pretty common code: MySubclassOfViewController *vc = [[MySubclassOfViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MySubclassOfViewController" bundle:nil]; vc.title = @"A title"; [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES]; [vc release]; After a succession of some views I want to load UITabBarController. Is there a way to desing the nib file and create an instance of UITabBarController the same way as above? I know I can do this programmatically or by explicitly declaring an outlet and connecting it with the controller in the nib. It's also possible to initialize the controller using something like NSArray *objects = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"MySubclassOfViewController" owner:self options:nil]; self = [objects objectAtIndex:0]; [objects release]; But can I make it without extra work & typing? Let's say I define a subclass of UITabBarConroller (although I know it's discouraged in the Apple docs, but just out of curiosity). When I make an instance of the subclass, can I somehow load the superclass part out of a nib?
