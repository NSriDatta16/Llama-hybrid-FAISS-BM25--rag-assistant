Occam's razor obsolete?

I saw Vapnik's books about statistical learning... I read the first few chapters. Anyway what surprised me the most was that he thought that the Occam's razor was obsolete. I thought it was related to the situation in which assuming higher dimension improves the fit significantly. Am I understood right? Is it correct that Occam's razor can't be no longer right like Vapnik said? Is there any argument that Occam's razor shouldn't be considered as the default? The exact sentences come from the Preface to the Second Edition of The Nature of Statistical Learning , which are: The years since the first edition of the book have also changed the general philosophy in our understanding the of nature of the induction problem. After many successful experiments with SVM, researchers became more determined in criticism of the classical philosophy of generalization based on the principle of Occam's razor." I wish someone could elaborate on the criticism on Occam's razor.
