Which library is the easiest to start with for Deep Learning

I am quite proficient with Machine Learning libraries and now want to get into Deep Learning. I am even quite comfortable with neural networks as far as understanding back propagation algorithm is concerned. Three languages I am most comfortable with are R, Java & Python. To start with deep learning, I see that there are various libraries such as Caffe, Torch, DL4J and so on. I want to start implementing deep learning as soon as possible with a library that has the least learning curve w.r.t the language, its interfaces and so on. Which among the existing libraries is the easiest to start with?
