You can follow Vogella's " Eclipse Source Code - Tutorial ", especially the section " Import Plugins " how you can import Eclipse plugins from your Eclipse installation to review the code. The Eclipse distribution contains the source code for the core Eclipse projects, e.g. JDT. For other Eclipse projects you usually find a "SDK" bundle on the project update side which contains the source code. To avoid "pollution" of your existing workspace, switch to a new workspace and select File -> Import . Select " Plug-ins and Fragments ". Make the following settings. Select " Binary projects ". In Binary project you can read the source code but you cannot change it. They will also not be compiled therefore this setting will save memory and performance. Add all plugins you would like to import and press "Finish".
