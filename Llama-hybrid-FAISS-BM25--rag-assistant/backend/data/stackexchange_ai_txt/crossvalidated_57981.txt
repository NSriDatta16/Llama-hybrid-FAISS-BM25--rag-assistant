Forecasting optimization techniques in fantasy baseball

I am currently trying to build a better forecasting model for my fantasy baseball roster. I currently am using commonly accepted projected season statistics ( ZiPS from Fangraphs ) to determine the average fantasy points a player can be expected to contribute per game. This is problematic, however, because it does not take into account variance in player performance (among other things). Since baseball involves both luck and skill, I don't think it is a useful exercise to try and predict any particular statistic of a game (i.e. how many hits Prince Fielder will have). Instead, I would like to project average point contributions but take variance into account while doing so. The first thing that comes to mind is the effect of the opposing pitcher. My hypothesis is that the quality of the pitcher effects opposing player performance. Given two players to choose from which are relatively equal in projected fantasy point averages, how can I quantify the effect of the opposing pitcher and how can I test the hypothesis? Also, how can I consider variance in a reasonable way even though it is uncertain? How would I actually know if my projections are under performing or over performing? (This seems to be similar to a financial portfolio optimization problem)
