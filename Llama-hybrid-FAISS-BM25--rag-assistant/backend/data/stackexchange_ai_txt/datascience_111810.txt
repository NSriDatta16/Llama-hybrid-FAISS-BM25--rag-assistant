How to handle date in Random Forest prediction?

I want to predict the income for small business from 1/1/2018 to 1/1/2020 for a dataset from historical data(all my variables are numeric except for date) the start date of my data is 1/1/2012. The income is updated each 3 months (so on 1/1/2018 I have x income and on 30/3/2015 I have new income) I'm not sure how to handle the date in this situation. I did the following: 1- read the data 2- analysis the data 3- convert date column to type date 4- sort date 5- split the data (training data from 1/1/2012 to30/12/2017 and test data from 1/1/2018 to 1/1/2020) 6- convert date back to numeric 7- normalize all my columns except for the date columns 8- perform RF 9- predict using test dataset In this scenario I didn't change the date format but I feel like this might not be the best way to handle date format.
