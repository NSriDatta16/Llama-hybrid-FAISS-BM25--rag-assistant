I think you misunderstood what synchronized means. Synchronized is to ensure that multiple threads have limited access to a certain block of code so that you don't get conflicts between the two threads. I think what you may be more interested in is a CyclicBarrier or a CountDownLatch. Both can be used to "synchronize" (overloaded use in this case) multiple threads so that they try to start doing things at the same time. However, be aware that it's impossible to have multiple threads do things at exactly the same instant. You can only try to encourage to do them at about the same time. The rest is subject to OS scheduling on the cores in the system. And if you have a single core, they will never run at the same time.
