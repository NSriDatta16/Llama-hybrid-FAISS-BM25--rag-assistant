Why and when should use a Copy Constructor in C++? Why shallow copy is discouraged?

Lets say we create an object of class Student, we create two instances/objects class Student(i.e. StudentA and StudentB). We do shallow copy to initialize data members of B with that of A as follows: Student StudentB = StudentA; And then we destroy StudentB. Are we facing a situation of Dangling Pointer here? Why and how? Please explain.
