cocoa-touch: How to pass on a touch to another object

This is a beginner's question I'm afraid: I have an UIText which covers the entire screen. I have another transparent view on top of this UITextView so as to be able to recognise swiping gestures (horizontally and vertically), like so: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; // UITextView CGRect aFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480); aTextView = [[UITextView alloc] initWithFrame:aFrame]; aTextView.text = @"Some sample text."; [self.view addSubview:aTextView]; // canTouchMe CGRect canTouchMeFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480); canTouchMe = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:canTouchMeFrame]; [self.view addSubview:canTouchMe]; } Let's consider the user touches (not swipes) the canTouchMe View. In this case, I would like the canTouchMe view to disappear and pass on the touch to the UITextView hiding beneath so that it enters the editing mode and enable the 'natural' scrolling options an UITextView has (i.e. only horizontally). My touches began method looks like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch =[touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; } How do I tell this method that IF it recognises only ONE touch , that it should hide the canTouchMeFrame and PASS ON the touch to the UITextView? Sorry if this is basic, but I have no idea how to implement this. Thanks for any suggestions. EDIT: I introduced a touchEnded method, but I still have no luck. The touch will not be forwarded to the UITextView. I need to tap twice in order to edit it: - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self.view]; CGFloat deltaX = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.x - currentPosition.x); // will always be positive CGFloat deltaY = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.y - currentPosition.y); // will always be positive if (deltaY == 0 && deltaX == 0) { label.text = @"Touch"; [self performSelector:@selector(eraseText) withObject:nil afterDelay:2]; [aTextView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; [self.view bringSubviewToFront:aTextView]; [self.view bringSubviewToFront:doneEdit]; } }
