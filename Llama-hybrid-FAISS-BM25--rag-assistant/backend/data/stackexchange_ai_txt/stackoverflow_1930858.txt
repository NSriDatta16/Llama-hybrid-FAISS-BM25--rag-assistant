The quickest way to "Just get rid of it" without modifying your code would be to use #pragma warning disable 0162 On your Namespace, class or method where you want to supress the warning. For example, this wont throw the warning anymore: #pragma warning disable 0162 namespace ConsoleApplication4 { public class Program { public const bool something = false; static void Main(string[] args) { if (something) { Console.WriteLine(" Not something" ); } } } However be warn that NO METHOD inside this namespace will throw the warning again... and well.. warnings are there for a reason (what if it happened when you did NOT planned it to be unreachable?) I guess a safer way would be to write the variables in a configuration file , and read them from there at the beginning of the program, that way you don't even need to recompile to have your different versions/releases! Just change the app file and go :D. about the speed penalty.. yes.. making it this way would inquire in a speed penalty... compared to using const but unless you are really worried about wating 1/100 of a millisecond more.. I would go for it that way.
