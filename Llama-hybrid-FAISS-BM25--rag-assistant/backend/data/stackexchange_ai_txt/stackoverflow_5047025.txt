How can I alias an android bitmap to a drawable from another size (drawable-large-mdpi aliases to drawable-hdpi)

I'm working on adding support for tablet sized screens to my apps. I already have images in drawable-mdpi and drawable-hdpi for different density screens. My problem is with tablets like the Galaxy 7" which is a "large" screen but is still medium density. Part of my layout has 5 buttons across the width of the screen which are evenly spaced. On the large screen with mdpi graphics though the images are very small with tons of whitespace between them. I would like to use larger graphics for the large layout to make them look appropriate as well as take advantage of the screen real estate. I have some double sized graphics in my hdpi directory that would work perfectly. As a test, I've copied all of the images from /res/drawable-hdpi into /res/drawable-large-mdpi and everything looked exactly as I want. However, I don't want to bloat the size of my app by coping all of those images. I would like to just create aliases for each of them so that when /res/drawable-large-mdpi/button_0 is requested, it will actually use /res/drawable-hdpi/button_0 instead. I've tried creating an xml bitmap but I don't know how to reference a drawable from a specific directory. Any help? Contents of /res/drawable-large-mdpi/button_0.xml: The error I get with the above is: error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'src' with value '@drawable-hdpi/button_0_highlighted').
