Let me confuse things even more: ECONOMETRICS - FIXED EFFECTS APPROACH The "fixed effects" approach in econometrics for panel data, is a way to estimate the slope coefficients (the betas), by "by-passing" the existence of the individual effects variable $\alpha_i$, and so by not making any assumption as to whether it is "fixed" or "random". This is what the "First Difference" estimator (using first differences of the data) and the "Within" estimator (using deviations from time-averages) do: they manage to estimate only the betas. For a more traditional approach that does explicitly treat the individual effects (the "intercepts") as constants, we use the Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) Estimator, which provides also estimates for the $\alpha_i$'s Note: in the linear model the three estimators algebraically coincide as regards the produced estimates for the betas - but only in the linear model. Discussion (partly excerpted from class notes) "The main advantage of the fixed effects approach is that we do not need to make any assumptions about the nature of the individual effects. We should apply it whenever we suspect that the latter are correlated with one or more of the regressors since in this case ignoring the presence of such correlation and naively applying OLS on the pooled model produces inconsistent estimators. Despite its appeal on grounds of the minimal assumptions that we need to make concerning the individual effects, the fixed effects approach has certain limitations. First, coefficients of time invariant regressors cannot be estimated since these variables are differenced out along with the unobservable individual effects. Second, the individual effects (in case we use the LSDV estimator) cannot be consistently estimated (except if we let the time dimension go to infinity)." ECONOMETRICS - RANDOM EFFECTS APPROACH In the "traditional" econometric Random Effects approach we assume that the individual "intercepts" $\alpha_i$ are "permanent random components" while the "usual" error terms are "transitory" error components. In an interesting extension, the additional randomness arises from the existence of a random time effect , common to all cross sections but time varying , alongside a fixed(constant) individual effect and the error term. This "time effect" for example may represent an aggregate shock at economy-wide level that affects equally all households. Such aggregate disturbances are indeed observed and so it appears to be a realistic modelling choice. Here the "Random Effects" Estimator is a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimator, for increased efficiency. Now, one more conceived estimator, the "Between" Estimator, performs OLS on the time-averaged observations. As a matter of algebra it has been shown that the GLS estimator can be obtained as a weighted average of the Within and the Between estimators, where the weights are not arbitrary but relate to the VCV matrices of the two. ...and there is also the variants of "Uncorrelated Random Effects" and "Correlated Random Effects" models. I hope the above help make the contrast with the "mixed effects" models.
