Selecting a surviving population in a "voter" Genetic Algorithm

I've been working on a genetic algorithm where there is a population consisting of individuals with a color, and a preference. Preference and color are from a small number of finite states, probably around 4 or 5. (example: 1|1, 5|2, 3|3 etc) Every individual casts a "vote" for their preference, which assists those individuals with that vote as their color. My current idea is to cycle through every individual, and calculate the chance that they should survive, based on number of votes, etc. and then roll a die to see if they live. I'm currently doing it so that if v[x] represents the percent of votes for color x , individual k with color c has v[c] chance of surviving. However, this means that if there are equal numbers of all 5 types of (a|a) individuals, 4/5 of them perish, and that's not good. Does anyone have any idea of a method of randomness I could use to determine the chance an individual has to survive? For instance, an algorithm that for v votes for c , v individuals with color c survive (on statistical average).
