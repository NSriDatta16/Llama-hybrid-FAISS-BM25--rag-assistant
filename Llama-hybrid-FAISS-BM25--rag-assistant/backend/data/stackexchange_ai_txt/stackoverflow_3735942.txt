There's very little information in your question to work from, but it looks like some code uses some form of placement new , and while that special operator new is declared (the compiler finds it and compiles the code using it), the linker can't find its definition . (Since this old answer of mine seems to still get attention: See here for an extensive discussion on declaration vs. definition.)
