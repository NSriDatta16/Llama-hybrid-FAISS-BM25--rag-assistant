Just code your groups as dummy variables, which I think may be what @whuber was suggesting. There is plenty of reference information available on the internet about dummy variables. Like so: time summary(lm1) Call: lm(formula = size ~ groupa + groupb + time + groupa:time + groupb:time) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.035833 -0.021012 -0.003583 0.015768 0.043929 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.066786 0.022092 3.023 0.00912 ** groupa 0.103214 0.041156 2.508 0.02508 * groupb -0.045000 0.031243 -1.440 0.17176 time 0.097381 0.004375 22.259 2.51e-12 *** groupa:time 0.295619 0.013413 22.040 2.87e-12 *** groupb:time 0.006667 0.006187 1.078 0.29946 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.02835 on 14 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9963, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9949 F-statistic: 746.2 on 5 and 14 DF, p-value: And now your p-value for Shapiro-Wilks is 0.35, for Breusch-Pagan it is 0.45, and for Durbin-Watson it is 0.92. For group A your equation is size = (0.066786+0.103214)+(0.097381+0.295619)*time. Except I would probably run it again without 'groupb' and 'groupb:time', to get a single fitted line for groups B+C together.
