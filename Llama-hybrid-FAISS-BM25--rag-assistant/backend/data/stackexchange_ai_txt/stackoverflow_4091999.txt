Probably not useful, but you can play with the internal fields on a delegate to make it call to arbitrary code: http://www.atrevido.net/blog/2005/01/28/Inline+X86+ASM+In+C.aspx See the comments for more caveats and other approaches. The benefit of playing with a delegates target directly is (AFAIK) you won't get a managed-unmanaged transition as if you did GetDelegateForFunctionPointer or other interop approaches. On the downside, this means you have to code it by hand and make sure the calling conventions line up and so on. It's probably fragile, and the delegate call overhead might make it not worth it.
