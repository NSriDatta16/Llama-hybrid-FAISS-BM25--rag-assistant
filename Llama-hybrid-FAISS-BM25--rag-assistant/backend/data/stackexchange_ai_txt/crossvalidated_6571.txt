What types of analysis are appropriate for demographic time series data?

Let us say we have some demographic time series data which tells us how many hours people spend in front of a computer screen each day, grouped by age and gender: set.seed(42) dates = seq(as.Date("2011/1/1"), by="day", length.out = 100) male.age1 = round(runif(100, min = 1, max = 10)) female.age1 = round(runif(100, min = 1, max = 10)) male.age2 = round(runif(100, min = 1, max = 10)) female.age2 = round(runif(100, min = 1, max = 10)) df = data.frame(dates = dates, male.age1 = male.age1, female.age1 = female.age1, male.age2 = male.age2, female.age2 = female.age2) which looks like this: > df[1:5,] dates male.age1 female.age1 male.age2 female.age2 1 2011-01-01 9 7 9 5 2 2011-01-02 9 3 6 5 3 2011-01-03 4 3 9 2 4 2011-01-04 8 5 5 4 5 2011-01-05 7 9 2 9 etc... I am just wondering what kind of analysis would be appropriate for this type of data, and if you could give me some examples? My initial thinking is trying to see how certain types of people act on certain dates, though I don't know how to go about that. I think what I'm finding hard is that the dates are not really independent of each other (i.e. what happens today might effect what happens tomorrow). Many thanks in advance for your time. Note: This isn't homework or anything like that, just curiosity and trying to learn R. Note 2: Is there any benefit in reshaping the data as follows (I came across the reshape package a few days ago, and it looks really cool): library(reshape) library(reshape2) y = melt(df, id = "dates") y$gender = NA ind = grep("female", y$variable, fixed = TRUE) y[ind, "gender"] = "female" y[-ind, "gender"] = "male" y$gender = factor(y$gender) levels(y$variable) Which gives: > y[with(y, order(dates)), ][1:10,] dates variable value gender 1 2011-01-01 age1 9 male 101 2011-01-01 age2 7 female 201 2011-01-01 age3 9 male 301 2011-01-01 age4 5 female 2 2011-01-02 age1 9 male 102 2011-01-02 age2 3 female 202 2011-01-02 age3 6 male 302 2011-01-02 age4 5 female 3 2011-01-03 age1 4 male 103 2011-01-03 age2 3 female etc...
