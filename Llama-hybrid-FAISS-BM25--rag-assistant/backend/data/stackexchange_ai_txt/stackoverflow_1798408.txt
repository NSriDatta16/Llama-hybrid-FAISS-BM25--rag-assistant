File-scoped variables are extern by default; see C99 spec, 6.2.2 ยง5: If the declaration of an identifier for a function has no storage-class specifier, its linkage is determined exactly as if it were declared with the storage-class specifier extern. If the declaration of an identifier for an object has file scope and no storage-class specifier, its linkage is external. If you want your variables to be distinct, add the specifier static .
