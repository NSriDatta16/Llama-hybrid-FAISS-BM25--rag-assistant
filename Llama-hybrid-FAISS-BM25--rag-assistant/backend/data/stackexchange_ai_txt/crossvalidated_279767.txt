This is one of the ways how can you provide data for logistic regression in R (see also here ). In this case you are modeling probability of selling ticket given the predictors. You are still estimating probabilities. Moreover, your data is still (conditionally) binomial, you are predicting $k$ successes vs $n-k$ failures provided as $(k, n-k)$ tuples -- this is just another way of representing the same data.
