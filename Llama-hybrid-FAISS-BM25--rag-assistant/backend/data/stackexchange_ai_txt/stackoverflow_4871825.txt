It's because char *op creates just a character pointer, not the backing storage to hold the string. Since this is C++, you should be using std::string . Old style C strings have their uses but easy-to-use strings is not one of them. Embrace C++, there are more than enough C programmers trying to pass themselves off as C++ gurus as it is :-) Since this looks like homework, I won't give you back your fully fixed program but I will give you one that can be used as a basis for testing and, more importantly, understanding: pax$ cat qq.cpp ; g++ -o qq qq.cpp #include int main (void) { std::string s; std::cout > s; // or getline (std::cin, s). std::cout Alternatively, if you really want to use C strings, something like: #include int main (void) { char s[256]; std::cout may be suitable.
