Thanks to Will's great analysis! Based on Will's suggestion: " A better solution would be if you could directly databind the MinWidth of the ListBoxItem itself...However I have no idea how to get access to that item ", I was able to implement that using pure xaml, as follows: I got the idea from Adam Nathan's great book, " Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed ". So, this seems to fix the original problem. New Problem You notice that there is a Slider control in the xaml that let's you increase/decrease the ListBox font. The idea here was to allow the user the ability to scale the ListBox content up or down for easier visibility. If you first drag the Slider to the right to increase the FontSize, this will make the horizontal scroll bar appear, as expected. The new problem is that the horizontal scroll bar never goes away if you drag the Slider to the left to reduce the FontSize . Any ideas?
