I agree with you regarding the dependence of bond returns on interest rates and yield curve but I think these components are not enough to answer the question as the PCA and EFA tend to give different analyses so to base both the answers on the same parameters will be a bit faulty. Other factors that might influence it are inflation, credit rating, portfolio diversification methodology etc. Courtesy- Copeland, Weston and Shastri's "Financial theory and Corporate policy"
