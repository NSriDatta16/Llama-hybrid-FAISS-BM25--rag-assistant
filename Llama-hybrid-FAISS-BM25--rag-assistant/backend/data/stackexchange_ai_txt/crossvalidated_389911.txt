In a CRF, for instance, as below, X is a set of observed variables and Y target variables: Since the $X$ are all observed, a factor $\phi_i (X, Y_i)$ can be any function. And if it is a logistic regression function, then $X$ are just the features and so as any combination or manipulation of them, as we do in simple logistic regression tasks. For instance(general cases) if we say, $X_1$ should be the same as $X_2$ for $Y_i$ to be a particular state $Y_c$ , then we just define it as $X_1=X_2$ as one feature. If it holds the energy between this feature and $Y_c$ is low and the probability is high.
