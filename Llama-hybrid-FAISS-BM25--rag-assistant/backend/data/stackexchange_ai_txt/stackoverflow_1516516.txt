What you could try is stripping necessary punctuation and running each sentence through a stemmer (e.g. a Porter Stemmer ). Once you have a stemmed version of the sentence you could store that in another column for comparison. However, you may find it more space efficient to hash the stemmed sentence if the sentences are long (e.g. over 40 chars on average). Any rows which share the same stemmed sentence or hash will be highly likely to be equivalent - you could automate their removal, or create a UI to enable a human to rapidly approve each one. Here's a Python implementation of the Porter stemmer .
