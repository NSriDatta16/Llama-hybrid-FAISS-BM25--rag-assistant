Does the Enumerator of a Dictionary return key value pairs in the order they were added?

I understand that a dictionary is not an ordered collection and one should not depend on the order of insertion and retrieval in a dictionary. However, this is what I noticed: Added 20 key value pairs to a Dictionary Retrieved them by doing a foreach(KeyValuePair...) The order of retrieval was same as the order in which they were added. Tested for around 16 key value pairs. Is this by design?
