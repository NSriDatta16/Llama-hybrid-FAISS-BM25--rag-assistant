What is the effect of number of hidden layers on local optimas in neural networks?

How does the number of hidden layers, affect local minimas? is it because of only the number of parameters or the depth of the network? for example a network of 5 hidden layer with each having 500 neurons is more prune to local minimas or a network of 2 hidden layes with 1250 neurons each?
