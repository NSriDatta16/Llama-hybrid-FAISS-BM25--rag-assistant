First, welcome to the deep learning world. Take as simple as it is: The dimensions of weights in any layer = (number of neurons in the next layer, number of neurons of the previous layer). In your example, the weights between the first hidden layer (4 neurons) and the input layer (3 inputs). The dimensions of bias = (number of neurons of the connected layer, 1) Z can be computed as in the following matrix: This is a step-by-step reference for your question: Using the right dimensions for your Neural Network I hope that helps!
