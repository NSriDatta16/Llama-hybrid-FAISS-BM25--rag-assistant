How does multivariate regression consider the correlation among response when estimating the parameters?

I have read a few posts about multivariate regression, where the response is a matrix instead of a vector. However, when I really look into the literatures, there is nothing. I have read the multivariate books (the books recommended by people answering similar questions), all they talk about is multivariate distribution, Wishart distribution, MANOVA, PCA, factor analysis, etc. None of them discussed how to take the dependency among y into account. Is there any literature about how to do the 'multivariate regression' instead of talking about how to deal with multivariate data, etc.?
