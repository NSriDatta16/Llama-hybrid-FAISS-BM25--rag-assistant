You're right. SuperContainer could help to deal with the dropped references when storing files in FileMaker by reference instead of storing the entire file within the database. Personally, given how large FileMaker files can be, when working with documents, I tend to simply store them within the database and script their retrieval. But SuperContainer isn't doing anything that you couldn't do yourself with scripting and a web server. By using SuperContainer you might save yourself some coding time, which might make it worth the purchase, but it won't add any capabilities that you couldn't code yourself.
