Populate a TreeView from an object

I am having a problem with a treeview in my WinForm app. I created a TreeViewItem class that holds the data. There are only 5 fields: CaseNoteID, ContactDate, ParentNoteID, InsertUser, ContactDetails. public class TreeItem { public Guid CaseNoteID; public Guid? ParentNoteID; public string ContactDate; public string InsertUser; public string ContactDetails; public TreeItem(Guid caseNoteID, Guid? parentNoteID, string contactDate, string contactDetails, string insertUser) { CaseNoteID = caseNoteID; ParentNoteID = parentNoteID; ContactDate = contactDate; ContactDetails = contactDetails; InsertUser = insertUser; } } The plan was to show relationships of the notes by showing a note under it's parent as determined by the ParentNoteID field. Pretty simplistic really. Unfortunately, all my attempts so far have put a "child" note, one with a ParentNoteID, in both positions. The first level AND under it's appropriate Parent. When I step through my code my data is coming back accurately. List items = BLLMatrix.GetTreeViewData(HUD.PersonId); PopulateTree(tvwCaseNotes,items); I just don't know how to take that and populate my TreeView accurately with it. This is what I started but now I am stuck. public static void PopulateTree(TreeView tree, ICollection items) I just don't seem able to wrap my head around it. Do I need to split my data call up and first return all entrys with ParentNoteID = null and then go get the rest and somehow join the two? @Hogan: I apologize for the drastic change in the question. It was evident from your response that I hadn't approached this from a good angle in the first place. In the second place, the original method still did not work.
