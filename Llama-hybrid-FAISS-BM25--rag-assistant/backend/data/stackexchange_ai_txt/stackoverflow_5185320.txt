Grab here the version you need. SWT is still not bundled platform-neutrally, so you have to pay attention to the platform to use. I'd grabbed windows version, with postfix of 3.6.1-win32-win32-x86. I've used that as a versionId, leaving the platform out of group/artifact fields. This might be not totally correct for maven gurus but fits for me quite well (at least for now). Also I am using the debug-version of the jar, which is okay for development. So here we go. Unpack the archive and then issue this (in the root folder of your archive): mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.eclipse -DartifactId=swt -Dversion=3.6.1-win32-win32-x86 -Dfile=swt-debug.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=../path/to/your/local/project/repo and then this, to install sources as well: mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.eclipse -DartifactId=swt -Dversion=3.6.1-win32-win32-x86 -Dfile=src.zip -Dpackaging=jar -Dclassifier=sources -DlocalRepositoryPath=../path/to/your/local/project/repo Add reference to a local repo to your pom.xml, local Project Local Repository default file://${project.baseDir}/path/to/your/local/project/repo/ and then add a dependency itself: org.eclipse swt 3.6.1-win32-win32-x86 Hope this helps someone, and I get some karma for bounties on other, harder questions of mine... ;)
