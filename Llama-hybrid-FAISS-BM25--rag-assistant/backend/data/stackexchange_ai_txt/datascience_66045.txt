Time Series Classification for loan data

I have multiple columns for loan installment repayment. As there is a field for month of repayment, I want to predict if the customer is going to pay next month's installment or not. As I have multiple variables and target variable as installment paid (Y/N), despite repayment being dependent on time variable, i.e., installments paid in past months, I'm looking to solve this problem with time series classification. Any references will be appreciated.
