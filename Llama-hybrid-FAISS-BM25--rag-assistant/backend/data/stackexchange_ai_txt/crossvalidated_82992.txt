Using principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection in regression

I have a dataset $D$ made of $m$ samples and $n$ features with $n \gg m$. For each sample I have a score $s$ which I would like to be able to predict. As the number of features is very high (compared to the number of samples), I have performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and built a regression model for $s$ based on the first 3 principal components (out of 45). I cross-validated the results and am happy with the performances of my model. Now I would like to understand what is happening in terms of my original features. In particular I would like to understand which features are relevant in predicting $s$, and select them to build a model which does not involve PCA. How can I perform this last step (if you have R based solutions it is better, but not essential)?
