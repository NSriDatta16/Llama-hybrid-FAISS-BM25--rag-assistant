The wikipedia entry from moogs is a good starting point for smoothing the data. But it does not help you in making a decision. It all depends on your data, and the needed processing speed. Moving Average Will flatten the top values. If you are interrested in the minimum and maximum value, don't use this. Also I think using the moving average will influence your measurement of the acceleration, since it will flatten your data (a bit), thereby acceleration will appear to be smaller. It all comes down to the needed accuracy. Savitzkyâ€“Golay Fast algorithm. As fast as the moving average. That will preserve the heights of peaks. Somewhat harder to implement. And you need the correct coefficients. I would pick this one. Kalman filters If you know the distribution, this can give you good results (it is used in GPS navigation systems). Maybe somewhat harder to implement. I mention this because I have used them in the past. But they are probably not a good choice for a starter in this kind of stuff. The above will reduce noise on your signal. Next you have to do is detect the start and end point of the "acceleration". You could do this by creating a Derivative of the original signal. The point(s) where the derivative crosses the Y-axis (zero) are probably the peaks in your signal, and might indicate the start and end of the acceleration. You can then create a second degree derivative to get the minium and maximum acceleration itself.
