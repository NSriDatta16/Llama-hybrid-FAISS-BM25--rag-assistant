I think you probably want a regression model. Surely mortality is a dependent variable here, and it seems like you want to examine the effect of race on it. What sort of regression model depends on how mortality is recorded. It could be a (regular) logistic regression, an ordered logistic or possibly a survival model. As for a simple display, it seems like a mosaic plot would be good.
