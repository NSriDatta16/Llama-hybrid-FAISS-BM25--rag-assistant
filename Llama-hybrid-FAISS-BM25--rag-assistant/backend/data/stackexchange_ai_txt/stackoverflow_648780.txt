My hunch for your DSL is that any language sufficiently powerful enough to solve the tasks you have identified will be too complicated for your non-technical business analyst. That said, for a highly constrained problem domain, (as I think you are heading), it should be possible to come up with a relatively useful DSL. Indeed, this is the starting premise for Ruby On Rails. My current bias is towards internal DSLs/ language specialization that is: DSLs embedded as part of another language. This may mean embedding IronRuby or IronPython in your .net application. Whilst this does get you out of the problems of writing a compiler/interpretter for your own custom language, it does mean some up front work writing the DSL in the embedded language. From experience, I would say that this was small potatoes compared to the benefits of built in documentation, documentation writing support, and all the other language features that appear for free.
