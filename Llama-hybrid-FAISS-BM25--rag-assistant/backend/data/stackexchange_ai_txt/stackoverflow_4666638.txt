RI doc error installing Rails with RVM on Snow Leopard

Installing Rails with RVM on Snow Leopard turned up this error during the installation of the RI docs: ERROR: While executing gem ... (NoMethodError) undefined method coverage_level=' for nil:NilClass This occurred after installing the RI docs for railties-3.0.3. I've done a search and didn't find anything similar. This is error isn't, perhaps, the end of the world, but I'd like to see if anyone has any ideas. Any help would be appreciated. I'm using Ruby 1.9.2-p136 and RVM 1.2.0 on Mac OS 10.6.5. All of the Rails gems, besides the documentation, seemed, so far, to install fine.
