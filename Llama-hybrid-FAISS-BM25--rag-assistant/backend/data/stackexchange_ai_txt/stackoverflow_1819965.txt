Differences in WYSIWYG capabilities for ICEfaces on Netbeans and Eclipse?

While evaluating ICEfaces I have used Eclipse and its Web Page Editor to visually create a webpage using ICEfaces components. I have heard that Netbeans 6.5 provided a similar capability, but Netbeans 6.7 does not support a visual drag and drop. I was wondering if there is a plugin for Netbeans to enable this? Also to those who have experience with ICEfaces, what IDE do you prefer and why?
