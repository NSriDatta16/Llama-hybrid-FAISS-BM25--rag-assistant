Note that the null hypothesis of the ADF test is that there is a Unit root. The alternative hypothesis of the test is that there is a "root outside the unit circle". A "root outside the Unit circle" usually infers stationarity or trend-stationarity. Trend-stationarity CANNOT be detected with an ADF test. The ADF test does not test a null hypothesis of trend stationarity against an alternative hypothesis of strict stationarity. Instead detrend the time series and test for stationarity in the detrended data set. Edit: Note that a Unit root can be defined as a shock which shifts the time series permanently to a new level. Apparently your data does not have such shocks. Edit2: In the following link I described cases in which an ADF-test might produce missleading results (i.e. if the time series contains components of both stationary and non-stationary time series or if the data set is two small for inference. In your case the first case might be a possibillity). Two solutions of these problems are either applying additionally for a Stationarity test such as KPSS or Leybourne-McCabe or applying a Variance ratio test . What is the difference between a stationary test and a unit root test?
