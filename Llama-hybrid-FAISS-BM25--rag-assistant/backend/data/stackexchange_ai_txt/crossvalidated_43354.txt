I don't know if can give you an expected answer, but I think some Bayesian approach would be good in this case. You may want to take a look in particle filters instead of Kalman as I susspect it may be a problem to set up correct model for Kalman filter in this case. If you want to go for Kalman, there are different types of the filter and some of them require good knowledge about error covariance, which may cause troubles, but some can compute it with Mante Carlo. Take a look on unscented Kalman Filter. You may also like http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/apr2012 as it explain some basic about estimation for moving vehicle and google's self-driving car. (and it is in python). Maybe some more details in your question would be more helpful and you can get more precise answers.
