What statistical test should I use for subgroup analysis/correlation?

I am a conducting a four group randomized survey-based study. In the first group, I explain a situation, and then ask respondents their willingness from 1-10 to take a medication. In the second group, I explain a situation, and then ask the respondents their willingness from 1-10 to take a medication. The same repeats for group three and four. I believe if I wanted to compare the "willingness responses" between each groups, I could use a basic Kruskalâ€“Wallis test. However, for each respondent, I will also be asking them: 1) their age; 2) gender; 3) educational level; and 4) how long they have suffered with their disease. I was wondering, what is the best test to use to compare if patients' subgroup categorization has an effect on their willingness to take a medication? I took a closer look and did some digging, what do y'all think of ordinal logistic regression?
