Estimator of the variance of a population from different groups

Suppose a population can be divided into 4 different groups (A, B, C, D) and you take the sample variance for a parameter of each group. A proposed estimator for the population variance is $$s^2_A/n_A + s^2_B/n_B + s^2_C/n_C + s^2_D/n_D,$$ where $n_A, n_B, n_C$ and $n_D$ are the number of observations in each group. In other words, the proposed estimator for the population variance is the average of the estimators of the conditional variance calculated before. Is this population variance estimator correct?
