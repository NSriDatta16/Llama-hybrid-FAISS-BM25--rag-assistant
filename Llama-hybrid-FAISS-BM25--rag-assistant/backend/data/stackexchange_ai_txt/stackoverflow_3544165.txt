How do I include XML data in a Windows Phone xap deployment?

I'm working on a WP7 app. The app will have a couple of XML files. Some are read-write, a couple are read-only. What are my options here? IsolatedStorage? Embedding as resources? I'll also need to know... How would I load the XML into XElements from either? How would I save from an XElement into either?
