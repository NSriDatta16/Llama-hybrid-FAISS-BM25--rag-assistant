ASP.NET MVC Route with dash

I've got ASP.NET MVC routing question. I prepared following routing table to map such url mywebsite/mycontroller/myaction/14-longandprettyseoname to parameters: 14 => id (integer) longandprettyseoname -> seo_name (string) routes.MapRoute( "myname", "mycontroller/myaction/{id}-{seo_name}", new { controller = "mycontroller", action = "myaction", id = 0, seo_name = (string)null }); routes.MapRoute( "Default", "{controller}/{action}/{id}", new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }); It works for URL above but it has problems for following type of urls mywebsite/mycontroller/myaction/14-long-and-pretty-seo-name Is that possible to make it working? EDIT: "mycontroller/myaction/{seo_name}-{id}" seems to be working
