When the result is "non significant" you don't say "how much insignificant it is" besides quoting the p-value. I think, that what you want to do, is to informally test another hypothesis , that the parameter is significantly smaller than some chosen by you threshold . In that case you'd need to formally create another test for it (which in most cases would should be straightforward) and quote this new p-value (which we expect will yield significant result). The bottom line is, that the classical statistics (contrary to common sense and every-day intuition) doesn't provide arguments for null hypothesis. It can only give arguments against it . Take a look at Bayesian Statistics. Although much more difficult to implement, in the end it does provide arguments both for or against any tested set of hypotheses.
