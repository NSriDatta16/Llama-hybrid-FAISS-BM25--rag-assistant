Types of Models Suitable for Problem with Categorical Time Series Labels

I have a situation with a standard input but have to output a set of categorical time series labels. I have had a look at the literature, and there is much to say when we have the reverse situation, i.e. variable length inputs, for example padding. But was wondering what to do with variable length outputs. Is this a situation for a one to many RNN? Or are there other options?
