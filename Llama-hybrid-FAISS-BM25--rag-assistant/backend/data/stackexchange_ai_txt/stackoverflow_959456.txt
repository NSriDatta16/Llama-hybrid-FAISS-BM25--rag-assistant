I know your using asp.net, but for anyone who comes across this and is using apache, the best (fastest, least cpu intensive) method of compression is mod_deflate, . This is what I use in my .htaccess: # Insert filter SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine # BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary Source: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html And for evidence that it is faster: http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=deflate+vs+gzip
