What does the "self organizing" in "self organizing Scrum team" mean? It means this: No one – not even the ScrumMaster - tells the Team how to turn Product Backlog into increments of shippable functionality. The Team figures this out on its own. Each Team member applies his or her expertise to all of the problems. The synergy that results improves the entire Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness. Reference: Scrum Guide
