Maybe repeated measures anova is what you want. It allows you to compare the subjects (inter subject factors) while taking the correlated structure of the "time series" per subject (intra subject factor). It is an easy but dated method and can be found in the context of "general linear models", it needs some additional features (e.g. sphericity). Another way could be mixed linear models which allow for more general correlations structures (even AR(1) like Rob suggested) and unbalanced data.
