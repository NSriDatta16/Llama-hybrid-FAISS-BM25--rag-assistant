My answer isn't specific to Ruby on Rails. Next time you need to touch the codebase, to fix a bug or add a new feature, write tests for the parts of the code you're touching. If you can spare a couple of minutes, add some related tests. If you find that you need to refactor, go ahead and write the tests to support that. Over time you'll build up the test coverage, and you'll find you always have tests for the areas you need them in (because those are the tests you're writing).
