C#: Load roaming profile and execute program as user

In an application I need to execute other programs with another user's credentials. Currently I use System.Diagnostics.Process.Start to execute the program: public static Process Start( string fileName, string arguments, string userName, SecureString password, string domain ) However this function does not load the roaming profile from the net - which is required. I could use "runas /profile ..." to load the profile and execute the command, but that would ask for a password. There must be an more elegant way... But where?
