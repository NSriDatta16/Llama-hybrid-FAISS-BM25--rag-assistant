If you look at Paul Hewison's webpage , you can find his free book on Multivariate Statistics and R . Another free book is by Wolfgang Hardle and Leopold Simar. I have been working my way through Johnson and Wichern, a book that has been used in the US for over twenty years; you will have to buy this book.
