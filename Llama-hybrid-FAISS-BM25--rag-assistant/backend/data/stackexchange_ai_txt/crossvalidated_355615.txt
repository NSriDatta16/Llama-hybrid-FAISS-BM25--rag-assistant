What does Proper policy mean in RL?

I have seen the word "proper policy" in a bunch of reinforcement learning papers. Unfortunately, these papers did not provide any formal definition of what they mean by "proper policy". My guess is it might be something related to the learning rate. I would appreciate if someone can help me better understand this notion. Thanks.
