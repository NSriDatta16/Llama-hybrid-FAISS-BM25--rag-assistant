You need to leave off the quotes (since they're added already as part of the parameterization process), this: "SELECT * FROM github.repo WHERE id='#{username}' AND repo='#{repository}'" ...which results in: SELECT * FROM github.repo WHERE id='"jquery"' AND repo='"jquery"' should just be: "SELECT * FROM github.repo WHERE id=#{username} AND repo=#{repository}" ....which results in: SELECT * FROM github.repo WHERE id="jquery" AND repo="jquery" Once you correct this, the format coming back is: {"query":{"count":"1","created":"2010-12-25T21:49:01Z","lang":"en-US","results":{"repository":{"url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery","has-downloads":{"type":"boolean","content":"false"},"organization":"jquery","homepage":"http://jquery.com/","pushed-at":{"type":"datetime","content":"2010-12-25T09:56:56-08:00"},"created-at":{"type":"datetime","content":"2009-04-03T08:20:14-07:00"},"has-wiki":{"type":"boolean","content":"false"},"fork":{"type":"boolean","content":"false"},"forks":{"type":"integer","content":"496"},"private":{"type":"boolean","content":"false"},"open-issues":{"type":"integer","content":"35"},"name":"jquery","description":"jQuery JavaScript Library","watchers":{"type":"integer","content":"5387"},"owner":"jquery","has-issues":{"type":"boolean","content":"false"}}}}} So you need a .query in there, like this: if (data.query.results.repository["open-issues"].content > 0) { You can test it out here .
