What are good, freely available journals for keeping track of the latest developments in machine learning?

Feel free to substitute 'journals' for any other useful portal of knowledge. I am interested in keeping an eye on new developments in machine learning, with a view to practical applications. I am not an academic seeking to publish my own work (at least not in this field), but I do want to be aware of potential new algorithms or tricks that would be useful on a practical level. The only caveat is that the journal/conference proceeding or whatever must be freely available without requiring a subscription.
