Django admin is much more, but is bound to Models. Without them, You will not gain much and as there is no such concept in CherryPy, I doubt there is similar application. However, Django admin is phpmyadmin for masses exploited. Don't be constrained by it and create much more usable admin apps, leveraging CherryPy simplicity ^_^
