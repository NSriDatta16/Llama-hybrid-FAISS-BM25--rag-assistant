Can we use the pretrained WavLM on Portuguese?

I wan to try WavLM for 2 tasks: Speaker Verification Speech embeddings If I understand it correctly, the WavLM pre-trained model was trained on English. so if I want to use it for my missions, do I need to fine-tune it for Portuguese? or because the basic was trained only on English - I need to train it from scratch on Portuguese?
