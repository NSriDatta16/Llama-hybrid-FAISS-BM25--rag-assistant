As you've stated the question --- to calculate "the average treatment room occupancy for patient using technique A" --- you should use the second technique you describe, ignoring that the observations are from different patients and just sum all of the time and divide by the total number of observations. If you instead calculate the average of the averages, then you're weighting the observations ("fractions") by the number of observations for each patient. In effect, the observations from patient 1 will "count more" in your final average than the observations from patient 3 because patient 1 has only three measurements whereas patient 3 has five.
