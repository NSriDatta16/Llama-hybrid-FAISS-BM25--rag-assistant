The term "modal" in this context refers to data type. For example, text is a data type. Images is another. Embedding refers to a mapping of an observation to a point in an N-dimensional space. For example, the mean (R, G, B) value of an image is a mapping of that image to a point in a 3-dimensional space. For another example, the state-of-the-art Sentence BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) language model can map a sentence to a 768-dimensional space such that similar sentences are closer to each other in that hyperspace. Thus, multimodal embedding refers to a mapping of an observation that contains different data types to a single point in an N-dimensional space. For example, mapping of a news article containing both text and images to a point in space. You're encountering the term multimodal embedding in image captioning because it involves both images and text.
