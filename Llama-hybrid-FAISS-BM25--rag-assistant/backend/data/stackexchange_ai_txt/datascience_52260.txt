Terminology: "flat geometry" in the context of clustering

Sklearn's documentation refers to "flat" or "non-flat" geometry of clusters to describe the use-cases of their implemented clustering algorithms. Those terms are not directly defined. However, the following quote states: Non-flat geometry clustering is useful when the clusters have a specific shape, i.e. a non-flat manifold, and the standard euclidean distance is not the right metric. So far, I do understand that a manifold type of shape is poorly represented by a cluster centro√Ød and that clustering such dataset should rather rely on local density, nearest neighbors, or connectivity constraint. However, I do not understand how it relates to the concept of flatness according to Wikipedia's definition: In geometry, a flat is a subset of a Euclidean space that is congruent to a Euclidean space of lower dimension. It seems contradictory to me. For instance, a hypersphere is not geometrically flat but would be flat using sklearn's terminology. My questions are then: Are flat and non-flat geometry a legit terminology in machine learning and statistics? If yes, what is the mathematical definition? If no, what is the most appropriate alternative? (e.g. manifold vs convex ???)
