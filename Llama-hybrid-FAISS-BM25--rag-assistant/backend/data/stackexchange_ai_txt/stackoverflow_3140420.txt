Information related to Node in a Database Structure for Tree Data Structure

Imagine you have a tree data Structure in a database like this: Level: id nextlevel desc 1 2 company 2 3 department 3 4 group Nodes: id level parentnode 0 1 null -> the company 1 2 0 -> dep 1 2 2 0 -> dep 2 3 3 2 -> group 1.1 4 3 2 -> group 1.2 I want to store information about every level. That is, information about the company, departments and groups. Â¿How would you do that? I think I could add a column to the Level table where store the table related. The table would be like this: Level: id nextlevel desc table 1 2 company company 2 3 department deparments 3 4 group groups And then create those tables: Company: id level desc etc... 1 1 Acme Company I've been thinking about a better and more elegant solution but I don't find any. Can someone help me? Is this a good solution? Regards.
