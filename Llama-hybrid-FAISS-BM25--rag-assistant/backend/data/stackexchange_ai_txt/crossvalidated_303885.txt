Using PCA to reduce dimensionality of multivariate time series

I have multiple (12000) multivariate time series datasets. Each MTS has 4 dimensions and 3500 time-points. I want to reduce each MTS into a single vector of features using PCA. As far as I've seen, in a lot of cases dataset is reduced using PCA either by dimensions or time points. But not both. Is it possible to do it?
