One solution is car::Anova() . It can take the output from a logistic regression, as well as many other types of model, and recompute it into a type II or III analysis of variance table. In my example above, car::Anova(lm_model) will take a linear or logistic multiple regression and provide an analysis of variance table formatted exactly like the ANOVA result shown in my question, including a main effect estimated across all levels of the covariate(s). This is exactly what I wanted.
