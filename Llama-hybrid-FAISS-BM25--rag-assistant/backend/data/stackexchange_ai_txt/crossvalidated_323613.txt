How to remove trend from estimated variance?

I know the initial and final value of a time series over a year, so I can easily calculate the daily geometric average of the growth over that period. I also have an estimate of the daily variance for that year. But some of the variance will be due to the growth. How should I adjust the estimated variance to remove the effect of growth?
