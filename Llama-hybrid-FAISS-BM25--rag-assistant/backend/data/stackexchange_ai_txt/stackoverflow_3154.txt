Itzik Ben-Gan in DATETIME Calculations, Part 1 (SQL Server Magazine, February 2007) shows three methods of performing such a conversion ( slowest to fastest ; the difference between second and third method is small): SELECT CAST(CONVERT(char(8), GETDATE(), 112) AS datetime) SELECT DATEADD(day, DATEDIFF(day, 0, GETDATE()), 0) SELECT CAST(CAST(GETDATE() - 0.50000004 AS int) AS datetime) Your technique (casting to float ) is suggested by a reader in the April issue of the magazine. According to him, it has performance comparable to that of second technique presented above.
