You want to start working with Oslo. It includes the tools to define the DSL and tools for defining grammars over the DSL. The grammars can either emit an AST or anything else. One kind of output it can generate from the DSL is ia corresponding SQL Server schema. Instances of the DSL can therefore be stored in SQL Server Express (or above). Oslo is part of a larger vision that Microsoft has, but you can ignore that and just get started with the "DSL" part. I recommend you get started and get active in letting Microsoft know what you like and dislike about it. You've got their attention right now, whether you know it or not.
