Wtf is going on your system? You should consider re setting up and pay attention on sane applicaitons and security. However its very likely that you are just running into the max length of command arguments if i am looking at that. If not, well install UTF8 locales and install them as system default. On debian based systems this is usually just a matter of dpkg-reconfigure locales also work on your accept rate.
