EDIT I misinterpreted the original intent of the question, but after reviewing it again, this is an acceptable use case for sessions since it is assumed that the data persistence is only temporary. If you check on the server for the actual session file (assuming file based session storage), the AoA data structure is stored in serialized form, so this would allow the user to navigate other areas of the website and still retain the original state of the color-me-table choices until the session times out. ORIGINAL There are some issues with variable names, namely $col, $column. The $_POST array is checking for an HTML input form variable named "col". However, there are two sections in code referencing a variable named "$column". Since $column doesn't exist, the code inside the if statement block checking for is_nulls never gets executed. I renamed $column to $col and I received the HTML hex color code at the top of the page after the form submission.
