Time Series Analysis- ARIMA interpretation

I have the graphs of ACF and PACF. But I am unable to interpret how to consider whether it is AR(p) or MA(q) or ARIMA. Along with ACF and PACF. ADF and PP test suggests that the data is Stationary. Please Help me. Auto.arima() function suggests two models.But one of my friend suggested that one cannot blindly believe auto.arima() function. [Figure 1 gives information about ACF and PACF of original Data] [Figure 2 gives information about ACF and PACF of differenced with 1] What does these signify?
