How can I interprete ROC-curves? (example inside)

I will be writing an exam in machine learning and am preparing for it. During my studies I encountered ROC-curves but I can't wrap my head around what they actually tell you. I have the following ROC-curves: First of all the x-Axis is false-alarms, the y-Axis is the hits. Now the questions from old exams was to say which of these curves would be better for image recognition for smartphones testing somebody for the ebola-virus/bomb-detector at an airport Intuitively, the first one should have many hits, the second one can have false alarms, since I want to be sure that if there is a bomb, I recognize it. If there is no bomb I still tolerate false alarms, since better be safe than sorry, right? But which of the both curves A and B belong to which statement? What do the curves mean?
