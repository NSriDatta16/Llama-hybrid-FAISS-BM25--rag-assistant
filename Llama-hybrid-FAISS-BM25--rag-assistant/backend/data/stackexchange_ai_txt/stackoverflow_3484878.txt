Tools for getting intent from Twitter statuses?

I am considering a project in which a publication's content is augmented by relevant, publicly available tweets from people in the area. But how could I programmatically find the relevant Tweets? I know that generating a structure representing the meaning of natural language is pretty much the holy grail of NLP, but perhaps there's some tool I can use to at least narrow it down a bit? Alternatively, I could just use hashtags. But that requires more work on behalf of the users. I'm not super familiar with Twitter - do most people use hashtags (even for smaller scale issues), or would relying on them cut off a large segment of data? I'd also be interested in grabbing Facebook statuses (with permission from the poster, of course), and hashtag use is pretty rare on Facebook. I could use simple keyword search to crudely narrow the field, but that's more likely to require human intervention to determine which tweets should actually be posted alongside the content. Ideas? Has this been done before?
