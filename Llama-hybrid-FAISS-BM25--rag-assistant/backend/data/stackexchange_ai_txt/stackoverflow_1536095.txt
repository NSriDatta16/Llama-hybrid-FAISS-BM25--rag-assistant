Have a look at Jeroen Pluimers Sessions at CodeRage 4 called Practical XML in Delphi "Starting with the XML basics, learn about well formed and valid documents, encoding, and recoding and XSD validation. See examples in Delphi for Win32 and Delphi Prism showing you which tool to choose when. Finally, learn where things can go wrong and how to prevent that: improper but well formed XML, copying data between XML documents, convert XML to tables and objects, etc."
