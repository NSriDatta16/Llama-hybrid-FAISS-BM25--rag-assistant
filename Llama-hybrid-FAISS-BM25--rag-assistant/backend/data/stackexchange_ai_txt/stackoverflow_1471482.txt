Mick - in order to do what you want (copy/test), you will simply need to add a constructor to test_type class as well as a non-constructor init_from_globals() (whose code copies the 4 values one by one, the arrays copied in a loop or via memcopy). Add a "diff_from_globals()" method, which again diffs the 4 members individually It's a bit less efficient/elegant than what you wanted as far as implementation, but wrapped in a method, the in-elegance is fully hidden from the rest of the code :)
