How would a Bayesian define a fair coin?

In the frequentist worldview, probabilities are long-run relative frequencies. Hence, a fair coin can be defined as a coin, for which the long run relative frequency of each of the sides approaches 0.5, as the number of flips approaches infinity. Fairness is a quality of the coin, for frequentists. In the Bayesian worldview, probabilities are assessments of event credibilities, made by the subject . One can speak of a specific subject, who believes that heads is as likely as tails for a specific coin. But does it make sense to speak of fairness as being a property of a specific coin, in the Bayesian worldview?
