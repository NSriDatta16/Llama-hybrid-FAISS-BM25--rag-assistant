Fetching LDAP Schema in Java

I'm trying to fetch the schema of an LDAP entity. I've been advised to use Novell's open sourced LDAP library, which seems to be quite good. I found an example called GetAttributeSchema , which sounds really good, but I think I've got a parameter set incorrectly or something. The results I'm getting are: ou ( 2.5.4.11 NAME ( 'ou' 'organizationalUnitName' ) DESC 'Standard LDAP attribute type' SUP 'name' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 X-ORIGIN 'RFC 2256' ) objectClass ( 2.5.4.0 NAME 'objectClass' DESC 'Standard LDAP attribute type' EQUALITY 'objectIdentifierMatch' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 X-ORIGIN 'RFC 2256 (XXX: syntax should be ...38)' ) The results I'm expecting are [something to the effect of]: cn affiliations streetaddress phone fax etc Just wondering if it's obvious to an LDAP expert what I'm missing or what I should be asking for. Thanks! ============================== SOLUTION: ServiceableLDAPConnection lc = takeConnection(); LDAPSchema schema = lc.fetchSchema(lc.getSchemaDN()); Enumeration enumeration = schema.getAttributeNames(); I found this site particularly useful: http://www.go4expert.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4814 ==============================
