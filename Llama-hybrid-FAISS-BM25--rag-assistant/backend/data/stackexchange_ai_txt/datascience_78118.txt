Knowledge Graph as an input to a neural network

I want to create a neural network that takes as an input a knolwedge subgraph(different types of nodes and different types of edges) to predict some properties. For instance an input in the graph can be : :Mike :likes :chocolate; :studies :Biology. Assuming we have n nodes and r relation types. How can I provide this as an input in a neural network and how will the architecture of the neural network look like.
