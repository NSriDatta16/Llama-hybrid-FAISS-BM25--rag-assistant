I think there is a 2 step solution for what you are asking: Identifying the best performing models: paperswithcode is a website with the best performing models for different tasks and different datasets. For any specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis), you can go to the appropriate section in the site, and try to identify a benchmark dataset that is most similar to the scenario you are facing. Once you have identified the appropriate model, you may find pretrained weights for it in different places: In the article associated with the model (which is linked in paperswithcode), the authors may specify that they have released models in a github repo or their lab's web page. In framework-specific repositories, like Tensorflow Hub or Pytorch Hub , there may be released models. In topic-specific libraries, like Huggingface Transformers for NLP, you may find the pretrained model.
