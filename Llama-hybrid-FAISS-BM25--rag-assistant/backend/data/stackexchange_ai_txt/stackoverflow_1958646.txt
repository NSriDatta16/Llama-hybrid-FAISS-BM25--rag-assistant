choosing the right control for developing windows application

I am looking for a contol either listbox or listview to support my requirements. Basically how my application looks is: alt text http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/451/39967846.png The background should be black when the user clicks any 'row' the row should get highlighted witgh grey. The user will have the ability to search items in this control. For example , if one of the row displays 'This is the second Item in this car' If the user searches for Car, that corresponding row(s) should get highlighted with pink. The user should be able to search an item in this contol and specify a number to display the lines below the searched row. For example, if the user Searched for 'car' 5, the rows that have car should get highlighted and their immediate 5 rows. I mean Search Result : car row next row 1 next row 2 next row 3 next row 4 next row 5 car row next row 1 next row 2 next row 3 next row 4 next row 5 The user should be able to drag and drop the files and they should get opened in this 'control' i.e each row should display a new line till the EOF. The user will have the ability to right click on the row, context menu pops up displaying that row item. The contol should be able to display specific text items in a row(s) with different color. Having said these things. I used to program in VC++6, VB6. But using those version now seems not realistic now as I lost touch. But if I have to use the latest 2008 versions, for which I do not have any experience seems scary. So, If you are reading this , and you have got some experience in these fields or using controls that support my requirement, can you please let me know which programming language or IDE and Control should I use to develop this application. PS: the image is made using mspaint and does not represent actual program.
