I'd assume you would want to load the images from the ImageServer via DICOM. This would require a DICOM C-FIND request against the ImageServer to retrieve the list of studies on the ImageServer. You would then need to select a specific study and issue a DICOM C-MOVE request to move the study to your application. Note also that you will need a DICOM Storage SCP application to listen for incoming DICOM associations and your application will have to be configured as a device on the ImageServer. To issue a C-FIND request using the ClearCanvas DICOM library, the following code could be used: StudyRootFindScu findScu = new StudyRootFindScu(); StudyQueryIod queryMessage = new StudyQueryIod(); queryMessage.QueryRetrieveLevel = QueryRetrieveLevel.Study; queryMessage.SetCommonTags(); IList results = findScu.Find("LocalAETitle", "SERVERAE", "localhost", 104, queryMessage); foreach (StudyQueryIod item in results) { string AccessionNumber = item.AccessionNumber; string PatientID = item.PatientId; string Sex = item.PatientsSex; DateTime BirthDate = item.PatientsBirthDate; string StudyName = item.StudyDescription; string PatientName = item.PatientsName; string StudyUID = item.StudyInstanceUid; DateTime StudyDate = item.StudyDate.Value; string Modality = item.Modality; string ReferringPhysiciansName = item.ReferringPhysiciansName; } Note that if you want to "filter" your query, you could set additional tags to match on in the queryMessage. Once you've selected a study from the resuts, to Issue a DICOM C-MOVE request, the following code could be used: string studyInstanceUid = "1.1.1."; // Fill in with the real Study Instance UID ClearCanvas.Dicom.Network.Scu.MoveScuBase moveScu = new ClearCanvas.Dicom.Network.Scu.StudyRootMoveScu("LocalAETitle", "SERVERAE", "localhost", 104, "LocalAETitle"); moveScu.AddStudyInstanceUid(studyInstanceUid); moveScu.Move(); Finally, the ClearCanvas source does have a Storage SCP implementation. I would suggest looking at the file in Trunk\Dicom\Samples\StorageScp.cs. This takes a fair amount of extra code to implement.
