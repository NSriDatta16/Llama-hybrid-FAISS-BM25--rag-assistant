Don't do correlations at all. Do ordinal logistic regressions instead and, if the assumption of proportional odds is really violated, try multinomial logistic. Surely "Quality of life" is the dependent variable and the others are independent. Correlations (of whatever sort) do not treat one variable as the dependent and others as independent - they treat all variables equally. Also, correlations look at the relationship between two variables. Regression lets you control for multiple variables. Ordinal logistic regression is good when the DV is ordinal, but the usual method assumes proportional odds. Although there are models that do not make that assumption - or make it partially - they are relatively little known, so multinomial might be better
