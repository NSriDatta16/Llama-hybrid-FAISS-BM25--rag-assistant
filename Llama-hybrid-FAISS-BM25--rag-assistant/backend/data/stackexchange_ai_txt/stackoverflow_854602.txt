SimpleDB library with joins in Ruby

Is there a Ruby library for Amazon's SimpleDB that can generate joins from Ruby classes? For example, if you define Ruby classes for Game and Ball, and each Game has one Ball, code should be generated that queries for the appropriate Ball given an instance of Game, much in the way ActiveRecord works. RightAWS is the most popular Ruby AWS library I can find, but it doesn't handle this. If there's no library to do it is everyone just doing this manually, or is there an elegant way to generate the right queries?
