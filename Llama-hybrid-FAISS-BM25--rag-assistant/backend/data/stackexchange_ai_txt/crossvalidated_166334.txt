Kernels don't save you the trouble of vectorizing images. In fact, no learning method does. Of course, you can write a wrapper to do this once and be done with it. Kernels do often save you the trouble of identifying a suitable feature space, through the use of the kernel trick. You can find out which kernel function is best in two ways: (i) try different kernels and see what works and (ii) read about what comparable applications have used. The former is most reliable by far, and can be automated using hyperparameter optimization libraries like Optunity . If you want to obtain good representations and learn distinctive features automatically you should have a look at deep learning .
