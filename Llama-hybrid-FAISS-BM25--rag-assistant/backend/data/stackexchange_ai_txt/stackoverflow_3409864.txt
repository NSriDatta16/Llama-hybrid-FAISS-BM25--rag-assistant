I know this question is over a year old, but I was searching trying to remember how I've done it in the past. So for anyone else's reference, the quickest and less complex way then the above link is to override the WndProc function. /* Constants in Windows API 0x84 = WM_NCHITTEST - Mouse Capture Test 0x1 = HTCLIENT - Application Client Area 0x2 = HTCAPTION - Application Title Bar This function intercepts all the commands sent to the application. It checks to see of the message is a mouse click in the application. It passes the action to the base action by default. It reassigns the action to the title bar if it occured in the client area to allow the drag and move behavior. */ protected override void WndProc(ref Message m) { switch(m.Msg) { case 0x84: base.WndProc(ref m); if ((int)m.Result == 0x1) m.Result = (IntPtr)0x2; return; } base.WndProc(ref m); } This will allow any form to be moved by clicking and dragging within the client area.
