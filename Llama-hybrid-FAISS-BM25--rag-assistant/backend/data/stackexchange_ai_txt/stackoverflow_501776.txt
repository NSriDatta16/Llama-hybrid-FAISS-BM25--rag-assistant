Where can I find good programming resources for SharePoint?

I have been trying to find a book or web reference that gives me good understanding on how to build, test, and deploy ASP.NET pages, controls, and web parts to a SharePoint web site. All I have found so far is either draggy-droppy stuff or administration stuff. Is SharePoint really flexible with ASP.NET when is comes to extending it? A series of getting started videos or tutorials would be ideal. Thanks in advance!!
