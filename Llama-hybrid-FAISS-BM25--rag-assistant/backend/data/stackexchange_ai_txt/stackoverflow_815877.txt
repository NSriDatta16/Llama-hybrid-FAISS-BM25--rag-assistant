The click handler isn't being picked up when you append the element to the DOM. Try using jQuery to register the click handler by changing the line(s) that look like: $("#" + placeId + " .actions").append(" Added! Undo ") To $("#" + placeId + " .actions").append(" Added! Undo "); $('#' + placeId + " .actions").find("span:last").find("a").click( function() { undoAddPlace( placeId ); return false; }); You might be able to do it more simply, but it looks like you could be adding more than one span to the paragraph so I went conservative. You could also probably chain off append, but I thought the reselect made the point clearer.
