Is a Foreach loop a type of block?

In thinking about blocks, I've always wondered why the thingers.each { |thing| example is actually interesting (since there's another, built-in way to do it). In most modern languages there's a way to iterate through a collection and apply some inline code to it. But then I thought that maybe the for (Thing thing : things) { syntax is really a type of block, even in languages like Java-sans-Groovy where there are none. So the question is: Is a for-each loop a type of block, albeit with a fixed syntax? Edit: This question is confusing but yet got some attention so I can't delete it. Anyway... by Blocks I mean "closures" and not just code blocks. As far as why I tagged this as language agnostic is that I'm not interested in how a for-each is implemented under-the-hood. I'm more interested in whether, from a programmer's perspective, a for-each could be considered a freebie closure in languages that doesn't have them, like Java.
