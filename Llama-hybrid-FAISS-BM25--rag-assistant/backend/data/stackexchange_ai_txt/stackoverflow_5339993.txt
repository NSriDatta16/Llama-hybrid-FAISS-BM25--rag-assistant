Magento configure a product while comparing

I'd like to add some functionality to the comparing feature Magento offers. When comparing products, users are presented with an 'Add to cart' button. This feature only works well for simple products. When pressing the add to cart button on a configurable or bundled product the user is redirected to the product detail, out of the compare view. Would it not be much better when a user could configure the products inside the compare view?! Do you guys know of a magento plugin that does this trick? Or have ideas how this feature could be implemented in the existing source?
