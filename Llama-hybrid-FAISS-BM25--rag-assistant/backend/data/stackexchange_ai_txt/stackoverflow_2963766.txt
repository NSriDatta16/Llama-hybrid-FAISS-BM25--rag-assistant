The dragon book: Compilers, Principles, Techniques and Tools by Aho, Sethi and Ullman has a chapter (titled Syntax Analysis) which explains a procedure to eliminate left recursion and another procedure to left factor a context free grammar. The resulting grammar is suitable for LL parsing. I suggest you read that chapter in the book and see if you can convert it into code.
