Question regarding notation in Goodfellow's GAN paper

On page 3 of the GAN paper in the caption of Figure 1 there is this expression: $D^{*}(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_{g}(x)}$ where $p_{data}$ is the distribution of the training data and $p_{g}$ is the distribution of the generator. What is the difference between $p_{data}(x)$ and $p_{data}$ ? Does $D^{*}(x)$ equate to a scalar? Thanks!
