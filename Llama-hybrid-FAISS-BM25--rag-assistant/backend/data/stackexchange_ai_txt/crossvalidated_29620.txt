I think this does depend very much on what discipline you want to go into. Everyone needs the basics, Understand the normal distribution and the binomial. Learn the basics of hypothesis testing and interval estimation. Understand the difference between parametric and nonparametric inference. Learn the simple nonparametric test (sign test and Wilcoxon). In the medical research field survival analysis, relative risk and contingency table analysis become important. For business time series analysis is important and survey sampling for marketing.
