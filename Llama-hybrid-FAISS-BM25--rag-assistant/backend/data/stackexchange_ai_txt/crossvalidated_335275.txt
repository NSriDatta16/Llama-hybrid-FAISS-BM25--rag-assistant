Recurrent Neural Networks are quite well suited for this job. Let's say we have an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with 1 layer and 128 hidden units. Instead of predicting price at t+1 based on ohlc data, and then t+2 based on ohlc data up until t in addition to the output of t+1, you can use a dense layer to map those 128 hidden units to, let's say, 48 dense outputs, where 48 is the number of hours we want to predict. I am using this approach with a pretty good success rate in terms of accuracy.
