Have you added the Activity to your manifest? Also your call to StartActivity() looks off. Here is how I am familiar with launching a new Activity Intent i = new Intent(this, NextActivity.class); startActivity(i); Edit: It's come to my attention you likely were not having difficulty with Explicitly launching an Activity . Sorry!
