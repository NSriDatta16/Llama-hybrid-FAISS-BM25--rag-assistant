Whilst Sachin's answer is probably the best solution you should be aware that the table will still continue to use the storage space for the deleted column until you rebuild the clustered index . For that reason it would be quite nice if there was some explicit convert syntax that could be run to, for example, change an 8 byte datetime column to an 8 byte bigint column but AFAIK none exists. An alternative would be to use SSMS to generate the script for you. This will generate a script that rebuilds the whole table. If you have a large table or many NCIs the blocking overhead of this may well be unacceptable however.
