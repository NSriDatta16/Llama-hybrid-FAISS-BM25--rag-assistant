Having your server in between the end user and the storage, is probably a good idea. Whenever I let users direct access to storage places, with FTP or SSH, it tends to get really messy. A place where you can upload files, that get accessible from the web, is used for all sorts of things. Having your server in between you can organise the files uploaded into some rational structure. A folder per date for instance, and perhaps also enforce some strict naming of the files themselves, avoiding URL encoding problems etc.
