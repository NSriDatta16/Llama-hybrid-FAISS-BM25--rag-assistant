Without knowing the context in which the classes are organized its hard to tell you the right solution. Depending on that, you could just do a: return new Foo($this->Foo_Id); The code which is calling the "save" method will get an instance of Foo. From the outside this could look like: befor: $instance->save($ID); $instance->methodFromClassFoo(); # Instance would be now of class foo. (which btw. is really bad design. after: $foo = $instance->save($ID); $foo->methodFromClassFoo(); or even: $instance = $instance->save($ID); // Instance is now instance of foo. $instance->methodFromClassFoo(); maybe this helps you.
