Devpartner Instrumentation for Code coverage causing linker errors

So I've got a Visual studio 2005 solution that contains a C# project (test driver - creates exe) and 7 C++ Projects (dll's). This solution builds fine up to this point. I have DevPartner studio 8.2 installed. I am trying to generate test coverage on the entire solution which requires me to instrument native c++ code during builds. when I turn this DevPartner option on, the build produces linker errors. Does anyone have experience with this? For example: Error 25 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall IntLong::IntLong(class BufObjBase *,int,int,unsigned char,wchar_t const *,bool)" (??0IntLong@@QAE@PAVBufObjBase@@HHEPB_W_N@Z) X.obj
