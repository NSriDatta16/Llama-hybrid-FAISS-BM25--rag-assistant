change monodevelop f# file order

I have started using MonoDevelop for F# on a Mac. It's pretty cool, except for the fact that it crashes quite a lot. One thing that is bothering me is that I can't change the order of the F# source files in a project. Is this possible? It will make organising projects a bit of a nightmare if it isn't.
