Stat Sig Testing in Bayesian A/B/C+ Context

I'm trying to teach myself bayesian a/b/c+ (more than 2 variations) testing and working my way through https://github.com/raffg/multi_armed_bandit/tree/master as an example. My question is this: in a bayesian test of proportion with more than 2 variants, is there a pretty standard approach for evaluating the statistical significance of the difference between their posts? Can anyone point to a repo where I can see such stat sig eval for >2 variants in action? I have seen the 2-variant eval used here: https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/4/25/bayesian-ab-testing and I also understand how Google's potential value remaining approach would help you decide when to stop running the test. However, I'm not sure what else one should do, if anything, to monitor stat sig when there are more than 2 test branches to evaluate. Thanks for any advice.
