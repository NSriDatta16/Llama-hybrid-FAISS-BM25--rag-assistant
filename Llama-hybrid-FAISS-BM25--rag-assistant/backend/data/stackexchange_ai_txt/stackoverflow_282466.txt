Another option that I have been using is to use JkDefrag which is free. There is also a whole process on defragging a virtual PC, but since I can't find the "official" link in the JkDefrag forum, it goes something like this for command line parameters: Defrag the guest drive from within the virtual machine. Exit the virtual machine. On the host machine, run JkDefrag with these command lines (you can also put them in a batch file): jkDefrag -q -a2 jkDefrag -q -a6 C:\PathToVirtualDisks\VDiskToDefrag.vhd jkDefrag -q -a3 -e C:\PathToVirtualDisks\VDiskToDefrag.vhd Here's what the parameters do: -q = Quit the program when finished. -a2 = Defragment, don't optimize. -a6 = Move to end of disk -a3 = Defragment, fast optimize. The process can take a long time depending on the size of your virtual disk. As an example, on my PC with a 56GB vdisk it takes about 16-18 hours to complete this process on really badly fragmented days. As a matter of fact, as I write this I have 150+ fragments of that file being defragmented and it's been running for about 30 minutes and it's only about 10% done with just that file.
