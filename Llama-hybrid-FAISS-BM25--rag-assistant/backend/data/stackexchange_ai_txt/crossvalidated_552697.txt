Please help me understand a sentence in Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"

The sentence is in section 1.5.1 "Minimizing the misclassification rate" (page 39), underlined in red: The author thinks this statement is "clear", but I just can't understand. Can you please help me understand it, preferably in rigorous math derivation? Thank you.
