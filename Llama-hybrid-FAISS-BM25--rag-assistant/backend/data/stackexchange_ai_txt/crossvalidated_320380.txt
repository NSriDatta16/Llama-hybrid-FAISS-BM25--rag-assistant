Is it a good idea to transform a sequence classification problem into simple classification problem with this way?

I am having a dataset under this form: It is to be known that this is an ordered structure of data. In other words, custommer 11676 bought item 3297 ,rated it then bought item 776 and rated it. Based on the user's historical records of bought items and ratings,we want to predict the rating of the next item. This is to my knowledge a kind of sequence classification problem.( Can somebody confirm?) What I did so far is to transform the dataset into the following form: Custommer Item1 Item2 Item3 ... ItemN Actual_Item Target 11676 rating1 rating2 rating3 0 2310 1 To be more precise here is an example based on the 2 first lines from the screenshot above: Custommer Item3297 Item776 Item684 ActualItem Target 11676 0 0 0 3297 1 11676 1 0 0 776 1 11676 1 1 0 684 1 If an item haven't been bought by the custommer, I simply put 0 in its rating(assuming that this number isn't used for the ratings) I did this transformation mainly to be able to use classical classification algorithms(decision trees, svm ,multinomial naive bayes etc....) Is this a good way to transform a sequence classification problem into a simple classification problem?
