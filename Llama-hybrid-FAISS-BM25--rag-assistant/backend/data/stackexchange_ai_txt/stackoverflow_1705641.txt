How to give users a file storage limit?

I'm working on a web application right now using Rails and wanted to see if anyone knew of a good way to keep track of file storage limits? We want to give users a specific amount of room that they can use to upload files and we are using paperclip for storage on Amazon S3. Any thoughts? Thanks
