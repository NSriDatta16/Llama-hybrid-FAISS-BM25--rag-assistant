R comes with a lot of datasets, and it looks like it would not be a big deal to reproduce most of the examples you cited with few lines of code. You may also find the mlbench package useful, in particular synthetic datasets starting with mlbench.* . Some illustrations are given below. You will find additional examples by looking at the Cluster Task View on CRAN. For example, the fpc package has a built-in generator for "face-shaped" clustered benchmark datasets ( rFace ). Similar considerations apply to Python, where you will find interesting benchmark tests and datasets for clustering with the scikit-learn . The UCI Machine Learning Repository hosts a lot of datasets as well, but you're better off simulating data yourself with the language of your choice.
