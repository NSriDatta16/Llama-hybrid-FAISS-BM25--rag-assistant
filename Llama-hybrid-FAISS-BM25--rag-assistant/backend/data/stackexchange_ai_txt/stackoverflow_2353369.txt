The .NET/VS settings framework already does exactly what you indicate that you're trying to do, without the clumsy runtime casts and generic classes. Absent a very compelling reason not to use it, that is what you should use. It already handles persisted user-level settings. If for some reason you absolutely cannot use that, either store the settings directly in a file somewhere in the user's AppData, or use Isolated Storage . You will have to write your own persistence model for it. If an application could rewrite its own executable code on disk , it would raise all sorts of thorny questions about security and reliability. Besides, security restrictions on Vista and Windows 7 would prevent it from functioning correctly anyway - unless it's a ClickOnce app, it's probably installed in a program folder (i.e. Program Files), and you'd need a user with administrative privileges to elevate the process in order to make it work.
