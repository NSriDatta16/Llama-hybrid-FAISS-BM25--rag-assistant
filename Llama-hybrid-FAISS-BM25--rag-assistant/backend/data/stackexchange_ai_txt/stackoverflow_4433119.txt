Safari multiple hashtags

I recently tested my site on Safari and for some odd reason it only reads the first hashtag in the url http://www.mangamanga.com/mangaReader.php#mangaNo=3%23chapterNo=8%23pageNo=1 while in all the other browsers it looks like this http://www.mangamanga.com/mangaReader.php#mangaNo=3#chapterNo=8#pageNo=1 could someone please explain why this is happening.
