This is a well-known property of k-means. The initialization is usually randomized , so you might even get (and in fact, intend to get) different results for multiple runs. It is a common best practise with k-means to run it multiple times, and choose the one with the minimum average distances (or by some other internal metric). DBSCAN is mostly order independent. Only for fringe points that could belong to two different clusters, the cluster assignment is not stable (unless you extend DBSCAN to support multi-assignments or use some other stable tie-braking rule). In general, it actually is even a good idea to shuffle your dataset before doing any kind of analysis. Say your method fails completely, and returns the data set in its original order. If the data was sorted before, the output will look meaningful. So always shuffle your data.
