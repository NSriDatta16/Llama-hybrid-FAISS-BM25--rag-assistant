BERT : text classification and feature extractionn

I have tried multi-label text classification with BERT. Here is the sample input: $15.00 hour, customer service, open to industries One of the labels is Billing_rate and prediction score looks quite good. Now my question is if I want to extract $15.00 hour basically feature value out of BERT. Can you please suggest what are my next step options?
