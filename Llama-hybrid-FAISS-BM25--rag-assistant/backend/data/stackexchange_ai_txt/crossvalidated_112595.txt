What are the most popular artificial neural network algorithms for recognising the content of images?

What are the most used/popular artificial neural network algorithms for recognising the content of images in general? E.g. If the picture is of a person, dog, cat or a car. If the picture is a landscape, indoor or some banner or advert. etc. I've heard of backpropagation algorithm so far.
