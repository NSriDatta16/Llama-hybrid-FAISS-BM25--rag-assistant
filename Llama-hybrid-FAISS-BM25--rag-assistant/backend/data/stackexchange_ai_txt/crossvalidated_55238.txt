If you are new to the scoring world, your first book should be by naeem siddiqi on credit scoring using SAS. If you have not taken the class go for it. The class main focus is the overall understanding of scoring and selling SAS enterprise miner for millions of dollars. If you need theory you need a categorical data analysis and Data mining class from a near by university. Even after taking these classes you will still need help. currently the most popular techniques used are logistic regression neural networks support vector machines and random forests clustering, discriminant analysis, factor analysis, principal components are a must as well. Credit scoring by elizabeth mays will also give you a good overview. I also took a credit risk modeling class by SAS institute, which helped me a little. It is a constant learning process and its never done. Bayesian folks like their methods as well. Edit i also forgot to mention. Logistic regression in the most popular technique out there and will always be the one that banks will continue to use. Other methods are very difficult to sell to the upper management people, unless your bank is willing to care less about understanding these methods and their focus remains risk taking and money making.
