I'm not sure if I understand what you're trying to do with the conditional logit model. You write that you want to "know whether there are differences between points that are scored as a consequence of an intra-team pass (1) or a steal/rebound (0)". Assuming that the key variable is the "points scored", one way to analyze this is to do a logistic regression using pass/steal/rebound as the dependent variable and the key variable as an independent variable. Another way is to do a Poisson regression using the key variable as the dependent variable and pass/steal/rebound as an independent variable. This seems preferable to me provided that the key variable (again, assuming that this represents points scored) conditioned on pass/steal/rebound approximately follows a Poisson distribution. Now what about the control variables? If you do a logistic regression you have to omit them because they don't tell you anything about the probability of the dependent variable being a pass or a steal/rebound since they are only recorded in for the last category. But if you do a poisson regression, you can use them even if all values for passes are missing. The trick is to create interaction terms between the pass category and the control variables that will be equal to the control variables for those in the pass category and 0 for the other category: passXcontrol1 And now, you can do the poisson regression: model The estimated coefficients for the interaction terms will tell you the effect of the control variables on the key variable in steals/rebounds, and the effect of being a pass compared to steal/rebound will be estimated with the pass variable.
