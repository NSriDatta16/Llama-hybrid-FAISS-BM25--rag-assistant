Delayed Job not processed in rspec

I am trying to run rspecs for a custom delayed job (GetPage::GetPageJob), but I have a problem. When I run them, the jobs are well enqueued (that is to say, well inserted in the delayed_jobs table), but they are not processed by the job worker. Indeed, after launching "rake jobs:work RAILS_ENV=test" in a first terminal, and after running the specs in a second terminal, I don't see any output from the job worker in the first terminal. On the other hand, the jobs are well processed if I enqueue them via "script/console test". So I'm a bit confused. With both the specs and the script/console, the line I use to enqueue my jobs is : Delayed::Job.enqueue GetPage::GetPageJob.new("http://cnn.com") Any idea ?
