Yes you can. For example, R enables you to use logistic regression with three kinds of data For the binomial and quasibinomial families the response can be specified in one of three ways: As a factor: ‘success’ is interpreted as the factor not having the first level (and hence usually of having the second level). As a numerical vector with values between 0 and 1 , interpreted as the proportion of successful cases (with the total number of cases given by the weights). As a two-column integer matrix: the first column gives the number of successes and the second the number of failures. All the three ways of storing data are equivalent, so it is just a matter of interface. Notice however that for second way you need not only the proportion, but also the sample size. This also may not be possible if you use other software that does not allow for providing the data in such form. However, if you want to model outcomes between 0 and 1 that are not proportions with sample size given, you should rather consider other approaches e.g. beta regression as noticed by @Alex .
