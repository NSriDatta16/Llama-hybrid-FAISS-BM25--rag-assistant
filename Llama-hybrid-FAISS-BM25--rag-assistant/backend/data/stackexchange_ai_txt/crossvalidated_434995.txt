what do you mean of compare?please explain a bit more about whole your goal in this problem,and describe it. but ti hope this help you your data set is a panel data.it means you have cross-section and time series together. and there are a lot of information about panel data on the internet. but depends on how many years you have and your variables are in the same years or not,do you have missing values or not ,, approaches can be different. but almost every test in a crosssection dataset have an adapted version for panel data too.
