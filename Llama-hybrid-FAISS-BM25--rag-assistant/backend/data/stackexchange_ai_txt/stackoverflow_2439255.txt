Min/Max across an array of objects

It has been done to death pretty much, here on SO and around the 'Net. However I was wondering if there was a way to leverage the standard min/max functions of: Array.max = function(array) { return Math.max.apply(Math, array); }; Array.min = function(array) { return Math.min.apply(Math, array); }; So I can search across an array of objects of say: function Vector(x, y, z) { this.x = x; this.y = y; this.z = z; } var ArrayVector = [ /* lots of data */ ]; var min_x = ArrayVector.x.min(); // or var max_y = ArrayVector["y"].max(); Currently I have to loop through the array and compare the object values manually and craft each one to the particular need of the loop. A more general purpose way would be nice (if slightly slower).
