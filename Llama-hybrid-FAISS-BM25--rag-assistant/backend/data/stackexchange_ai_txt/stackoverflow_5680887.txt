Dynamically load a and sort into columns of 5 rows

Ok so I thought i would put this one out there. I have a list of 25 entries in my db which I would like to display on my page, in list form, in 5 columns with 5 rows. I prepared a solution, albeit not such an elegant one. "; $counter = 1; while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { if ($counter {$row["name"]} "; $counter = $counter + 1; if ($counter == 6) { echo " "; } } elseif($counter > 5 && $counter "; } echo " {$row["name"]} "; $counter += 1; if ($counter == 11) { echo " "; } } elseif($counter > 10 && $counter "; } echo " {$row["name"]} "; $counter += 1; if ($counter == 16) { echo " "; } } elseif($counter > 15 && $counter "; } echo " {$row["name"]} "; $counter += 1; if ($counter == 21) { echo " "; } } elseif($counter > 20 && $counter "; } echo " {$row["name"]} "; $counter += 1; if ($counter == 26) { echo " "; } } } ?> This will Output the following Belfast Birmingham Brighton Bristol Cambridge Cardiff Carlisle Edinburgh Glasgow Hull Lancaster Leeds Leicester Liverpool London Manchester Newcastle Norwich Nottingham Oxford Plymouth Portsmouth Southampton Swansea York Does anybody know of a better way of doing this? I'm still new to php, and I kbnow there must be a better, neater way of doing this.
