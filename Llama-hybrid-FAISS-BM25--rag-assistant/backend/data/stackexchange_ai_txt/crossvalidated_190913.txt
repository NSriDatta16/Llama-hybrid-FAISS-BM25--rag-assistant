How to determine if independent variables in multiple logistic regression model are independent or not?

I am trying a multiple logistic regression model. But I am suspicious that one of my independent variables is dependent on another. I wonder how to prove that the independent variables are truly independent? There are previous findings suggesting they have a positive correlation. But in my research I have found no correlation between them.
