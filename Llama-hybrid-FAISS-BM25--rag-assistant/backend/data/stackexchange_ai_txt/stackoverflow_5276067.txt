XtraGrid does not provide a built in functionality to show column header captions this way. However, this can be done within the CustomDrawColumnHeader event handler. We have posted a tutorial showing how this can be done. By default, it should be located at: C:\Users\Public\Documents\DevExpress 2010.2 Demos\Components\WinForms\XtraGrid\CS\GridTutorials\GridVerticalHeaders NOTE, as this feature is implemented using custom draw. It means that this text is only painted this way. Custom drawn text won't be exported or printed.
