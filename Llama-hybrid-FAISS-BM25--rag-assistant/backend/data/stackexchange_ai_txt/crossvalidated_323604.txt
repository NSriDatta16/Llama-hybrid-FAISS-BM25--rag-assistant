The idea is to have an estimate of he support of the (unknown) probability distribution from which the samples have been obtained. Concretely, you would like to have a threshold, $\delta$, so that only you only consider points which are not too unlikely to be encountered. Now, how can we express it in a geometrical sense?. Given a set of i.i.d. samples, you find the smallest enclosing hypersphere that contains those points (because you consider them to be "OK" points) allowing for some outliers/errors (soft margin SVM). The formulation in the primal is, $$ \text{min}_{R,c,\xi} \text{ }R^{2} + \frac{1}{\nu l} \sum_{i}^{l} \xi_{i} $$ subject to, $$ || \phi(x_{i})-c||^{2} \leq R^{2} + \xi_{i}, \xi_{i} \ge 0 $$ where $R$ is the radius of the sphere, and $\nu \in (0,1)$, and $c$ is the center of the sphere. There is another paper by those same authors where it is explained in more detail and more clearly ( Estimating the support of a high-dimensional distribution ).
