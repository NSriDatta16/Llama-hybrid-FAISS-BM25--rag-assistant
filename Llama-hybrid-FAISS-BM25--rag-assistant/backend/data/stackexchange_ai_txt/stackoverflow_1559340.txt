I find Maven's bootstrap build funny: build Maven to build Maven. Note that it is possible to build Maven with Maven already installed but I'm not sure this build shows a wide features set usage. From this point of view, JBoss AS might already be a better example, but not the "best" (if this has a sense). Actually, I like XWiki 's build (Vincent Massol is working there). Or Exo Platform 's one (Arnaud Heritier is working there). I'm pretty sure XWiki and Exo Platform are good examples as their respective build manager have a deep knowledge of Maven (as more or less active maven committers): these build are full of best practices, show the right way to do things, have a clean modules organization, etc. In other words, they are representative of the "state of the art" with Maven.
