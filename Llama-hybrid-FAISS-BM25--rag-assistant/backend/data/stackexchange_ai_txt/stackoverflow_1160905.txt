c# excel 2007 print preview ribbon

is it possible from c# to add some groups, buttons,... to excel-2007's print preview ribbon... why? i wanted to put some images on that ribbon so that user by selecting the image will be able to put it on a sheet (where ever on that sheet by dragging it) and print it with that sheet... many thanks!
