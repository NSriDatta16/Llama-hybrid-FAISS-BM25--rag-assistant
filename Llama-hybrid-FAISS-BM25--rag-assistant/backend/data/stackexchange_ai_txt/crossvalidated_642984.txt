Long-run average cost for uniform distribution

The lifetime of a device is a continuous random variable having the continuous uniform distribution $\mathrm{Unif}(0,15)$ . Suppose that under an age replacement strategy a planned replacement at age $T=12$ costs 300 dollars, while a failure replaced at time $X costs 350 dollars. Determine the long-run average cost per unit time My attempt so far: For $\mathrm{Unif}(0,15)$ we have $f(x) = \frac{1}{15}$ for $0 \leq x \leq 15$ and so $P(X and long-run average cost = $P(X (cost before T) + $(1-P(X (cost at T) = $\frac{4}{5}\cdot300 + \frac{1}{5}\cdot350 = 340$ Please let me know if I am doing this correctly, and feel free to correct me if I am wrong
