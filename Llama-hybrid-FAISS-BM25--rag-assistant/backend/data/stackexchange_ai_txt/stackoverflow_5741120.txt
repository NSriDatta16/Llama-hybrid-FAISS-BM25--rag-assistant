Running Pig query over data stored in Hive

I would like to know how to run Pig queries stored in Hive format. I have configured Hive to store compressed data (using this tutorial http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/CompressedStorage ). Before that I used to just use normal Pig load function with Hive's delimiter (^A). But now Hive stores data in sequence files with compression. Which load function to use? Note that don't need close integration like mentioned here: Using Hive with Pig , just what load function to use to read compressed sequence files generated by Hive. Thanks for all the answers.
