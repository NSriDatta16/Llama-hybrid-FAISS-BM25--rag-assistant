I would try to organize the folder structure of the files before simply just dumping it into a subversion repository. I think your problem mainly lies in the disorganization of the existing files. If you can find a way to logically divide up your system into segments, then it would be easier to allow people to only check out chunks of files(which would be in logical groupings). Subversion really mirrors a filesystem, so if it doesn't look pretty in a filesystem, it won't look pretty in subversion either. If you want to avoid reorganizing files, perhaps you can find a version control system that lets you check in/out things based on tags, instead of where they are in the file system.
