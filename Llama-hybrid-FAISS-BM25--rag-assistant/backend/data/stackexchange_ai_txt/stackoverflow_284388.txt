Is there a test runner for .NET tests that can run multi-threaded to take advantage of multi-core machines?

I'm setting up CI at present using Thoughtworks Studios' Cruise, Gallio to run xunit.net fact/tests, and ncover 2 to do code-coverage. I noticed that running the code-coverage pegs one of the four CPUs that our build-agent server has, and wondered whether there was a multi-threaded test-runner that I might use instead, to take advantage of the other 3 cores that are sat idle? I had a quick search around, but most hits are in reference to testing multi-threaded code, not multi-threaded test running...
