I am pretty sure the question you are asking is: So, I have to create an extra entity in my model .xcdatamodel? And the answer is YES. You need a third "OrderItem" entity. Just as you have described: An order item has exactly one order and one item. The orders have many order items and items are used by many order items. Order > OrderItem Item The quantity attribute goes in the OrderItem entity. This does not mean you are creating an extra table . If you are using SQLite for storage, Core Data would use an additional table for the many-to-many relationship anyway. Typically with Core Data you will design and use a data model that meets your needs. You should not think about it in terms of SQL or tables. In fact, it does not even have to use SQL for storage.
