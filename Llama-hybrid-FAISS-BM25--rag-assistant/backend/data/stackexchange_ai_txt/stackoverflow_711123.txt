MySQL query: How to calculate the average of values in a row?

The AVG() function calculates column-means but how can I retrieve the mean of several values in the same row like so: SELECT MEAN(A.a, A.b, ... , A.n) FROM A; EDIT: sure, as cherouvim suggests I can do: SELECT MEAN(A.a + A.b + ... + A.n) / n FROM A; but I'm trying to find out if there's a leaner way.
