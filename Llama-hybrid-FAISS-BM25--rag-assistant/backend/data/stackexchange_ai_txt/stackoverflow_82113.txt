Do Delphi class vars have global or thread local storage?

My guess is that class variables ("class var") are truly global in storage (that is, one instance for the entire application). But I am wondering whether this is the case, or whether they are thread in storage (eg similar to a "threadvar") - once instance per thread. Anyone know? Edit: changed "scope" to "storage" as this is in fact the correct terminology, and what I am after (thanks Barry)
