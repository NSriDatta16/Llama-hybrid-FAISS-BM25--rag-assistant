It depends on the nature of your site. I happen to work on a bit of software where IP tracking is important, and within a field consumed by parter sites I'd guess some 20% - 40% of requests are either detectably spoofed IPs or headers blanked out, depending on the time of day and where they came from. For a site which gets organic traffic (i.e. not through partners) I'd expect a much higher ratio of good IPs. As Kosi said, be careful what you're doing with this - IPs are in no way a reliable way to identify unique visitors.
