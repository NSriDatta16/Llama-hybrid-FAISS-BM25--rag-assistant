The analysis of @bzki (+1) seems reasonable. A brief Bayesian analysis might begin by noticing that you have seen 16 skeletons with periostitis out of 84 skeletons at nearby sites. So a reasonable posterior distribution of the rate $\lambda$ might be $\mathsf{Gamma}(\text{shape}=16,\, \text{rate}=84),$ which has mean $0.190$ and puts 95% of its probability in $(0.109, 0.295).$ In R: qgamma(c(.025,.975), 16, 84) [1] 0.1088736 0.2945264 So you should not be surprised to see no instances of periostitis at a site with only five skeletons.
