Add centered text to the middle of a horizontal rule

I'm wondering what options one has in xhtml 1.0 strict to create a line on both sides of text like-so: Section one ----------------------- Next section ----------------------- Section two I've thought of doing some fancy things like this: Next section Or alternatively, because the above has problems with alignment (both vertical and horizontal): Next section This also has alignment problems, which I solve with this mess: &nbsp; Next section &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to the alignment problems, both options feel 'fudgy', and I'd be much obliged if you happened to have seen this before and know of an elegant solution.
