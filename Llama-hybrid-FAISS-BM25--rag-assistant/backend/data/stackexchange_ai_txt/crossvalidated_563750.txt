It's tricky to answer this question because you'd have to be much clearer on what you mean by I am already convinced that there is a causal relationship between the two , but let's assume God came down to earth and told you that there is a causal relationship between A and B . In this case, because it's time-series data, if it's possible to identify which one happens before the other, we can say that the one who happened earlier caused the other, since cause always preceding effect in time is a fairly accepted assumption. However, according to your description, it's possible that you can not identify which one happened first. Granger causality won't help you here, since it's not even able to identify a causal relationship. The causality in its name is pretty unfortunate, according to Granger himself. Jonas Peters has done some work on this topic and I think a good reading for you is this paper of his: Detecting the direction of causal time series . They fit an autoregressive moving average model and investigate noise to identify ordering of the causal relationship.
