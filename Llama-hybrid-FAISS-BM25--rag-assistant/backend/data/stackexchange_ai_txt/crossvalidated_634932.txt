Wikipedia uses the term "geometric data analysis" but I find that the page hardly scratches the surface, and the examples given seem hodge-podge to me. Let me provide a template for how you might progress into this subject. Basic An excellent starting point is Euclidean geoemtry . A really basic description is a Euclidean distance matrix and an angle matrix, and plot them as heatmaps. You can start with plotting the univariate and bivariate plots that seem appropriate to the domain. Parallel axis plots can also be your friend if you want to visually learn about the distances and angles in relation to the original variables. Intermediate Learn what a metric space is so that you understand the general notion of distance. You can readily generalize your notion of "angle" using inner product spaces .See dot product and generalizations . Hilbert spaces are a good case study of this abstraction which has applications in physics. Some of the classic correlation coefficients can be interpreted as such angles. It can be helpful to think of correlation as an angle which is the approach Aguste Bravais took before Galton or Pearson. Correlation is usually thought of as a relationship between two variables, however Seilis 2022 discusses "correlations" as angles between more general subspaces and cites some related literature. With that generalization of distance and angle, you can repeat the basics I suggested above. Advanced Geometry in a modern mathematical sense geometry is generalized to transformational invariance. There is a lot of history there even though the subject is only a few hundred years old (breaking news compared to Euclidean geometry). An interesting inflection point is the Erlangen program . I recommend Bronstein et al 2021 for a nice introduction to some of the history and basic version of the math, and further discussion of geometry in relation to innovations in deep learning. The abstract task becomes uncovering the transformational invariants (AKA symmetries) of a latent manifold for which your data is assumed to be a noisy sampling from. This requires mathematical modelling and is sometimes enhanced by machine learning in which you wish to approximate an unknown shape. A special case that I recommend is discrete differential geometry. I have been working my way through Discrete Differential Geometry - CMU 15-458/858 . I have benefited from combining what I have learned about curvature in that course with statistics. Warning Some data sets have interesting geometry, but many don't. Many data sets can be seen as samples from roughly-elliptical or a union of roughly-elliptical shapes. Learn this stuff either because you enjoy it or because you have a data set that seems to have some interesting property that seems related to geometry. But don't expect it to revolutionize how you conduct data analysis in most cases.
