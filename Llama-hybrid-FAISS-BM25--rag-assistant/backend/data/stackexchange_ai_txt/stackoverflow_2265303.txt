Splitting up a string, based on predicate

I want to split up a string, based on a predicate. As an example: "ImageSizeTest" should become "Image Size Test" Note: Uppercased character is the predicate Of course I could write a simple loop, going through the string, check for uppercased characters (the predicate) and build the new string. However I want this to be a bit more general, splitting up based on any predicate. Still not very hard to implement, but I was wondering if there is an elegant way to do this using Linq .
