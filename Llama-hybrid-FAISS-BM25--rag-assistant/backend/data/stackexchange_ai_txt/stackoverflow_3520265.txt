To add to your benefit of reading writing by location, the additional benefit are. Pros Indexing Indexing the text with full text indexing that can give searching benefits. Ofcourse the size of database will probably be more then the conventional file sizes. But you have benefit in terms of performance because database system will have only one file handle open, and it will do caching and will improve performance and cause less fragmentation. Lock/Performance Opening/closing multiple files will put little more overhead in terms of performance because each open/close requires access control check and locking. Replication Replication benefits, if you put them in mysql, mysql replication is easy to setup and you can keep multiple backups easily. Maintanence Transfering, maintaining and querying database will be much easier then in terms of files. Cons File Browser Access You can not access files through explorer or normal file system api, you will need some sort of access api probably REST based api or some viewer that can read the database. You can check my blog about more detailed analysis.
