Estimating mass proportions from fractional samples

Say you are on a beach that is composed of a mixture of different colored sands (for simplicity, black and white) and you wish to estimate how much there is of each type. You have a bucket that you can use to take samples of the sand and a technique to separate the different types and weigh them. Say also that the beach is not too big, so you know the fractional amount of sand in your bucket samples compared to the total sand on the beach. Let the true fractional portion of white sand on the beach be called $w^*$, and therefore (in this two-type case) the true amount of black sand be $(1 - w^*)$. Our bucket samples give weights $\{w_i\} = w_1, w_2, â€¦, w_n$. I'd like to estimate the distribution of $w^*$ given my measurements $\{w_i\}$. Assume the sand is iid uniformly at random across the beach and that the bucket samples are taken without replacement. Can anyone give me some direction on how to model this problem? I would ultimately like to generalize to more than two types of sand, but the two-type case, even with just a single sample, should at least get me started. I began trying to consider the sampling as a Bernoulli process, but I ran into trouble with understanding how to deal with the non-integer nature of the samples: i.e., the measurement values are continuous-valued masses, rather than some sort of count.
