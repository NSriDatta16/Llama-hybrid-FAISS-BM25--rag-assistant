There may be a philosophical issue whether a $0$ success probability makes sense. For such a problem, one could use a Bayesian credible interval that gives an upper bound on the success probability $\theta,$ based on a sequence of say $n = 50$ or $n = 500$ failures in a row. Suppose your prior distribution is that $\theta$ is small: $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(1, 10)$ and density $f(\theta) \propto (1-\theta)^9.$ Then after $n=50$ trials with $x=0$ successes, the binomial likelihood is $g(x|\theta) \propto (1-\theta)^{50}.$ Thus, the posterior density is $(1-\theta)^9\times (1-\theta)^{50}$ and the posterior distribution on $\theta$ is $\mathsf{Beta}(1,60),$ which gives a one-sided 95% posterior interval estimate of $(0, 0.049).$ [Using R.] qbeta(.95, 1, 60) [1] 0.04870291 Similarly, with $n = 500$ consecutive failures, the 95% Bayesian posterior interval estimate would be that $\theta qbeta(.95, 1, 510) [1] 0.005856767 Note: If you approach this problem without any opinion as to the value of $\theta,$ then you might use the non-informative Jeffries prior $\mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5).$ Then 95% Bayesian credible intervals for $50$ and $500$ consecutive failures, respectively, results would be as shown in R below (rounded to five places). round(qbeta(c(.025,.975), .5, 50.5),6) [1] 0.000010 0.048758 round(qbeta(c(.025,.975), .5, 500.5),6) [1] 0.000001 0.005009
