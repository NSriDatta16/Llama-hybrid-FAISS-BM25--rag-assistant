delete mapping from edmx

In the edmx file I deleted some of the properties because I don't want to add them to the POCO object, but each time I get that kind of exception: Error 1 Error 3023: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 255:Column COMPANY.contact_phone_number in table COMPANY must be mapped: It has no default value and is not nullable. Why do I need map those columns if they don't have default values and are not nullable??
