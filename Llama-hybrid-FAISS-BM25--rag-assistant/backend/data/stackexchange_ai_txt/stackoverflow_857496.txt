Netbeans uses the Sun Wireless Toolkit. The JavaME emulator it contains can me made into a touchscreen emulator. Read the accompanying documentation, it should be as simple as setting a variable inside a configuration file before stating the emulator. You can find the specification for MIDP (the top layer of the JavaME platform you're probably targetting) at http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=118 Look at the javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas class, you will find several methods used to deal with "pointer". While they are more often used to handle touchscreen event, they also map to mouse/joystick clicks on emulators. You can definitely get the MIDP pointerDragged events when running the emulator on Linux. This is basic MIDP, no need for fancy JSR-226 (e-swt) support.
