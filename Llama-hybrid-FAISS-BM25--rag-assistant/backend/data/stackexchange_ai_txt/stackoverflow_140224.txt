Reusable code / class Repositories

I've got several modules containing functions, classes and templates that I keep in a directory called (hah!) 'reuse'. I know the content reasonably well, so to find a particular class or bit of code doesn't take too long, but it is slowly growing in size and I need some sensible method to store them for easy search & retrieval. How should I do this? A related question can be found here: full text search for source code
