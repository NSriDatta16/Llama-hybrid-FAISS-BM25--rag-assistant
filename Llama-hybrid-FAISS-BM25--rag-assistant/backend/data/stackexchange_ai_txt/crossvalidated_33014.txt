This paper and R package completely solved my problem. It uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which relies on the fact that if you can find an initial solution of the constraint, through linear programming, you can find an arbitrary number of them by using a matrix that when multiplied by $E$, the constraints, gives zero. Read about it here: http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/149403.pdf and here is the package: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/limSolve/index.html
