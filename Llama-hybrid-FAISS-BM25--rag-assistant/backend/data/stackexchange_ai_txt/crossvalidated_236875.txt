From the comments in Generating quantile forecasts in R : Larry Pohlman: For the quantile forecast question you can use the R "quantile" function or the quantile regression function "rq" Rob J Hyndman: You can only use the quantile function if you can simulate future sample paths of the time series (unless you want to assume iid data). I'm not sure how you would use "rq()" without assuming a linear regression model which is usually too restrictive for forecasting. Larry Pohlman: strictly speaking quantile regressions are only linear if the residuals are homoscedastic.Otherwise the quantitle regression generates a family of linear functions for every quantile. Check Roger Koenker's papers / book Rob J Hyndman: I've read Koenker, and I've used rq . Homoscedasticity will give you parallel lines. I don't want parallel lines, and I don't even want linear functions, or a family of linear functions. Forecast quantiles are almost never linear.
