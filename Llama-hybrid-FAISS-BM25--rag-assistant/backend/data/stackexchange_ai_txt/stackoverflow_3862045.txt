SQL Queries, execution plans and "Parallelism"

So I'm (still) going through some slow legacy sql views used to do calculate some averages and standarddeviations on a (sometimes) large set of data. What I end up with are views joining views joining views etc. So I though I would review the execution plan for my query. And it immediately suggested a missing index, which I then implemented. But it's still unbearably slow (so slow it times out the VB6 app querying it for data ;) ) So upon studying the execution plan further, I see that what costs the most (about 8% each in my case) are "Paralellism" cases. Mostly "Distribute Streams" and "Repartition Streams". What are these?
