Whether to replace NaN values in result column

I have a training dataset where we have to predict "Result" based on features "A", "B", "C" and "D" using machine learning. For a few rows, the "Result" is empty (7/19612). While for the other features I have filled the NaN values with their mean, I don't understand whether or not to do so with the result column. Will it better to drop the rows entirely instead?
