Dimensional reduction like UMAP or PacMap is a good way to understand complex and numerous data. Here is a demonstrator . Nevertheless, 40M is a lot of data: you may not see clear clusters if you take all the data at once, and it might be useless: a lot of industrial cases focus on a time frame, and taking all the data would result in a blurred visualization. I recommend starting with a ~1000 values data sample (ex: 1 day), and then increase progressively. You'll be able to detect outliers that are outside the clusters. In addition, you can also apply some PCA to understand some data dependency linearly. Here is a similar case to yours: https://github.com/bharathsudharsan/Air-Quality-IoT-Analytics
