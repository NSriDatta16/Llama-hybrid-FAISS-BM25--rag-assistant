Am I wanting to perform a random walk?

I am trying to determine the best method to obtain a probability distribution that describes the likelihood of flipping only heads for a number of successive coin tosses with a coin that has an unknown probability of landing heads. I have a prior for the probability of the coin landing heads, described by a beta distribution: $$\beta(a,b)$$ I am updating this distribution according to the number of successes ('heads') $y$ from trials $n$ : $$\beta(a+y, b+n-y)$$ What is the best way to do this, or at least a relatively efficient way? My lazy (and potentially incorrect) way of doing this has been to arbitrarily choose some upper bound of trials I will consider, say $n = 20$ , update the probability distribution for each $n$ , e.g. $n = 1,2,3,...,20$ , and then aggregate the distributions. However, I'm not happy with this approach. I have started looking into markov chains (and random walks) and associated sampling methods e.g. gibbs sampling which seem relevant but I'm not sure if they are or how to apply them.
