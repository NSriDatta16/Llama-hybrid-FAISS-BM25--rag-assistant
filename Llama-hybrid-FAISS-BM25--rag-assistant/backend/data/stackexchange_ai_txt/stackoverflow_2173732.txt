The obvious option below would have worked if you had no NULL values: SELECT ((col_1 + col_2 + col_3) / 3) AS Average FROM table; However, as jxac suggested in another answer, you would have to do it as follows: SELECT id, (ifnull(col_1, 0) + ifnull(col_2, 0) + ifnull(col_3, 0)) / ((col_1 is not null) + (col_2 is not null) + (col_3 is not null)) as Average FROM table; If all the values of each column were to be NULL, the division by zero would return NULL for that row.
