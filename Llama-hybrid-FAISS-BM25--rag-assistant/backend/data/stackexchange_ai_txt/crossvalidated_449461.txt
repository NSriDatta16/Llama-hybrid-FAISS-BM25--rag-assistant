I'd like to point out that Random Forest is not just a bagging technique. It's a bagging + random subset of the features. Definition on Wikipedia suggests that ...The above procedure describes the original bagging algorithm for trees. Random forests differ in only one way from this general scheme: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a random subset of the features. This process is sometimes called "feature bagging". So bagged tree is bagging. And random forest is baggging + "feature bagging". Also recommend to check the following link for detail info by Arvind Shukla. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/random-forest-bagging-tree-arvind-shukla
