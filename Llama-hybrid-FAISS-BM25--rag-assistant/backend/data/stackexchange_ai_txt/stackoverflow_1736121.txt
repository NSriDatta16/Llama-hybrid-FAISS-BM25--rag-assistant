This crazy combination of knapsack and travelling salesman is surely NP-hard . Virtually everywhere, when you want to load your agent with optimal job schedule, or when you want to build a route through all vertexes in the graph, or when you feel that you need to look for a " longest path *", you most likely run into an NP-complete or an NP-hard problem. That means, that there is no known fast and exact solution to the problem, i.e. the one that runs in a polynomial time. So you have to create approximations and implement non-optimal algorithms based on your particular conditions. What time loss is acceptable? Are there additional patterns the trucks can drive? Do you know more about the graph (e.g. is the area divided into distant dense regions)? Answer these questions and you'll find a non-strict heuristics that satisfies your customers. *yes, searching for longest paths is not as easy as you think. Longest path problem is NP-complete, given that your graph is not acyclic.
