A recent commit to rails uses Config::CONFIG['host_os'] !~ /mswin|mingw/) to test whether it's not on Windows, and RUBY_PLATFORM !~ /java/ to test whether it's not on JRuby. However, I know it's possible to enable fork as a command-line switch. I'd have to look into whether there's any way of telling whether it's been enabled. I suspect macruby doesn't support, or strongly discourages, forking, and from the thread Marc-Andre refers to, you can test for it with RUBY_ENGINE != "macruby" Now for all the other platforms out there...
