I have a loop that is accessing data off the 'net and stuffing it in a db. As I'm processing, I would like a console-like window (not the one in Xcode since this would be a compiled app.) So I have a NSTextView that I'm changing the textStorage of and scrolling to the bottom each time through the loop. Unfortunately, the only visible changes occur when the loop is finished (though correctly.) Is there some kind of simple "OK, update the screen now" method without having to get low level or writing much more code?
