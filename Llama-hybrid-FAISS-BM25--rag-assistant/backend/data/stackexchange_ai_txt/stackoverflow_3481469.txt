how to make tableview like contact apps

I want a do a tableview like in the contact apps, is it many tableView? There is a tableview controller or they just drag table in interface builder, how do you make vertical line in the cell, is it custom cell table view. That's a lot of question but just give me the main idea to do a tableView like this?
