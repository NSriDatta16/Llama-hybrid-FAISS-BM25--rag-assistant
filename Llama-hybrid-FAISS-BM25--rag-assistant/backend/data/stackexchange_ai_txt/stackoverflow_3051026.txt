If you knew simple math, you'd know that 2010 - 24 - 1 = 1985 or $year = date("Y") - $theirage - 1 ... But just giving an age does not accurately deduce what year they were born. For example: If the date is December 30, 2010 and they say they're 24, you're still saying they were born in 1985 when chances are very, very high that they were actually born in 1986. You cannot rely on their age to give you their birth year. EDIT If that wasn't very clear: Today's date is June 16, 2010. So to be 24 years old, I would have needed to be born somewhere between June 17, 1985 and June 16, 1986. That's near half of the birthyears that would be 1985 and near half that would be 1986, causing a very high inaccuracy.
