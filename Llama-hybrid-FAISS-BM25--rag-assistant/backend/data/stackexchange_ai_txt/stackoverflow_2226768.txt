How To Create File System Fragmentation?

Risk Factors for File Fragmentation include mostly full Disks and repeated file appends. What are other risk factors for file fragmentation? How would one make a program using common languages like C++/C#/VB/VB.NET to work with files & make new files with the goal of increasing file fragmentation? WinXP / NTFS is the target Edit: Would something like this be a good approach? Hard Drive free space = FreeMB_atStart Would creating files of say 10MB to fill 90% of the remaining hard drive space Deleting every 3rd created file making file of size FreeMB_atStart * .92 / 3
