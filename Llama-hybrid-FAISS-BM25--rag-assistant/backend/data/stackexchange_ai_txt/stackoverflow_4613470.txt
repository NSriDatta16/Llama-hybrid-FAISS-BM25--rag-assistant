First of all, you are looking at the wrong id. The id of the user is $user['data'][0]['from']['id'] . Secondly, as far as I can see, facebook gives you already the url for that user picture: picture param of that array ;) edit: The 4th step of that tutorial is wrong! Lets take it step by step on how to use the response given by API. When you make a call to facebook search API (eg: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=word ) the returned json looks something like this: { "data": [ { "id": "731528743_161616260551729", "from": { "name": "Sammi Heil", "id": "731528743" }, "message": "\"i always thought that when people said like, its a quarter to five it meant 25 minutes to five...thats how much a quarter is, so how does 15 minutes make sense?\" idiot. 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, 25 cents is a quarter of a dollar. ugh.", "type": "status", "application": { "name": "Mobile", "id": "2915120374" }, "created_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:43+0000", "updated_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:43+0000" }, { "id": "100001056843950_154372714611375", "from": { "name": "Manoj Bharti", "id": "100001056843950" }, "message": "Never argue with an idiot. They drag\nyou down to their level then beat you\nwith experience", "type": "status", "application": { "name": "Mobile", "id": "2915120374" }, "created_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:37+0000", "updated_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:37+0000" }, { "id": "727806581_130875896976657", "from": { "name": "Emran Bala", "id": "727806581" }, "picture": "http://vthumb.ak.fbcdn.net/hvthumb-ak-snc4/hs1302.snc4/50953_154339931282736_154339771282752_21104_1284_t.jpg", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=154339771282752&oid=124673824262095&comments", "source": "http://video.ak.fbcdn.net/cfs-ak-snc6/78924/709/154339771282752_17935.mp4?__gda__=1294484092_1efde632f7fac98390cf08ef85861f2f", "name": "Video - Crazy Idiot Lays on Train Tracks and Lets Train Run Over ", "properties": [ { "name": "Length", "text": "0:55" } ], "icon": "http://b.static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "video", "application": { "name": "Video", "id": "2392950137" }, "created_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:34+0000", "updated_time": "2011-01-06T10:54:34+0000" } ], "paging": { "previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=idiot&limit=25&since=2011-01-06T10%3A54%3A43%2B0000", "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=idiot&limit=25&until=2011-01-06T10%3A45%3A22%2B0000" } } Having this response you need to decode it in order to easily parse it. You do this like this: $json = 'the string above'; $results = json_decode($json, true); Now we can iterate through this array like this: // each result have a `from` array containing the `name` and `id` // of the person who posted that message foreach ($results['data'] as $result) { echo ' '; } Now you have the picture of each user showing on the screen. Simple as that! Full example of how to use the API here: http://pastie.org/1433642 . Copy-paste it on your local machine and test it! You don't need an access token. edit2: and if you still want to use the example from that tutorial, the correct usage is: /picture?type=small" />
