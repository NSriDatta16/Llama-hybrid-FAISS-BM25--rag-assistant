Yes, the values given for outcomeAL and outcomePD are the estimated average effects (in this case, mean differences) for the two outcomes. By using mods = ~ outcome - 1 , you get the two estimated average effects directly. If we had used mods = ~ outcome , we would get the estimated average effect for outcome AL and then a coefficient that is the difference (i.e., contrast) between the estimated average effect for outcome AL and outcome PD . The gray diamonds/polygons in the forest plot show the predicted effects (i.e., fitted values) for each study. That is what is automatically shown when drawing a forest plot based on a model with moderator variables. In this example, the fitted values are just the values given for outcomeAL and outcomePD (so, for "studies" 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, the value for outcomePD ; for "studies" 2, 4, 6, 8, and 19, the value for outcomeAL ). In this case, it probably would make things clearer by not drawing the gray polygons (use addfit=FALSE ) and instead drawing two summary polygons at the bottom of the forest plot (this can be done using the addpoly() function).
