This a tough one without revealing more about the data. I would say your best bet is to create features out of the plain text file based on subjective data. For example some features could be 1) How likely is fraud from a given zip code? 2) Spell errors and other typos in a given claim 3) Income level if it is revealed somewhere on those claims 4) Others? Once you have all of this, you want to break up the cases into a training set and a test set and use some basic machine learning methods. The Naive Bayes approach is a good one for such cases and works quite well. Hope this helps
