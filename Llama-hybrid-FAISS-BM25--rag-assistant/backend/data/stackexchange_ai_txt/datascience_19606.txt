Training accuracy with SGD

So I am computing the training accuracy of my CNN on a batch training data and it almost always gives 100% accuracy. But I found from somewhere that in order to get the training accuracy, it is tested against the entire training data and not the specific batch that you used for your training. Is training accuracy even computed? I wonder if you don't use batches for training. Then it will be 100% accuracy always? I'm suspecting that this is due to using a small batch size.
