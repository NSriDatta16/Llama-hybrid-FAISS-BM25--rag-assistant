I would not have posted this (my) question, have I seen before my posting here that answer by AlexSmith there , which I saw just a few minutes after posting and having been already answered here: "Greg Linwood wrote a great series of blogs. It is a must read: Debunking myths about clustered indexes " It is pity, it is impossible to accept it there as an answer here Update: The accepted here answer by PerformanceDBA told: "The problem is that the doco is gobbledegook, and increases the very confusion it is alleging it clarifies" Well, all msdn docs tell and show, for ex., cf. pictures from Clustered Index Structures vs. "Heap Structures" that clustered table does not have IAM page. Meanwhile, the output from following the code from Inside the Storage Engine: Using DBCC PAGE and DBCC IND to find out if page splits ever roll back shows the opposite. Having no desire to continue spamming here I shifted my questioning and participation to /www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums My related question there: Does clustered table have IAM page?
