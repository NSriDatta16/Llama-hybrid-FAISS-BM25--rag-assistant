In summary, this is hard! So it is useful to step back from the abstract question. Why do you want to compare these distributions? Perhaps this goal can be met some other way. For example, one reason for doing this is when training a GAN. In this situation the training is iterative and stochastic. So it is sufficient to use a stochastic approximation to the answer, which can be done as follows: each time you want to measure the distance between the distributions, choose a random projection to one dimension. Then calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric for the two projected distributions. Apologies, I forget the reference for this method, which was invented by someone smarter than me.
