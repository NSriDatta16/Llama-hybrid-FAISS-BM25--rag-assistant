Next steps after "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning"

I'm currently going through "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" by David Barber and it is an extremely well written and engaging book for learning the fundamentals. So a question to someone who has already done this. What are the next set of books I should go through after I have reasonable proficiency with most of the concepts in Barber?
