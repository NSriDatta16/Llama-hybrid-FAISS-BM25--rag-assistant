simultaneous confidence bands for derivative of density

There is lots of attention on confidence bands for regression functions, but I see not many for densities and even less for derivative of density. In particular, I would like to know some theory and hopefully R code or at least start for an algorithm. For example, consider the following simulated "data": x I would like uniform confidence bands regarding density of x, e.g. at 95% level. It would show something like a positive and increasing derivative up to -1 (that is where the inflection point is), and positive but decreasing derivative from -1 to 0. Then negative and decreasing from 0 to 1 (second inflection point), then negative but increasing. By the way, when I say "increasing" I'm talking about the derivative increasing (i.e. positive second derivative). I did literature search and all I found was this: http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~nickl/Site/__files/AOS738.pdf It is (very much) too technical for my abilities however, and not a chance I can figure out the R code for it. I wonder if I can use function kdde from the ks library. Can I bootstrap from original data and apply kdde to bootstraps? Is there a paper containing a theorem telling me this is valid approach? Can you please provide both theory justification and R code showing why proposed method works?
