Why doesn't content/code assist work inside html tags in eclipse helios in the jsp editor?

It took me a while to isolate where the problem comes up but I've narrowed it down to this: If I have an html tag in my jsp like so: "> The content assist won't work for the jsp expression Defs.NAME if it's inside an html tag (ie between <>) If I do this: then the content assist works fine. It just has to be outside the html brackets. When I say it doesn't work, I mean the box comes up with no suggestions. Whereas 'works fine' means it gets all the suggestions in scope. Worked fine in ganymede.
