I solved the problem in a Scheme environment. Probably it is not very fast, but it works. ;;; boat-loads : mc_num boat_capacity --> list of boat_loads ;;; returns a list of possible (cannibals cannot be more than missionaries) ;;; boat-loads (define (boat-loads mc bc storage) (local ((define isBoatBig (> bc mc)) (define (both mc bc storage) (cond [( = (first x) (second x)) true false)) (append (both mc bc empty) (single mc bc empty))) (filter (lambda (x) (if (>= (first x) (second x)) true false)) (append (both bc bc empty) (single bc bc empty)))))))])))
