A1. you're better off with a map, this is a tree that does the lookup for you. Test with a map and (assuming you have the right compiler) or a hash_map (which does the same thing, but the lookup mechanism is different). They have different performance characteristics for different types of data storage workloads. A2. A list would probably be better for you - push to the front, pull off the end. (a deque could also be used, but you cannot keep an iterator if you erase from it, you can with a list). push_back and pop_front (or vice-versa) will allow you to keep a rolling queue of cached data. A3. You could try SQLite, which is a mini-database designed for simple application-level db storage needs. It can work entirely in-memory too.
