Microsoft also has free chart control you can get at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=130F7986-BF49-4FE5-9CA8-910AE6EA442C&displaylang=en . It's pretty good--especially for being free. I have used Dundas charts in the past. They are excellent but pricey. There are several other vendors with good chart controls including DotNetCharting , Telerik , Component Art, and Infragistics.
