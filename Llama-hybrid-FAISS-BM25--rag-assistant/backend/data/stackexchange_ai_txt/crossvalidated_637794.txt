Interpretation of summary of a hierarchical logistic regression

I'd like to know if my interpretation of this summary is correct. It is a hierarchical logistic regression I made with mixed models for an analysis of a generalization gradient. I've got fixed and random effects. The variables are the following: a) Group: group CONTROL is the intercept. The other group is INTERV. it's a FACTOR variable. b) TIME: TIME = 1 is the intercept, and was the first time the data was collected. The other time is TIME = 2. It's a FACTOR variable. c) SIMILARITY: it's a NUMERIC variable. It's the similarity of one stimulus to another one. d) CHOICE: it is an INTEGER variable. The "choices" can be 0 or 1. e) id: number of identification for each subject in the study. It is a FACTOR. The code I used in R and summary: model |z|) (Intercept) 0.7344 0.3534 2.078 0.037666 * groupINTERV -2.3423 0.5218 -4.489 7.15e-06 *** time 0.2049 0.1018 2.012 0.044191 * similarity 0.3790 0.1882 2.013 0.044063 * groupINTERV:time 1.3925 0.2018 6.902 5.14e-12 *** groupINTERV:similarity -0.6144 0.2996 -2.050 0.040316 * time:similarity 0.3519 0.1056 3.332 0.000862 *** groupINTERV:time:similarity 0.2337 0.1976 1.183 0.236840 In TIME = 1 with SIMILARITY = 0, CHOICE is greater for INTERV group than for CONTROL group. CHOICE was positively influenced by TIME for CONTROL group (when SIMILARITY = 0) For CONTROL group, in TIME = 1, the greater is SIMILARITY, the greater CHOICE is. In other words: for CONTROL group, in TIME = 1, SIMILARITY influences positively in CHOICE. INTERV group was more positively influenced by TIME in CHOICE than the CONTROL group. In TIME = 1, the effect of SIMILARITY is greater in CONTROL group than in INTERV group. In both group s, the rise in TIME increased SIMILARITY's influence in CHOICE.
