I might use 'return' instead of 'last' (in the code as amended by Chas Owens), but the net effect is the same. I am also not clear why you multiply the first parameter of your retry function by 10. IMNSHO, it is far better to (re)factor common skeletal code into a function as you have done than to continually write the same code fragment over and over. There's too much danger that: You have to change the logic - in far too many places You forget to edit the logic correctly at some point These are standard arguments in favour of using functions or equivalent abstractions over inline code. In other words - good job on creating the function. And it is useful that Perl allows you to create the functions on the fly (thanks, Larry)!
