This is a common problem with LDA, as the number of measurements of each sample (i.e., the dimensionality of each data vector) exceeds the number of samples in each class. In this case, the covariance (scatter matrix) estimates do not have full rank, and cannot be inverted. There are a number of ways to deal with this: Use the pseudo inverse instead of the usual matrix inverse. Projecting the problem onto the subspace spanned, like using PCA. Use a shrinkage of the covariance matrix, i.e add a diagonal matrix to the covariance matrix. If you are using a library where you don't have access to the covariance matrix add random noise to your data (not the best way).
