First off, there are a few ways to grab a client's IP address using PHP. Here are 3 methods that I know of: if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) { $ipAddress = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']; } else if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) { $ipAddress = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP']; } else if (isset($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])) { $ipAddress = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; } Second, if you're worried about volatile storage, such as cookies or sessions, it may be best to have a database table which stores these values. It could be a simple table with 3 columns: client_ip, item_id and date_created. This would allow you to track whether a specific ip address was used to vote for a certain item. Now, the only problem I see with this is if the client is at work and sitting behind a proxy. So, I guess you have a few options, each with their own pros and cons.
