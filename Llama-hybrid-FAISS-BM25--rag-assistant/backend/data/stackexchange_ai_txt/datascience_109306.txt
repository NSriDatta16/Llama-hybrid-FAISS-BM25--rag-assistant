TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation

I have one dataset containing images X of type ( numpy array) and one target csv file as Y which has counts of cells (type : pandas dataframe, that I have converted to numpy array), both are now read as numpy arrays. Essentially, I am creating a training dataset to train my images with target dataset using cnn model. For the code below i am getting an error that argument is bad. Any help on how to solve this? **image = cv2.imread(img_path)** Full code: def load_data(): import os datasets = (X,Y) images = [] labels = [] # iterate through training and test sets count =0 for dataset in datasets: # iterate through folders in each dataset for folder in dataset: if folder in ['plasma']: label = 'T4' elif folder in ['lymphocyte']: label = 'T3' elif folder in ['epithelial']: label = 'T2' elif folder in ['neutrophil']: label = 'T1' elif folder in ['eosinophil']: label = 'T5' elif folder in ['connective']: label = 'T6' img_path = np.append(dataset, folder) **image = cv2.imread(img_path)** image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # resize the image image = cv2.resize(image, image_size) # Append the image and its corresponding label to the output images.append(image) labels.append(label) images = np.array(images, dtype = 'float32') labels = np.array(labels, dtype = 'int32') return images, labels Error: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) in ----> 1 images, labels = load_data() in load_data() 24 25 img_path = np.append(dataset, folder) ---> 26 image = cv2.imread(img_path) 27 image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) 28 TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation
