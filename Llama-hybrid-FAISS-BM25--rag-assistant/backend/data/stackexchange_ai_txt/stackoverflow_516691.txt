work on a particular RDF file in flex

I'm still working on a particular RDF file, but seems that something is not going in the right way for me. The code of my RDF file is the following: CAB m021 null 1 micron 0.23235294 0.23046875 20.0 0.6 316 236 plane 20 1-103 1-86 I've loaded this file using URLLoader and in my script I'm trying to access some properties. For instance I have to access property dp:x, nested in dp:resolution, nested in rdf:Description and in my mind the right piece of code is: //assume that 'result:XML' is the variable containing all my RDF and xmlLabel a label xmlLabel.text = 'test: ' + result.Description.resolution.x; but this code gives me an empty result. I tried a different (and not elegant way) to do it passing the following line: xmlLabel.text = 'test: ' + result.child(0).child(11).child(1); and this piece of code wokrs, giving me the value 0.23235294 (as expected) My question is: am I doing something wrong calling the properities? I also tried the "double dot" notation (e.g. result..Description) with no results. The problem could be that the file I am working on is not a valid XML file? In this case, is there a way to adapt my RDF to a valid XML in order to make it work? Thank you for your answers David
