What are some methods for persisting customer configurable data in a database?

I'm looking for some ideas on methods for persisting customer configurable data in a relational database (SQL Server 2000 in my case). For example let's say you have a standard order entry application where your customer enters a product they want to buy. In addition to the fields that are important to both you and the customer (itemID, cost etc), you want to allow the client to enter information only relevant to them and persist it for them (for later retrieval on reports or invoices or whatever). You also want the labeling of these "customer fields" to be configured by the customer. So one customer might have a field called "Invoice Number" another customer might have 2 fields called "Invoice#" and "Invoice Date" etc... I can think of a few ways to do this. You could have a customerfields table with some reasonable number of varchar fields related to each transaction and then another table clientcustomerfields which contains the meta data about how many fields a customer uses, what the field names are etc. Alternatively you could use XML to persist the customer data so you don't have to worry about filly up X # of fields, you'd still need some table to describe the customers meta data (maybe through an XSD). Are there any standard ways of doing this type of thing?
