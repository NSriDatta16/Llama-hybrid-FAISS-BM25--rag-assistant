How to write component to upload files directly to Windows Azure Blobs?

I've been experimenting with Windows Azure Blob storage using the samples using Silverlight. I was wondering if it's possible to write a file upload component in Flash instead of Silverlight, since the former is installed almost everywere. I've never programmed in Action Script but I have a solid background in C# so that must not be hard. Do you know any place where I can learn how to get it started?
