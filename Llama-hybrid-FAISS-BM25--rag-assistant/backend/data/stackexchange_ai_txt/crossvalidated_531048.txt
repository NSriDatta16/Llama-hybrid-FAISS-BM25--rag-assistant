Is threshold moving unnecessary in balanced classification problem?

As far as I know, the threshold moving is needed in imbalanced classification problems. The reason why we have to adjust the decision threshold is as follows: Most machine learning algorithms are developed assuming balanced classification problems. Therefore, the algorithms provide very high probability of a majority class and low probability of a minority class. Then, I think, we do not have to adjust the discriminant threshold in a balanced classification problem. Is it correct?
