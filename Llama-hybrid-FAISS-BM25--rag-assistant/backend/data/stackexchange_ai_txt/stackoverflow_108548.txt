One good solution is to add another connection to the dbml file itself. You can get to this by right-clicking on the field of the design surface and selecting properties. From there, you can add another connection string. Instead of deleting everything and redragging, just change the string and recompile. But if you want to get fancy-schmancy, you can have the program auto-detect whether it is being run locally or not, using this neat utility function: detect local And go from there to set the appropriate connection string based on the results.
