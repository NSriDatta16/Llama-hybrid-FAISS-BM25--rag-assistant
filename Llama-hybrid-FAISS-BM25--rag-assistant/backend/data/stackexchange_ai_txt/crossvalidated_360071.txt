The H2O prcomp algorithm (i.e. PCA) is not limited to 10 components. The limit is the number of columns in your data (or the number of rows if that is smaller). The online documentation ( http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/pca.html and http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/algo-params/k.html ) is wrong . (I'll ping someone at H2O.) Here is quick R script to show this: library(h2o) h2o.init() d I.e. make a matrix of random data, and request the first 20 components. The output looks like: Importance of components: pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 pc5 pc6 pc7 pc8 pc9 pc10 pc11 Standard deviation 3.569561 0.599236 0.560946 0.529781 0.518060 0.495266 0.477426 0.438890 0.429845 0.417752 0.407795 Proportion of Variance 0.754456 0.021262 0.018631 0.016619 0.015892 0.014524 0.013496 0.011406 0.010940 0.010333 0.009847 Cumulative Proportion 0.754456 0.775718 0.794349 0.810968 0.826859 0.841383 0.854880 0.866285 0.877225 0.887559 0.897405 pc12 pc13 pc14 pc15 pc16 pc17 pc18 pc19 pc20 Standard deviation 0.394316 0.386367 0.370733 0.362824 0.354425 0.343219 0.321725 0.304999 0.295844 Proportion of Variance 0.009206 0.008839 0.008138 0.007795 0.007438 0.006975 0.006129 0.005508 0.005182 Cumulative Proportion 0.906612 0.915451 0.923589 0.931384 0.938822 0.945797 0.951926 0.957434 0.962616 Note that only 96.2% of the variance is explained by the first 20 components. If you set k to 40 you will see 100% of the variance explained. If you set k higher than 40 you will get an error message. Note: the python API will behave identically. Aside: I needed so many components because this was random data. With data that has more signal it should not need so many to capture most of the variance. But for high-dimensional data, using more than 10 components is a very reasonable thing to do.
