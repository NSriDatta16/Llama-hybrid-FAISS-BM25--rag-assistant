Analysis for checking if an Ensemble model is a better fit for a dataset than Primitive model

I have a dataset and have the option to apply either GLM (primitive) or a Random Forest (ensemble). So far the Random Forest is giving way better results than the GLM. As it is generally believed that ensemble models should not be used unless absolutely necessary, hence I am looking for any analysis which I could perform on the dataset, which could prove that indeed the only way/better way to model the relationship between variables in the dataset is by using a ensemble model like Random Forest etc.
