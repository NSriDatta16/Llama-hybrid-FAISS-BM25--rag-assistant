Map two values to one object

I am trying to write a function in C# that will take two small int values (range 0-3) and return a Color object based on those values. The problem is that there is no way to programmatically determine the color from the two values, they are specific to a type of LED and must be hardcoded. The simplest way I can think of would be a massive (16 cases) if-else statement that will check each value, but this doesn't seem like a very elegant solution. Is there a better way to determine the Color?
