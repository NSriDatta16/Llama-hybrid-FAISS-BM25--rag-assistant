With respect, if you need to ask this question you should not be attempting to "adjust" your analysis with an online calculator. Seek some statistical expertise. To get you started, it sounds like you have dichotomous outcomes (had a c-section/didn't have one, had early labour/didn't have it) that would be analyzed using logistic regression. Logistic regression makes it easy to incorporate covariates that you wish to adjust for (provided you know what you are doing). This will never be as good as randomization for controlling covariates, but it will be the best you can do with your data (which I presume is retrospective collection?).
