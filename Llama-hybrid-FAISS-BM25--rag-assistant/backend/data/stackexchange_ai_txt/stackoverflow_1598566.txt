I don't do exactly that, but I do a very similar thing. I run the following shell command as a post-build command: (I've broken it into several lines so it's easier to read) /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Resources/pbxcp -exclude .DS_Store -exclude CVS -exclude .svn -resolve-src-symlinks $FOLDER $APP_FOLDER This command copies $FOLDER to your app, and $APP_FOLDER is the location of the (built) .app folder, not the Xcode project. For example, my command expands out to /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Resources/pbxcp -exclude .DS_Store -exclude CVS -exclude .svn -resolve-src-symlinks /Users/beder/src/myproj/data /Users/beder/src/myproj/build-iphone/Debug-iphonesimulator/Myproj.app (My build system uses CMake, which is why the .app folder is in a bit of an unconventional location.) The net result is that the data folder is copied to the .app folder (as you would expect - ../Myproj.app/data/ ). This bypasses copying it to Xcode, but I've found that I have no need for the folder to appear in Xcode. After each build, it copies the folder, so I can use the files in it as if I had dragged the folder to Xcode. Obviously this isn't applescript, but you can execute a shell command in applescript by do shell script "whatever"
