What to do when one feature has very large importance/weight?

I am new to Data Science and currently am trying to predict customers churn for a company that offers of subscription-based bookings management software. Its customers are gyms. I have a small unbalanced dataset of a historical data (False 670, True 230) with 2 numerical predictors: age(days since subscription), number of active days in the last month(days on which a customer(gym) had bookings) and 1 categorical: logo (boolean, if a customers uploaded a logo in a software). Predictors have following negative correlations with churn : logo: 0.65 num_active_days_last_month: 0.40 age: 0.3 Feature importances look similar with Logo having the most weight. When I predict, the model (logistic regression) classifies customers without logo as churners, even thought they are quite active. For example the following two customers have almost the same probability to churn: Customer 1: logo: True num_active_days_last_month: 1 age:30 days Customer 2: logo: False num_active_days_last_month: 22 age: 250 days I understand that this is what model learned from the dataset, but it just doesnâ€™t make sense in my mind to have such strong importance assigned to something like Logo. Is there any way I can avoid completely excluding Logo from the predictors? maybe somehow decrease its importance? Thank you in advance for any help/ suggestions i can get.
