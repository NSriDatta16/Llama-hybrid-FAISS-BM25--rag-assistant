DataMapper: Create new record or update existing

Does DataMapper provide a convenient way to create a new record when none exists or update an existing one? I couldn't find anything in the API documentation. This is what I have at the moment which doesn't seem very elegant: foo = Foo.get(id) if foo.nil? foo = Foo.create(#attributes...) else foo.update(#attributes...) end foo.save
