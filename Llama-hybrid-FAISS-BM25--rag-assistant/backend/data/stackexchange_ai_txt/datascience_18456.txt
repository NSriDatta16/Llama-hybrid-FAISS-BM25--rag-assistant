Encode multi-class response variable

In a classification problem when the response variable has multi-class, e.g., "sunny","rainy","cloudy", how should we encode it? I know that for predictors like this, usually we do One Hot Encoding , and if a predictors have too many classes, then we might just use the LabelEncode . When this multi-class issue occurs in the response variable, I guess we can just use LabelEncode() rather use using One Hot encoding right? Because if we use One Hot encoding, then we will have 2 variables as the response variable, and the machine learning algorithm in sklearn usually expects the response variable not to be a vector right? (I mean it expects a long 1D vector with length equal to the number of observations but not a 2D matrix). But on the other hand, if we just map "sunny", "rainy","cloudy" to {1,2,3} or {0,1,2}, or whatever 3 numbers, that will create a less than or greater than relationship among "sunny", "rainy","cloudy", which is not inherited in the original problem.
