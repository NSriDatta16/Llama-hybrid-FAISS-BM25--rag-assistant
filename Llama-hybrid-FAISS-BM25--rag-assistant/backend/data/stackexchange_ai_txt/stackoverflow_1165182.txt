Fastest/easiest way to average ARGB color ints?

I have five colors stored in the format #AARRGGBB as unsigned ints, and I need to take the average of all five. Obviously I can't simply divide each int by five and just add them, and the only way I thought of so far is to bitmask them, do each channel separately, and then OR them together again. Is there a clever or concise way of averaging all five of them?
