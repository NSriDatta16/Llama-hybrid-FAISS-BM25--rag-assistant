Neural network with unknown layers

Say I have a neural network with some unknown number $N$ of hidden layers. Assume I know the structure (e.g. feedforward, convolutional, or recurrent) of the first $k$ of these hidden layers but know nothing about the remaining $N-k$ layers. (I also don't know $N$ .) Assuming the weights in the unknown part are fixed, then if I know the output generated by the full network, is it possible to use the loss function (e.g. MSE) to train only the hidden layers for which I know the structure without knowing anything about the unknown layers?
