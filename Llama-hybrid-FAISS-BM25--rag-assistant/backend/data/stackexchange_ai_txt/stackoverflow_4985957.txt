Developing a simple web designer (drag + drop of text /w fonts and images)

I have a client who has requested I develop a simple web designer (ala CustomInk.com's t-shirt designer) which allows users to drag & drop text and uploaded images onto a canvas. I have some ideas about getting started with javascript/jQuery but I wanted to ask SO: What is the most universally accessible way (in terms of browser support etc.) of developing an editor like this? Does anyone have any advice/experience in the matter before I start fooling around blindly?
