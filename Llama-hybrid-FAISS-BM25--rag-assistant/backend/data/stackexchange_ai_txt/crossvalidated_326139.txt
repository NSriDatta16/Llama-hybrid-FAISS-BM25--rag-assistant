Predicted probability at the mean decreases when more variables are added to a Logistic regression model

I have been thinking about this question for the past couple days and have not been able to come to a conclusion. I am running a logistic regression and want to calculate the % change in predicted probability from adding a variable of interest. I am using STATA for this is and here is my code. First, I run a regression with the full specification and calculate the predicted probability for the average individual: use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/margex quietly logit outcome i.sex age distance i.group margins, atmeans I get the following: | Delta-method | Margin Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- _cons | .0586319 .018623 3.15 0.002 .0221315 .0951323 If I calculate the predicted probability excluding without distance for the average individual, quietly logit outcome i.sex age i.group margins, atmeans | Delta-method | Margin Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- _cons | .0962654 .0072607 13.26 0.000 .0820347 .110496 I find this quite strange in that the predicted probability at the mean decreases when you add another variable. Even though this is an example, I found the same to be true in my research. I am baffled at why this is so and do not think this is overfitting because I am using the same dataset in all cases. Any insights would be appreciated.
