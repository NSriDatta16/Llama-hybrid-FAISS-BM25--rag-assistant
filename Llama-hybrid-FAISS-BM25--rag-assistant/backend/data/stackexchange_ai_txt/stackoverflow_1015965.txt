I was always hoping to find something like Apache Chainsaw for the java.util.logging/Eclipse combination, i.e. a log viewer in Eclipse that listens to a port and a java.util.logging.Handler implementation writing directly to that. But I haven't found such thing yet and didn't get around writing one either. So far I just use a suitable plain-text format to log to the console. Not elegant and no handy filtering options, but it does the job. Writing your own custom formatter is not hard at all. There is some support for analyzing log files in Eclipse's Test and Performance Tools Platform Project (the name being even worse than the acronym). I never tried that, but it might be useful for you.
