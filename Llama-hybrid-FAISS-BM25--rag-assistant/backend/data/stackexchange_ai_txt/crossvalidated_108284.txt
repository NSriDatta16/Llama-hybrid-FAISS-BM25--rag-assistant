Here is the R code that produced the output below: library(caret) set.seed(934) fitControl Consider the following output from R: Generalized Linear Model 900 samples 20 predictors 2 classes: '0', '1' No pre-processing Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 10 times) Summary of sample sizes: 846, 847, 846, 845, 847, 846, ... Resampling results Accuracy Kappa Accuracy SD Kappa SD 0.80 0.58 0.076 0.18 This is a logistic regression model using a 10-fold cross validation repeated 10 times. Does the output above indicate that the average accuracy is 0.80?
