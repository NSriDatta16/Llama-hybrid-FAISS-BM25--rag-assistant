How to construct a rolling annual returns from a time series using R?

I have the daily closed values of the initial index for DJUSER, MSCI, SP500, SPGSCI from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2011. I want to transform them in to data of rolling annual returns. How to do it using R? which package do I need to use? The density of the rolling annual returns associate to each data should be similar to the graph in the picture : I can send to you the initial data if you want to try.
