Electricity consumption prediction with Gaussian Processes (GPs) using temperature forecast

My goal is to predict electricity consumption given historic data for a time horizon of 36 hours. I understand how I can predict using GPs and historical consumption data; however, I also have access to temperature forecasts which is naturally highly correlated with electricity consumption. What I would like to do is incorporate the temperature forecast into my simple GP model, that is, condition the 36-hours-ahead electricity consumption prediction also on the forecast temperature values at the corresponding time labels. One very simple way I can think of is to model the electricity consumption using recent electricity consumption observations only, and scale the results up or down in accordance with the temperature forecast, using some linear regression approach. But this does not seem very elegant. Is there a better way to do this?
