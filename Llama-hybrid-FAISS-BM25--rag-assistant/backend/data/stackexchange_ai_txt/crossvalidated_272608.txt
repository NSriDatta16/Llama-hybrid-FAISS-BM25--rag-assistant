Approximate order statistics for Half-normal probability plot

To construct the half-normal probability plot, plot the absolute values in a certain statistical diagnostic (residual, leverage, Cook distance and others) versus $z_i$ where: $\displaystyle z_{i} = \Phi^{-1} \left(\frac{k + n - \frac{1}{8}}{2n +\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ $\therefore$ Applied Linear Statistical Models, (Kutner,Nachtsheim,Neter & Li, 2005) Fifth Edition, Pag 596 or $\displaystyle z_{i} = \Phi^{-1} \left(\frac{k + n + \frac{1}{2}}{2n +\frac{9}{8}}\right)$ $\therefore$ Generalized Linear Models, (P. McCullagh & J.A. Nelder, 1989) Second Edition, Pag 407 where $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. $k$ is the $k$-th ordered absolute residual $n$ is the sample size I could not locate the mathematical justification for the difference of the $z_i$, and more importantly I don't have any intuition about where it comes from.
