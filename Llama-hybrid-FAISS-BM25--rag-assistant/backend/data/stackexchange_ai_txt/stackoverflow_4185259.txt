What are advantages of SQL Server 2008 transparent encryption TDE over encrypting db backup?

What are advantages of SQL Server2008+ TDE ( Transparent Data Encryption) over encrypting just database backup file (with a password)? Update: I am sorry - removed Oracle from this question (SQL Server TDE is for the whole database and encrypted data is stored in database). Encrypting is not difficult to organize using C# without 3d-party tools, though there are plenty of 3d party tools.
