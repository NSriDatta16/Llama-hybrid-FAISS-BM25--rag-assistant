Is this even sensible? Your data is country wide, duplicating data by any measure will only skew your results and produce fake "accuracy". If you do not have enough countries/records for modelling maybe think about enriching the data set with a time series (e.g. the same entries over multiple years for each country). I don`t know exactly what you are modelling but let's say an example could be predicting happiness based on economic data (GDP, etc.), development indices, etc. In this case each country is exactly one record and duplicating data would be absolutely wrong here. There aren't 327 countries with the statistics and happiness of the USA, there is only one. Multiplying by 327 will fake model accuracy and absolutely overfit to boot. Do not do it!
