You should be fine with: openMonth.id = "openMonth"; getElementById() can only work if the element is part of the DOM, but since you already use insertBefore() this is merely a side note. There is a common source of confusion involved here: An attribute named "id" is not necessarily the one that is defined as the element ID in the underlying DTD. In declarative HTML, they are linked automatically. When you use setAttribute() , you are not more than creating an attribute named "id". The element ID itself is accessible via the .id property. Edit The following works for me: function test() { // create element, set ID var p = document.createElement("P"); p.innerHTML = "Look ma, this is a new paragraph!"; p.id = "newParagraph"; // make element part of the DOM document.getElementsByTagName("BODY")[0].appendChild(p); // get element by ID var test = document.getElementById("newParagraph"); alert(test.innerHTML); }
