This is not really an android question, though the protocol and other mechanisms you choose will have an effect on the device (e.g. battery life). What protocol to choose mainly depends on your requirements (average packet size, packets per second on average, whether lost packets are an issue, how much data you will send at once, is jitter an issue, etc). I can give a few pointers though. Here's a very good article on the Quake3 networking implementation: http://trac.bookofhook.com/bookofhook/trac.cgi/wiki/Quake3Networking Simple but effective, I really like it and can only recommend this one. Here's also a good thread on the topic: http://www.gamedev.net/topic/319003-mmorpg-and-the-ol-udp-vs-tcp/ Some games use UDP (especially FPS and RTS types), some TCP, and some of them a certain combination of them (e.g. UDP to send game data, TCP for chat and other stuff). Either one can work. You should also keep in mind that users might like to work over 2G, 3G or WiFi networks, and even WiFi networks can be laggy and over capacity. I'd suggest to implement a quick prototype and test it in various network environments.
