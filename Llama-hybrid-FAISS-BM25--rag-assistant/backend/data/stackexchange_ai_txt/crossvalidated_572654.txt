To understand this, you must first be clear about the disctinction between features and parameters . Features - this is basically the input columns of your training data. Parameters - these are basically the weights of your model that you want to learn For example, for a linear regression model with two features, you make the assumption that the response depends on the features through the following relationship: $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$$ The features are $X_1$ and $X_2$ whereas $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$ are the parameters Linearity Linearity is meant in terms of the parameters of the model. So if the response(or a function of the response) can be written as being linear in the parameters, we say the model is linear. Eg. linear regression with two features shown above polynomial regression - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1^2+ \beta_4 X_2^2 + \beta_5 X_1 X_2 + \epsilon$ logistic regression - $log (\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$ Additivity Additivity is meant in terms of the features of the model. So if the response(or a function of the response) can be written as being additive in the features (or a function of features), we say the model is additive. Eg. linear regression with two features shown above logistic regression - $log (\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$ because $g(Y) = f(X_1) + g(X_2) + \epsilon$ Models can be (linear & additive), (linear & not additive), (nonlinear & additive), (nonlinear & not additive) The following models are linear & not additive : polynomial regression - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1^2+ \beta_4 X_2^2 + \beta_5 X_1 X_2 + \epsilon$ because $X_1, X_2$ terms cannot be split into separate additive functions of $X_1$ and $X_2$ The following models are nonlinear & additive : $Y = exp(\beta_1 X_1) + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$ since this is not linear in the parameters The following models are nonlinear & not additive : $Y = exp(\beta_1 X_1) + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \epsilon$ neither linear in parameters nor can it be split into separate additive functions of $X_1$ and $X_2$
