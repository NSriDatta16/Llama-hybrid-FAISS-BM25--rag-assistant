If you move the child, the parent has to be refreshed because it may need to draw the area where child was located previously. It would also mean that all children (of parent) would get refreshed. OTH, using so many controls may not be a good idea. I would suggest you to keep data structures describing walls and then use it to draw it within Panel (or your custom control). You can write your own logic for hit testing (mouse or keyboard click within wall boundary) by capturing mouse/keyboard events at Panel/Parent level. With correct organization data structure, hit testing can be very efficient.
