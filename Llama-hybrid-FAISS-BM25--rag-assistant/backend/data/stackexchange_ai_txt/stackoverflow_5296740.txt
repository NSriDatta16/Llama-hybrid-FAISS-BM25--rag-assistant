OOD : Who should create object from persistence layer?

In my software, I have 5 main layers: UI CONTROLLER DOMAIN (business rules) PERSISTENCE MYSQL (db) In which layer and to whom should I assign the responsibility to get the domain objects from the persistence layer? I decided to create a new partition in the domain layer, but doing so by the controller layer makes ambiguity about how to create domain objects. I'm looking for an elegant solution for creating domain objects by taking them from the persistent state.
