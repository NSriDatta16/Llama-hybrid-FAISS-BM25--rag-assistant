In C++, pointers are just like arrays in your WhatTheyWant class, you define the private member: Event *events[2]; This is an array of arrays (2D array) with variable length (of arrays) and 2 element in each array. and the operator '->' is used when you want to access a (member of some kind of object) and that is called an object pointer (a pointer which points to an object) but when you define a normal object variable you use '.' operator. If you've got the courage and knowledge to use them they are very useful but in general they're dangerous and that's why the new languages tend to go to the managed way.
