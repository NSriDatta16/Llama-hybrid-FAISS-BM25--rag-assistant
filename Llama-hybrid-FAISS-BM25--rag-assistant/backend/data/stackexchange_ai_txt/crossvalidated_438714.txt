Stacking the two modes into one should be perfectly fine. If yes, how should I standardize each channel ? With modern training techniques, standardization is not too critical -- anything reasonable should work. Can the multimodal architecture automatically handle the different points of view of my 2 input images In theory yes, having a multi-modal stereo input would probably perform better, but only if you have a specially designed architecture for it. This stuff gets pretty involved so unless it's mission critical it's probably not worth the complications. I recommend reading the paper "Stereo-RCNN" for inspiration.
