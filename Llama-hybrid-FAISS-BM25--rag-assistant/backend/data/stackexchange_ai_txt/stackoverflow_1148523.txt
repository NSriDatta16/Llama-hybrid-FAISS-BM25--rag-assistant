Visual C++ Development

I'm learning C++, and know a little bit of Visual Basic and an Delphi. But I want to know, is there some program like Delphi, but for C++. Something where you can drag a button to a form, double click it, the like in Delphi and VB: opens a code editor and you edit the code of the button, but with a similar code of C++? I'm using Windows Vista.
