This very much depends on what do you mean as "goodness of fit." I would suggest something along the following lines: how much better results will my model give compared to a "naive" model. A good metric is how many correct predictions you predict compared to the sample average. For instance, if the average is 333 win - 333 lose - 333 draw, in average you only get about 33% of these correct if you just assign results randomly to the games. But you can predict the results based on your model, and (we hope so) you get more of them right, say 40%. Now the goodness of fit might be (40 - 33)/(100 - 33) = 10%. You can also use something else as your naive model, for instance it may be a model where you include the position but not information about the previous games... You may also not just care about correct prediction, but also how much off was the prediction..
