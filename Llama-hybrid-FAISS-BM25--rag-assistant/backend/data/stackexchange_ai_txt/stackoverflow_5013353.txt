It depends on what you need. If the information you retrieve are anywhere in the URL, you could have a look at the function parse_url() . According to the php manual: The above example will output: Array ( [scheme] => http [host] => hostname [user] => username [pass] => password [path] => /path [query] => arg=value [fragment] => anchor ) /path and this gives you each url part, so you can work to the one you need. Of course by using $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] you just get the query and work on that, or strip it off the full url to get the base bath. Since it seems you say URL sometimes are not well formed (using & instead of ? for the first paramater) using explode('?',$url) may lead to unpredicted results.
