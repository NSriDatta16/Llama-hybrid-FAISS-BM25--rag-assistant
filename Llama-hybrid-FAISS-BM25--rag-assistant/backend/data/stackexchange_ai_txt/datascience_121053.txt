Time-series sequence classification is a set of problems where the model takes in a sequence and spits out a classification for that sequence. This is essentially your basic use case. Sequence classification is ideal for when the complete sequence is available. In your case, you can do the training process on the complete sequences. Upon deployment, take the sequence up to that point and simply get the prediction for the shorter sequence. RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs can take sequences of any length. Solely training on complete sequences might, for obvious reasons, not necessarily be optimal. Therefore, during training, you can also feed 'partial' sequences to train on and simply predict the shorter sequences. This mimics the behaviour that you will later get during deployment.
