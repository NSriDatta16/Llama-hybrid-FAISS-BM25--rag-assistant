I think you've basically got it, honestly. You could be a bit more elegant by using Add-Member: ls | Add-Member -Force -Passthru -Type ScriptProperty -Name Length -Value { ls $this -recurse | Measure -Sum Length | Select -Expand Sum } PSCX messes with the formatting and will output "" for the size even though you've actually got a size. If you're using PSCX you'll have to add an explicit | Format-Table Mode, LastWriteTime, Length, Name -Auto
