How do I present averages from different sample sizes across years?

I have 20 years' worth of observations that either say YES or NO to the question of whether breeding was observed.

I believe this might skew the results and result in a graph that is misleading in presenting a genuine trend over the years. My question is whether I should weight my averages, log transform them or disregard certain data based on confidence intervals? Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is what the data looks like at the moment:
