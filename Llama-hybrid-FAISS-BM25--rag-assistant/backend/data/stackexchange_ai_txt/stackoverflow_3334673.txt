Calculation of words, sentences and paragraphs from text entered by the user

I need to write a program to take an entry 'essay' from the user. This essay can contain any characters (special characters, quotation marks, etc.). It then has to calculate the total number of words, sentences and paragraphs, and the total number of special characters. How should I go about doing this?
