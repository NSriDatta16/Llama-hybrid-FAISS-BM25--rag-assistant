What is a good way to do multi-row updates in struts (with struts live)?

Without using DynaForm and it's kin. I would like to use a POJO data transfer object, e.g., Person: public class Person { private Long id; private String firstName; private String lastName; // ... getters / setters for the fields } In the struts live action form we would have: public class PersonUpdateForm extends SLActionForm { String organization; Person[] persons; // all the people will be changed to this organization; they're names and so forth can be updated at the same time (stupid, but a client might desire this) // getters / setters + index setters / getters for persons } What would the corresponding html:text tags look like in the JSP to allow this? If I switch to a List persons field and use a lazy-loading list (in commons-collections) how would that change thinsg? There seems to be no good way to do this in struts-1.2(.9?) All help is greatly appreciated!!! If you need more context let me know and I can provide some.
