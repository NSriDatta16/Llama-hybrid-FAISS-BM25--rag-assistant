How to sample discontinuous probability functions?

I fitted a pdf with CumFreq to data, and the best fitting pdf is a discontinuous function composed as: The cumulative frequency function is broken into : Gumbel standard ( P) : Breakpoint : P = 166 X P : Freq = 1-exp[-exp{-(As*X+Bs)}] Ag = -0.0046 Bg = 1.22 Average X: 214 Median X: 144 St.Dev. X: 142.2 How can I sample thse two functions to produce random numbers? how can I make sure that the area under the curve equals 1? Thanks!
