If the regression coefficient of your logistic regression is 1.76 on the logit-scale, then the odds ratio for 1 unit increase in temperature is $\mathrm{OR_{+1}}=\exp(\beta) = \exp(1.76)\approx 5.81$, as you already stated. The odds ratio for an increase in temperature for $a$ degrees is $\mathrm{OR_{+a}}=\exp(\beta\times a)$. In your case, $a$ is 2 and 3, respectively. So the odds ratios for an increase of 2 and 3 degrees are: $\mathrm{OR_{+2}}=\exp(1.76\times 2)\approx 33.78$ and $\mathrm{OR_{+3}}=\exp(1.76\times 3)\approx 196.37$. If in 2012 50% of the fish die, the baseline odds of dying are $0.5/(0.5-1)=1$. The odds ratio for 1 degree increase in temperature is 5.8 and thus, the odds of dying are $5.8\times 1$ (i.e. the odds ratio multiplied by the baseline odds) compared to fish without the increase in temperature. The odds can now be converted to probability by: $5.8/(5.8+ 1)\approx 0.853$. The same is true for an increase of 2 and 3 degrees: $33.78/(33.78+1)\approx 0.971$ and $196.37/(196.37+1)\approx 0.995$.
