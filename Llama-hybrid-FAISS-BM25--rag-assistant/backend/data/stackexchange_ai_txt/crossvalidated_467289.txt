This answer is from the point of view of R, but the issues are not primarily about the software, so it should apply generallly "certainty" is not needed very often in practice. It's quite common to have certainty PSUs at stage 1 -- for example, the National Health Examination Survey has some large cities sampled with certainty. I don't have the list, but I'd expect New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles to be on it. When the PSU is sampled with certainty, there's no sampling uncertainty at stage 1, and the multistage variance estimator can just move on to stage two. The reason you don't need this very often in practice is that you can just treat certainty PSUs as strata . That's easy and you don't have to worry about what's going on in the internal workings of your statistical software. The other two are for situations where there is sampling uncertainty at stage 1 in that stratum. You now have a problem: no unbiased variance estimator exists. Basically, in that stratum, at stage 1, your variance estimator looks like a variance between the PSUs, and so it ends up as 0/0. There are several things you can do here. One is just to zero out the contribution of that stratum to the variance; obviously not ideal, but easy, and if you have lots of strata it can't matter that much. That's what "remove" does. Numerically, it's the same as "certainty" , but it's conceptually completely different, which is why it has a different name. "remove" is anti-conservative. Another possibility is to pretend the strata are a random sample ('exchangeable', as our Bayesian comrades would say). In that case, you can replace the unknown variance contribution of this stratum with the average over all the other strata. Yet another possibility is to discard the whole point of stratification and work out the variance by computing residuals from the whole-population mean rather than the stratum mean. It's using the stratum mean when you have just a single PSU that gives 0/0; the zero in the numerator is a sort of residual sum of squares involving PSU means minus stratum means, and when there's just one PSU those are the same. That's the "adjust" option. It's conservative. Given these problems, why would you even have a single-PSU non-certainty stratum? It could be because of missing data or non-response. It could also be because the study designers wanted to use a single PSU per stratum to reduce standard errors even at the cost of not being able to get an unbiased estimate of them. That's what happens with some studies from the National Center for Health Statistics: they use one PSU per stratum, but in the public-use data they group the PSUs into pairs and pretend there were two PSUs per paired stratum. If you know enough about the population, that's likely to be the best strategy. You look at the data and say, ok, this is Seattle, let's pretend it's in the same stratum as Portland. You get variances for that stratum from Seattle vs Portland differences. That's better than using Seattle vs whole-US differences ( adjust ) and probably better than saying the Seattle variance is the same as the average stratum across the country ( average ) and probably better than saying Seattle is just perfect and doesn't contribute any variance ( remove ). The problem is that if you only have public-use data from some national survey, you won't have enough information to do that.
