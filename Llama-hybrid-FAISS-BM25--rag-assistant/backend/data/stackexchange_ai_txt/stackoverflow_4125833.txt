how to obtain simplified Stanford Bunny model

Some will object that this is not a programming question. I'm willing to defend its relevance to SO, or to take the question elsewhere, if someone has a good suggestion for a better place to get this sort of help. The classic Stanford Bunny model has almost 70,000 polygons. I'm looking for a simplified version, on the order of 4,000 polygons. (This is for an open-source screen saver I'm working on.) Searching the web, I find that many people have simplified the model for various research projects. But I haven't found a downloadable, simplified model of the complexity I want. The closest I've found is the Scanview program, which comes with a 16,000-poly simplification of the model. However, it's provided in the binary SVM (ScanView Model?) format, for which I don't find ready information, and indeed the ScanView web page suggests that it may be encrypted and please don't hack it. :-) I've searched in a few of the major online 3D model download sites, and haven't found the bunny at all there. This surprises me, given the popularity of the bunny , and the fact that permission is granted to redistribute it freely. If there is not a readily-available simplified model to download, what is the easiest way for me to simplify it myself? Use a program like meshlab ? Thanks...
