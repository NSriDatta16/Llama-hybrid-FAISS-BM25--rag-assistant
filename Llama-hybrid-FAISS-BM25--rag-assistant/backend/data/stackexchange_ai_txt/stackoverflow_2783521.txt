It depends what the performance problem is. If is CPU bound, then the XML validation could be a factor and varchar(max) could be faster. If is IO bound then the XML compressed storage is better than the nvarchar(max) loose format and you'd loose performance. On the other hand, if the problem XML fragments are small the varchar storage presents the opportunity for in-row storage and may bet better than XML On yet another hand the in-row storage would decrease the leaf pages row density and cause performance problems for reads. If the problem is neither CPU nor IO but is lock contention, then the XML vs. varchar issue is orthogonal to the performance problem. Same goes for insert hot spot page latch contention problem. And again, same goes for log flush performance problem. All would manifest as 'slow inserts' (for some definition of slow) and none would change in the slightest by replacing an XML with varchar. So, as with all performance problems, the recommendation is to measure first and cut later. The recommended approach is to apply a well tested and proven performance investigation methodology, like Waits and Queues . Guessing will land you nowhere fast.
