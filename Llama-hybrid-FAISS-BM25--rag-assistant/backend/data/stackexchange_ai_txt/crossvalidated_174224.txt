Should I treat dependent variable as continuous or categorical?

I'm trying to use RF (Random Forest) in R in order to predict if the Titanic passengers will perish or not. Thus, the nature of my dependent variable is categorical. I would like to predict the probability of each passenger perish. So, with this outcome I can clusterize and make groups, like this: group A: passengers who have [81 to 100] % of perish risk . group B: passengers who have [60 to 80] % of perish risk. group C: passengers who have So, if the Titanic happens again, I could know the probability of each passengers perished and which group he belongs to ( A, B or C ). However, I don't know what is the best approach to get the probability of a passenger perish. I can transform my dependent variable to a continuous one,and then, use RF to get the probability of a passenger perish ( 0 to 1), or I can use the RF with dependent variable as categorical one and use the probability to perform this.
