Get newly-added rows from MySQL using PHP

I have a table posts with columns post_id , user_id , post . When a user visits his page, I retrieve a list of his posts ( select post from posts where user_id=$uid ). He can then add one or more posts to the table through a form. Is there any way I can retrieve these newly-added posts without querying the entire table again? I'm particularly interested in using this with jQuery to auto-refresh his posts periodically (like YouTube comments when 'auto-refresh' is selected, for example). Thanks, Albert
