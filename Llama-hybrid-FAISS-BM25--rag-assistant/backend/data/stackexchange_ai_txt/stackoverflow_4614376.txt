Bug in Scala's type system?

The following scala code seems to be valid: class A[X] class C[M[X] I expected the compiler to perform type inference on type A, but after I tried the following: new C[A[Int]] I got the following error message: (fragment of Main.scala):11: error: this.A[Int] takes no type parameters, expected: one println( new C[A[Int]] )
