As Triptych said, I would start from scratch. Also, consider the following: use a CSS reset file to smooth out cross-browser inconsistencies: http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/ get it working perfectly in Firefox, then tweak for other browsers as needed study the underlying HTML. How is it organized? Is it laid out with tables? all DIVs? Semantic tagging? is the CSS used for layout or simply styling (fonts, colors, etc.)? Once you get a feel for that, study the content. Categorize the layout and elements as much as possible, so that you identify all the common elements and can maximize the efficiency of your CSS remember the C in CSS, Make the most commonly used font the body font, so that other elements will inherit it by default. use relative units (ems) for font size, to allow proper scaling of text try not to use ANY inline styles make use of Firebug - it will let you inspect an element and see exactly what CSS is in effect and where the rules came from don't be afraid to re-use portions of the old CSS, especially for things like dropdown menus, which can need very specific incantations to work properly have fun! starting from scratch lets you implement best practices and learn a ton along the way. When you are done you are probably going to look back on this as a good experience. there is a presentation here that should get you in the right headspace for tackling this task: CSS Systems
