Try Incredibuild . It dramatically cuts down compile/build time. This product basically enables Visual C++ to build across multiple machines in your organization by taking advantage of idle cycles. I've used Incredibuild on huge projects (500 kloc) with lots of template code and got good speedup in build times.
