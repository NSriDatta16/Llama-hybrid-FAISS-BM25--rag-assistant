How to calculate influence of variables at ROW LEVEL?

There are several algorithms which give relative importance of variables at OVERALL Model level. But the most influencing variable might not be the reason why a particular row might get higher or lower scores. eg: different applications get different reasons for Credit decline though scored by the same Credit Risk model. This happens because one variable's value drives the overall score for that particular application down, although this variable might not be the one which is the most significant across all rows at a model level. I know how to calculate the top influencing variables in a Logistic / Linear Regression Model for each ROW (by rank ordering the product of coefficient & variable value for each variable). But how do we calculate relative importance of variables at each ROW level using other algorithms like Neural network, Random Forest, etc.
