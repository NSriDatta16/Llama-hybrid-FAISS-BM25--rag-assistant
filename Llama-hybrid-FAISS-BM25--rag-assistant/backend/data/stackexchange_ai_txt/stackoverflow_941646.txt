What do you use the svn tags directory for anyways?

Ok so we all know the standard SVN set-up of trunk\ branches\ tags\ And I realize that the recommendation is that tags should have "special" commits in it. I've never really used the tags directory however and I don't see why I ever would. My understanding is that tags\ would contain things like "Version1Release\, Version2Release\, ThatTimeWeUpgradedEverthing\" etc. But here's the thing, if you are going in and need to make a change to the Version1Release then it should be a branch, and if tags are supposed to be never-changing then whats the point of making a copy in source-control anyways? Just make a note revision 712 was our version 1 release. I guess my confusion is that it seems like tags are versions that are never supposed to change. But source control is all about keeping a history of changing files. I know this is a minor organizational argument, but I'm curious what people think.
