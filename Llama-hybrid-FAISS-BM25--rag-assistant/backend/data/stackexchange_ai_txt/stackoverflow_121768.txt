Does COROUTINE a portable C++ library for coroutine sequencing point you in the right direction? It seems like an elegant solution that has lasted the test of time.....it's 9 years old! In the DOC folder is a pdf of the paper A Portable C++ Library for Coroutine Sequencing by Keld Helsgaun which describes the library and provides short examples using it. [update] I'm actually making successful use of it myself. Curiosity got the better of me, so I looked into this solution, and found it was a good fit for a problem I've been working on for some time!
