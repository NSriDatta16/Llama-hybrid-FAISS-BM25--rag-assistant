Your site is being attacked by an automated agent (auto-hacker or worm) that is hacking thousands of servers. This is caused by a vulnerability in your code base that a developer has introduced. Despite popular opinion, this it is extremely unlikely that this is SQL Injection because it is difficult to get to full PHP remote code execution using a mysql database like this. Change your FTP password. Use SFTP whenever possible, FTP is extremely insecure and should never be used by anyone for any reason. In fact I would just go with a different hosting company that actually cares about security. When I have cleaned up sites in the past I have seen problems with phpmailer (this project was written by retarded rhesus monkeys and about a million servers have been hacked because of this garbage). If you update phpmailer you probably won't get hacked again for at least 6 months. The 2nd place to look is FCKEditor, this is a very insecure project. By default it doesn't introduce a vulnerability, but if you intend on using it then you probably configured it to be very insecure. SDL or simple directory listing can also be problematic, but it is less likely. Basically make sure all your PHP Libraries and all installed PHP applications are up to date. This includes CMS's like Joomla and forums like PHPBB. The final solution is to hire a professional. A lot can go wrong with a web application and you need someone who is experienced in cleaning up hacked sites. I know I can fix the problem firealwaysworks(at)gmail.com .
