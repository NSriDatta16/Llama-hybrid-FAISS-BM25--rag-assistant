Embedding objects into Microsoft Word and OpenOffice Writer

I am looking for some references on how to implement the following feature: ability to embed objects (e.g. diagrams) into word processors and being able to edit them in their respective "mother" application For example, MS Word and Visio work like this together, allowing the user to easily edit/tweak the diagrams after adding them to the word processor. I am interested in how this is done on the following platforms: Microsoft Word OpenOffice So far I know that: Microsoft Word uses OLE/COM Open Office uses UNO Can you point me to any references, examples, books on how to approach this?
