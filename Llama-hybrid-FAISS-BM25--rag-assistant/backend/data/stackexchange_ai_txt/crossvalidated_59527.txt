F test for equality of variances

I know that the test statistic is $$F=S_1^2/S_2^2 $$ But I am looking at some example questions from my lecturer and some have confused me. For example: For a certain game, individual game scores are normally distributed. Two players played 10 games each, and recorded their scores on each game. For player A, the average score is 375 and the sample variance is 17312. For player B, the average score is 360 and the sample variance is 13208. Test, at the 5% level the hypothesis that the variances ofthe two players' scores are the same assuming that the true means are unknown. And he uses the equation $$F=(17312/9)/(13208/9) $$ Obviously the solution is the same here, but in other examples I have looked at (which I can't find now) the ns do not cancel so it is not. How do I know when to use which equation?
