Zend-Framework: how we do this without module?

Sorry this is a pretty long question, but i want to have some disucssions here. i am new to zend and try to avoid using modules as I think the view aspect of zend is pretty flexible and module will add extra directory and confusion. However i am wondering one thing. The app i am building is pretty big it actually has the modules concept in the app. I know if using module, things can be more organised, where you can put modules in its own directory and have seperate view and controller etc. however i decided to simulate module directory in the form of --lang/module(in fact the controller)/controller(that's the action)/action(that's the child-action)/other-params/-- how we go about and do this kind of simulation The initial idea i have is add another route to the application take the 4th param as the child-action. e.g class some_controller extend extends Zend_Controller_Action{ public function someAction{ switch (child-action) { case 'child-action1': ....... excute some action break; case 'child-action2': ....... excute some action break;.... } } something like that. Does that make sense or if there's any other approach? and with this approach how we integrate Zend_ACL as how to add the 'fake child action' as a resource? Thank you.
