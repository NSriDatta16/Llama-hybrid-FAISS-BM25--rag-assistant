I believe you are looking for continue . if (dmo is IResourcePolicy) { etc... } else { continue; } EDIT: Based on the comments, here is what I understand you want to do: Also to note, there is only one loop here, and you're breaking out of it once your inner conditional is met. I think this may be what is confusing you. The way it is now, you'll always be processing only one of the objects in your collection. The following has the break statement removed so it will process every object in your collection. foreach (DataModelObject dmo in allObjects) { if (dmo is IResourcePolicy) { // if these loops are not executed i want to show agentversion instead of showing None in UI layer IResourcePolicy irp = (IResourcePolicy)dmo; irp.AgentVersion = agentVersion; //(else) i want to show the entire four things including agent version if (string.Compare(dmo.Name, hostName, true) == 0) { irp.ResourcePolicy = rp; irp.AgentPolicyVersion.Version = Convert.ToInt64(policyVersion); irp.ResourcePolicyEnabled = Convert.ToBoolean(enabled); } // Distribute the object without saving it. SpoServer.Spurt.ServerSendObject(dmo, true, 0); } }
