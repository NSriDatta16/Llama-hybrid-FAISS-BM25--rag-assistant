Suppose you want to check if every element of your array is of type IFoo , and depending on that perform a certain operation. There are at least 3 ways to do this. 1. Iteration var allFoo:Boolean = true; for (var i:int = 0; i 2. Enumeration var allFoo:Boolean = true; for each (var e:* in array) { if (!(e is IFoo)) { allFoo = false; break; } } if (allFoo) { // perform operation } else { // do something else } 3. Array.every() function isElementFoo(item:*, index:int, array:Array):Boolean { return (item is IFoo); } if (array.every(isElementFoo)) { // perform operation } else { // do something else } I expect the second one to be the fastest, whereas the third one is the most elegant due to the absence of any temporary variables. Ultimately which one you choose depends on the nature of your program as much as your own personal style and philosophy.
