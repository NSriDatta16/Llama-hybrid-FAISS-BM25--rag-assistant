SVM with sparse Gram matrix

I have a corpus of many short entries. Because of this it is very rare that for two entries $x_i, x_j: \ \neq 0$. Therefore for almost all the entries, $x\in TeS$, in the test set I get $\forall x_i\in TrS, \ =0 $ where $TrS$ is the training set. Therefore SVM is unable to classify most of the entries in the test set. Is SVM the wrong approach to take with short entries? What other algorithms do not face this problem?
