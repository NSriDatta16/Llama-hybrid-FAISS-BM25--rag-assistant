This won't help with your problem but might be interesting nevertheless: There's another universal attribute apart from title which can be used to store data - lang ! Just convert the data you want to store to a continuous string and prefix it with 'x-' to declare private usage in accordance with RFC 1766. In the comments, sanchothefat clarified that he wants to solve the usability-issues with the abbr-design-pattern in microformats. But there are other patterns which are as semantically meaningful (or, in my opinion even more so) than this pattern. What I'd do: The party is at 10 o'clock on the 10th 20051010T10:10:10-010 . together wtih these styles dfn.micro-date { font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; } dfn.micro-date var { display: none; } In my opinion, the semantically most correct way would be to use a dl definition list - which isn't allowed inside of paragraphs. This can be worked around with the following pattern: The party is at 10 o'clock on the 10th . 10 o'clock on the 10th 20051010T10:10:10-010 which requires a more sophisticated stylesheet: q[cite='#micro-dates']:before { content: ''; } q[cite='#micro-dates']:after { content: ''; } dl#micro-dates { display: none; }
