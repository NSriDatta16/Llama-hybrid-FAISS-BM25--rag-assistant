Recommendations for statistical models given my dataset

I'm having a problem when using the k-fold cross-validation with the Random Forest method. One of the outputs is the error "Error in randomForest.default(x, y, mtry = param$mtry, ...) : Need at least two classes to do classification." However, I already have two classes to do the classification, which are "Normal" and "Failure". When posting this question at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60643415/error-in-randomforest-defaultx-y-mtry-parammtry-need-at-least-two?noredirect=1#comment107290940_60643415 was recommended to me that I ask for "recommendations for statistical models given my data and your prediction/estimation/modeling needs". Someone could help me?
