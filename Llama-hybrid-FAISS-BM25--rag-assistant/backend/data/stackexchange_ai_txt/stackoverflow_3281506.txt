A second clock resolution is not suitable for measuring such fast operations. I suggest you execute your code many times (something like 1 million times; use a for loop for this), estimate the overall time and then compute an average value. This way you'll get more reliable results. Just a quick note: I see you use cout in your functions. This is a bad idea: cout and usually most I/O operations are slow regarding to other operations. It is likely that your functions will spend most of their time to print the value, instead of computing it.
