Maximum Likelihood as an Expectation

I am reading the Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, 2016) book. I don't have a statistical background, so I couldn't follow this part: How come by only dividing Equation (5.58) by m one can get Equation (5.59). As a follow-up question, many equations that involve summation are expressed in terms of Expectation. Is there a general way of explaining how a summation can be expressed as an expectation?
