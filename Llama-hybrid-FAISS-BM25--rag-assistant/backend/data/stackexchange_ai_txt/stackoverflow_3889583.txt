JavaScript wrapper for Google Gears / HTML5

Are there any JavaScript wrapper scripts available that can use HTML5 JavaScript features if they are available (e.g. locaStorage / Web Storage / anything in common between Google Gears and HTML5), falling back to Google Gears if the browser is not capable (e.g. IE6 or IE7) While it would be ideal that IE7/6 users all move to IE8 (or Chrome, Firefox, Opera), they will still be around for years to come (maybe IE6 will not last as long as IE7, but IE7 lacks any real JavaScript changes).
