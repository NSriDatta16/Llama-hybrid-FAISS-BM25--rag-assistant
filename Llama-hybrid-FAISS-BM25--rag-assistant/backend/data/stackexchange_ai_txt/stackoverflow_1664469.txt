If the data is going to be pretty sparse, you could use an array of hash tables. hash_map matrix[] = new hash_map [10000]; for (int i = 0; i (); Then to look up a value (x,y), you index the array with x and look up y in the hash table. A few things to watch out for: Deleting can get pretty expensive, as you have to iterate through a lot of the hash tables. Total storage can grow as you delete/insert, you should trim() your hash_maps occasionally. it should be easy to take advantage of symmetry.
