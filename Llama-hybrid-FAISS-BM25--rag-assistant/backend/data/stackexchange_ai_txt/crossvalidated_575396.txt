Your problem setup calls for a causal prediction setup. In particular for unit-level ( individual) treatment effect (ute) estimation. In your case data about incident and patients are features (X) triage decision is treatment (T) and 'what happened' are outcomes (Y) Triage incoming patients according to predicted treatment effect and budget constraints ( rank ute). A recent probabilistic neural network algorithm for this learning problem has been developed in "Predictive state propensity subclassification (PSPS)" by Kelly et al (2022) with implementation available at https://github.com/gmgeorg/pypsps .
