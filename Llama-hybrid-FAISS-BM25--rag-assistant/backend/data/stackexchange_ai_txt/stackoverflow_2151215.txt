Trigger a javascript click event from vb.net

I have a set of accordian divs (powered by the prototype library) in an asp.net page. I would like to save the state of the accordian, so when a postback event occurs, the same div is open rather than reloading the page entirely and opening the default div. My plan was to set a page control value with the ID of the open div using the div's toggler click event function, and then fire a click event after postback calling that same div (using the value of the control holding the div ID) as the target. I'm not sure how to fire a javascript click event from vb.net however, and this sure seems like a lame workaround. 1) can you tell me how to fire a javascript click event from the vb.net codebehind page -or- 2) is there a more elgant way to do this? Thanks
