It sounds like a piece of content in that column might have a defined width which is more than what the 25% of page width it is given. Can you provide CSS examples? EDIT : IE6 does not support inline-block which could also be the issue. EDIT 2 : I looked at it on a 1680x1050 screen in IE6 in a virtual machine. When I drag the width slowly over time from about 800px to 1600px, it randomly moves the right column around. I suspect it's an issue with the hack that you're trying to use. Your code is so simple that I think you should consider researching an alternate hack instead. I've also never seen the * : hack. What's the * do, all compliant browsers?
