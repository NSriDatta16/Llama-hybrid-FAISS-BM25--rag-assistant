PHP regex: match lines that do not start with an HTML tag?

This problem seems simple enough, and yet I cannot come across an example of it on the web... I am trying to create a preg_replace that takes a line at a time, and puts tags around it if it does not begin with an HTML character already. For instance, this paragraph becomes this paragraph while this content remains the same, with no tags being put around it. What would be the simplest way to achieve this?
