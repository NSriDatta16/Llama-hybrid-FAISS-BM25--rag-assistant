I recommend a simple regression $y_t\sim x_t$ or maybe even better $y_t\sim x_{t-1}$ . The reason is that before trying anything fancy you need to address multiple methodological issues. So, instead, I'm suggesting to do this in the simplest way and be done with it. For instance, what if the exchange rate is not the independent variable, but rather a dependent variable? This would actually make a sense from economics point of view: exchange rates can be a reaction to inflation. If the prices in one country are rising, and you believe in purchasing parity relationship then exchange rate will adjust to restore the parity. The prices (inflation) are determinants of the nominal interest rates, which are in turn determinants of exchange rate, e.g. through carry trade arbitrage. I'm saying if you're not willing to deal with this sort of issues, then why not run the simple model? On stationarity: if you run a formal unit root test on exchange rates they will probably show non stationary. However, why would they be non-stationary? The prices often are nonstationary, and you could look at the log returns of prices.
