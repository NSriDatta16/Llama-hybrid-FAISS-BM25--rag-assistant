Random investment returns from a normal distribution (and confidence intervals)

I work for a financial planning company and what I am trying to do is to project a client’s investment assets forward over several years. This is easy if we assume a constant return e.g. 7% every year. However I want to take account of fluctuations of returns and have therefore built in some random returns using excel following a normal distribution. I then want to show a 95% confidence interval for each return and show the client we are 95% confident that their £100k initial investment will be within £X and £Y in 5 years’ time. A mini example is as follows. The random returns below are generated by the function =NORM.INV(RAND(),6.8%,7.5%) in Excel. Yr 1 Yr 2 Yr 3 Yr 4 Yr 5 4.4% 14.8% -3.3% 9.9% 4.4% 9.7% 12.3% 11.2% 21.8% 4.6% -3.2% 14.0% 7.0% 10.7% -6.5% 5.4% 0.6% 0.0% 7.4% 6.9% 11.7% 6.4% -6.3% 17.8% -8.1% 26.9% -1.4% 2.3% 9.9% 4.5% 4.0% -1.6% 8.4% 3.8% 1.5% 10.7% -13.1% 7.1% 9.3% 17.7% -0.7% 0.8% -1.1% 0.1% 7.0% 9.6% 1.4% 20.3% 13.2% -3.4% Average 7.9% 3.4% 4.6% 10.4% 2.9% St Dev 8.3% 8.6% 7.9% 6.3% 7.5% CI Upper 13.0% 8.8% 9.4% 14.3% 7.5% CI Lower 2.7% -1.9% -0.3% 6.5% -1.8% Investment Amount £100,000 Future Fund Values Yr 1 Yr 2 Yr 3 Yr 4 Yr 5 Upper £112,995 £108,765 £109,434 £114,272 £107,528 Average £107,850 £103,420 £104,560 £110,390 £102,860 Lower £102,705 £98,075 £99,686 £106,508 £98,192 The question I have is because we are assuming the upper return and the lower return year on year, are we exaggerating the range? Although the confidence interval for each return is fine, it’s the cumulative effect of this year on year that I’m concerned about. Is what I’m doing statistically correct or can you advise on an alternative method. Any alternative method needs to be able to be iterated easily thousands of times and therefore cannot be too data intensive in Excel.
