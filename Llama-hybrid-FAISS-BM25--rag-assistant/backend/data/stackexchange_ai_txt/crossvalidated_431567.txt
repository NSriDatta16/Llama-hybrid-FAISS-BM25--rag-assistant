Is it possible to bootstrap a Diebold-Mariano test?

I am currently working on a small project where I want to use a (two-sided) 1-step ahead ( $h=1$ ) Diebold Mariano test to compare forecast losses for different realized measures calculated on time-series data. However, my supervisor told me to use a stationary bootstrap with average block length of 10 in order to increase the quality of statistical-inference in the forecast comparison analysis. Now, I'm wondering if I can use this bootstrap method on a Diebold-Mariano test (or if I should change the forecast comparison method entirely) and how I should proceed to do this? Any help would be very much appreciated! :-)
