Sadly I am forbidden by NDA agreements to tell you how to do this. I worked on the team that created a non-relational database that does exactly what you are trying to do. It is called Citadel. I can however point you to the link for what is publicly available, and it should give you some ideas of how it works. http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/6579 You could just buy the product, but it is rather expensive. Also as Karl points out this is generally Used in SCADA products like Wonderware , Lookout , and LabVIEW DSC . A search for SCADA data storage turns up some interesting reading as well. As an aside a relational databases can solve this problem if the amount of data is small. What tends to happen over time is that the data grows without bounds, and the relational database gets filled beyond its capacity. A good SCADA data storage system can easily handle 50000 points being polled at once a second. Though at some point even they start to get too large to handle easily.
