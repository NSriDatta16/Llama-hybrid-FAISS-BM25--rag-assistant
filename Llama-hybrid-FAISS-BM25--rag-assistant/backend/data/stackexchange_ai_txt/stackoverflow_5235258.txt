CSS3 Font Embedding

I'm trying to simply embed a font that I have uploaded to my server. Everything is being loaded correctly, but the wrong font is being displayed. I know this is happening because when I remove the @font-face code the rendered HTML font changes. Here's my code, I've played around with so many different things in the last hour so shout out whatever you think might work. I've also tried .TTF files. @font-face { font-family: Joan; src: url("../fonts/joan.otf") format('font/opentype'); } body { background: url('../images/bg.gif'); font-family: Joan; }
