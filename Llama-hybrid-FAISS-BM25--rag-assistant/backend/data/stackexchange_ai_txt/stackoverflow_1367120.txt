I have a simple Crud application where there is one filed called Category. During Creation , for Category I have provided a simple drop down box which lists all categories. During Editing, I need to get the same drop down box with the entry in the database chosen.How do i do this. For creation i used say Category: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifestyle Automobiles Food & Beverage Health How do i do this during editing, say I need to select 'Health' which is available in the variable $row['course detail']
