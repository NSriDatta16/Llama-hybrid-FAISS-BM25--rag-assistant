One simple way is to store the organization's parentage in a text field, like: SALES-EUROPE-NORTH To search for every sales organization, you can query on SALES-%. For each European sales org, query on SALES-EUROPE-%. If you rename an organization, take care to update its child organizations as well. This keeps it simple, without recursion, at the cost of some flexibility.
