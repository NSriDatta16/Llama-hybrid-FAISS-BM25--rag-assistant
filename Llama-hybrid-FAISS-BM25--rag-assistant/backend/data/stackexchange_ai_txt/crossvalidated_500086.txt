The use of vague or informative prior depends on the amount of knowledge that you have for the parameters that you want to assign the prior. I consider the following cases: No experts information and big/small data set, in that case, a vague prior would do the job Experts information and big/small data set, in that case, a more informative prior based on the beliefs of the expert would do the job So, the choice of the prior depends on the a priori information that you have and not the size of the data set. However, in the case where you have a small data set and experts information is available, then the bayesian narrative can work much better than the frequentists narrative.
