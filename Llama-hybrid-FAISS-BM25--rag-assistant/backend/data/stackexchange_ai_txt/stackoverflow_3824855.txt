If an emailaddress is unique and static in your population (and make very sure it is), you may make it a primary key, and actually a full normalization would favor that option. There are however some pitfalls to consider: People change emailaddresses once in while. What if a student becomes a professor, or is harassed on his/hers emailaddress so he/she applied for a new address and got one? The primary key shold not change, ever, so there goes your schema. Sanitizing emailaddresses takes a little bit more effort then integers. Depending on how many foreign keys point to this ID, needed storage space could be increased, and joining on CHARs rather then INTs could suffer in performance (you should test that though)
