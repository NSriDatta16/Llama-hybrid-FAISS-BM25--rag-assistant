What can you use the HTML5 storage feature for?

Not sure if I understand HTML5 storage correctly. Is it just kind of a an advanced cookie store where user data can be persisted without a particular schema - like a key/value store? If so, what types of features could it be used for? I'm having a hard time imagining how it could be applied in a web app that already has its own server-side persistence mechanism - not to mention the complexity of performing sync between client storage and server-side storage.
