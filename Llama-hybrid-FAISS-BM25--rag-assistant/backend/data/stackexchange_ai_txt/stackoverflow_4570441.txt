Few things to consider: In your processDrops function, you pass in windPower but use some sort of class member or global called WindPower , is that a typo? If the value of Gravity does not change, then save the calculation (i.e. mult by 0.1) and use that directly. In your update function, rather than calculating windPower * elapsed and Gravity * elapsed for every iteration, calculate and save that before the loop, then add. Also, re-organise the loop, there is no need to do the speed calculation and render if the drop is out of the screen, do the check first, and if the drop is still in the screen, then update the speed and render! Interestingly, you never check to see if the drop is out of the screen interms of it's x co-ordinate, you check the height, but not the width, you could save yourself some calculations and rendering time if you did this check as well!
