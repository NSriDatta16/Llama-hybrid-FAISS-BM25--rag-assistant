Difference between graph neural network and graph convolutional network

Which characteristics my neural network (NN) model should have to be considered as a graph convolutional network (GCN) instead of a graph neural network (GNN)? I know that GCN is a variant of GNN, but what is the difference between these two types of NNs?
