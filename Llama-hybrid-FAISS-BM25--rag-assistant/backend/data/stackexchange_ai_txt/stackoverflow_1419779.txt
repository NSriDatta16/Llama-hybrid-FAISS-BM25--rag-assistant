How To Present A Large List Of Items For User To Choose One?

I am building a Silverlight application where one of the tasks will involve the user selecting one item from a list of approximately 1300 items. What would be some of the best ways to present this list to the user? I think 1300 items in a ComboBox is too many. Is it? What are the best practices for this kind of situation? The items are inventory locations that have a pattern such as: Row 1 - Aisle 1 - Level 1 Row 1 - Aisle 1 - Level 2 ... Row 1 - Aisle 2 - Level 1 ... Row 2 - Aisle 1 - Level 1 and so on. There will also be some other locations such as: Shipping Dock, Staging Area etc... I would like to possibly have a TextBox and ListBox where the ListBox would start be populated with matches to what the user enters into the TextBox. The data could be from a web service or stored in Isolated Storage?
