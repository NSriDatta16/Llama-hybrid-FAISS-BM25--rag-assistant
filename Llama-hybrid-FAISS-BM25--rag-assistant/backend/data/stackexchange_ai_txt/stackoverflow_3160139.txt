Neural networks aren't really very biological. They resemble, at a very general level, the architecture of neurons, but it's a great exaggeration to say that they work "just like the brain" (an exaggeration that's encouraged by some neural-net advocates, alas). Neural nets are mostly used for fuzzy, difficult problems that don't yield to traditional algorithmic approaches. IOWs, there are more "suitable" solutions for computers, but sometimes those solutions don't work, and in those cases one approach is a neural network.
