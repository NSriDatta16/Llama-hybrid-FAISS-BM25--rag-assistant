You can try Perplexity or Coherence Score for the number of topics. Perplexity is a statistical measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. As applied to LDA , for a given value of k, you estimate the LDA model. Then given the theoretical word distributions represented by the topics, compare that to the actual topic mixtures, or distribution of words in your documents. - Lower the better . Coherence Score is defined as the average/median of the pairwise word-similarity scores of the words in the topic - The higher the better . Perplexity R implementation
