For assessing "might" try this: File:htdocs/mix/extraction.php and call it like that: http://localhost/mix/extraction.php?_SERVER=test After the extract on my Xampp the output looks something like that: string(4) "test" If any one knows anything about your variable naming and you use extract on $_POST or $_GET globals, then you have a serious problem. With a bit of time and work it would be possible to find out some namings by try and error. Without knowing your source an intruder could try to hijack any global variabl like $_SESSION (but here it will only take any effect if you do the session_start(); before the extract($_GET), $_COOKIE or $_SERVER and even set specific values for them like that: //localhost/mix/extraction.php?_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT]=Iphone If you use extract like that: extract($var,EXTR_SKIP); extract($var,EXTR_PREFIX_SAME,'prefix'); extract($var,EXTR_PREFIX_ALL,'prefix'); then you will be perfectly safe.
