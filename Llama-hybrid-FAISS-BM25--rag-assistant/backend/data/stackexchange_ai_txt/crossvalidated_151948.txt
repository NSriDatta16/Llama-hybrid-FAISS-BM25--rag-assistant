Since you expect a trend in you data, Holt-Winters could be a good candidate. There also is an extension that deals with cyclic data (seasonality), triple exponential smoothing. These models are generalizations of simple, weighted and exponential moving average. They help to filter noisy data and to forecast. For more information see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing Change detection can be added by checking if the forecast is positive. Time-out periods I would somehow fit in manual.
