A precision matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix. In Bayesian analysis, the precision matrix is often characterized by inverse-Wishart distribution conjugate priors. For Gaussian random vectors, zero entries in the precision matrix imply conditional independence of corresponding pair of variables.
