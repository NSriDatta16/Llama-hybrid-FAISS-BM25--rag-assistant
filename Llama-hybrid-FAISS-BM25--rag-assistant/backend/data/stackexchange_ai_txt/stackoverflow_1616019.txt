The is second-hand information, but I understand they use inverted indexes (indices?) for finding the top 100 or so results, and then they use a set of neural networks to narrow it down several times to the top 10, top 3, and then to find the first one. They do this because they reason the first hit is what makes a user thing the search engine works or not. If you search for CNN and you don't get CNN.com as the first hit, users think the engine doesn't work. Again, this is second-hand knowledge. I heard this from a friend who worked at MS for a while on their search team.
