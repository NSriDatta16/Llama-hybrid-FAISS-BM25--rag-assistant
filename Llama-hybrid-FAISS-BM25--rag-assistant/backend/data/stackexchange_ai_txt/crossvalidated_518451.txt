Example: Suppose you have $n = 1000$ randomly chosen subjects of whom $x = 889$ are 'engaged.' Then the estimated proportion engaged in the population is $p = x/n = 0.889.$ Wald confidence intervals are intended for use with such large samples. A 95% Wald CI is of the form $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$ Using R as a calculator, we get the 95% CI $(0.870, 0.908),$ rounded to three places. n = 1000; x = 889 p.est = x/n; p.est [1] 0.889 se = sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/n); se [1] 0.00993373 ci = p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*se; ci [1] 0.8695302 0.9084698 If this does not answer your question, please say what part of it seems different from what is being done in your course. Note: There are many styles of CIs for a binomial proportion (google confidence interval binomial proportion ; perhaps see the Wikipedia article, in particular). One additional style, called the Jeffries CI, relies on a Bayesian derivation, but has very good properties as a frequentist CI. For the data above the 95% Jeffreys CI is $(0.868, 0.907),$ easily computed in R as shown below. This style of confidence interval never gives endpoints outside of $(0,1).$ n = 1000; x = 889 qbeta(c(.025,.975), x+.5, n-x+.5) [1] 0.8684107 0.9073418
