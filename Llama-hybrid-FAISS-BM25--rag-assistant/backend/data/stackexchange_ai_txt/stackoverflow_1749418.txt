I had the same problem ages ago. Try check the version of Flash. Maybe there is something to do with the Flash Image uploader. Is the image showing 100% and then stopping? This could possibly be a space issue. Check if you have enough space. You also need to set permissions to the media, upload directories after a move or upgrade. Try the Magento Forums with the specific query. There have been issues with images in the past.
