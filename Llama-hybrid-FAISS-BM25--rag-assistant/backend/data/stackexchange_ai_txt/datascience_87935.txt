How to use embedding to reduce features for a regression problem

I’m working on a regression problem in which I’d like to predict demand of different items. I have used holidays as a feature in my model, in a hot encoded format, i.e. I have 11 binary features each representing one holiday. I’d like to reduce the size of my features and thinking to used embedding on the holiday features to represent them in lower dimensions. I’m new to embedding. My question whether it make sense or not and if it does any hints on how to do it?
