Building on the comments to the question ... Unless these PNR's are arbitrary alpha-numerics as user777 points out, this seems to be a problem best solved with a Regular Expression. You mention that all 70 "IsPNR" tags are 1 so you don't have a negative case to train with either, also making machine learning a bad choice.
