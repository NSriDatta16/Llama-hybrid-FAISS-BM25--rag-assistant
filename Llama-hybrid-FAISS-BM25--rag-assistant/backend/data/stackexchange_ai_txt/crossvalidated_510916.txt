Multiclass classification metrics : average probability

I'm looking for a metric to evaluate my classification model. I have 3 differents class (0,1,2). And I want to get the average probability of the good label. For example, if my ml model get me those probas : [[0.5, 0.25, 0.25], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]] And the true labels are [0,1,0], then the evaluation result should be (0.5+0.8+0.7)/3 = 0.66. Does this metric has a name ?
