VAR - ARCH LM Test results are conflicting

I'm using the R package vars to model multivariate series with VAR of order p = 5 . The multivariate series is: $$ Y_t = \{y_{1,t}; y_{2,t}; y_{3,t}\}^\top $$ In order to stabilize the time series, I calculated the relative differences (return) of each element: $$ x_{i, t} = \frac{y_{t} - y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}} $$ When I test the residuals for heteroskedasticity with the function arch.test , which implements an ARCH-LM test, I get conflicting results. For example, with arch.test(data.var, lags.multi = 1) , I get: > ht ht ARCH (multivariate) data: Residuals of VAR object data.var Chi-squared = 27.663, df = 36, p-value = 0.839 which tells me to accept the null hypothesis. But when I run arch.test(data.var, lags.multi = 2) , then I get: > ht ht ARCH (multivariate) data: Residuals of VAR object data.var Chi-squared = 295.84, df = 72, p-value now the result is that I should reject the null hypothesis and hence my multivariate time series is heteroskedastic. If I continue increasing the lags.multi parameter, the p-value closes to zero. Why different test lags result in a different result? Should I use another method to stabilize my time series?
