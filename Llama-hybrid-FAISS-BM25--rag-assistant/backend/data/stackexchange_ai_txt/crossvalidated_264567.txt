What does it mean "systematic departure from hypothesis"?

In the following article which (among other things) tries to explain the difference between statistics and data science, I've read the following quote: ... unlike statistics—which is concerned largely with testing the hypotheses and stops there—data science focuses on the implications of systematic departures from hypotheses (as evidenced by statistical tests) and the bigger conclusions we can make as a result of those departures. Can someone please explain in simple words what does it mean ?
