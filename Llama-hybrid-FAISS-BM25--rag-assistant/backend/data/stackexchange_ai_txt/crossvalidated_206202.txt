Confidence bands for model averaged predictions of GLMMs

I use R with the MuMIn package for Multimodel inference. My global Model is M.global After that I use M.dredge To calculate all possible models from the global model and rank them by AICc. m.max limits the number of predictor to 3 and dc is a dependency chain, so the function takes the squared c1 only if unsquared c1 is included. m.max is used since the total sample size is 30, and according to Harrels 10:1 rule of thumb there is amximum of 3 predictors to avoid overfitting. The I use M.avg to get the model average across a subset of candidate models with a maximum difference of 4 AICc points to the "best" model having the lowest AICc. fit = TRUE refits every model in the subset. Now I can use M.avg to get the averaged (full and conditional) coefficients for all predictors included in the subset as well as for the confdidence intervals: Coef Now my question: Using poisson GLMMs and model averaging, how can I calculate model predictions and according confidence intervals for these predictions, to be used in a graph showing the regression line and confidence bands for that line? Here they fill in the coefficients in the Model formula by hand and calculate point estimates for a given value (0, and 0.25) for the predictor f . Afterwards they repeat the procedure with the lower and the upper value of the confidence interval for the coefficients. However, I repeated that and I got something like this:
