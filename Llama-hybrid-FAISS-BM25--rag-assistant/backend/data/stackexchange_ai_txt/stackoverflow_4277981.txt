I've had some good success with the Adorner system in WPF. It allows you to bung an overlay virtually anywhere. Check out the MSDN here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743737.aspx Previously, I have created an adorner to follow the mouse during a DragDrop, to show the information I'm dragging (like dragging from iTunes). At a guess for your program, you could capture the hover and create an adorner rather like a ToolTip.
