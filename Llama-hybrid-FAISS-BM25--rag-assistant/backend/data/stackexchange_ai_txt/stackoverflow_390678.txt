Sphinx can be useful for generating very verbose and informative docs that go above and beyond what simple API docs give you. However in many cases you'll be better served to use a wiki for these kind of documents. Also consider writing functional tests which demonstrate the usage of your code instead of documenting in words how to use your code. Epydoc is very good at scanning your docstrings and looking at your code to generate API documents but is not necessarily good at giving much more in-depth information. There is virtue to having both types of documentation for a project. However if you get in a time crunch it is always more beneficial to have good test coverage and meaningful tests than documentation.
