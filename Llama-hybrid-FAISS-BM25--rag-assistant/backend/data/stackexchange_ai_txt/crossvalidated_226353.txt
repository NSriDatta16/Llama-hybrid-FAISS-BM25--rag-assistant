I'd add that if you directly use a State Space function, you're probably going to have to understand the several matrices that make up a model, and how they interact and work. It's much more like defining a program than defining an ARIMA model. If you're working with a dynamic State Space model, it gets even more complicated. If you use a software package that has a really, really nice State Space function, you may be able to avoid some of this, but the vast majority of such functions in R packages require you to jump into the details at some point. In my opinion, it's a lot like Bayesian statistics in general, the machinery of which takes more understanding, care, and feeding to use than more frequentist functions. In both cases, it's well worth the additional details/knowledge, but it could be a barrier to adoption.
