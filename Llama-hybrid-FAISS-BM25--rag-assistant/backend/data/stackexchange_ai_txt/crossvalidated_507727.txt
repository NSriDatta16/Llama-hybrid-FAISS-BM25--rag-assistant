Should I consider a different definition of control? Yes you absolutely should! Comparing to the "average" performance is just asking to be dooped by regression to the mean. Some variants will naturally perform worse than the average, but they might do better than business as usual. That would be a win. Additionally, your comment "determining if/ when there is a statistically significant winner/loser" makes me worried about peeking. You should not be peeking or checking if the result is statistically significant yet. Unless done correctly, that will destroy the validity of the experiment. Stick to traditional designs. Keep $n$ small, use business as usual as the control, and either end the experiment when you've attained your prespecified sample size or use techniques which allow for intermittent analysis.
