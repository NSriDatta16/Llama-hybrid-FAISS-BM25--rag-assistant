Update: Oops.. see that you want this in MSTest. Sorry. Speed read & Misled by your title. Try this extension project from Callum Hibbert and see if it works. Old response: You can do this with NUnit 2.4 and above. See documentation of ExpectedException here [ExpectedException( typeof( ArgumentException), ExpectedMessage="unspecified", MatchType=MessageMatch.Contains )] public void TestMethod() { ... MatchType can be Exact (default), Contains or Regex.. which pretty much handles the 80% use-case. There is also an advanced exception handler method approach if the verification gets too complex.. never used it personally.. didn't need it yet.
