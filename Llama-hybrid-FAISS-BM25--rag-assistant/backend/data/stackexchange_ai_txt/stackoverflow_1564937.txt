gcc warning" 'will be initialized after'

I am getting a lot of these warnings from 3rd party code that I cannot modify. Is there a way to disable this warning or at least disable it for certain areas (like #pragma push/pop in VC++)? Example: list.h:1122: warning: `list >::node_alloc_' will be initialized after list.h:1117: warning: `allocator list >::alloc_'
