notification for touches ended

I am a little newbie regarding notifications on the iPhone. What I am trying to do is this: I have an object using a class based on UIImageView. This class has its own implementations of touchbegan, touchesended, etc. Is that possible for the main program to know when the user lifted his finger from the object? In other words, is it possible to create a notification from the class to the main application's view controller (using the class) so it will fire a method? The method should be on the main application, not on the class. Is this possible? Can you give an example? thanks for any help.
