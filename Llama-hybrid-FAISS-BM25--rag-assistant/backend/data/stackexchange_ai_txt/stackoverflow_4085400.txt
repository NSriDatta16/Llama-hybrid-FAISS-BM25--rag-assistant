I might be completely off, but I think setSelection doesn't necessarely checks your item (as in checkbox, or radio), it navigates to it though. As a workaround (maybe there is a more elegant solution) you can extend ArrayAdapter and set checked manually in a getView() method. Add something like this to your class: private static class MArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter { public Adapter(final Context context, final String[] objects) { super(context, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_single_choice, objects); } @Override public View getView(final int position, final View convertView, final ViewGroup parent) { final CheckedTextView view = (CheckedTextView) super.getView(position, convertView, parent); view.setChecked(position == 2); return view; } } And change your way of getting an adapter to new MArrayAdapter(this, items); P.S. On my previous comment, my mistake, you better call setChoiceMode (it's just in my app, I call notifyDataSetChanged, so I don't really need it). I think your'r up to some weird behaviour without choice mode.
