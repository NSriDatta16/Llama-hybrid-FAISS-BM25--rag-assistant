Programming in any sort of programming language, you have several different types of data at your disposal, including the very useful array type. Interchanging data between Javascript and any server side language can only happen through strings. I.e. you can send and return any text , but there's no way to send a native array or number type. JSON is an elegant way to express array and other types using only a string. This way you can pass arbitrary data back and forth between different environments and are not limited to pure text. XML solves the same kind of problem, but is often overkill for simple AJAX requests.
