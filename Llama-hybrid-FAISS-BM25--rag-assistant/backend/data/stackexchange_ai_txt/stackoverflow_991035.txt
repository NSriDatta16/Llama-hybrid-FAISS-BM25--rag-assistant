Setting copyright statement on a per-project basis?

I'm an independent developer working primarily with iPhone applications, and I'm currently engaged in several different projects. Some are for myself, and others are for one of a number of clients. Because of this, I'd like to have a way to have Xcode set the copyright notice at the top of each source file on a per-project basis. I've seen these questions , and I understand that Xcode by default pulls the organization on the user's Address Book contact card for the copyright statement, and that you can change the property either in the Address Book or on the terminal. What I'm looking for is a setting that lets that default be changed for each project, and has Xcode remember the copyright assignee (i.e. I don't want to have to change my Address Book organization entry each time I switch projects).
