What is the real benefit to make Pixel perfect cross browser compatible site? Consistency. While nobody will surf same site on multiple browsers and OS. I wouldn't say that, think desktop and mobile browser. Why anyone think(client or boss) that pixel perfect look is necessary? "Necessary" is indeed the keyword. Often it isn't. People are still used to print magazines though. What is business and personal benefit to give time to make site look same in all browsers? That's up to you to decide. It depends on how important consistency is for you and how high your level of consistency needs to be. Why anybody will surf same site on multiple browsers and OS? Because people own more and more internet capable widgets. Is pixel perfection madness? Yes. Why Clients give more attention to pixel perfect compatibility than Accessibility and usability of a site? They only see that it looks one way in their demo browser and another way in another browser, and they think the site breaks in the other browser. Which may or may not be true. Some define "break" as "font looks different" , while others define it as "two paragraphs are overlapping and become unreadable." The question is were to draw the line. Also, see above, people are used to print magazines and can't understand why on earth the same thing would look different on two different platforms. Most people don't even know what a browser is, try to explain the abstraction of HTML, CSS, font rendering and rendering differences to them...
