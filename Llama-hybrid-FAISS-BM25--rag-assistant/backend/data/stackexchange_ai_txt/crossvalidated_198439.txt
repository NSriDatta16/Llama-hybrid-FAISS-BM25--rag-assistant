Are there any reasons to use the identity link in logistic regression (or any other glm)?

From this answer , the following statement is posed: ' Though not "wrong", you'd want a good reason for using an identity link to model a Bernoulli probability. ' I would like to know what good reasons would result in an identity link being used for logistic regression, if these exist. Do these reasons generalise to GLMs?
