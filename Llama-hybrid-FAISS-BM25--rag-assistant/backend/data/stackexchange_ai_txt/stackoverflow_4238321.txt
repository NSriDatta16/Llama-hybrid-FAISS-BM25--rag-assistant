Didn't quite understand what you were trying to do + your example on jsFiddle is a bit broken here is a more simplified(i hope) version of your markup http://jsfiddle.net/avipinto/F95x3/2/ i put the spans between the images to show the transition between images as you supplied the same image to them all. if all your problem is the positioning the text below the slideshow then give the container of the images height. if you want different title to each image - look at the source of the page of the plugin - he uses the following code: $('#slideshow3').cycle({ delay: 2000, speed: 500, before: onBefore }); function onBefore() { $('#title').html(this.alt); } and html: much more elegant and accessible than spitting spans all over the place Hope this helps
