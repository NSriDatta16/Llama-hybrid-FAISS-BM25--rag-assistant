Binomial GLM in R: the same data, but two different models

Consider a logistic regression on these data: X1 X2 Y 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 R accepts three different representations of the data: one row per table entry, and two condensed representations (one with weights, one with successes and failures). In my mind, these three specifications should all be the same mathematically: the data is the same 7 observations, and they are presented to R in different formats. data1 Models 2 and 3 are the same, which makes sense. But Model 1 is different from model 2 and 3 and I can't reason out why the same data should return different model statistics (coefficients, null and residual deviance) than the others. Models 2 and 3 just use a different representation of the same data. This might be a red herring, but Model 1 has its coefficients shifted by 4 units compared to Model 2, which is exactly the difference in the number of (populated) rows/residual degrees of freedom between the two. > model1 Call: glm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2, family = "binomial", data = data1) Coefficients: (Intercept) x1 x2 -19.66 19.66 18.57 Degrees of Freedom: 6 Total (i.e. Null); 4 Residual Null Deviance: 9.561 Residual Deviance: 7.271 AIC: 13.27 > model2 Call: glm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2, family = "binomial", data = data2, weights = w) Coefficients: (Intercept) x1 x2 -23.66 23.66 22.57 Degrees of Freedom: 2 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 2.289 Residual Deviance: 3.167e-10 AIC: 9.112
