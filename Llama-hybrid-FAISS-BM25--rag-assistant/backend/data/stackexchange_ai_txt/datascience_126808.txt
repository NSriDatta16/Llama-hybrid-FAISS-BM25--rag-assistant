A few years ago a blog post criticizing Prophet became very popular: https://www.microprediction.com/blog/prophet . One of the Prophet authors commented on the issue, basically agreeing with the post in this Twitter thread The author of the post talks a lot about time series forecasting on his blog ( https://www.microprediction.com/blog ), and maintains a ranking with comparisons between different approaches ( https://www.microprediction.com/ blog/fast). I think you can get ideas from there. In general, Python people seem to tend to use pmdarima or other packages that have an auto-ARIMA implementation, while R people tend to use auto.arima from the forecast package.
