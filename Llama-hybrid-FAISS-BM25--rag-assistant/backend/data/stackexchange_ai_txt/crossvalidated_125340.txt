repeated measures ranking data

I have a repeated measures design where 180 participants rank their preferences for 12 items at time1, and then undergo an intervention, and then they rank their preferences for the same 12 items again at time2. The 12 items are split between 2 factors, e.g, there are 12 foods, 6 are junk food, 6 are healthy. I am trying to come up with a test that would show whether or not the intervention changes the rankings based on the factor, more specifically, if the participants ranked junk food more highly than healthy food in the first ranking, but then rated healthy food more highly than junk food after the intervention. Ideally I'd like to show an interaction such that junk > healthy at time1 and healthy A paired samples ttest or a repeated measures anova doesnt seem appropriate given that the ranking data is not independent. Any suggestions for analyses or papers that could help? I am supplying another example to better illustrate the concept. Suppose I have the hypotheses that all people prefer coffee to tea, but believe their mothers prefer tea to coffee. One way I could do this is to have people rate their preferences for 6 kinds of coffee and 6 kinds of tea, then supply ratings for what they believe their mothers' preferences are. All ratings would be done independently so in this case I would run a 2: beverage type(average rating for coffee, average rating for tea) x 2: rating for whom (self, mother) repeated measures ANOVA and show that people have a preference for coffee but expect their mothers to have a preference for tea. Now imagine, instead of ratings I asked people to rank order their preferences for the 6 teas and 6 coffees all in one question, then on the next screen I asked them to rank order their mothers preferences. Is there an analysis for raNKing data that is analogous to the repeated measures ANOVA for raTing data?
