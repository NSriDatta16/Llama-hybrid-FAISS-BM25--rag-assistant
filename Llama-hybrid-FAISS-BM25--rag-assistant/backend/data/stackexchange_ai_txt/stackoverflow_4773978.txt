These can be used together with the new elements introduced for applications: An API for playing of video and audio which can be used with the new video and audio elements. An API that enables offline Web applications. An API that allows a Web application to register itself for certain protocols or media types. An editing API in combination with a new global contenteditable attribute. A drag & drop API in combination with a draggable attribute.
