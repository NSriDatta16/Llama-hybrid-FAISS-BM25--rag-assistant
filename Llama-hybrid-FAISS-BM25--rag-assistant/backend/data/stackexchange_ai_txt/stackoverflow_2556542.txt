I have never thought of makefiles as problems, they are quite usefull... The frequency would depend on the platform that you're using and your role. For example, in some organizations there is a fairly fixed build file that doesn't often change, while in others there are frequent changes. Some organizations rely on the IDE to deal with the build, etc. You don't have to be the build engineer. I think that most C/C++ developers should have at least some fundamental understanding of how makefiles work, though they don't have to be gurus. In my alma mater, that is part of first-year CS.
