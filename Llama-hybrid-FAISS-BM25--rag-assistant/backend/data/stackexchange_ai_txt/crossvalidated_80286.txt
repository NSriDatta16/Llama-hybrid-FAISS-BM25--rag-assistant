Running a statistical test to generate a p-value may not be the best way to quantify how "representative" a sample is. I think this may be what @NickCox is getting at. Take the extreme case where you sample only 3 people, because you have so few degrees of freedom, you may conclude that the sample is representative, even if its average characteristics are way off. On the other side of things, suppose you draw a very very large sample whose characteristics are significantly different, but are only off by a fraction of a percent. This latter case could happen if, for example, the census is slightly outdated and the demographics of the community have shifted by only a tiny bit. Thus, I think a more direct measure of how representative a sample is simply to state the % difference (as you mention).
