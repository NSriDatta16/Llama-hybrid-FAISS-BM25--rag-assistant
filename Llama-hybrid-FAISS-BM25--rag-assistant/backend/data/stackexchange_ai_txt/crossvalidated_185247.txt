How to interpret the Accuracy and Importance in RandomForest test from Cox regression models

I am trying to use random forest to show the results from Cox regression analysis. I have 757 samples with complete follow-up data (456 cases and 301 control). The case is defined as scores scores >=12. The status of case is coded as 1, and control is 0.The follow-up time is showed in another variable called time . The other variables were age , glucose glu , interested molecular levels marker and the other confounders. Firstly, I used the survival analysis to find out the most significant model as below: coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + glu + marker + hdl + smoking + drinking, data=raw) It turns out the glu and marker has significant interaction: the marker is significantly higher in the patients than the control if the patients also has high glu . The I use the random forest in two models. One is for scores , the other is for status : model1 The importance of predictors in the two models were like this: model1: OOB estimate of error rate: 82.3% model2: OOB estimate of error rate: 33.55% I prefer to use model1 because the MeanDecreaseAccuracy is better to be showed in the paper, but its accuracy is only 17.7%. Do you think this accuracy is acceptable? Or the model2 is better? What is the other suggestion you would give in this case? I posted this question in the wrong place stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34111732/how-to-interperate-the-accuracy-and-importance-in-randomforest-test-from-cox-reg so I migrated it to cross-validated.
