Cumulative Effect

Let $X_t$ be a causal AR( $p$ ) model. If we have $n$ observations of this time series and fit an AR( $m$ ) model with $m\gt p$ to the data; that is $$X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \cdots + \phi_m X_{t-m} + W_t,$$ the quantity $1/(1 - \phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_m)$ is called the cumulative effect. Is there any result on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic (when $\phi$ 's are replaced by their MLEs) as well as its applications?
