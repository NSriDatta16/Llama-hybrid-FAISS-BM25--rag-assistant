touchesBegan/touchesMoved/touchesEnded is probably the way to go. Depending on exactly what you are trying to do, UIGestureRecognizer may also be an option. To make sure subviews pass events up, set userInteractionEnabled to YES on the subviews. UIView sets this to YES by default, but some subclasses (notably UILabel) override this and set it to NO.
