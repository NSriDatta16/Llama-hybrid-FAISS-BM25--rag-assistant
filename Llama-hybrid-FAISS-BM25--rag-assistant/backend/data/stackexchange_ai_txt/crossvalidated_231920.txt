I think, the modeling approaches and estimation techniques should be viewed seperately. From modeling point of view, Lumley model only works for two-arm trials only. So it is not preferable. To my understanding, node-splitting approach, which you listed as Dias et al, is very intuitive. Also, I think you should add the design-by-treatment interaction approach ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777711 ). From estimation point of view, I dont know much about frequentist techniques, but one can use MCMC for almost all models for NMA. Lastly, there is a different technique (which is not widely known unfortunately) called INLA. You can use INLA from within R and fit NMA models, it is faster and no need to check convergence diagnostics. Here is the paper http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360927 . So, at the end I would prefer node-splitting and the design-by-treatment interaction approach using INLA.
