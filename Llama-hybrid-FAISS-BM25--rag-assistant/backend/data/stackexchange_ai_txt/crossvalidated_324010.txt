My favorite example is number of fingers by gender. The vast majority of people have 10 fingers. Some have lost fingers due to accidents. Some have extra fingers. I don't know if men have more fingers than women (on average). All the easily available evidence suggests that men and women both have 10 fingers. However, I am highly confident that if I did a census of all men and all women then I would learn that one gender has more fingers (on average) than the other.
