Google Maps API V3: fromContainerPixelToLatLng

I'm currently working on a project that requires that I have a div stacked above a Google Map. However, I need to pass the mousemove event of the div to the Map. To do that, I need to find the LatLng co-ordinates from the map container pixel co-ordinate (since triggering the Maps mousemove event requires the LatLng co-ordinates). Is there any other way to pass the mousemove event from the div to the map, and if not, how do I go from the Map container co-ordinates to LatLng. I read that doing so requires creating a dummy overlay, and then using the getProjection() on that to get a MapCanvasProjection , and finally calling the fromContainerPixelToLatLng() . Is there any simpler way or do I really have to create a dummy overlay first?
