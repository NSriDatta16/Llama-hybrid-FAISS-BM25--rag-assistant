How can I add a namespace in C# Express 2008?

Right now everything falls in this namespace: XXX.YYY.(varies) It's an open source project and I'm refactoring it to suit our needs. That part works fine, but I need to add another namespace after YYY for organizational reasons. So every single class will read XXX.YYY.ZZZ.(varies) How can I do that?
