I promise I am in no way affiliated with DevExpress , however, having used Telerik , Infragistics and DevExpress , if you are looking for a 3rd party control, in my experience, the DevExpress controls are by far my favourite in usability, functionality and look and feel. I have not used ComponentOne , as mentioned above, so I cannot comment on them.
