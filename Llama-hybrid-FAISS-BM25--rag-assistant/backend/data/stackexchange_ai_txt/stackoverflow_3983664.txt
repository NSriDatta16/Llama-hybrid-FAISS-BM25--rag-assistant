Perhaps one of the simplest things you could do given what you've got already is to wrap the grid in an update panel. Add an aspx button to the page but make it's visibility hidden. Add an async trigger to the update panel based on the click event of that hidden button. When the ajax call succeeds, call $("[id$=btnId]").click(). Add an event handler in your code behind of that button to update your grid. Not the most elegant solution, but it's probably the quickest win for what you've currently got.
