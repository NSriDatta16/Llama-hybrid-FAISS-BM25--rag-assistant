JQuery draggable element with image - problems dragging in IE and Chrome

I have divs that are defined as draggables. The divs contains one image and some text each. Dragging works perfectly in Firefox and Opera, but in Chrome and IE I can only start the drag by mousedown on the text, not the image. When I mousedown on the image in IE and Chrome, the built in html element drag-drop browser function kicks in - trying to drag only the image element (lika a cut n paste thing). How can I override this?
