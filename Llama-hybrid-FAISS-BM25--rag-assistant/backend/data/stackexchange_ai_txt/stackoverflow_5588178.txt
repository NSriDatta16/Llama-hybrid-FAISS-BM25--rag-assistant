DragnDrop Uploads and Image_FUpload also work with imagefield, which may make image uploading easier for batch uploads: http://drupal.org/project/dragndrop_uploads http://drupal.org/project/image_fupload As suggested by Amateur Barista, I think CCK is the way to go, I don't think the number of images will be a problem. Just make sure it's not running on a slow server.
