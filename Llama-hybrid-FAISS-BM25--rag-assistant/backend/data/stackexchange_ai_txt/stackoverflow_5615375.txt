inline block problem on firefox and internet explore

I am having a difficult time with how ie and firefox are displaying inline-block. I should probably point out that Google chrome displays it as intended.. Sean val The problem occurs in firefox and ie when i write a longer name in the paragraph above, in the parapgrah above. in firefox and ie, the cell div moves up thereby making the layout look weird and inconsistent. .cell { display: inline-block; display:-moz-inline-stack; border: 3px solid #ff0000; padding: 7px; height: 170px; zoom: 1; *display: inline; _height: 170px; } .cell p { padding: 10px 25px; width: 150px; }
