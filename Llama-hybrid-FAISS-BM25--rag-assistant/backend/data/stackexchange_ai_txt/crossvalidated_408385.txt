Estimate mean of a population with multiple samples when the individual sample mean is biased

I am working with datasets of grades going ~15 years back for different classes. I am trying to determine if there is a difference in the average grade for odd years compared to even years. There is a big event going on for several weeks during the exam period every even year close to the university, and I want to see if this affects the students grades. I am only experienced with working with single samples from a population and estimating mean, variance etc. My initial though was to find the mean/variance for each year, then estimate the total mean/variance using an unbiased linear estimator weighted by sample size (number of students taking the class that year). However, I suspect this is not correct because the relative difficulty of the exam changes, this would of course affect every grade for that year. How do I adjust for this bias in the individual sample mean, which I assume is independent from the fact that it is an odd/even year?
