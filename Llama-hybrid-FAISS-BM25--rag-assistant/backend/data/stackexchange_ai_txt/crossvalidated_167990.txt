Frequentist statistics

Frequentist inference is the only form of statistics taught in my department, and I feel like it has a strong hold over many students here. But when I read data science blogs, I get the feeling that frequentist methods, ANOVAs, t-tests etc. are really looked down upon, which is in stark contrast to all the other graduate students around me I understand that a problem with frequentist methods is the strong assumptions that get made (which vary depending on the specific method). This is in essence saying you need clean data and that is very rarely the case in real life Can anyone provide some real life examples of where/why frequentist methods would fail? I'm looking for some strong arguments that I could make against those who hold such a strong pro belief in my department
