Is there a simpler, more elegant solution? Well, it depends a bit on what "react differently" means. Let's suppose you want to raise a Notification if your activities are not in the foreground, but you want to pop a dialog if an activity is in the foreground. In that case, you need some communication path from the service to the activity anyway. So, register a callback (supplied by the activity) with the service in onResume() and unregister it in onPause() . Your service uses the callback if one exists; if there is no callback, it raises the Notification . You could accomplish the same thing with a broadcast Intent (register/unregister the receiver in the activity in onResume() / onPause() ) if you wanted.
