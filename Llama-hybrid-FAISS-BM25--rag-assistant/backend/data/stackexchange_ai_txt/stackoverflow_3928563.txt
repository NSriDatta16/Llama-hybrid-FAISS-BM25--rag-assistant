jquery: Embedding font face with jquery?

As far as I know that embedding font face is only possible with CSS3 (CSS2 but not CSS2.1), and not all browsers are ready for it yet, particularly IE (unless IE9?)... I wonder if it is possible to use jquery to embed font face? any idea how can I start the code? or any plugin which can do this job? Thanks
