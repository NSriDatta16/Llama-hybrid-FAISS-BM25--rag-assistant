You could build a lookup model with these two column families as an example: DomainLookup = { 'domain1.com' : { 'ips' : '1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3' } 'domain2.com' : { 'ips' : '1.1.1.1,4.4.4.4' } } ReverseLookup = { '1.1.1.1' : { 'domains' : 'domain1.com,domain2.com } '2.2.2.2' : { 'domains' : 'domain1.com' } '3.3.3.3' : { 'domains' : 'domain1.com' } '4.4.4.4' : { 'domains' : 'domain2.com' } } This example is probably not ideal for your case. But remember Cassandra is optimized for write. So you could create other indices best for your query scenario. Plus, Cassandra adopts Dynamo's fully distributed design which makes it easier to scale. It is self-managed meaning you could add a new machine to your Cassandra cloud and it will automatically balance the storage and load. One thing you need to pay attention is to choose either Random or Order Preserving Partitioning.
