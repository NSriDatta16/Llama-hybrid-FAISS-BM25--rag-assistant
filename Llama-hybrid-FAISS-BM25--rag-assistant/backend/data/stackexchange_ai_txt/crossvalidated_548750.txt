Using logistic regression to determine the association between covariates and being in the treatment group

I want to determine if there is an association between my covariates (age, gender, bmi) and whether the person is in the treatment group or not. I ran logistic regression using each covariate in term as the one explanatory variable. I.e. y=b0 +b1age and then I used cross validation to measure how accurate age was in predicting whether the person was in the treatment group. Should I include covariates that were able to predict more than 50% of the time whether the person was in the treatment group?
