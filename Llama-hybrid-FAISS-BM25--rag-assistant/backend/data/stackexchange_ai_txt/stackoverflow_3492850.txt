Get PID of javaws jnlp applet under linux

I'm trying to run a java (jnlp) applet from bash and get the PID of the created process. Using this command : javaws myapplet.jnlp > /dev/null & echo $! This returns a pid of the first instance of java that loads the jnlp; i guess, but has nothing to do with the final java process running. Any clues ? Found out the original javaws as follows : #!/bin/sh prog="$0" while [ -h "$prog" ]; do prog=$(readlink -f $prog); done [ $# -eq 0 ] && set -- -viewer exec $(dirname $prog)/javaws.real "$@" Is there a way to modify so it gives the PID of the child process ?
