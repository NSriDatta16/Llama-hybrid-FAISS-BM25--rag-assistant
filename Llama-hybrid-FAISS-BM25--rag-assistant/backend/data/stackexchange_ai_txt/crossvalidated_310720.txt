Potential Misunderstanding of PCA

I am playing around with PCA by plotting a regular 256x256 grid of points, randomly rotating the grid, and computing the principal axes. Originally, I thought I would be able to recover the amount that I had rotated the grid using the principal axes, but it seems that is not the case, and it makes sense to me that on a 90 degree or 45 degree interval the covariance would be 0, but for some arbitrary rotation, like say 75 degrees, I still get the basis as [[-1, 0],[0, 1]] as in the attached image. I must be misunderstanding something about what these principal axes mean, can anyone clear up my confusion?
