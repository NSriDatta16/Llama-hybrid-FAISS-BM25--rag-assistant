An array will be filled with zeros after initialization: int[][][] cube = new int[10][20][30]; This you can do also later, to reset them array to zero, it is not limited to declaration: cube = new int[10][20][30]; Simply create a new array, it is initialized with zeros. This works if you have one place that is holding the reference to the array. Don't care about the old array, that will be garbage collected. If you don't want to depend on this behavior of the language or you can't replace all occurrences of references to the old array, than you should go with the Arrays.fill() as jjnguy mentioned: for (int i = 0; i Arrays.fill seems to use a loop in the inside too, but it looks generally more elegant.
