The most elegant way I know of is to use Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with a tool such as PostSharp . I found INotifyPropertyChanged implementation examples here and here . These allow you to decorate your properties with an attribute and PostSharp then implements INotifyPropertyChanged for you when the code is built.
