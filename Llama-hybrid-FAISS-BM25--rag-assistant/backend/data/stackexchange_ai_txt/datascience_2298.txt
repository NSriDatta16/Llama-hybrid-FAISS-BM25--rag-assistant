Differences in scoring from PMML model on different platforms

I've built a toy Random Forest model in R (using the German Credit dataset from the caret package), exported it in PMML 4.0 and deployed onto Hadoop, using the Cascading Pattern library. I've run into an issue where Cascading Pattern scores the same data differently (in a binary classification problem) than the same model in R . Out of 200 observations, 2 are scored differently. Why is this? Could it be due to a difference in the implementation of Random Forests?
