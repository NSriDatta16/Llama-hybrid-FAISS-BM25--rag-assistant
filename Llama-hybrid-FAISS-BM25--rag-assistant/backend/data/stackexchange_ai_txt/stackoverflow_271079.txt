We have recently starting a tool called dynaTrace . There is a workstation verison that you can use on one box and a server/agent version for operating against many boxes. Basically, you set up the tool against a particular application (or IIS). After that it will collect method calls that it is instrumented against. In your scenario you might instrument against entire namespaces and get everything. Basically it then tracks every method call by using IL injection. It picks up the database calls by instrumenting against ADO.Net including the bind variables in SP's. It can apparently track across Web Service calls as well. It is pretty cool in that you can look at specific methods, see all the paths that were made to call that method, or look at all calls to a method. You can look at a specific database call, and look at all the code paths with that call. It's pretty cool.
