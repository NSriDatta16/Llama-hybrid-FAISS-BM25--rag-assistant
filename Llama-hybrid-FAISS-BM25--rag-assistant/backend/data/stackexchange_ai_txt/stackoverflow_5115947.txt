How can I reduce Mongo db by averaging out old data

I have a mongodb for measurements which has a document per measurements. Each doc looks like: { timestamp : 123 value : 123 meta1 : something meta2 : something } I get measurements from a number of sources every second, and so the db gets quite large, quickly. I'm interested in keeping the recent information at the frequency it was read in, but older data, i would like to average out periodically to save space, and make the db a bit quicker. 1.Whats the best approach in mongo? 2.Is there a better db for this, considering that the schema is different for different measurements, and a fixed format wouldn't work very well. RRD is also not an option as i need the dynamic query abilities.?
