Stochastic processes underlie many ideas in statistics such as time series, markov chains, markov processes, bayesian estimation algorithms (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings) etc. Thus, a study of stochastic processes will be useful in two ways: Enable you to develop models for situations of interest to you. An exposure to such a course, may enable you to identify a standard stochastic process that works given your problem context. You can then modify the model as needed to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of your specific context. Enable you to better understand the nuances of the statistical methodology that uses stochastic processes. There are several key ideas in stochastic processes such as convergence, stationarity that play an important role when we want to analyze a stochastic process. It is my belief that a course in stochastic process will let you appreciate better the need for caring about these issues and why they are important. Can you be a statistician without taking a course in stochastic processes? Sure. You can always use the software that is available to perform whatever statistical analysis you want. However, a basic understanding of stochastic processes is very helpful in order to make a correct choice of methodology, in order to understand what is really happening in the black box etc. Obviously, you will not be able to contribute to the theory of stochastic processes with a basic course but in my opinion it will make you a better statistician. My general rule of thumb for coursework: The more advanced course you take the better off you will be in the long-run. By way of analogy: You can perform a t-test without knowing any probability theory or statistics testing methodology. But, a knowledge of probability theory and statistical testing methodology is extremely useful in understanding the output correctly and in choosing the correct statistical test.
