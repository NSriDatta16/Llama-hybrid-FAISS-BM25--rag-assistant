jQuery rotation and transparent images

Hi I have some images which have a jagged edge so they naturally are a gif, png etc and have transparency however i want 2 of these images to rotate in jquery and one not to, i have this code: $('#slideshow ul:odd').css('background', 'url(../skin/frontend/default/getbranded/images/header/slideshowpic2.gif) no-repeat').rotate({angle:45}); $('#slideshow ul:even').css('background', 'url(../skin/frontend/default/getbranded/images/header/slideshowpic1.gif) no-repeat').rotate({angle:0}); i don't know why its not working in jquery, i used jqueryrotate plugin and have also tried in css3 although in css3 it works it has a white jagged stroke around the image, how can i fix this? These are background images. http://www.getbranded.co/magento/index.php/ this is the plugin i used: http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/ graham
