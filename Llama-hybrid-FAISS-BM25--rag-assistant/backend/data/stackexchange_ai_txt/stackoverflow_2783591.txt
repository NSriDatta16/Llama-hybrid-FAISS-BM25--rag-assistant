In this case you have to use var because you have an anonymous type. This situation is in fact why it was necessary to add var to the language. If you want to write an explicit type instead of var then you have to select a concrete class which must be defined somewhere. Then your code can look like this: IEnumerable groupCats = from g in groups group g by g.Value into grouped select new MyClass { GroupCategory = grouped.Key, Categories = GetCategories(grouped.Key, child) }; I suspect though that the above query is not correct. You perform a grouping but then you only use grouped.Key .
