See Martin Fowler's material: http://www.refactoring.com/ His articles are very good, recommended to anybody who wishes to learn beyond the basics of just writing code. Robert Martin's blogs (Uncle Bob) are also excellent. In practise, choose any IDE which supports common refactoring like Eclipse or IntelliJ (latter is my favorite). But it's just a tool -- it helps to learn what are the reasons why a piece of code should be refactored and how.
