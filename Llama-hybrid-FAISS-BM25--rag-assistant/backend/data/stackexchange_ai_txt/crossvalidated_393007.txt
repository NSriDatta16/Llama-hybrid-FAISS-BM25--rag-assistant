AR(1) Finding $\gamma_l$

I have $\gamma_l = Cov(r_t, r_{t-l})$ as a definition in my notes and now I need to find $gamma_l$ for a series $r_t- m = p(r_{t-1} - m) + a_t$ where $r_t$ is a linear time series with expected value $m$ and $a_t$ is a white noise. Here is my attempt: $Cov(r_t - m, r_{t-l} - m) = E[(r_t - m)(r_{t-l} -m )] = E[p^2(r_{t-1} - m)(r_{t-l-1} -m ) + pa_t(r_{t-l-1} -m ) + pa_{t-l}(r_{t-1} - m) + a_ta_{t-l}] = p^2E[(r_{t-1} - m)(r_{t-l-1} -m )] + 0 + pE[a_{t-l}(r_{t-1} - m)] + E[a_t]E[a_{t-l}]$ Now if $l=0, = p^2E[(r_{t-1} - m)(r_{t-l-1} -m )] + pE[a_{t-l}(r_{t-1} - m)] + s_a^2 $ Otherwise, $= p^2E[(r_{t-1} - m)(r_{t-l-1} -m )] + pE[a_{t-l}(r_{t-1} - m)]$ . In either case, I'm stuck here. I am supposed to get everything in terms of $\gamma_{l-1}$ (or $\gamma_1$ in the case of 0, but I am not sure how to proceed.
