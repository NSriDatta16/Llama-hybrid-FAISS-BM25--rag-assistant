What is the best approach to generalize and aggregate XML dumps in C#?

Here is the business part of the issue: Several different companies send a XML dump of the information to be processed. The information sent by the companies are similar ... not exactly same. Several more companies would be soon enlisted and would start sending information Now, the technical part of the problem is I want to write a generic solution in C# to accommodate this information for processing. I would be transforming the XML in my C# class(es) to fit in to my database model. Is there any pattern or solution for this issue to be handled generically without needing to change my solution in case of addition of many companies later? What would be the best approach to write my parser/transformer?
