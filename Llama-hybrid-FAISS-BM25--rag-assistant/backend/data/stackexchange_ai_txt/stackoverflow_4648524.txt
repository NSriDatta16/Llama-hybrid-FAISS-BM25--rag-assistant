The statement that Java "officially has no pointers" is simply false. Just because you can't do arithmetic on it doesn't mean it's not a pointer. C is not the final authority for programming terminology. The only people who get hung up over it are either C/C++ fans who want to disparage Java for its lack of power over the bare metal, or (unlikely, nowadays) marketing people who want to sell Java as a simpler, safer alternative to managers who've had bad experiences with C development. From the Java language specification : The reference values (often just references ) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers to no object.
