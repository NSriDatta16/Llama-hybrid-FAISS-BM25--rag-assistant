How to find average and median age from an aggregated frequency table

I am using excel and I am trying to find both the average age and median age. I have two columns. 1 for the category and the other for the number of people in each category. Under 5 6,360 5-9 6,360 10-14 10,986 15-17 5,204 18-24 7,886 25-34 9,463 35-44 17,349 45-54 18,926 55-64 13,406 65-74 6,309 75 and over 5,520 total 107,769
