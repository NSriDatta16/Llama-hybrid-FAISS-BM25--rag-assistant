This type of thing is in the domain of a Content Management System. So, you have a couple of choices. Try to integrate your work into an existing CMS like drupal, joomla, DotnetNuke, etc (depending on what language you are coding in); or, Build your own. You can certainly leverage existing components such as a rich text editor (like the one you used to post the question) in combination with writing the files to a DB or straight to the file system. Either way, you have a fair amount of work ahead of you.
