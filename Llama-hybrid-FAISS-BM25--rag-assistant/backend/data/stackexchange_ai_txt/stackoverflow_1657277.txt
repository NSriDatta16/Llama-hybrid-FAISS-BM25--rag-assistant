Regex to move image in markup with PHP when publishing content with TinyMCE

I am using TinyMCE to publish content to my site. I have the problem whereby I can only insert an image inside another element, eg a paragraph, even if I place the cursor at the end of the content. So, when I publish the content, I currently end up with markup like: Text content Another paragraph I notice that WordPress and the TinyMCE example site both insert images in the above manner. I have been unable to find a solution as to how I can insert an image in TinyMCE outside of any other element, so my next step is to try and alter the content server side so that when I publish my content, I am able to correct the markup before saving it to my db, so that I would end up with: Text content Another paragraph Does any body know what I would need to do to achieve this. I know regex should work, but I am not sure what or how to use it to that effect. Even better, if anybody has a solution to the TinyMCE problem, that would be even better. I know I can obviously use JS to achieve this client side on the fly, but that solution is not ideal. Many thanks, D
