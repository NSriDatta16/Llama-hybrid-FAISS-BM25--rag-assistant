VAR model variable selection

I'm required to use two time series models in my exam project. I want to use a stock price of an energy company, and then explain it first using ARIMA, and then adding other variables and using VAR. My problem is that I can't find variables which pass the Granger test of causality. I have tried prices of commodities, competitor stock prices, etc. So now I have opted to use two of the same company's stocks, but just listed on different stock exchanges (same company, same currency - one stock trading in Germany, the other in Brussels) Obviously, the stock on both markets is impacted by the same unobserved variables. Is this a huge mistake, or can I proceed if I discuss and show that I am aware of omitted variable bias?
