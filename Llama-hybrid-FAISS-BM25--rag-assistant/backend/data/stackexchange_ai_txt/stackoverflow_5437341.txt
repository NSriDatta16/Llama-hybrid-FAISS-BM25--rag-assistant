Note, I wrote the quoted paragraph. In general, I'm seeing a 1:1 correlation between applications and design docs. Everything a single application needs should be in one design document. Bigger applications may want to rely on multiple design docs for various reasons (like different groups of views), but in general, one design doc per app is a good rule of thumb. Now, you may have multiple applications per database. E.g. a CMS: one application could be the public facing CMS viewing app and another one would be the admin interface. You want to keep them separate because, well, they are two distinct apps that operate on the same data and keeping them separate is a good organisational idea. Different security mechanisms apply, so you have two validation functions that do implement what is applicable for the respective app. The quoted paragraphis the definition of the case where you do have (for whatever reason) have more than one design document per database. It explains what to expect. It is not meant as a guideline how to split things up. Go with the one design doc per app rule of thumb and you're good most of the time.
