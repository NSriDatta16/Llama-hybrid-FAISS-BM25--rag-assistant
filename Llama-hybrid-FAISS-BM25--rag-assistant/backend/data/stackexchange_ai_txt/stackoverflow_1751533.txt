In the end I took the GNU GPL type approach: A copy of the full licence text with each project (licence.txt). A 'reference' to the licence file (as well as a small blurb) at the top of each code file. Of course, throwing a bit of text in the top of each code file might be a simple concept but its not a trivial thing to do if you have multiple projects and files. So in the end I whipped up a small tool to do it for me. Get it here: http://www.morphological.geek.nz/MorphologicalLicenceInserter/default.aspx (99Kb, full source code, released under Ms-RL). How to use it: Copy your code to a staging area (I use RoboCopy). Crank up the Licence Inserter Tool and have it 'embed' a bit of text (which you write once) into the top of every file you want the reference to appear in. Check or test the end result of the licence embedding process, and you're good to go. The program automatically 'wraps' your text in the correct commenting syntax for the file type.
