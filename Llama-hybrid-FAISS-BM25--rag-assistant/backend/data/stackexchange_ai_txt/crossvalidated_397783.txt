what does it mean to run a time series model in levels?

I have seen the phrases running a var in levels and running a var in difference very frequently, either on this site or elsewhere. I understand running a var in difference basically means to difference the var model ( $I(d)$ ) and write it in $I(0)$ form. but I failed to find a relevant definition for levels, and the usage of levels in the phrase was unclear to me as to what kind of transformation it is indicating. What does it mean to run a var in levels please?
