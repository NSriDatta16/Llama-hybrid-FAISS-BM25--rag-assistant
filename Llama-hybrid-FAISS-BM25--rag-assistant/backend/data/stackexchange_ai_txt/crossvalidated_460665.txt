Answering my own question over 2 years later, but it turns out that this distribution lies in the family of z-distributions, see the bottom of page 150 of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. 1982: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1402598?seq=1 . If anyone else is interested in how I found this out, this family of distributions arises in the study of global-local shrinkage priors in the Bayesian analysis of regression problems, see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00763 .
