This would work better as a competing risks model, which is a specialized form of a survival model. Competing risks is based on the Cox Proportional Hazards model, which uses a lot of the same underlying principles as a logistic regression model. Competing risks uses the concept of a group being "at risk" for all events until one event occurs. The people who can experience the event are known as the "risk set." Usually, when someone experiences an event, they are removed from the risk set for the rest of the follow-up. Use this kind of time to event model should give you a better sense of which effects are important. Probably, someone who goes to prison again immediately after release is different from someone who has the same outcome at the end of your two-year follow up. Competing risks will account for that. In your case it sounds like some people can experience a certain event that removes them from the risk set for a period of time, but they also become "at risk" for the other event again after a period of time. You can account for that, too, if you think it's biasing your results. This R vignette shows how you might implement in R and gives a deeper explanation on the concepts. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/compete.pdf This whitepaper has a good description of competing risks in general: https://data.princeton.edu/pop509/CompetingRisks.pdf
