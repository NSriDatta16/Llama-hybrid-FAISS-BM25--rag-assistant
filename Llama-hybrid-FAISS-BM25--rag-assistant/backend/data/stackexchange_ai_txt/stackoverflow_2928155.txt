Avoid blinking, if possible - it annoys people. But you can do it with JS/jQuery like this: setInterval(jQuery('.blinking').toggle, 1500 ); That'll show/hide anything with the blinking class every 1.5 seconds. So in the HTML you would do: hello! But again, think very carefully about whether it should be blinking! If you need something to specifically draw a user's attention (and for whatever reason regular emphasis/highlighting/etc isn't good enough), then instead of on-off blinking (where the text dissappears for half the time), consider changing the colour, or a blinking underline/border, or similar. The key thing is, if something is important enough to visually annoy the user then it should remain readable.
