To have a valid interpretation of the cross correlation function, time series need to be wide sense stationary. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation#Cross-correlation_function ) Looking at the graphs, both of your time series are not stationary. So it is not ok to interpret this ccf graph. You can still examine the correlation between these two time series, by checking if the differenced time series are stationary and computing the correlation of the differenced time series in case of stationarity.
