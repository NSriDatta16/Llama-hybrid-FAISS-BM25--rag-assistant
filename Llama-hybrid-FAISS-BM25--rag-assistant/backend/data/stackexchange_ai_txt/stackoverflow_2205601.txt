I would say don't worry about the formatting to decide which heading to use, you can always adjust the look with CSS. My rule of thumb is to think of what you would want to see in a well organized and hierarchical table of content. If you would want the text in it then use a H[123456] tag. Then the more prominent use closer to H1 , less prominent use closer to H6 . Use the same Hn for things that are at the same level of importance. It does not matter if you don't have a TOC in the end, but that will help you think how to organize your headings.
