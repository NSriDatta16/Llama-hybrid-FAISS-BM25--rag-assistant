Why are t-tests rather than z-tests used in linear regression? Because the variance of the error must be estimated from the residuals. This is then used to calculate the standard error of the regression coefficients and predictions. Do the explanatory variables need to have normal distribution in linear regression? No, explanatory variables are considered "fixed by design". They can come from any distribution. You would have to derive a whole different type of regression routine to incorporate variance in the $X$ variables. Why are there z-tests rather than t-tests in logistic regression? Because for a binomial outcome the variance depends on the mean and not the residuals, so you don't have to estimate any extra parameters.
