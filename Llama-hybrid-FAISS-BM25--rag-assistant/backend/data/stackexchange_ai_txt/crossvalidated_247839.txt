Non-conditional probability to be in a given state in a markov chain

I am asking your help for a question I couldn't find the answer on the internet. I am considering a markov chain with 3 states. The transition probability matrix is pij, i, j from 1 to 3. pij is the probability for the markov chain to be in state i at time t knowing it is in state j at time t-1. I'm a looking for the non conditional probability: P(state in t=j). I know the formula in the case where there are 2 states, but I can't find a general formula, for n states (3 states in my case). I guess I found the answer in some academic articles, but I don't understand it and how to apply it.
