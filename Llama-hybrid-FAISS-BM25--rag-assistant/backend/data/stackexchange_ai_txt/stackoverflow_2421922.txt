Unable to Affect Scintilla Control Programmatically at Runtime

I'm attempting to use the ScintillaNET control in an application I am working on. I drag and drop the control into my form and run form. The control appears on the form. This is good. In addition, if I set any of the properties in the control's properties editor (ConfigurationManager.Language, for example), I am able to type in that language and see syntax highlighting occur. Where I run into problems is when I attempt to change properties programmatically. For example, I attempt to load text from a file into the form (I'm doing this in the form's Load). The text doesn't display. I also can't seem to show the line numbers or do any other number of tasks (including programmatically change the Language). Any idea what I may be doing wrong? Even something as simple as the code below doesn't seem to work: private void scintilla1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { scintilla1.ConfigurationManager.Language = "xml"; }
