When setting up associations with single table inheritance models, you need to refer to the parent model so the associations can infer a table name. So, in your Garage class you need: has_many :vehicles If you want to restrict the association to RoadVehicles , you can add conditions: has_many :vehicles, :conditions => {:type => ['Car', 'Bus']}
