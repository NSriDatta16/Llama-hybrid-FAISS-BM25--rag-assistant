Current MVC fashion/naming convention calls these Helper Classes/Objects, which is orthogonal to singleton/non-singleton, (helpers often are create as a singleton and/or class with static methods, but they don't have to be) See Zend Documentation for an example . A plugin isn't quite the right description. Typically plugins are code/programs written by outside parties to leverage and/or extend functionality within a system. A plugin would be more if the system you were using provided a way for YOU to write a security class and have it automatically instantiated and it's methods available to call, and if your security class could call on System APIs in a standard, non-hack way.
