@nsaners - I'm pretty sure the problem is down to memory fragmentation. We've analyzed minidumps that point to a problem when a large (5-10mb) chunk of memory is being allocated. We've also monitored the process (on-site and in development) to check for memory leaks - none were detected (the memory footprint is generally quite low).
