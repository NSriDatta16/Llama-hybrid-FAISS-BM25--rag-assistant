Why don't I get code coverage results for C++/CLI project in Visual Studio 2010?

I've recently upgrade my solution to Visual Studio 2010. I have 4 projects I want to cover using unit tests - 3 C# and 1 C++/CLI. I get coverage for the C# projects but not for the C++/CLI project. I did get for all of them in Visual Studio 2008. I've configured the assemblies using testrunconfig -> Data and Diagnostics -> Code Coverage -> Configure. Why don't I get code coverage result for the C++/CLI project?
