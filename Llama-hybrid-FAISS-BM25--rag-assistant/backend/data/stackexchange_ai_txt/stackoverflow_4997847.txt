Using XCode and instruments to improve iPhone app performance

I've been experimenting with Instruments off and on for a while and and I still can't do the following (with any sensible results): determine or estimate the average runtime of a function that's called many times. For example if I'm driving my gameLoop at 60 Hz with a CADisplayLink I'd like to see how long the loop takes to run on average... 10 ms? 30 ms etc. I've come close with the "CPU activity" instrument but the results are inconsistent or don't make sense. The time profiler seems promising but all I can get is "% of runtime"... and I'd like an actual runtime.
