Sounds like a bug in their use of MD5 (maybe they are MD5-ing the wrong files), or a bug in the library that they're using. For example, an older MD5 program that I used once didn't handle files over 2GB. This question suggests that, on average, you get a collision on average every 100 years if you were generating 6 billion files per second, so it's quite unlikely.
