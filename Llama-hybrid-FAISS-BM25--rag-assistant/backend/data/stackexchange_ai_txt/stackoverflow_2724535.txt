It's not mandatory, it's an optimization because reallocating is expensive. I think it's an implementation detail how often it reallocates. I think it's normal for the vector to double its storage every time it reallocates, but, as I said, this can vary by implementation. (It might be the case that because you are in a debug build it's reallocating more often than normal.)
