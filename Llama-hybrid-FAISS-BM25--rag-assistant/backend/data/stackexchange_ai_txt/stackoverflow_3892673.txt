Code listing in LaTeX beamer presentation frames

I'm trying to create a LaTeX beamer presentation that has several Java code listings. However, I encountered a very bizarre problem - my listing snippet causes a compilation failure when in the presentation, but works just fine in some other document. \begin{frame}[Fragile] \frametitle{Test} \begin{lstlisting} public class SimpleClass { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello!"); } } \end{lstlisting} \end{frame} If I remove this code from my presentation it will work just fine, but with it I get the error message: === ERROR: Paragraph ended before \lst@next was complete. --- TeX said --- \par l.129 --- HELP --- A blank line occurred in a command argument that shouldn't contain one. You probably forgot the right brace at the end of an argument. ==== I'm totally at a loss here, because this exact listing works just fine in some regular report. I've searched around and found out that I should have the fragile attribute set for frames with listings in them, but this didn't change anything. Thanks in advance for your help.
