Kernel PCA for feature selection for various machine learning algorithms

I would like to forecast stock index returns with SVM, k-NN, and Neural Networks. In advance I want to select my inputs via kernel PCA (kPCA). Everything is performed in R. For the KPCA I use kernlab . The data which I preprocess to the KPCA are various lagged input variables, where I want to identify the most explanatory lags through the KPCA. It is in xts format originally but for the KPCA I convert it to matrix. Is there anybody who can tell me how I find out which of the original variables in the xts data matrix are considered to be most explanatory by the KPCA? Yet I am able to perform KPCA but I cannot interpret any results of it. I have read the documentary of kernlab, so that did not help.
