If all series have the same number of data points at the same x positions, then a LOESS smoother with lambda=0 (essentially a weighted moving average) will satisfy your constraints. At each position, you're computing $z_i = \frac{w_i * y_i}{n}$, where $w$ is the local smoothing function around the position. Given that $w_i$ and $n$ are the same for each series, if all the $y_i$ in one series are greater than or equal to the corresponding $y_i$ in another series, then the $z_i$ will follow the same rule. The external bounds condition is met by applying the above logic with a series of all min values or all max values. This smoother will not usually go through the data points.
