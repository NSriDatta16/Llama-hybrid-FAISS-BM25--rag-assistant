Architecting a Complex iPhone Application?

I am comming from an enterprise java development organization where we did development in nicely seperated re-usable layers. Persistency layers, Service layers, etc etc. Now, I am looking for iPhone example apps or documentation on how to architecture complex iPhone projects. Most books & apple examples show you very limited code & architecture. They are not usable imo. What I am also looking for is info on how to setup a continuous-integration build system which runs all my unit tests on code checkin & reports the unit test findings to a system where we can see the results. For our java projects, we use svn, mvn & sonar for this. What's apple's equivalent for this setup? Is it even possible? So, to summarize my questions: Q1: Are there any examples or books on complex iPhone project architecture? Q2: How do we setup a continuous-integration build system?
