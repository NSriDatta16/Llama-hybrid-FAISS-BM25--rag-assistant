Clustering is unsupervised and as such does not use any labels. Zero-shot learning is a form of learning which does not conform to standard supervised framework: the classes are not assumed to be known beforehand (you evaluate on unseen classes), but it does assume some relationships between classes (for example some methods assume encodings for classes, then you can think that's something like embeddings for classes, for example you use word embeddings for some words instead of one-hot encoded matrix). The main advantage of this approach lies in the fact that it is able to leverage structure that exists on classes - this enables these methods to work where standard supervised learning methods fail - handling unseen/very small classes is a typical example.
