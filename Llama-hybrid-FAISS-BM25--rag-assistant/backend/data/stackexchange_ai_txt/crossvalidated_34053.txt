Cascade-Correlation Neural Networks adjust their structure by adding hidden nodes during the training process, so this may be a place to start. Most of the other work I've seen that automatically adjusts the number of layers, number of hidden nodes, etc, of a neural network use evolutionary algorithms. Unfortunately, this work is out of my area so I can't recommend any particular papers or references to help you get started. I can tell you that I haven't seen any work which tries to jointly optimize network structure and parameters simultaneously within the deep learning community. In fact, most deep learning architectures are based on greedily learning a single layer at a time, thus making even online learning of deep neural networks a rather untouched area (the work of Martens et al. on Hessian Free Optimization being a notable exception).
