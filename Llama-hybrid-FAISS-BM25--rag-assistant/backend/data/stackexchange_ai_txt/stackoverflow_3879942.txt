You could try embedding \n in your string, and see whether they make it into the database. You could also try block literals by starting the string with a | character, which allows you to span multiple lines, but that might break the generated insert clause. Then, to convert your newlines to tags, use nl2br() when you display the string, otherwise the linebreaks in the HTML source will just be ignored.
