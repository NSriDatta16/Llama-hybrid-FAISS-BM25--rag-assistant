How to add "Last Position" button to my tool bar in VB6 IDE

I did this before but can't remember how the heck I did it. I want to have a button on my vb6 IDE toolbar that takes me back to the previous place I was in the code (in my "history) -- an incredibly useful feature. I have it in my properties (right-click) menu but don't see it in the other menus from which I could drag it to the Toolbar. Any ideas?
