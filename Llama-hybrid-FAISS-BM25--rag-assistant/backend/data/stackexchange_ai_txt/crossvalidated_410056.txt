Test to compare means of non independent samples with repeated measures

I am struggling a little to know if I am comparing independent or not independent data and I am not sure what kind of test I should use. Here is the pitch : I would like to compare latencies between two groups of fish: fist group : 14 fish (alone) that had several trials each, so several latencies for one fish second group : 14 different fish that had also several trials, so several latencies for each fish as well. But, those fish are working in pairs with other fish, some coming from the first group, some that are new. Is it enough to talk about non independence between the two groups? And how do I deal with the repeated latencies for one fish? I first thought about paired t test, but it is to compare repeated means of same individuals between groups if I understood well. Thank you if you can help, Morgane
