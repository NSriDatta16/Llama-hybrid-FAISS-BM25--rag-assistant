How can I drag a DOM object(image) (which is outside of ) into a map then create a marker there?

I just want to add some kind of markers which are listed beside map, then user can drag them in to map. I tried to use GEvent.addDomListener(domObj, "drag",functName); but it didn't works. Is there any way to do that? Thanks Dau
