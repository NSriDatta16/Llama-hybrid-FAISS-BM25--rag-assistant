New rare-event regression method somewhere between logistic and survival

I keep running into situations (in my job) where I need to predict relatively rare events that occur at most once per entity, across many entities, and over time (e.g. predicting mortality of cancer patients based on treatments given). I’ve gone through this process a few times applying both survival/hazard models as as well as cost-aware classifiers (or the myriad of other ways to bend a classifier to deal with imbalance) and found a few commonalities that I thought seemed to suggest an opportunity for research. Basically, I find that classifiers work well in those scenarios and generally have more desirable properties but there is always one critical modeling question that has to be answered in order to cast survival problems as classification ones — over what time period in the future are you trying to predict the event in question? To phrase this as an example, say I’m trying to predict when my car will break down based on how many miles it has and how many of the sensor/warning lights are on. As a survival regression problem, the objective is to estimate a probability curve for this failure time at some point in the future, but as a classification problem it must be reduced to a question like: “will my car break down in the next 1-3 weeks?”. “will it break down between 3 and 6 months from now?” “will it break down tomorrow?” My point is that choosing this interval for classification isn’t easy and in the past I’ve just done it based on the classifier performance for a ton of different interval possibilities and tried to find some setting that gives the best performance. My question then : Is anyone aware of a joint modeling strategy for both a binary classifier and the, let’s call it, “time-to-event” interval length? It seems like it would be possible with an MCMC sampler and an appropriate probability model, and I wanted to see if that kind of regression has already been tried before.
