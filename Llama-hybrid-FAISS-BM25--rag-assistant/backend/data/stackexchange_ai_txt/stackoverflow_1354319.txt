Why is Flash obj invisible in FF, works great in IE, Safari, Chrome?

I'm working with a WordPress plugin. It adds a flash player to the output page. All works great on IE, Safari, Chrome. In FF 3.0.13, I can see via Firebug that the object is there, but it is grayed out. Display == inline Visibility == visible So why isn't it visible? Ideas much appreciated.
