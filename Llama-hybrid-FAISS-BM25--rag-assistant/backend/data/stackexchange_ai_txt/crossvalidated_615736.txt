You're dealing with an interesting challenge. The short answer is that, in general, SVMs are not easily updated with new training data without retraining, but there are alternative approaches you can consider. Incremental learning: Some machine learning models support incremental learning, which allows you to update the model with new data without needing to retrain on the entire dataset. Models such as Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and certain neural networks support incremental learning. Note, however, that these models may not be as effective as SVMs for OCR. Online SVM: There are variations of SVM, known as Online SVMs, that can be updated incrementally. This could be an option if you wish to stick to SVMs. Transfer Learning: For your use-case, transfer learning could be a very effective approach. Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved state-of-the-art results in OCR tasks. You can provide a pre-trained CNN model to your users, which can then be fine-tuned on specific fonts that users come across. This fine-tuning process typically requires much less data and computational resources than training a model from scratch. Active Learning: This is a semi-supervised learning approach where the model identifies instances in the dataset for which it is least confident and requests their labels from the user. This approach can be very efficient when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. In your situation, I would recommend exploring transfer learning with a deep learning model. This would allow users to improve the model with new fonts without needing to retrain from scratch. It's also worth noting that deep learning models tend to perform better than SVMs for image-based tasks like OCR. Remember, any model improvement approach will require careful design of the user interface and user experience to make the process intuitive and efficient for the user.
