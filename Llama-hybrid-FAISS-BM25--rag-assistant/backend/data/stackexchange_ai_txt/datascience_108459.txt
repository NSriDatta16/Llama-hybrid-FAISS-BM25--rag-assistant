I just wanted to add this. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) generally refer to the type of neural network architectures, where the input to a neuron can also include additional data input, along with the activation of the previous layer. E.g. for real-time handwriting or speech recognition. Residual neural networks (ResNet) refer to another type of neural network architecture, where the input to a neuron can include the activations of two (or more) of its predecessors. E.g. for non-realtime handwriting or speech recognition. So, there is a difference but maybe these implementations can be considered equivalent, especially if we are performing non-real-time data analysis.
