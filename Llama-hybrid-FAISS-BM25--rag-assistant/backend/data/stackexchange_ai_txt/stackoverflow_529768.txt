A couple of thoughts come to mind: Make them very well documented and easy to figure out. That way, no one will give up on using them because its too confusing. Make them very useful, and make sure they take care of problems that are so annoying that people would have to be crazy not to use them. Another great tactic is to find out what code other people in the organization have in their projects, offer to extract some of that functionality (talk it up about how great it is and how you really want to use it in your project). Once their code is added to the shared module, you usually end up +1 fan of the shared library, and have an evangelist to help you sell the idea. Remember, people usually only do things if they are in their benefit - so making them look good and their code look good is strongly in their benefit.
