Does anyone know of any standards for the classification of software?

I have, of course, tried Google/Bing and have found one or two classifications for specific industries, but nothing general. The sort of thing I'm looking for is: General Office Tools -> Wordprocessing -> Word Utilities -> File Management -> Compression -> Winzip Waht I am after is a Standar that has been issued by some organization, or is used my a number of different parties - not just a classification a single org is using.
