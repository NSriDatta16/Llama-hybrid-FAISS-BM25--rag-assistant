If you can find some mapping from $R^N \rightarrow R^M$ where $R^M$ is some space with a nice distance measure (e.g. euclidean) then you could determine ordering based off of distance. For example, suppose you were very lucky and could find a mapping to $R^1$, then you could just use the scalar value as the index (which is essentially a hash function). There are many approaches to actually solving for that mapping (e.g. you could train a multi-layer perceptron). You might also find something simple like PCA could work if there are only a few dimensions that play an important role in ordering.
