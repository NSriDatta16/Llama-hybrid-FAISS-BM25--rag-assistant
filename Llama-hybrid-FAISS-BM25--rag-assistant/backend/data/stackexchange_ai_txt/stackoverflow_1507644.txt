Sample code for creating a NSTextField "label"?

In my desktop Mac OS X app, I'd like to programatically create a NSTextField "label" which has the same behavior and properties as a typical label created in Interface Builder. I usually use (and very much like) IB, but in this case it must be done programatically. Try as I might, I can't seem to find the combination of method calls that will programatically produce the same label-y behavior as a "Label" dragged from the IB View Library palette. Can anyone provide or point out some example code of how to do this programatically? Thx.
