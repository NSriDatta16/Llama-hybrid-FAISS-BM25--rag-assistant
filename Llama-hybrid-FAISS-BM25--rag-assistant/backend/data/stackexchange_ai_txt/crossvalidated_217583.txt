A non-positive definite Hesssian matrix is indeed a problem, and you should not trust your results. If you search the web for some variations of "Hessian matrix not positive definite" then you will find many answers. On my most resent encounter with this problem I assembled the following possible fixes that I tried, in order: make sure no large amounts of missing data check scaling of predictor variables; If an order of magnitude or more off, the model might have trouble calculating variances check all variables to make sure none is a constant check if there is a near perfect linear dependency b/t two variables (e.g., height & weight); if so, one may be deleted reduce the number of exclusions (they could combine to leave you with less variation in your data) check if a random intercept captures all the variation make sure have specified a SUBJECT variable on the RANDOM subcommand make sure there is level 2 variation in the outcome make sure there are level 2 predictors run models and check if some covariance estimates are either 0 or have no estimate or no standard errors at all increase the number of MAX ITERATIONS increase the number of (Fisher steps) for SCORING remove INTERCEPT from RANDOM line (may not be needed & may make solution impossible to obtain if it makes no difference) use a simpler covariance structure (with fewer unique parameters; avoids redundant parameters) check if too many levels of the random effect and not enough fixed observations within each random level try using a different missing data technique if hypothesis allows it, run a population-averaged (repeated measures) model (which has no random effects, but accounts for correlations within individuals) work directly with eigenvalues to adjust zeros up to .05 My matrix was positive definite when I got to #12. Scaling the variables to within the same order of magnitude and increasing the max iterations seemed to help the most, but every dataset is going to be different. I have no fix for the error message: Data Structure: One or more subject fields were specified but not actually used in the analysis.
