When will a plot of principal components against each other reveal a meaningful correlation?

I read these two threads: Why are principal component scores uncorrelated? Questions on PCA: when are PCs independent? why is PCA sensitive to scaling? why are PCs constrained to be orthogonal? and learned that PC modes are by definition orthogonal and thus uncorrelated. So why do I see people plot PC modes against each other if they're uncorrelated? In what case will e.g. a PC1 vs PC2 plot reveal a meaningful correlation?
