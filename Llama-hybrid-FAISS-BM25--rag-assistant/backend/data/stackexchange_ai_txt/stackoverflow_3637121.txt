If you only have few items, put them in array, that keeps things simple: $items=array( 1=>array('item name 1', 1200), 2=>array('item name 2', 4600), ... ); otherwise, use a storage method, whether a database or a file, according to your needs and how much items do you have and how often they are willing to change.
