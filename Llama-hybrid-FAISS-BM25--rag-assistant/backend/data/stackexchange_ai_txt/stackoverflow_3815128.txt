How to bind from DataGridColumn.Header to ViewModel property?

I want to bind my datagrid header to a property on the DataContext of the grid. Now, I got it to work, but I consider this a temporarily solution: The biggest issue with this solution is that it makes the binding more fragile (context sensitive). If the DataContext of the grid is used in a master/detail scenario (which makes the DataContext a BindingList instead of a single item) I would have to replace update the DataGrid DataContext with DataContext={Binding /} . Is there a more robust way to bind from the DataGrid.HeaderTemplate than using ElementName and refering to the DataContext?
