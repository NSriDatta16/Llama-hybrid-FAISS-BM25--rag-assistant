Why remove django DATABASE_OPTIONS's "init_command set engine=INNODB" after table creation?

Docs on creating your database tables says: Another option is to use the init_command option for MySQLdb prior to creating your tables: DATABASE_OPTIONS = { "init_command": "SET storage_engine=INNODB", } This sets the default storage engine upon connecting to the database. After your tables have been created, you should remove this option as it adds a query that is only needed during table creation to each database connection. Does anyone know why is it necessary to remove this option after table creation?
