Is there a way to test HTTP Live Streaming via an iSight camera?

I'm working on an iPhone app that will use HTTP Live Streaming. Using Apple's provided tools (particularly mediafilesegmenter), I'm able to successfully segment and serve an archived video. Now I want to test Live Streaming stuff. I don't own any sort of camcorder, I just have my iSight built-in to my Mac. Is there a way to leverage this camera to test out Live Streaming? Run iSight from the command line maybe? If so, I need a port number for mediastreamsegmenter.
