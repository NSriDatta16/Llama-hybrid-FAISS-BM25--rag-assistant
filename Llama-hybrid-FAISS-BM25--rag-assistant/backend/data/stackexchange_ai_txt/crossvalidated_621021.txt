The goal of the matching is to remove all imbalance in the covariates so that a simple difference in (weighted) means is unbiased for the treatment effect estimate. The g-computation step exists to reduce the residual variation in the outcome, which increases the precision of the treatment effect estimate for free. The goal of the outcome model therefore is not to correctly model the outcome but rather to reduce this residual variation while retaining the estimand. One of the most important aspects of this analysis is that you do not respecify the outcome model. There is almost always a way to respecify the outcome model to get the desired effect estimate. Using a simple linear model with just the covariates you included in the matching tells your audience that you did not engage in this specification search to find the model that gives you the most "convenient" results. If I saw a squared term in the outcome model with no a priori justification, I would assume the analyst included it because without it they got a result they didn't like. To me, the justification needs to be strong and apparent (e.g., it is well known and demonstrable in the literature that a variable has a quadratic relationship with the outcome) in order to include such a term in the outcome model. Square terms rarely reduce the residual variation above and beyond the linear term; an exception would be when the relationship really is close to U-shaped. Even if the true relationship is quadratic, it might be that the reduction in residual variance is not worth the cost in precision of including an additional variable in the model. If you want to do something sophisticated, you can. You can fit a machine learning model for the outcome, or even a flexible spline model. The key is to manage your audience's expectations and avoid performing analyses that will make your audience lose trust in your conclusions or invalidate the inferences. Using a linear outcome model does this best because it will tend to reduce most of the residual variation in the outcome without requiring the specification search that would otherwise be necessary to correctly model the outcome.
