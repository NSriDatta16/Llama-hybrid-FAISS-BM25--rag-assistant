Some informal definitions A deterministic time series $\{y_t\}$ can be written as a function only of time. There is NO randomness. Some examples: $y(t) = 2t$ $y(t) = e^t$ A stochastic process $\{Y_t\}$ is a series of random variables. Recall that a random variable is a function from a sample space $\Omega$ to an outcome. A stochastic process $Y(t,\omega)$ is a function of both time $t$ and an outcome $\omega$ from sample space $\Omega$. Examples: $y_t = \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ (i.e. follows standard normal distribution) $y_t = .7 y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ You can also think of a stochastic process as a deterministic path for every outcome $\omega$ in the sample space $\Omega$. Randomly draw an $\omega \in \Omega$ and you get a path $Y_t(\omega)$. Some comments... ... reason of AR(1) to be called as stochastic model is because the variance of it increases with time. That's not the reason! The reason an AR(1) defines a stochastic process is because the process is random. Different values are possible at a time $t$, hence the process is stochastic. I also don't think simple linear model is totally deterministic as we have a $\epsilon_t$ term associated with the model. The $x_t$ you have written up there is not deterministic. If you had a time series process $x_t = \alpha t + \epsilon_t$ where $\{\epsilon_t\}$ is a white noise process , then the time series $\{x_t\}$ would not be deterministic. It is stochastic because there is randomness! The time series $y_t = \alpha t$ would be deterministic. You can decompose $\{x_t\}$ into two components: a deterministic component $\alpha t$ and a stochastic component $\epsilon_t$. This leads to Wold's Theorem that any covariance stationary process can be uniquely decomposed into a deterministic component and a stochastic component.
