Bayesian linear regression question

I am doing a problem on Bayesian regression but I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Here is the question: Consider $f=w^Tx$, $p(w)\sim N(w|0,\Sigma)$. Show that $p(f|x)$ is Gaussian. Find the mean and covariance of $f$. Consider $t=f+\epsilon$ where $\epsilon\sim N(0,0.001)$. What is $p(f|t,x)$? I'm just really confused about the notation. Since we are doing Bayesian regression, shouldn't we really be trying to compute $p(w|f)$? Why are we conditioning on $x$, which doesn't have a prior on it? What does $p(f|x)$ and $p(f|t,x)$ even mean?
