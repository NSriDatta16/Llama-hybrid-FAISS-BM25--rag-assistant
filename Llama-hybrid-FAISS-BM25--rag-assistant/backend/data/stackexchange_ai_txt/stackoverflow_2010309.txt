The first things that come to mind are: Try a smaller path Make sure your modules are pyc's so they'll load faster Make sure you don't double import, or import too much Other than that, are you sure that the disk operations are what's bogging you down? Is your disk/operating system really busy or old and slow? Maybe a defrag is in order?
