Append text to Blob in Azure

After looking at this tutorial on blobs: channel 9 , I was thinking of using a blob container to save a bunch of tweets (storing the json of each tweet that is). Ideally I would like to create a blob reference for each hour of the day, and append new tweets to this blob as they come in. The issue is that the method UploadText(string) overwrites the existing content of the blob, is there an easy way to append text to an existing blob ? Thanks! fun (json:string) -> let account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue("DataConnectionString")) let blobs = account.CreateCloudBlobClient(); let tempBlob = blobs.GetBlobReference("tweets/2010-9-26/17/201092617.txt") tempBlob.Properties.ContentType
