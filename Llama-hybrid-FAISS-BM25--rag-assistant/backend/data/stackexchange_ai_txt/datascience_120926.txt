Clustering with features of categorical type

I have a dataset of 17 features and class label for each datapoint. The description of dataset is as follows: 2 features contain values 0, 1, 2, 3 15 features contain values 0, 1, 2 class label containing value 0 or 1 I am given a set of clustering algorithms namely KNN, DBSCAN, Agglomerative clustering, Self Organizing Maps(SOM) and asked to implement each of these algorithm for the above dataset. I implemented them and plotted the obtained clusters with respective any of the two features on a scatter plot. Then I realized that there is no use doing clustering because either all of the points are considered a single cluster or each datapoint is considered a separate cluster. I also tried one-hot encoding and then perform clustering, still the same result Is there any use applying clustering algorithms on such data or am I doing something wrong in the implementation part here Any help is appreciated
