PHPâ€™s default session handler uses only the session ID to identify the session. That makes it possible to use the session ID from another user and thus use the same session ( Session Hijacking ). Another attack is to prepare a session and get the victim to use that session so that the victim and attacker again use the same session ( Session fixation ). The base for such attacks is that you just need to know the session ID to use the session that is associated to it. Prevention techniques are to use more identification information than just the session ID. Some suggest to use the IP address (but that may change during a session) or the user agent identifier. Another technique is to hide the session ID externally by allowing only a cookie and HTTPS. But be also aware of shared hosting. Some might use a common pool for all session data files of all cumstomers.
