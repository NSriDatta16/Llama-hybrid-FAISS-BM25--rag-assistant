Iterative / Additive MD5

I need to generate a checksum over a dictionary. Keys and Values. Is there any simple way to accomplish this in an iterative way. foreach(var item in dic.Keys) checksum += checksum(dic[item]) + checksum(item); In this case, keys and values could be converted to strings, concatinated and then a single checksum applied over these but is there a better way? Ideally MD5 but other options could work. Using this to validate data that is passed over a couple of storage methods. The checksum is then encrypted along with some other information (using AES) so I am not horribly worried about an ideal, unbreakable checksum.
