You can add a custom setup DLL to your CAB file to perform actions. This could conceivably read some other text file to do the configuration, but that extra file would have to be deployed along with the CAB and the CAB would have to either know or be able to determine that file's location. How it would do that would depend on how your install works (i.e. from a storage card, via ActiveSync, etc).
