Which software development practices provide the highest ROI?

The software development team in my organization (that develops API's - middleware) is gearing to adopt atleast one best practice at a time. The following are on the list: Unit Testing (in its real sense), Automated unit testing, Test Driven Design & Development, Static code analysis, Continuous integration capabilities, etc.. Can someone please point me to a study that shows which 'best' practices when adopted have a better ROI, and improves software quality faster. Is there a study out there? This should help me (support my claim to) prioritize the implementation of these practices.
