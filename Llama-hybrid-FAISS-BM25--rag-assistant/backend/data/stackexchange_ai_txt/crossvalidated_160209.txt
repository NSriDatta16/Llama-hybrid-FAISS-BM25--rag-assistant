Your hybrid approach sounds a little bit odd to me, especially if you consider analysing time series data. This could lead to situations where you are comparing three points in time, which have no cases in common. Example : t0 case1 case2 case3 case4 (rest is missing) t1 case3 case4 case5 case6 (rest is missing) t1 case5 case6 case7 case8 (rest is missing) t0 & t1 = compare case3 and case4 t1 & t2 = compare case5 and case6 One possible way to deal with missing values without loosing cases, would be using multiple imputation. In multiple imputation you substitute each missing value by several plausible values based on a pre-specified regression model for each variable. An alternative would be estimating the model with the full information maximum likelihood approach, which is used in many structural equation modeling software packages. For univariate statictics both approaches could be a bit over the top, but I would give it a chance.
