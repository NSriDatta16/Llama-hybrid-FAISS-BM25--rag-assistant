I suggest using a type adapter. These are normally used to adapt XML string values into more strongly-typed values like timestamps, but you can also use them to adapt strings to strings. First, create a subclass of javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter . This class will have to implement marshal and unmarshal , converting to and from the value of your field, and the HTML fragment in the XML. Once you have that, you can annotate your field with @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(MyAdapter.class) And that should be it.
