Shouldn't a test be repeated X times and average the results to determine the best machine learning model?

I have searched in several web pages how to choose the best machine learning model for a dataset and they all seem to agree that they should be compared using the same seed. However, they only run the test once and choose the best result of all. Shouldn't you run a lot of tests and average the results before choosing one? It may happen that for a given seed a model has obtained very good results when, in general, it does not give good results.
