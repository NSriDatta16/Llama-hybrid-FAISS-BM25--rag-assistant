Why is video classification still not that accurate?

I was wondering, with the advent of deep learning, many tasks related to images have been solved to near human accuracy such as classification, object detection etc., however in videos, traditional methods still compare to deep learning methods and both are not as good. I wanted to understand what and how is it that with videos that understanding them makes it much harder.
