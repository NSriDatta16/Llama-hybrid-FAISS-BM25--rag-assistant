Does it make sense computing the mean value of a set of MSE values?

First of all, thank you for your attention. One of my class projects asked me to quantify the asymmetry of 3 classes of moles, given a dataset. In order to do that, I estimated the MSE between a 2D version of the mole and its 2D flipped version. The professor requires the statistical properties of the asymmetry (standard deviation and mean value). Since computing the standard deviation of a set of MSE values didn't seem right to me, I used the RMSE the std, but I don't know what to do with the mean. I quantified the asymmetry taking the MSE value in percentage. Taking the mean of those values for each class is something I can do or is it conceptually wrong?
