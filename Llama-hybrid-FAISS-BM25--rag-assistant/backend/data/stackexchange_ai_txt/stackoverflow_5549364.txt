jQuery FullCalendar event deletion by dragging

I have this code: eventDragStop: function(event, jsEvent, ui, view) { calendar.fullCalendar('removeEvents', event.id); } But I'm stuck there. I'd like to be able to drag the event over a div with the class name of "event-delete" and the event is deleted. I've tried several ways to identify if the event is being dragged over the delete div to no avail. The solution above seems to partially be working. The event trigger is working but freezes any dragged element in place.
