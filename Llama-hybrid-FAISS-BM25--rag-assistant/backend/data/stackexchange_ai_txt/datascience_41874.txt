Building predictive model with low correlated data

I have been working on a project with low features and only few entry fields ( 4 to be exact ). All the data in the dataset is barely correlated to each other. Is there some organized way or approaches to tackle such data and thus build a predictive model out of it. To give you a little glimpse of the dataset, here are a few columns from the +----+----------+-----------+---------+ | ID | OAG CODE | CONSIGNEE | SHIPPER | +----+----------+-----------+---------+ | 11 | 665 | 1001 | 20100 | | 11 | 665 | 1006 | 20105 | | 13 | 667 | 1023 | 20110 | | 13 | 669 | 1015 | 20104 | | 13 | 669 | 1006 | 20105 | +----+----------+-----------+---------+ I want to perform EDA over the data and also build a predictive model from the same. Please point out some of the standard techniques and methods for tackling such a problem.
