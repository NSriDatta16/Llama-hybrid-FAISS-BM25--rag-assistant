While I haven't done this myself I'm pretty sure that members on the EF team have, as has Kevin Hoffman . So it is probably just that you went astray with one step in your porting process. It sounds like you tried to update the EDMX (XML) by hand, from one that works against a local database. If you do this most of the changes will be required in the StorageModel element in the EDMX (aka SSDL). But it sounds like you've been making changes in the ConceptualModel (aka CSDL) element. My guess is you simply need to replace all references to the dbo schema in the SSDL with whatever schema is the SQL Azure schema. Hope this helps Alex
