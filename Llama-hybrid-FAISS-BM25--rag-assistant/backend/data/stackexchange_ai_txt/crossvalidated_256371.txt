Taking the average of the predictions from several neural networks trained separately is a common ensemble method . It often slightly improves the prediction, e.g. see Ensemble of convolutional neural networks for pattern recognition tasks? . Some visual explanation from http://images.slideplayer.com/17/5270015/slides/slide_2.jpg : (unlike what the slide says, the training data and the learning algorithms do not have to be different.)
