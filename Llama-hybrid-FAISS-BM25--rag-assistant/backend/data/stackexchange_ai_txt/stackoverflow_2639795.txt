No. You cannot use #include without the preprocessor. Without preprocessor directives, including the same file twice will always result in the same sequence of tokens. There are a couple non-portable ways to do this (both use the preprocessor), such as: #pragma once and #import "file.h" But header guards work everywhere , and your compiler is probably optimized to check for header guards so it won't even bother processing a duplicate #include directive.
