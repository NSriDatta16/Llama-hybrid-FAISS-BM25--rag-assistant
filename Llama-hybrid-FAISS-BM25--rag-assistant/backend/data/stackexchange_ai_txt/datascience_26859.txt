I used my existing directory structure with Git LFS and it works well. Here are the advantages I got by using Git LFS other than the alternative solutions. It saves space : Since Git LFS manages my dataset files (100MB to 1GB) with pointers and keeping only the minimum in the local memory. It works seamlessly with a git enabled repository : I was planning to use some storage solution (like Amazon S3) specific for my datasets. But I would have to make extra efforts to manage multiple version and keep my dataset files in sync.
