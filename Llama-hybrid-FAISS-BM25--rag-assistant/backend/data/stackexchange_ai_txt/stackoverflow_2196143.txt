First off: defense in depth. If you have concerns about the security of the backup site secure the backup site . Mitigating attacks through encryption is a good idea, but it should not be the only idea. Second, why are you thinking about using public/private key crypto? Normally you'd only use public/private key crypto when attempting to communicate a message from a sender to a recipient. What value does public key crypto add to your scenario? To encrypt the stream in C#, this page might help: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307010 UPDATE: Absolutely, YES, you have to encrypt the files before they get to the site which you are assuming is compromised . You believe that the site might be insecure. The assumption you should be making is that the site is your enemy and is trying to hurt you . Start thinking like your attacker thinks. What would your enemy do? If I were your enemy and you handed me a bunch of files to store on your behalf, I might: delete your files corrupt your files read your files log every byte that comes in or goes out for analysis later replace your files with hostile files -- in particular, all executable code, scripts, and so on, that you store on this site, you should assume are full of viruses targetted specifically at attacking you do stuff to get you in trouble -- forge messages that look like they come from you, and so on Assume that the insecure backup site operators are trying to do all of those things to you. Crypto is a mitigation for some of those attacks, but not all of them. No offense, but it is very clear that you do not know enough about crypto to solve this problem with any reasonable chance of getting it secure against real attackers. That's nothing to be ashamed of; I don't have this knowledge either . Rather, I have sufficient knowledge to know that this problem is beyond me. There's nothing wrong with trying to learn more about crypto; I strongly encourage that. But if you have a real threat here, and you're trying to mitigate it with professional-strength crypto tools, do not roll your own solution . Go hire an expert consultant in this field who can advise you on what the right thing to do is given the realistic threats that you face.
