How do I trigger the Drop event with jQuery UI Droppable without actually dragging and dropping?

I have a droppable with a drop event handler: $(this).droppable({ drop:function(){ console.log('OMG You Dropped It!'); } }); I have a draggable : $(this).draggable(); What I want to do is trigger the drop event handler on the droppable without actually dragging and dropping the draggable . I want to simulate the actual behavior without physically performing the behavior. I thought something like this would do: $(droppable).trigger('drop', [draggable]); Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. Does anyone know how I can accomplish this?
