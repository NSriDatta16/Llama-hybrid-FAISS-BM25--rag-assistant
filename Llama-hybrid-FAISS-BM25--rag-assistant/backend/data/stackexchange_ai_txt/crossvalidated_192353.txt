If you are regressing two (unrelated) time series with seasonality you might get what is called spurious correlation . An example of that is available here "it is important to consider whether significant trends exist in the series; if we ignore a common trend, we may be estimating a spurious regression, in which both $y$ and the $X$ variables appear to be correlated because of the influence on both of an omitted factor, the passage of time" -- source The commond trend could be a drift or a seasonality pattern. In order to avoid spurious correlation it is cornerstone to whiten your data, netting off the effect of trend and seasonality. You can then regress on the residuals. A more formal intro to the problem is available here
