santiiiii's explanation covers the use case of downloading the data in one package execution. If you need to get the data at different times, then you can use a conditional statement in a variable that will give you different file names and database connections based on the supplied value for the variable. You can then set the value of the variable in the SQL Server Agent Job in the Set Values tab. This can give you more flexibility, but santiiiii's solution is definately best if you want to process all three files at the same time.
