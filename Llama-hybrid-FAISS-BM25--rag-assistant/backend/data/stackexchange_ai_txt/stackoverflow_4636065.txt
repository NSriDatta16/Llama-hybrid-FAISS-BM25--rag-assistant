facebook integration for sites

AFAIK, the following are not possible for now: (Assuming we have user A which has allowed us all permissions:) Send a message to a A's friend get A's friends email Aside from the obvious "Like" button, what are the ways that an app can leverage facebook's graph API to increase traffic flow? I find the Like button to be more of a broadcasting mechanism. I was wondering what are the ways that I can specifically tell user B, whom is a friend of User A, that he/she should come check out my site. Many thanks
