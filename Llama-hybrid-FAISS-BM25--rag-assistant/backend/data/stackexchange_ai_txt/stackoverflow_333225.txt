Most of my professional experience involved last-minute feature additions like, "Hey, we should add a recommendation system to this e-Commerce site." The solution was usually a quick and dirty nearest neighbor search - brute force, euclidean distance, doomed to fail if the site ever became popular. But hey, premature optimization and all that... I do enjoy the idea that data mining can be elegant and wonderful. I've followed the Netflix Prize and played with its dataset. In particular, I like the fact the imagination and experimentation have played such a large part in developing the top ten entries: Acmehill blog Acmehill New York Times article Just a guy in a garage blog Just a guy in a garage Wired article So mostly, like a lot of software dev, I think the best algorithm is an open mind and some creativity.
