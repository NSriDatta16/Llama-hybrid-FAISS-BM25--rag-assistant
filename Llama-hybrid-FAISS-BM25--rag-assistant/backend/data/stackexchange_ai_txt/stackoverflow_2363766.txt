Is it possible to make a Category page the homepage in magento?

I would like to display a catergory page as my homepage rather than a CMS page as it seems to be difficult to get a CMS page to properly display items. I have gone to Url rewrite Management and created a url-rewrite for a category Then gone to System|Configuration|Web|Default Pages| and changed Default Web URL to my new url-rewrite from cms but I get a 404 error when I go to the root of my site. Is there a way to redirect the root to a category rather than a CMS page?
