Two levels of a factor in a linear mixed model; one is fixed and another is random. Is that possible?

Can you specify one level of a factor as fixed and the other as random in a linear mixed model (with lmer)? Some background information first: A set of speakers who vary in their proficiency levels (or dominance levels) in English and another language are asked to interpret as many words as possible once in English and once in another language within five minutes. The self-reported proficiency score is gradual and higher when participants are more proficient in English, near zero when they are proficient in both English and another language, and negative when they are more proficient in another language. The hypothesis is that those who have higher positive proficiency scores will do better on the interpreting task in English than in the other language. Participants with negative proficiency scores will perform better in the task in their other language. One simple method to investigate correlations is to find Pearson’s r with two continuous variables; proficiency scores and the proportion of words interpreted in the English task (English/(English+another language). measure_another_lang However, Pearson’s r does not include the fact that the experiment includes repeated measures; each participant was measured twice. I assume that a linear mixed model would give more conservative results and I’ve included a suggestion in the r code below. The task factor has two levels, English + any other language, and both levels are considered as fixed. But "any other language" sounds like a random factor to me. The only criterion for the participants is knowing English and any other language. Some participants are native English speakers, while other participants are non-native English speakers or exposed to both English and another language from birth. Language 1 consists of 15 different languages, with 1 to 5 speakers for each language. Is this an appropriate approach or do I need to take into consideration that languages were sampled randomly in one of the levels of the task factor? data_frame_lmm This question is edited for clarification, adding the hypothesis and a description of other languages (thanks to EdM and Robert Long). I've also made the r code simpler and cleaner to run, including a data frame.
