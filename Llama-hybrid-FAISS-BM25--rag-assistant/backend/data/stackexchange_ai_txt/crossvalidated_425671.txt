Mixture model on binary + continuous data

If I have a dataset of continuous variables (that I can assume are normally distributed), I can identify subgroups using a Gaussian mixture model and implement. Likewise if I have binary data I can model it as a mixture of Bernoulli. I can implement either of these models using likelihood EM approach, or MCMC (typically Gibbs) sampling. However, if my dataset comprises both continuous and binary data, can a mixture model be defined? If so, how?
