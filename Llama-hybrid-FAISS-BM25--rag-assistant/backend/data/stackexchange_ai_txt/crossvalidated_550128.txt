There are a ton of methods you could use, however you would also pick up other anomalies you would have to sift through. You are probably better off (since exercise is most likely pretty well defined) using basic logic such as: Any period of more than 5 minutes of average heart rate > 120 is exercise Maybe there are nuances person to person and you want to use median heart rate to help determine that threshold but to me this seems like the most reliable solution. Additionally, aggregating to minutes using the average per 60 seconds may help to make the exercise periods clearer and protect against a few seconds of running to catch a door or something that might spike the heart rate.
