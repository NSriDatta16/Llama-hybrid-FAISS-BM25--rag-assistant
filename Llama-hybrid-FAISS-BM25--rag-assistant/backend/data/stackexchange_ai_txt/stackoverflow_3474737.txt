Creating three-column table with CSS only? (No table element)

I'm creating templates for a Django project, and I need to create a three column table in HTML, using just CSS, rather than a element. The reason, apart from any ideological opposition to tables, is that the report needs to be viewed on both desktops as well as handheld devices such as BlackBerry. On handhelds, rather than trying to force three columns on a minuscule screen, the objective is to break up the table into a series of consecutive paragraphs. Previously, I'd hacked a quick/dirty template out using the Less framework ( http://lessframework.com/ ). {% for category in article_list_categorised %} {{ category.grouper }} {% for item in category.list %} {{ item.firms.all|join:", " }} {{ item.subject }} {{ item.abstract }} {{ item.source_publication }} {{ item.publication_date }} Page: {{ item.page_number }} {% endfor %} {% endfor %} {% now "l, jS F Y" %} On screen, this gives a three column table, containing a list of articles. For each article (row), we have: First column contains the firm name Second column contains the subject and article abstract Third column contains the source publication, the publication date and the page number. And when displayed on the BlackbBerry browser, it breaks up the columns in consecutive paragraphs, on top of each other. Now, I want to move away from using Less to doing the markup/CSS from scratch. I found another StackOverflow question asking something similar: How to create three columns in css and the advice from there is basically to use and . I've hacked out something like this, two rows, three columns: Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs JBWere Costs AAP June 28, 2010 Page: 3 Deutsche Bank Plans Bloomberg June 29, 2010 Page: 1 My question is, is this optimal, or is there perhaps a more streamlined hierarchy I could go for, or any tags I can strip out of the above? Also, the article referenced in the above question talks about three columns, with one row. I need three columns, with a new row for each article. What's a good way of CSS styling the above, to give three columns, with each set on a new row, and still have it display as consecutive paragraphs on handhelds?
