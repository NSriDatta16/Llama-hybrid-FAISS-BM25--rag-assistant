I had this error because i didn't have both the code signing certificates; 3rd Party Mac Developer Application and 3rd Party Mac Developer Installer. Open keychain, click certificates in the left panel and check you have both certificates, if you don't download them both form the Mac Dev Center, if you do then check that in your release configuration in Xcode that the code sign field is set to 3rd Party Mac Developer Application. You then need to open organiser, find your app and when you share it to test it code sign it with the 3rd Party Mac Developer Installer certificate. Make sure you manually click the drop down menu and choose the certificate because there's a bug which doesn't register your code signing value and then doesn't sign your code. Should solve your problem. All the best, Sami.
