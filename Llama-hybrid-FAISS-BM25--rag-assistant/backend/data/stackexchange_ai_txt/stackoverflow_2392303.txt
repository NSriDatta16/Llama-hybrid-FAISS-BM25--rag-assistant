Am i allowed to use c++ in code which i plan to submit to applestore? (iPhone Product)

I've heard that apple drops a lot of app submissions due to their stiff terms. I dont want to get too far with my project because i know that it will be hard to rewrite it later. Now i began rewriting it to Objective-C (from c++) because i got somehow the impression that apple takes only pure objective-c code. In some places on the net, people offers solutions in c\c++ for problems which cannot be solved with objective-c which makes me kinda think rewriting again. In order to clear things out, can someone please give me a direction to where can i find those iphone-code-terms of apple?
