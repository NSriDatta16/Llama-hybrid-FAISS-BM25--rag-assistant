This is a case of right censoring and (if there had been events) interval censoring. I.e. when a fish is event free when dissected, the event time is right censored (assuming all fish would eventually have the event). If you upon dissection a fish has the event, the event is interval censored to lie between time 0 and the time of dissection. So far, so easy. One tricky bit is when you don't have any events, at all. E.g. simple maximum likelihood estimation based on asymptotics will break down here. However, firstly there's exact methods for some situations (e.g. if you assume the hazard rate to be constant over time) and secondly (more flexible and probably more usefully) there's Bayesian survival analysis. Going Bayesian here with informative (based on the best available prior information/what you elicit from experts) or weakly informative (wider than your prior assumptions suggest) prior distributions is very attractive.
