Long running java process

I have inherited a java system which should be run in the background on a Linux server. The directions call for it to be started java -jar start.jar . This seems a little too fragile for my liking. I'd like it to actually run in the background, ideally starting up automatically at boot time. What is the best way to achieve this? I've looked into running the system within a screen environment, which works fine, but won't automatically start up when the system reboots.
