A real-world example is the parameter estimates in logistic regression. For simplicity, assume a single predictor variable $X$ . The model is $$\mathrm{logit}\,P(Y=1|X=x)=x\beta.$$ If all the observations with $Y=1$ have larger $X$ than all the observations with $Y=0$ , $\hat\beta$ is infinite. The probability of this is exponentially small in $n$ , but non-zero for all finite $n$ . Because the probability is exponentially small for large $n$ , $\hat\beta\stackrel{p}{\to}\beta$ . On the other hand, because the probability is not zero, $\hat\beta$ has no finite moments and so does not converge in mean square.
