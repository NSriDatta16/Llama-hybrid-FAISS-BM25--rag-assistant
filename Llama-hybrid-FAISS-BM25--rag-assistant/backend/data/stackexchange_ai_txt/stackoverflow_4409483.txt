SL4's ListBoxDragDropTarget modifier keys (Shift, Alt, Ctrl) functionalities.

I've recently started playing with Silverlight 4, and in one of my projects I'm required to use drag & drop functionality. I use the ListBoxDragDropTarget , which is not a problem. However I was wondering what are the default use of the modifier keys. I was able to understand that Ctrl means copy, but couldn't find the use of Alt , Shift , or when combining them (I saw that when I click Ctrl + Shift , the icon changes, but I don't understand what it does). I searched a bit on the web, but didn't found any explanation of the default behaviors.
