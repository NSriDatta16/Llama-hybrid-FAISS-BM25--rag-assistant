Forecasting ar(p) for several counties

I have a data set of prices, these prices vary across time and across area. I have 18 areas with 32 time periods. What i want to do is forecast these prices, i have found that a AR(3) process fits the data for each area using first difference. \begin{equation} \Delta \hat{y}_t = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \hat{\beta}_1 \Delta y_{t-2}+ \hat{\beta}_1 \Delta y_{t-3} + \epsilon_t \end{equation} I have been told to investigate panel data methods, however the information i find about dynamic panel data methods requires "large" amount of time series observations (32 not really "large"). My concern is for the latent heterogeneity, assuming prices in one area affects other/neighboring areas, over time. How should my estimation be done when the ultimate goal is forecasting the individual area prices. I have considered several estimation methods, but lack specific knowledge about how to select the best. Estimation methods considered: DPD (dynamic panel data) SUR (Seemingly unrelated regression) SAR (spatial autoregressive models)
