Adding Street View controls (the two icons just above the +) to a Google Map (v3)

It's probably something really simple, but I can't find it in the docs and I can't find a map with it to check it's source... I use version 3 of the API. I guess it's an something to add in myOptions ? var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(-34.397, 150.644); var myOptions = { zoom: 8, center: latlng, mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP } map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map_canvas'), myOptions); Currently I only have dragging controls and the zoom pane controls. I would like to have the two Street View controls icons too. If you want full source, I'm using this example as a base (how would you add Street View controls to this example?).
