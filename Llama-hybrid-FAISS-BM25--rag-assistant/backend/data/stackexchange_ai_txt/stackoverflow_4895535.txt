Is it possible to expose summary-information or similar to get Intellisense on consumed WCF service?

I have a WCF service where methods are alot like the following. Now, I know that the info is not exposed, but how can I get that information exposed, so that the consumer gets the information in intellisense? /// /// Obtains a list of agreements for a given dealer /// /// Object identifying the dealer /// Object containing a list of all agreements for the provided dealer [OperationContract] [FaultContract(typeof(DatabaseFault))] [FaultContract(typeof(ServiceAgentFault))] AgreementListResponse GetAgreements(AgreementListRequest request);
