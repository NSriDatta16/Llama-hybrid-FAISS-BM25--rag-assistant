Building time series models on data with high % of missing values

I am trying to build time series models for prediction of monthly sales volume of a product. I am given data for monthly sales volume of different products over the last 5 years, and I have to build individual models for individual products. Let us assume, I have only 1 product in the dataset. The problem I am facing is the sales volume for most of the months in the data is missing. Something similar to the following. year month sales volume (in M) 2011 10 3 2012 7 4 2013 7 4 8 4 2014 4 5 7 5 10 5 12 7 2015 1 5 4 5 2016 4 6 6 7 12 8 I am confused as to how do I deal with this kind of irregular data and build a forecasting model?
