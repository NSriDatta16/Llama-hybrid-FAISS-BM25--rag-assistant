ADF augmented dickey fuller test Distribution

In this link It is said that "We can use the usual linear regression approach, except that when the null hypothesis holds the t coefficient doesn’t follow a normal distribution and so we can’t use the usual t test. Instead, this coefficient follows a tau distribution, and so our test consists of determining whether the tau statistic τ (which is equivalent to the usual t statistic) is less than τcrit based on a table of critical tau statistics values shown in Dickey-Fuller Table." My question is although at the beginning of paragraph it is said we can not use usual t test, at the bottom it is said test consists of determining whether the tau statistic τ (which is equivalent to the usual t statistic).? Could you help me overcome that contradiction?
