Multiple regression with binary predictors. Component value analysis

I have the data about process duration (in minutes) and components (procedures) done during it like this (CSV): id,time,p1,p2,p3,p4 1,30,1,0,0,0 2,32,1,0,0,0 3,56,1,1,0,0 4,78,1,1,0,1 5,78,1,1,0,1 6,100,1,1,1,1 7,98,0,1,1,1 I need to estimate the duration of each component(procedure) I want to get something like this: component,timeMax,timeMin,timeAverage,timeSD,samples p1,... p2,.... p3,... p4,.... Note: I need the estimated time of procedures not time of processes where procedure was used. I think the solution shold initially group all combinations first and then simple procedures (1 process = 1 procedure ) time shuld be evaluated $$t_1 = 30$$ #id=1 $$t_1 = 32$$ #id=2 then more complex actions should be performed: for example, time of procedure 2 (from sample) could be calculated by subtraction: $$t_1 = \sum{(t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4)} - \sum{(t_2+t_3+t_4)} = 100 - 98 = 2$$ # id 6 - 7 $$t_2 = \sum{(t_1+t_2)} - t_1 = 56 - 30\pm1 = 26\pm1$$ #id 3 - (1,2) $$t_3 = \sum{(t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4)} - \sum{(t_1+t_2+t_4)} = 100 - 78 = 22$$ # id 6 - 5 $$t_4 = \sum{(t_1+t_2+t_4)} - \sum{(t_1+t_2)} = 78 - 56 = 22$$ #id 4 - 3 then average, SD, Min,Max for all $t_i$ is calculated. If there are several procedures are always combined time for each is calculated by dividing combination time by combination size. I think this procedure should be performed only before result output. May be also some kind of correction for procedures that are performed during this sequence. May be there should be iteration limit, or stop condition then last iteration brings no or The second part is to compare procedure times when it is done separately and in combination with others. And to estimate most effective (reducing total time) and ineffective (increasing total time) procedure combinations. The question is: How to achieve this? What methods should/could be used? What statistical software could be used for this task?
