I am having similar problems and I too submitted a bug to JQuery UI and posted here. I have a demo where I used a couple of additional sortable options and it actually seems to work Okay in IE but you cannot drag out of nested lists in FF. $(".myList").sortable({ connectWith: ".myList", appendTo: 'body', helper: 'clone', items: 'li' });
