how would you approach giving an introductory class about Bayesian statistics?

I need to give a lecture about Bayesian statistics, introducing it to people who have already basic knowledge of classic statistics (but not too much of it in general). I want to start with some example, showing the main differences between Bayesian statistics and classic statistics. Is anyone familiar with a very basic intro that I can derive slides from, or actual slides I can use? I think the best would be to start with an example... I would rather not have a coin toss example, but I can be persuaded to do that :-) I would also be happy to talk about some of the history.
