The problem you're attempting to solve (you're dealing with a subset of the problem, given you're restriction of y ) is called Integer Factorization and it cannot be done efficiently given any known algorithm: In number theory, integer factorization is the breaking down of a composite number into smaller non-trivial divisors, which when multiplied together equal the original integer. This problem is what makes a number of cryptographic functions possible (namely RSA which uses 128 bit keys - long is half of that.) The wiki page contains some good resources that should move you in the right direction with your problem. So, your brain teaser is indeed a brain teaser... and if you solve it efficiently we can elevate your math skills to above average!
