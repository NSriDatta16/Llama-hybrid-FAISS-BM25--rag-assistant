There is no relation between a 'correct' coverage probability and predictive performance. Take e.g. as prediction interval the range from the 2.5% to the 97.5% quantile of the responses in the training set. Its coverage probability will probably not be too far away from 95% in an independent test set but the predictive power of this empty model will be poor.
