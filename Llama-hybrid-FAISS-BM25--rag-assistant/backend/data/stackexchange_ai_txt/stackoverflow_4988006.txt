To handle "If-Modified-Since" headers, you need to parse that header and compare it to your last modification date. This isn't done automatically unless you have a HTTP cache like Varnish in front of your web server. In PHP, if the date is satisfactory, then do not render a body, instead return a 304 Not Modified response. Here is a good example of this being done. [php.net] The reason you're getting more requests for your asset than you expect is because you haven't set Cache-Control or Pragma headers. You probably want to do: header("Cache-Control: public, max-age=2419200"); header("Pragma: public"); You may not want to set a max-age this long if you want the client to check in for updates now and again...
