This is to be expected. Your correlation matrix has mostly large positive elements (around 0.4 on average), as shown on your own histogram. In other words, all variables are correlated between each other and tend to vary together . This suggests that the correlation matrix has one large eigenvalue, far surpassing the rest, corresponding to the strong first principal component capturing this "overall" variation of the data. After this first PC is removed from the data, the remaining correlation matrix can be expected to have off-diagonal elements very much closer to zero. Indeed, here is how the eigenvalue spectrum looks like in your case: And here is how your correlation matrix looks (color scale from -1 to 1). On the left is the original matrix; in the middle is its rank-one approximation given by the first PC (i.e. the correlations as reconstructed by PC1); on the right is the residual correlations after the first PC is removed. And I show the corresponding histograms of the off-diagonal elements below. As you see, the matrix has mostly positive elements (looking uniformly "orange") and can be well approximated by its first eigenvector only (middle). The residual is around zero. Note that the mean of the off-diagonal elements after the first PC is removed is not exactly zero (-0.012 in this case). So it is not true that removing the first PC will achieve exact centering of the off-diagonal elements. But in cases like yours one can certainly expect it to happen. (It would be interesting to try to construct an example where it would not be the case; I don't have a ready solution to that.)
