Get document DOCTYPE with BeautifulSoup

I've just started tinkering with scrapy in conjunction with BeautifulSoup and I'm wondering if I'm missing something very obvious but I can't seem to figure out how to get the doctype of a returned html document from the resulting soup object. Given the following html: HTML5 Demos and Examples This is paragraph one This is paragraph two . Can anyone tell me if there's a way of extracting the declared doctype from it using BeautifulSoup?
