What's the point of time series analysis?

What is the point of time series analysis? There are plenty of other statistical methods, such as regression and machine learning, that have obvious use cases: regression can provide information on the relationship between two variables, while machine learning is great for prediction. But meanwhile, I don't see what time series analysis is good for. Sure, I can fit an ARIMA model and use it for prediction, but what good is that when the confidence intervals for that prediction are going to be huge? There's a reason nobody can predict the stock market despite it being the most data-driven industry in world history. Likewise, how do I use it to understand my process further? Sure, I can plot the ACF and go "aha! there's some dependence!", but then what? What's the point? Of course there's dependence, that's why you are doing time series analysis to begin with. You already knew there was dependence . But what are you going to use it for?
