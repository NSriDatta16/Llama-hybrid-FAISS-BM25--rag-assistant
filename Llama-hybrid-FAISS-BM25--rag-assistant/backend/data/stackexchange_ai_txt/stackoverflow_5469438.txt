Well the Information in $_SESSION is just stored as a serialized string on the disk. (If you don't use something like memcached session storage) So reading in that file, unserializing it's contents, changing the appropriate values and then serializing it back should be pretty much everything you need. If you don't want to deal with that you could set the session_id() before session_start() , then edit the values using php and then call session_write_close() to store it on disk again. Sample script for the session id: Sample script for the unserialisation ( function taken from the comments on the unserialze php.net page ) Putting it back together isn't hard ether.
