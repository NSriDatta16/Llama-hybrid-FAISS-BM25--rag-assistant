I would suggest that you obtain a copy of Microsoft® Windows® Internals Fourth Edition: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Windows XP and Windows 2000 There are pdfs floating around in the cyber cloud. This is the book done by the "sysinternals" crowd who have written some very good windows utils over the years. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals You will have to read the chapters on Memory Management Storage Management Cache Manager File Systems They don't directly address your concern but if you manage to read, digest and grasp the very techical paragraphs you can work it out yourself. However if you can predict why Windows does what it does "You are a better man than most". Happy brain freeze reading that lot.
