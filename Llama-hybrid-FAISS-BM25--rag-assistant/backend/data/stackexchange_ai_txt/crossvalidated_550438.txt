Estimating ATT with a linear regression model

Suppose there is a binary treatment such as taking a drug or not. Let $D_i=1$ if an individual $i$ took the drug and $D_i=0$ if she did not. Let $Y^1_i$ is the potential outcome (e.g. blood pressure) when she took the drug. Let $Y^0_i$ is the potential untreated outcome. In this setup, we can estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) using a linear regression like below: $$Y_i=D_i Y_i^1+(1-D_i)Y^0_i \\ =Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$$ where $Y_i$ is the observed outcome. Then, rewriting $Y_i^0$ and $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$ as $$Y_i^0=\mathbb{E}[Y_i^0]+\{Y_i^0-\mathbb{E}[Y_i^0]\} \\ Y_i^1-Y_i^0=\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0]+\{(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)-\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0]\},$$ the observed outcome is $$Y_i=\mathbb{E}[Y_i^0]+\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0]D_i+U_i$$ where $U_i=\{Y_i^0-\mathbb{E}[Y_i^0]\}+\{(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)-\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0]\}D_i$ . Therefore, we can estimate the ATE= $\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0]$ by regressing $Y_i$ on $[1,\;D_i]$ with pretty strong assumptions. Here, I am wondering whether we can also estimate the ATT= $\mathbb{E}[Y_i^1-Y_i^0|D_i=1]$ using a linear regression like above case.
