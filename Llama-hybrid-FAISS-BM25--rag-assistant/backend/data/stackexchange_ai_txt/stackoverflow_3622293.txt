I use YaSnippet and it works just great. It comes default with a lot of snippets for different languages and modes, not only for C++. Plus, you can write your own templates (snippets) and even use Lisp inside them (i.e. generate file header with copyright information including current year). There is also a good documentation . Here is a an example of "once" snippet which is being expanded when you type "once" and hit "tab" button in cc-mode: #name : #ifndef XXX; #define XXX; #endif # -- #ifndef ${1:_`(upcase (file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name))))`_H_} #define $1 $0 #endif And here is my "license" snippet for c++-mode which adds a copyright information with a current year: #name : C++ source file license # -- // // Copyright (C) `(format-time-string "%Y" (current-time))` Bueller? Bueller? // // $Id$ //
