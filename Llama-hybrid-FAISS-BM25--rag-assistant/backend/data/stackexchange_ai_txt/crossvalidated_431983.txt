Help, my neural network is only recognising one particular category?

I am very new to Neural network and python and only know about very basic stuff. I tried to train the neural network with four categories of data however, when tested, the neural network tend to get one specific or two specific categories completely right and the other three categories completely wrong. I end up getting performance 0.25 /0.5. I am pretty sure my coding for the neural network is correct because it worked when I tried handwritten digits. I am just wondering under what kind of circumstance will this happen and if it is my datasets causing the problem.
