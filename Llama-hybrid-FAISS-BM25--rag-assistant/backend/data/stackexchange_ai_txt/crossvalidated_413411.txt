Using Decomposition to Extrapolate seasonality, cycle and trends of predictors

I'm creating a dynamic regression model in which macroeconomic indicators are predictors/features in the model. I need to forecast these features n-steps into the future. I am planning to decompose the time series using statsmodels package from Python. Next, i will take the trend and seasonal components and extrapolate the series n-steps ahead and then combined them for use in the test dataset. Is this the correct approach to extrapolating predictors, absent any other forecast knowledge about their future value or are there better approaches. Despite viewing many papers and articles on forecasting methodology, there is a strange dearth of material on forecasting the predictors. thanks
