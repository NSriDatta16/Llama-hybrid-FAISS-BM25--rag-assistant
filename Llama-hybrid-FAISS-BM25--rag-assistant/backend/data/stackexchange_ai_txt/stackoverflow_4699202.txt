The object oriented paradigm was not derived from a mathematical theory (unlike relational databases), it was initially invented for practical reasons, to simulate processes (Simula). People are trying to find a good mathematical foundation for it so that the existing languages can be polished or moddified, nice theoretical properties can be uncovered and so on. The work on "Abstract Data Types" is such a train of thought. There are probably other mathematical ways of looking at object orientedness. I found some information in "Object Oriented Software Construction", 2nd edition, Bertrand Meyer.
