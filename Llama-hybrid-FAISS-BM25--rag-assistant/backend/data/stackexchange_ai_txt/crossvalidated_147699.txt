I appreciate the school example, but for simplicity I stay with the original example, which was: lmer(Dep~X1+X2+X3+(1|R2/R1)) (R2=Genus, R1=Species) You make two comments I can use the average values of traits for each R1 and then drop the R1 random effect, but then I lose lots of data Response variable has no variation within species So, within each group of R1, despite variation in the fixed effects, there is no difference in the response. This may or may not be the reason why you get identifiability problems, in any case you have a very high chance to wrongly attribute variation in the response to either fixed / random effects. To solve this issue, I would probably go with your comment 1 after all, i.e. averaging trait values. If the response doesn't change there is nothing to be learned from the within-species variability, so you are not loosing information. However, note that then the averaged X1,X2,X3 are estimates from a distribution, and thus have an error. Error on the predictors can bias regression slopes. You should consider using a method that accounts for error-in-variable, such as a model II regression. I would think the most convenient way to do this is a Bayesian solution, see, e.g. http://mbjoseph.github.io/blog/2013/05/27/typeII/ Addition: if you desperately want to include phylogenetic information on the species-level, you could use a) PGLS (e.g. http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-43550-2_5 ), which accounts for phylogenetic signal in the residuals, or b) some mixed model where phylogenetic distance informs the covariance structure of the random effects. An example of the latter (admittedly not exactly what you want) is Ives, A. R. & Helmus, M. R. (2011) Generalized linear mixed models for phylogenetic analyses of community structure. Ecological Monographs, Ecological Monographs, 81, 511-525.
