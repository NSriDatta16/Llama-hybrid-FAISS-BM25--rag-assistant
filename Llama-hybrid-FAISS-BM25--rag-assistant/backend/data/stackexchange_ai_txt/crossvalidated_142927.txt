Cluster Assignment in Bayesian perspective

I am going to study clustering methods in the Bayesian perspective. I understood how k-means works, and I found it pretty clear, due to the notion of distance and assignments to specific centers. I am now turning the attention to the probabilistic approach and the use of mcmc methods. I have read this question: Dirichlet Processes for clustering: how to deal with labels? and a useful page: https://snippyhollow.github.io/blog/2013/03/10/collapsed-gibbs-sampling-for-dirichlet-process-gaussian-mixture-models/ However, I do not understand how to assign points to clusters. Which kind of posterior distribution should I compute? What is the meaning of sampling from the posterior distribution in layman's terms? Do I obtain a probability for each point to belong to any possible cluster?
