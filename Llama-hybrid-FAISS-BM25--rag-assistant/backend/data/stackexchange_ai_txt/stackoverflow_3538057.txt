How to use a .TTF font that .NET says "Is not a truetype font" in a .NET program?

I have downloaded a font, [Betsy Flanagan][1], that I'd like to use in my program that shows on-screen keyboard shortcuts and their meaning in various programs. However, when selecting the font in Visual Studio 2010 for a label, I get an error message that says "Only TrueType fonts are supported. This is not a TrueType font." Is there any way for me to display text with this font in a .NET program? Since this is a specialized toast-like form, with just one label that needs to have this particular font, I don't really care if it is a hack to do it (like P/Invoke or similar.) Note : This is a .NET 4.0 Winforms application.
