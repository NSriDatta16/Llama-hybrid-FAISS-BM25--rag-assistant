Can't build chart from simple values on page

I'm trying to build a chart based on the values on this stress test (2nd page - you can just click next as I havent set any of the questions as mandatory), however I cant seem to create the chart from the list of values that are calculated. I tried using JQplot but cant seem to get it to work.... Link is below. http://www.beatinganger.com/stress-test Any help would be HUGELY appreciated.
