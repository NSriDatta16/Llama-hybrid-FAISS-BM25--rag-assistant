Move certain nodes that are sibling of select node into a new parent node

I did some searching here and found some questions that were related to my problem, but I'm still having trouble...(hope it's ok that I'm adding a new question instead of commenting on an existing one..) Main Section Here is some text that is a child of a main section. Some more text. When a section has subsections, it should not have loose paragraphs before the first sub section. Those loose paras should be placed inside a comment element. This is my subsection Text that is inside of the sub-section And some more sub section text. I want to have the /section/para placed inside a newly created comment node, like so: Main Section Here is some text that is a child of a main section. Some more text. When a section has subsections, it should not have loose paragraphs before the first sub section. Those loose paras should be placed inside a comment element. This is my subsection Text that is inside of the sub-section And some more sub section text. I tried some of the suggestions I found searching stackoverflow, the closest one is here. This is the stylesheet I'm using: It's outputting this: Main Section This is my subsection Text that is inside of the sub-section And some more sub section text. simply deleting the paras I want to wrap in a comment tag. I tried going essentially line by line through the stylesheet in the question I linked to...any ideas? thanks, bp
