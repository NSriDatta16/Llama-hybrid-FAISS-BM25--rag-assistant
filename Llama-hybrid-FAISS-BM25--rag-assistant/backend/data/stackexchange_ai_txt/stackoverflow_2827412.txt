MVC, Service Layer and file upload/storage

I'm a using a layered architecture with Zend Framework. I have MVC with : Controllers > (DTOs) Services (Service Layer) > (DOs) Repositories > Persistance Now i have to handle image galleries. The upload process is handle by the front, but what part is responsible for the thumbs generation ? Do i have to store pictures to a temp folder from the front, passing the temp path to a service which will handle resizing and will move the file to the storage server folder ? Or do i have to handle the pictures resizing/storage process from the front and pass only the picture URL to the service ? The purpose of the Service Layer is to move application logic and keep the controllers thin. But for those cases i really don't know who is responsible of what :) Have you any advices ?
