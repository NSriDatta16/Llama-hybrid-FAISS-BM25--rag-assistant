Are there algorithms and tools that can optimize black box functions with black box constraints?

Suppose that we have an objective function $f$ which have as parameters $x_1, x_2$ . $f$ is an objective function to be maximized for a given problem.Lets say: $$f(x_1,x_2)=x_1+x_2+E(x_1,x_2)$$ where $E$ is a neural network model. Thus $E$ is not expressed as an explicit mathematical relation. Let's also assume that the problem have one constraint: $$G(x_1, x_2) where $C$ is a constant and $G$ as for $E$ is modelled using a neural network. My question is the following: Is it possible to optimize this problem assuming that we do not know how $F$ and $G$ executes the results? Are there any tools that can deal with sort of problems?
