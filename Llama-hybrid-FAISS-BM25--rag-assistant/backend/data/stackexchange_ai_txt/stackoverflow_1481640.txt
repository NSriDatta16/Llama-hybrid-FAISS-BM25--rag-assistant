Do you control the interface of the service? If so, surely the elegant solution is for the service to accept an aggregate Tender object in a single method rather than having the chatty methods that you have now. The Tender would then have Items and Documents as subcollections, and the data access code could handle all the updates in single transaction much more easily. Unless I am misunderstanding, it seems very similar to an Order/OrderDetails scenario, where the same logic applies.
