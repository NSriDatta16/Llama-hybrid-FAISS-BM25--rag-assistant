How can I store my atom data so my IRC bot can access it? Should I use SQL at all?

I want to add feeds such as ajaxian, smashingmagazine and store feeds starting today on my server, in order so that I can push the new items to my irc bot so it can echo them in my channel. I will get ATOM data from this service: http://superfeedr.com/subscriber .. so I'm wondering which of the NoSQL storage mechanisms is ideal for storing ATOM data? The atom data is xml, so they are documents, so perhaps something like CouchDB is suitable? Or MongoDb/Cassandra/Redis? I'm aware that there are different kinds of no sql databases such as document oriented vs key/store, but as I don't have much experience I'd appreciate some insight from someone way more experienced. Thanks. Additional things to consider These won't be displayed on a website, or any publically viewable URL. The only way to view them is to either a) wait for the bot to post new ones every hour or b) manually query the bot and give a time range or something like 0,20 and 20,40 through PM on IRC. I won't really need to scale, I just have 15-20 people in the IRC chat room and only 1-3 people on average would probably query the bot at a given hour. The bot will spit out new links every hour. The bot will never spit out old links.
