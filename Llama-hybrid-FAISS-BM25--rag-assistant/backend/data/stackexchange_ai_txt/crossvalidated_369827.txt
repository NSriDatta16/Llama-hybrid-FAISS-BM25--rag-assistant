Bayesian p-value in wrong direction using step function in JAGS / BUGS

I have estimated a Weibull regression model in JAGS using rjags and R2JAGS. The estimated posterior predictive p-values using the step() function confuse me. They make sense (comparing them to lower and upper bound) when the estimated regression coefficients are negative but seem wrong, and almost like 1-p would be correct, when reg coefficients are estimated to be positive. Is that just how the step function works? The thing is, in examples, I only see step functions implemented like: ppp.b.0 0. This is the result: And this is the model: modelstring.sl
