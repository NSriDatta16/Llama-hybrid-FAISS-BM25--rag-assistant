How can I make Link Features for Link Prediction in Graph Convolutional Network or Logisitic Regression?

Currently studying Graph Convolutional Network or Logistic Regression and have come to understand how it works and how I can do node classifications with given node features but I have a difficulty in understand how to make link features for Link Prediciton using Graph Convolutional Network or Logistic Regression. Hope to hear some explanations.
