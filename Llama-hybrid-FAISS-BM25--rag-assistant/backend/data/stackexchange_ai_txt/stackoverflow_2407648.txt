Depends on what you mean by terminate connections. You might mean providing an end-point for a TCP circuit or UDP stream. Or you could mean sending an acceptable RST in the middle of a TCP stream to indicate the end of the stream. To achieve this you have to know the sequence number expected by the other side amongst other things. Either way it is obvious you haven't been paying attention in class. The entire point of the assignment, it seems, is to show you understand the raw layout of IP packets and possibly TCP/UDP. I suggest you purchase a textbook on the subject (no doubt recommended by your lecturer) and/or take a read of Wikipedia.
