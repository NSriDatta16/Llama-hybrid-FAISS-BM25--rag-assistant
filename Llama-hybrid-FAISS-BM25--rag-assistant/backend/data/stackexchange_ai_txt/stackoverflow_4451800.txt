jQuery drag and drop position error

Recently I have come to a dead end with the drag and drop on jQuery. I have some div elements inside of a div container, all of this elements are positioned using top and left css attributes. Some of this elements must remain hidden (css display:none) and when a specific event triggers, some of the hidden elements must be displayed. So far we are good, because even though the elements were hidden, when they are shown they are located on their correct spots with the top and left they were given. The problem starts when one of this previously hidden elements are dragged to be positioned to some other place; for some odd reason when the drag starts, the element instead of stick to the cursor position, it goes like 300px below the cursor and 200px to the left. Why is this happening, how can I solve the problem?
