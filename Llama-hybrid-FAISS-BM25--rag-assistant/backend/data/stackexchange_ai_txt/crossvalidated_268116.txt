Would it make sense to classify pdf documents based on their structure with RNNs?

I am wondering if using RNNs to classify pdf documents for types of documents (i.e. scientific papers, books, reports, etc) based on the structural components like the text boxes and image boxes and their coordinates will make sense. Will the sequential order of the components make a good model of the type of document or are pdf files structure too messy for that? If you think not what would it be the best approach to use this structural info to classify the documents or will image classification approaches work better?
