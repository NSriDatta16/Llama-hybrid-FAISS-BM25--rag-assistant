naming the id field of a table properly

I am currently reading the book "SQL Programming Style" wrote by Joe Celko. In the first chapter, at the paragraph "Develop Standardized Postfixes" he states for the id column : "_id" = identifier. It is unique in the schema and refers to one entity anywhere it appears in the schema. Never user ">table_name Few pages later he states Do not use an underscore as the first or last letter in a name. It looks like the name is missing another component. He deprecated "id" as column name. So I would like to know how you guys name the id column ? I know that most people might think what the point of this question, but I am looking on standardizing my data model, following industry standards and ISO standards as much as I can.
