Having had problems with IE and ssl in the past, I've found that the following headers Cache-Control: cache, must-revalidate Pragma: public Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel // MIME type Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="excelDownload.xls" Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary Content-Length: 1024 // size as appropriate work for me (in addition to the usual Expires and Last Modified headers)
