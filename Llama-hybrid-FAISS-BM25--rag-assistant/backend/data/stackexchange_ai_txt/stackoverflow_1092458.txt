Blackberry | Keeping local Persistant Storage up to date with remote database

I'm developing a blackberry application to remotely access an external customer database. Selected employees can change customer entries via a webinterface accessible in our intranet. I don't want the blackberry to contact the database on every request, so I built in a local storage, which stores the top 50 selected customers of the blackberry user. What the best practice to keep both records in sync? I thought about creating an hashcode of each record to reduce the datasize to transfer (and though the energy necessary to transmit it). Can anyone here tell me what they do, to reduce requests by a mobile device? Thanks, rAyt
