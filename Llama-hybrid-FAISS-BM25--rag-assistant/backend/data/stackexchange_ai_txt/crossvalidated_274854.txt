The MLE is still an estimator for a parameter in a model you specify and assume to be correct. The regression coefficients in a frequentist OLS can be estimated with the MLE and all the properties you want to attach to it (unbiased, a specific asymptotic variance) still assume your very specific linear model is correct. I'm going to take this a step further and say that every time you want to ascribe meaning and properties to an estimator you have to assume a model. Even when you take a simple sample mean, you are assuming the data is exchangeable and oftentimes IID. Now, Bayesian estimators have many desirable properties that an MLE might not have. For example, partial pooling, regularization, and interpretability of a posterior which make it desirable in many situations.
