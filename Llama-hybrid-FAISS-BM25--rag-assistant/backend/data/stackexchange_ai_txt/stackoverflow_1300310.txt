HTTPResponse - Return organised data (table?)

My Webservice is currently returning a HTTPResponse which contains thousands of data from a mySQL database (via a Objects.filter). It's currently just displating them in a very boring way! I'm looking to organised this data in some way. What would be ideal is two things: The possibility of having a table and maybe having some kind of scroll bar? Does anyone have any idea what I'm referring to or what package would help me?
