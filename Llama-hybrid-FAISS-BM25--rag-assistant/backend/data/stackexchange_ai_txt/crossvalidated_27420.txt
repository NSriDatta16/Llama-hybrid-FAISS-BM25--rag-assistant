Does the GARCH approach model prices or returns?

I have a simple question about the GARCH model. We know that the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters of the models are fitted for the local volatility of each time $t$ as follows: $$\sigma_t^2= \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \varepsilon_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i \sigma_{t-i}^2$$ with $\varepsilon_t=\sigma_t z_t$ and $z_t \sim N(0,1)$ However, the wikipedia article says that the process $y$ is behaving as follows: $$y_t=a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q a_i y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t$$ I just wanted to make sure that here we assume that $y_t$ is the "original" time series values, and hence that $\varepsilon_t$ was the "return" of the time series at time $t$. Is that correct? In a financial application, would $y_t$ be the price or the return at time $t$? EDIT : As the answers indicates that $y_t$ models the returns, I'm a bit surprised because usually you use the maximum log-likelihood: $$\log L = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\log (2 \pi) + \log (\sigma_{i}^2) + \frac{y_i^2}{\sigma_i^2} \right)$$ But this is only true if $y_i \sim N(0,\sigma_i^2)$ Now clearly with the setup presented above $\text{Var}(y_i) = \sigma_i^2$, but if $a \neq 0 ~ \forall i$, then $E[y_i] = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q a_i y_{t-i} \neq 0$ Is it because the log-likelihood is computed assuming $a=0 \forall i$?
