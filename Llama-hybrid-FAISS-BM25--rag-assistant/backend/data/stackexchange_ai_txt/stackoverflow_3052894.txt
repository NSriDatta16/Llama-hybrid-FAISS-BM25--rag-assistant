Cannot drop custom Workflow activity for TFS2010 in custom build process template

I've created a custom workflow activity for TFS 2010 to customize the assembly versioning. I've created the activity and tested it using a Testworkflow and some unit testing code. It works fine. When I create a new build process template however, I cannot drop the custom activity onto the workflow designer. When I drag it to the position I want to insert it, the mouse cursor shows me the stop-sign. Here is what I did: - Create new build process template (as a copy of the default template) - Get latest for the new template, so I have a local copy of it. - Check out the new template - Open it in the workflow designer - Locate the position where I want to add my custom activity - In the toolbox, click Choose Items... and locate the dll that contains my custom activity - Locate the activity in the toolbox and drag it onto the workflow Adding any of the standard activities to the build process workflow works fine. I'm puzzled, what am I missing here?
