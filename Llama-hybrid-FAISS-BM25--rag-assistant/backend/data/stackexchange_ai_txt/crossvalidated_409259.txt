Interpreting very high conditional and very low marginal R^2 in linear mixed effect model

I've fit a linear random slope mixed effect model to some time series data from multiple participants. Here time is the fixed effect and participant is the random effect. I've received a very high conditional R^2 (~.99) and a very small marginal R^2 (~.01). I'd like some advice on how to interpret this. Thus far my understanding is this. The high conditional R^2 suggests most of my variance is in between my random effect levels (in this instance this is the different time-series of different participants). That is, to fit the models well, I have to alter the coefficients pretty drastically per participant. Given that roughly 98% of the variance is being accounted for by adjusting the coefficients, it seems to me that a value of 1% is actually quite high for the marginal R^2. That is, once you ignore the differences between participants, roughly half of the variance is accounted for. Is this an appropriate way to think about this? Another way of thinking of what I mean (this seems pretty abstract to me as it is) is that if I was only looking at one participant with multiple sets of time series observations, the random effect variance should now not be present, therefore the variance account for would be higher because overall there is less variation? Concisely, is my marginal R^2 fine despite being very small but has been squashed down because of just how much variability is between my participants?
