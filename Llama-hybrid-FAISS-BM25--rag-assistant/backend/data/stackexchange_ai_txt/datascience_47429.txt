ways to represent document by its keyword vectors

I have documents, say for example, D 1 , D 2 , D 3 ... D m . Every D i has its individual components or keywords k 1 , k 2 , k 3 ,... k n , where k i is an n-dimensional vector. The number of individual components varies between documents. What are the ways to find how close D i are? Or what is the best way to represent a document using its keyword vectors? Please note that I'm using a custom embedding here.
