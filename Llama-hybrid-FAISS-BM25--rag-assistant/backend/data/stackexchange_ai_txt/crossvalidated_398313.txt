Note the comparisons between the vertical axes of your decomposition plots. The seasonal signals are tiny compared to the other signals and the noise. This earlier thread is closely related: Even after seasonality adjustment, seasonality still remains. Why? Figuring out which seasonality is "real" is a bit of a philosophical question. As long as you don't create your data yourself, you don't know your actual data generating process. If what you are looking for is good forecasts , then I suggest you run different models on holdout samples and use whatever yields the smallest holdout error. This may be a simpler model than the actual data generating process. Conversely, if what you are looking for is understanding , then I don't think you can do much better than what I wrote in the first paragraph. Biweekly paycheck effects may have an impact... but I have looked for similar effects in retail sales, and I find them much more rarely than a nice narrative and story would suggest.
