I would probably go with Enterprise Library's logger, as I'd generally prefer one integrated library over using two separate libraries. If you were only going to be using the logging block from EntLib, then I would probably choose log4net, but in this case, where you are going to be using EntLib anyway, the advantages of log4net over EntLib are minor enough as to not make them whilewhile to drag in another dependancy.
