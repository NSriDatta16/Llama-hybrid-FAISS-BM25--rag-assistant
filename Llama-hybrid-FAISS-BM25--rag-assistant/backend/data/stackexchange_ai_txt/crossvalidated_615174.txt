Weights from matching and weighting are closest to pweights . They serve the same purpose, which is to shift the distribution of covariates to some target distribution. Sampling weights shift the distribution of variables to resemble that of the sampled population. Propensity score weights for the ATE shift the distribution in each treatment group to resemble that in the full sample. Matching weights for the ATT shift the distribution of the control group to resemble that of the treatment group. That said, it's best not to try to fit propensity score weights into this categorization. As you said, the point estimates are the same, and all that differs is the standard errors. But you should not be using the standard errors that happen to be produced automatically by Stata. You should use the specific standard error estimator that corresponds to the method you use. Robust (sandwich) standard errors are conservative for propensity score weighting for the ATE, which can be requested using vce(HC3) . There are asymptotic standard errors for propensity score weighting when the weights are estimated using logistic regression, which can be requested using teffects ipw . For matching without replacement, cluster-robust standard errors are appropriate and can be requested using vce(subclass) if subclass contains matched pair membership. For matching with replacement, teffects nnmatch and teffects psmatch have a special standard error estimator that was designed for that method.
