Suppose the variable of interest was an income tercile (1, 2, or 3). Let's make the middle third the omitted category. I would predict $Pr(y=1)$ for everyone as they are in the data. Then I would flip the dummy variables for the top category $d_3$ to 1 for everyone, and set $d_1$ to zero. Predict again as if everyone was in the top third. Calculate the difference for each person and then take the average over everyone to get the finite difference effect from being in the top tercile.
