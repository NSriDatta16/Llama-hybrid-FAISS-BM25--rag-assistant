Pass by value in Objective-C?

I'm looking at understanding objective-c and I came into a problem in tapping the screen and incrementing the count variable which I store in my appdelegate. - (void)updateLabel:(NSInteger)num { NSString *s = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"%@", num]; countLabel.text = s; [s release]; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { TestAppDelegate *aDel = (TestAppDelegate *)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate; aDel.count++; NSInteger num = aDel.count; [self updateLabel:num]; } I get the EXC_BAD_ACS which to me says I'm trying to access something I'm not. It looks like I cannot send updateLabel the num variable because the scope of the primitive type goes away at the end of the method and then when updateLabel tries to access it, I get the error? I wanted to know if I understood this concept correctly. Thanks.
