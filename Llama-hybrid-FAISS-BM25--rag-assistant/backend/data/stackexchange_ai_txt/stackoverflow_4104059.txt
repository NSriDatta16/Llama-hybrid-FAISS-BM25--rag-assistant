Best modern Web Server engine or framework on Java for HTTP requests?

Could you tell me, what is the best Web Server engine for embedding into Java application? I have some logic written on Java and I want this logic to be wrapped into Web Server. Solution must be stable, fast and do not have memory leaks.
