How do I detect the supported framework architecture (x86 or x86-64) in Mono and .NET?

In .NET/Windows there is the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment variable which identifies whether a running process is x32, x64 or IA64. There's also the GetNativeSystemInfo API method which can tell whether Windows OS supports x86-64. Is it true that there always will be an x64 version of .NET Framework as long as x86 version available on Windows x64? Or are there any means to detect what platforms are supported by the .NET installation on the machine? What about Mono/Linux or other non-Microsoft implementations? Can the x86 version of Mono run on x86-64 Linux? How do I detect (programmatically) what platforms are supported by a Mono installation? Added 16.11.2010 Iâ€™m developing a kind of plugin system (ok, I know there is AddIns system but it is too flooded with pipeline assemblies). What I want to do is to find out what kinds of assemblies can be loaded in the running process (represented by a platform neutral assembly) and what assembly architectures can be executed by the system in the isolated process. The solution to create test assemblies for every architecture in the system and try to launch it does not look elegant.
