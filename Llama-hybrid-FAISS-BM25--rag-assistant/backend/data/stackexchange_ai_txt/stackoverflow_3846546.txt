Cocoa Touch - Hypothetical Lag Comparisons

Hey all, I'm developing a rhythm game for the iPhone at the moment, just wondered if anyone had any thoughts on the best pieces to use for reaction time. I have all the coding worked out, and I've narrowed it down to about 2 ways: 1: Using instances of UIButton that bypass the UIControlEvent or whatever, in order to use touchesBegan and touchesEnded. I've found this to be a bit faster in the past. 2: Using UIViews with custom functions to change the state of the buttons. They would also use touches began. The rhythm pads (eight of them) need to be able to play a sound with minimal lag, and provide some sort of feedback, i.e. changing the image of the button. My question: Is it better to Use UIViews and make my own buttons, or actual UIButtons that have been subclassed to use touchesBegan etc?
