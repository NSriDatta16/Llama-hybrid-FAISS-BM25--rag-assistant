Set Identity_insert on - Merge Replication

I have merge replication set up between two databases and am using identity ranges on both. I want to add a specific row to a merged table (setting the identity value to something outside of the identity range) on the publisher. When I try this, I get the following error. The insert failed. It conflicted with an identity range check constraint in database 'xxx', replicated table 'dbo.yyy', column 'yyy_id'. If the identity column is automatically managed by replication, update the range as follows: for the Publisher, execute sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange; for the Subscriber, run the Distribution Agent or the Merge Agent. Is there a way to force specific identity value into a merge replicated table that is using identity range management?
