Here's a provisional solution - not elegant, but it works. In the code-behind for Form.Master I have something along these lines: Private Sub FormView1_ItemInserting(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormViewInsertEventArgs) Handles FormView1.ItemInserting ManuallyAddValues(e.Values) End Sub Private Sub FormView1_ItemUpdating(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormViewUpdateEventArgs) Handles FormView1.ItemUpdating ManuallyAddValues(e.NewValues) End Sub Private Sub ManuallyAddValues(ByRef Values As IOrderedDictionary) For Each Field As Core.Field In FormView1.DataSourceControl.IncludedFields If Values(Field.Name) Is Nothing Then Dim DataboundControl As Control = FormView1.FindControl("FormRows").FindControl(Field.Name) Values.Add(Field.Name, GetValue(DataboundControl)) End If Next End Sub This isn't so elegant because I have to know the names of all databound controls This relies on the assumption that the ID of each control matches the fieldname The 'GetValue' function (not included here) is a clumsy solution: it checks for various types (textbox, dropdownlist, checkbox, etc.) and gets the string value from the appropriate property (textbox.text, dropdownlist.selectedvalue, checkbox.checked, etc.). I'd still love to at least have a way of knowing what's bound with the ' ' syntax and getting that information directly.
