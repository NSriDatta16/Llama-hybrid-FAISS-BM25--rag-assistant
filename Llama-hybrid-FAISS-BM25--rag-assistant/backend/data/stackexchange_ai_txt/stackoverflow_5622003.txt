Upload image using POST, php and Android

I am getting the following error message after trying to upload an image using a MultipartEntity in android: Error: Problem with [picture] (File upload error 4) I am using the following code to upload the image: String url = "http://www.uploadurl.com/api/files.php"; HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(); HttpContext localContext = new BasicHttpContext(); HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(url); MultipartEntity multiEntity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE); File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + "/Temp/" + IMAGE_FILENAME); ContentBody cBody = new FileBody(file); StringBody sb1 = new StringBody(getNameFormatted()); StringBody sb2 = new StringBody(getDeviceID()); MultipartEntity multipartContent = new MultipartEntity(); multipartContent.addPart("name", sb1); multipartContent.addPart("uuid", sb2); multipartContent.addPart("picture", cBody); httpPost.setEntity(multipartContent); HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost, localContext); I'm not sure what i'm doing wrong, I have uploaded images using code very similar to this in the past only using a JSON array as a part of the entity rather than adding all of them individually. I think it's got something to do with the way the image is set into its ContentBody maybe? I'm really not sure.
