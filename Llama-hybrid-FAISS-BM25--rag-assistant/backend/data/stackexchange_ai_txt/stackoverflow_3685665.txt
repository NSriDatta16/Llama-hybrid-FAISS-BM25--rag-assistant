Handling sessions without ACID database?

I am thinking about using a noSQL (mongoDB) paired with memcached to store sessions with in my webapp. The idea is that upon each page load, the user data is compared to the data in the memcache and if something has changed, the data would be written to both memcached and mySQL. This way the reads would be greatly reduced and memcached utilized to do what it does best. However I am a bit concerned about using a non-ACID database for session storage especially with the memcached layer. Let's say something goes wrong while updating the session to the DB and our users got instant headache wondering why their product that they put in the cart doesn't show up... What's an appropriate approach to this? Should we go for a mySQL session storage or is it fine to keep a non-acid supportive database for sessions? Thanks!
