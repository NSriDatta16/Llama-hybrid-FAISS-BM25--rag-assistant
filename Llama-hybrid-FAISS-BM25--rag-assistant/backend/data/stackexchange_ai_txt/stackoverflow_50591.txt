I would just use a list, then convert that list into an array. You will notice here that I used a jagged array (float[][]) instead of a square array (float [,]). Besides being the "standard" way of doing things, it should be much faster. When converting the data from a list to an array you only have to copy [calibrationRow] pointers. Using a square array, you would have to copy [calibrationRow] x [SensorCount] floats. var tempCalibrationSet = new List (); const int SensorCount = 22; int calibrationRow = 0; while (recordsToRead()) { tempCalibrationSet[calibrationRow] = new float[SensorCount]; for (int i = 0; i
