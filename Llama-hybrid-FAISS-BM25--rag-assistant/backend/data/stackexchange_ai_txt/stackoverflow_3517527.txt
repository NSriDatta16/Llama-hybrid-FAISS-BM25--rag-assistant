adding a magento page to the catalog

I want to add another page in the magento module like the following... so when customer types in the url, they can do it like so domain.com/catalog/wizard. I have no idea how to do this. I tried adding another action in the catalog controller like the following public function wizardAction(){ $this->renderLayout(); } But this doesnt seem to work.
