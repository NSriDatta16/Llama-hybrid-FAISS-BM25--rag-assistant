transform.matrix on textfields?

Changing the scale to (2, .5) on a textfield's transform.matrix just makes the font uniformly larger. Frustrating. Many other transforms just make the text disappear. I am embedding fonts, which is supposed to allow for rotating text . Well, that is one kind of transform... I would like the freedom to transform every which way. Is there somehow to skew/transform textfields in as3 as shapes other than rendering to a bitmap first ? This solution is not optimal since it (1) results in pixelated text for many transforms; (2) makes very, very large fonts unweildy because of the bitmapdata size constraints. This fellow has dropped the flash text framework altogether to get fonts as shapes . This is kind of cool, and kind of extreme.
