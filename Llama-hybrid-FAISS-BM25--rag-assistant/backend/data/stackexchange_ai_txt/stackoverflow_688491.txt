Database efficiency

I am about to write a program to keep track of my school assignments and I was wondering what database language would be the most efficient and simple to implement to track the meta-data of the assignments? I am thinking about XML, but it would require several documents. I (currently) have at least ten assignments per week for 45 weeks. The data that has to be stored includes name, issue date, due date, path, and various states of completion. What ever language it's in would have to be able to take a large increase in both the number of assignments and the amount of meta-data without having to make large changes in either the format or the retrieval system.
