Is there any model between weights of different layers in deep neural network?

As I understand there are ways to look at reducing redundancies in the weights of a layer with the aid of measuring rank of a matrix. For example in the paper: "On the Redundancy in the Rank of Neural Network Parameters and Its Controllability" By: Chanhee Lee, Young-Bum Kim, Hyesung Ji, Yeonsoo Lee, Yuna Hur and Heuiseok Lim. In the above paper the method attempts to reduce the size of the weight matrix for each layer. This question is related to finding the appropriate number of layers. It would nice to work on this question if we have a model to represent the connection between the weights of different layers. Any comments would be appreciated. EDIT: It appears question is not clear. I am asking how to model relationship between the layers of a neural network? What a model mean here: Weights_layer_1=f(weights_layer_2). Where f is known or unknown but exist or known to be does not exit etc etc. There may not be one. In that case the answer is there is no such model. I hope the question is clear now.
