How to adjust confounders in Logistic regression?

I have a binary classification problem where I apply logistic regression. I have a set of features that are found significant. But I understand that Logistic regression doesn't consider feature interactions While I read online that, it can be accounted by adjusting logistic regression for con-founders Currently I did this and got the significant features model = sm.Logit(y_train, X_train) result=model.fit() result.summary() But how do I adjust for confounders? any pointers to tutorial for non-stat person like me would really be helpful Is there any python package that can help us do this? Can someone let me know on how can I do this?
