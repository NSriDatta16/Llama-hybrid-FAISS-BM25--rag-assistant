Django: setting a max number of unique fields in a Model

I'm using Django 1.2. I would like to make a model with 3 fields, as shown below: class Also_Viewed(models.Model): page = models.ForeignKey(Page) also_page = models.ForeignKey(Page) rank = models.IntegerField() class Meta: unique_together = ('page', 'also_page') However for each unique page field, I want to limit the number of rows in the table to a maximum amount (to say 24). So for example the following types of rows would be okay... (Page_A, Page_x, 3) (Page_A, Page_y, 21) ... (Page_A, Page_z, 45) ...for up to 24 occurances in the table. How would you recommend setting this constraint in the Django models.py file? The only way I can think of is adding another field, and setting the choices option to an iterable of only 24 tuples. This feels like a hack but is it actually a valid solution? Or can you think of more elegant and efficient solutions? I would also like to ensure that page and also_page are different objects. However I don't know how to approach this one. Thank you very much for your help, it is really appreciated!
