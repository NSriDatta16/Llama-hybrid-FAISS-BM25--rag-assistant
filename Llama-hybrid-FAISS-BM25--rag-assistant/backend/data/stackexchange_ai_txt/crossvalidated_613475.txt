Bootstrap validation for panel data machine learning

A traditional machine learning validation strategy is to train on some data and check performance on some holdout data. When data are time-dependent, an obvious way to proceed is to train on early periods and test on later periods, say train on data from $2000$ to $2011$ and then check performance in $2012$ , $2013$ and $2014$ (those are the real years for which I am likely to have data). A technique from biostatistics is to train on a bootstrap sample of the data and then test on the original data. An advantage of this is that valuable training data are not allocated to a holdout set. However, when it comes time to bootstrap this, the way to proceed is not clear. Do we bootstrap everything and use the future to predict the past? That seems problematic. What would be the way to do this for the panel-data I seem to have? This seems related but not a duplicate.
