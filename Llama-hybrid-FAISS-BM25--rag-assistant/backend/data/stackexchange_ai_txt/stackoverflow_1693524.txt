What OR-mappers allow one-to-many AND One-to-one relationship between the same tables?

I'm currently looking for an OR-mapper to use for a side project I'm about to start. Since we're using an inhouse developed OR-mapper at work I don't really know much about how other mappers work (and have a pretty incomplete picture of which exist). After some research it seems that NHibernate, Linq-to-SQL and Entity Framework are the most commonly used ones. So here's my question: is it possible in [insert your favorite ORM here] to map a one-to-many AND a one-to-one relation between the same tables and how is it done (elegantly)? A simple example for this is to store a list of items (one-to-many) and the selected item (one-to-one). The reason I chose this particular question is that it's a painpoint with our inhouse OR-mapper: it just doesn't allow more than one relation between two tables. What I want to gain from asking this is some insight from people who are working with those mappers to aid me in deciding which (existing!) OR-mapper to use for my side project. Thanks for your help!
