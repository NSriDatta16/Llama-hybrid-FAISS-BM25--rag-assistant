What I would do in such cases is, have another table where I would have the aggregation summaries. That is When row[m] is inserted into table 1 in table 2 against (column 1) (which is the row key of table 2) I would save its summation or other aggregational results, be it average, standard deviation, max, min etc. Another approach would be to index them into a search tool such as Lucene, Solr, Elastic Search etc. and run aggregational searches there. Here are some examples in Solr . Finally, Scan spanning across multiple region or M/R jobs is not designed for real time queries (unless the clusters designed in such way, i.e. oversized to data requirements). Hope it helps.
