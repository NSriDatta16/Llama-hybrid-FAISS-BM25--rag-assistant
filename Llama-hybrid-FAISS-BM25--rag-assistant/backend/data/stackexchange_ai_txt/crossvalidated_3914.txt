An alternative approach relevant to your 2nd Q, "Are there ways of looking at confidence intervals, at least in some circumstances, which would be meaningful to users of statistics?": You should take a look at Bayesian inference and the resulting credible intervals . A 95% credible interval can be interpreted as an interval which you believe has 95% probability of including the true parameter value. The price you pay is that you need to put a prior probability distribution on the values you believe the true parameter is likely to take before collecting the data. And your prior may differ from someone else's prior, so your resulting credible intervals may also differ even when you use the same data. This is only my quick and crude attempt to summarise! A good recent textbook with a practical focus is: Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern and Donald B. Rubin. "Bayesian Data Analysis" (2nd edition). Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2003.
