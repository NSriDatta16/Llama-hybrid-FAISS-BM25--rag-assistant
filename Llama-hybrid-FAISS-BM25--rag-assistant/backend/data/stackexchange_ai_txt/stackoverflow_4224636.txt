can it result in say example.com/index.php getting cached in some situations? It shouldn't, however there's a lot of implementations out there (particularly on mobile devices / mobile proxies) which don't behave correctly in this regard. There's also also a lot of bad information about caching - the 'Pragma: no-cache' is meaningless when sent from a server. To prevent caching: header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); When all else fails - check the manual
