Using a linear regression (and each equation of a VAR model is a linear regression) is not a crime when the dependent variable is binary, especially if this variable is not of direct interest but rather just is a feature that happens to be useful for forecasting another variable. Yes, the domain of the fitted values is not the same as the domain of the dependent variable (real-valued vs. binary), but this does not mean a linear regression cannot be useful here. Perhaps this is also the case in your application. But a neater approach could be to substitute the VAR equation for the binary variable by a corresponding logit equation that would give you fitted values between $0$ and $1$ that could be rounded to binary. However, such a model (a number of regular VAR equations and one logit equation) would require a more complicated estimation method (equation-by-equation OLS would no longer be an option). If you are comfortable with that, you could give it a try. Regarding the IRFs, what is unclear to you? Have you tried following the presentation of IRFs in a lecture note or a textbook (e.g. LÃ¼tkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" , 2005, Section 2.3.2 "Impulse Response Analysis")? Where did you get stuck?
