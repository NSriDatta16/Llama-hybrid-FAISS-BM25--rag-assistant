sharing objects between module in GAE

To share a state(e.g. user) between a module in django people sometime use thread local storage, but as google app engine follows CGI standard and keeps state of a request in os.environ , can I share objects between two modules just by setting it e.g. mod1.my_data = {} and now any other module can get handle to my_data? without worrying about other threads/requests sharing/overwriting it?
