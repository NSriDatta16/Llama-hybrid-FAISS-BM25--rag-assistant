You can set stuff up in your ~/.ssh/config For example: Host somehost User test See ssh_config(5) for more info. Next, you can generate a SSH key using ssh-keygen(1), run ssh-agent(1), and use that for authentication. If you want to run a command on a remote machine, you can just use something like: $ ssh somehost "sh myscript.sh ${myparameter}" . I hope this at least points you in the right direction :) If you need sudo access, then there are obvious potential security issues though ... You can use ChrootDirectory on a per user basis inside a Match block though. See sshd_config(5) for info.
