Does MSIL have ROL and ROR instructions?

I wrote an Int128 type and it works great. I thought I could improve on its performance with a simple idea: Improve the shift operations which are a bit clumsy. Because they are heavily used in multiplication and division, an improvement would have a ripple effect. So I began creating a dynamic method (to shift low and rotate high), only to discover that there are no OpCodes.Rol or OpCodes.Ror instructions. Is this possible in IL?
