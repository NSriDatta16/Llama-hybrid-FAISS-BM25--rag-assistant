How to retrieve H263/H264 data from a pcap file.

I have tried tools like videosnarf that takes a pcap file as input and creates a raw .h264 file , which could be later encoded with ffmpeg , and finally can be played with vlc player. But videosnarf can only handle h264 data. I'm not able to find a similar tool that can dump h263 data from a pcap file. I tried to decode h263 stream from wireshark but I have had no luck so far. I can program in perl/python but I don't know what exact steps to follow to retrieve h263 raw data from a pcap file as I haven't played with pcap capture files before.
