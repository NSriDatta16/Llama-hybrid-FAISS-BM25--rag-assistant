I'm not saying this is going to be easy, or that this solution will necessarily be perfect for you, but look at the documentation here: http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm and especially pay attention to the Image, ImageDraw, and ImageFont modules. Here's an example to help you out: import Image im = Image.new("RGB", (100, 100)) import ImageDraw draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im) draw.text((50, 50), "hey") im.rotate(45).show() To do what you really want you may need to make a bunch of separate correctly rotated text images and then compose them all together with some more fancy manipulation. And after all that it still may not look great. I'm not sure how antialiasing and such is handled for instance, but it might not be good. Good luck, and if anyone has an easier way, I'd be interested to know as well.
