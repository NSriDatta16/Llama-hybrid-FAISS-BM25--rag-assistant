By saying the response is measured on an interval scale you're stipulating that the zero-point is arbitrary, so you don't then go on to model it with distributions like the gamma that have a support of $(0,\infty)$. You need to use a distribution with a location parameter to absorb additive re-scaling (as well as a scale parameter to absorb multiplicative re-scaling). Shunning non-linear transformations of the response implies you must also shun non-linear transformations of its conditional means. So non-linear link functions are ruled out (except, trivially, for saturated models) because a unit change in the linear predictor doesn't have an effect on the original response scale invariant to location shifts. These two requirements leave you looking for a distribution in the exponential family with a location & scale parameter, & for a linear link function: a Gaussian GLM with identity link is the only option. But you needn't restrict yourself to GLMs when there's a clear reason not to: for the example you give a shifted gamma would be a suitable distribution to model the conditional response, even though it's not in the exponential family. There are other approaches to regression that don't involve worrying too much about the response distribution, not least using ordinary least squares when there's no evidence of heteroskedasticity, & relying on the central limit theorem to produce reasonably good confidence intervals for parameter estimates (even if the associated prediction intervals are unreliable). Note that as an interval scale is also ordinal, the ordinal logistic regression mentioned by @Glen_b can be used for an interval-scale response, as a kind of semi-parametric model.
