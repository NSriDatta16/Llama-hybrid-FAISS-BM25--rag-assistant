.NET Component for Floor Plan Designer application

My next project is a kitchen designer application (CAD). Something like MS Visio or Home Suite app. I am looking for a component that I can use as a design editor. Front view is a must, view from the top and 3D are desired. I want to be able to: Drag'n'drop components on the floor plan. Select and change size and color of the components. Move components when dimensions of inner components change. For now it is a desktop application (Windows Forms or WPF). But would be nice to have an option for silverlight open. Question: any .NET components out there that do what I need (free or commercial)?
