Comparing averages of two groups

Say I want to check if the averages of 2 groups (A and B) are the same. For each member in group A, there are some observations; same applies for group B. If I want to take the average of A and B, I have 2 options: take the individual average of each member in A, and then B, and compute the averages of A and B that way take the average of the observations in A and B. However, these 2 methods can produce very different SD's, and that means a very different test statistic. Say I want to take the SD of group B, I then have 2 choices: I look at all the observations of all the members pooled together I take the average of every member's observations and then do the SD on those averages of members Which one makes more sense, if one wants to check if there is a statistically significant difference (assuming a simple z-test is used) between the two averages?
