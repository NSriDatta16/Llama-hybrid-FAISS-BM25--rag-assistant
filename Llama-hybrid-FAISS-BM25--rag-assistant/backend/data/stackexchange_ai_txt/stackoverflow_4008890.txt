Scala map example not working as expected

Am doing all the examples from the "Pragmatic Bookshelf Programming Scala" book. It is simple singleton example but am not getting it right i.e. values from map are not fetched. Can you point out the error. class Marker(val color: String) { println("Creating " + this) override def toString(): String = "marker color is " + color } And singleton MarkerFactory is as below object MarkerFactory { private val markers = new HashMap[String, Marker]; markers += "red" -> new Marker("red") markers += "blue" -> new Marker("blue") markers += "green" -> new Marker("green") def getMarker(color: String) { if (markers.contains(color)) markers(color) else null } def main(args: Array[String]) { println(markers) println((MarkerFactory getMarker "red").toString) println(MarkerFactory getMarker "blue") println(MarkerFactory getMarker "red") println(MarkerFactory getMarker "yellow") } } Am getting output like this. Creating marker color is red Creating marker color is blue Creating marker color is green Map(green -> marker color is green, red -> marker color is red, blue -> marker color is blue) () () () ()
