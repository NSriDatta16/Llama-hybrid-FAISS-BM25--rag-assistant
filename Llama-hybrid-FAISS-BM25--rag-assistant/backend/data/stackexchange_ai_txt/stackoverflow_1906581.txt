Can Anyone help with Scripting for Autohotkey to work with Handbrake?

I'm trying to make an autohotkey script so I can drag and drop movie files into autohotkey for it to put it into handbrake's queue to be converted into iphone format. I just started with autohotkey and have no idea on how to record a macro like that. Can anyone point me the right way or maybe does anyone have a script like that to share?
