I have an hulking old refurbished T520 with the CD drive ripped out and the plastic busted out of the corner from when I dropped it. 8 GB of RAM. You know what? I've done quite a lot with keras, tensorflow and theano on that machine. Things start to go south with CNNs on bigger images, but the point is: no excuses! Install that stuff and start learning!! @JanKukacka's right about other cloud options. I have used Amazon's GPU instance on EC2. It can get expensive - you'll want to spin up a spot instance if you can. People have complained that the EC2 GPU instances are not as fast as they should be, saying that a $100 GPU card on a dedicated machine can perform better. I don't know about that, but I can say it is way faster than my laptop. Believe it or not I actually considered trying to add a GPU to the T520 (it's that special to me). But from my research, I took away the line, "laptops don't have GPUs!" from some message board and stopped looking. I'm expecting to see a comment below explaining why that's wrong. Another complaint about using a cloud GPU is that there's a time-tax for everything you do, especially if you're cheap like me and want to terminate the instance when you're done using it. Spinning up the machine, moving data, etc. all take time and drain a non-trivial amount of energy. I have to admit, it would be nice to have a powerful GPU machine that's all mine all the time. But one thing that doesn't sound nice is configuring the GPU. At least with EC2 you can find community instances that are already configured to use the GPU with tensorflow or theano.
