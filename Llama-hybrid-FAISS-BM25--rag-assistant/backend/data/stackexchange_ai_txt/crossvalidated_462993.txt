Multi Output Regressor Random Forest - Every output looks at different features

I am supposed to predict a hourly timeseries T 48 hours ahead in the feature. For technical reasons, I can only use a Random Forest Regressor, with 48 output representing each T value n hours ahead. There is a big correlation between weather and target output, and therefore as features I include 48 hours ahead weather forecast. My question is how do I prevent target T5HoursAhead from looking at feature TemperatureAhead25 as doing so is irrelevant, slows down training and probably worsen the results.
