Assuming you have controller like this: public class YourController : Controller { public ActionResult ShowOrHide(RecordInfo[] info) { RecordInfo[] existing = GetExisting(); if (IsPost()) { for (int i = 0; i And view like this: "> Everything should work. Just pay attention to the possible NULLs. This will work with no AJAX at all or you can easily wrap it with AjaxForm the usual way. So graceful degradation will work too.
