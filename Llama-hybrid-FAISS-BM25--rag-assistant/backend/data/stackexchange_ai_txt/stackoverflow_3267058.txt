How do i transform a HQL result to List where T is a mapped class

I have this nhibernate query: var q = NHibernateSession.Current.CreateSQLQuery ( @"SELECT LastestEvents.* FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT SbQcontainer.Container FROM HistoricEvents SbQcontainer WHERE SbQcontainer.LineCompany_Id = :lineCompany) as Sbq JOIN HistoricEvents as LastestEvents ON LastestEvents.id = ( SELECT TOP(1) id FROM HistoricEvents mi WHERE mi.Container = Sbq.Container and mi.LineCompany_Id = :lineCompany ORDER BY mi.Date DESC )" ).SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(HistoricEvent))); q.SetParameter("lineCompany",lineCompany.Id); q.SetCacheable(false); var results = q.List ().ToList(); It looks for the lastest events on each container for the given lineCompany, it works, but i dont know how to set this resultset to a list of T HistoricEvent, i try this line: .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(HistoricEvent))); But throws NHibernate.PropertyNotFoundException:Could not find a setter for property 'Event_Id' in class 'HistoricEvent'. Is there any way to do this?, or maybe doing this same query using the ICriteria API? Thx in advance.
