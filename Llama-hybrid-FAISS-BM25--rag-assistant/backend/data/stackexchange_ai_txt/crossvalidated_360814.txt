MLE for a homogeneous Poisson process?

If we have a data set consisting of event times $\{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_N\}$ and would like to model this as a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$, how do we do it? Intuitively, I would expect that we can calculate the average waiting time $w = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=2}^N (t_i-t_{i-1})$ and then set $\hat{\lambda} = 1/w$? Is this correct? If so, how is it justified? Do we have to consider fitting a Poisson distribution to the number of events after doing some sort of binning?
