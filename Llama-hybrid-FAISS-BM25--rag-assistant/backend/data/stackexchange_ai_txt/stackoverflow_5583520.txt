Main page xaml to manage user control events

I need an elegant solution (I am working on silverlight 4.0) to solve this simple problem(?) using the MVVM pattern: My mainpage xaml has my two custom user controls like this (say): Each one has its own view model and both these user controls are independent of each other. When an asynchronous operation in MyCustomUC1 has completed, I want an ICommand in MyCustomUC2's viewmodel to be invoked thus refreshing data in MyCustomUC2. I want this done by the parent page and all in xaml. Exposing dependency properties, event handlers etc in the user controls...anything is ok since I own the user control ...whatever makes sense. Any ideas ?
