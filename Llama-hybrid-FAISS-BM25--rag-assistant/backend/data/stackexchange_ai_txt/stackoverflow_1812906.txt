Tips for designing a minimalist data store suitable for an embedded device

I am trying to design a data store implementation like SQLite, BerkeleyDB or CouchDB suitable for a small embedded computer platform. The main criteria is minimal bloat and simple API. I could not find any products that fit my needs. SQLite is a tad too large and mimics relational databases. CouchDB has a good RESTful API but is bloated. Basically my goals are: Written in C. Key-value model preferred over relational model. RESTful web server and API. I am struggling with designing the database backend. What's the best way to store the data? How do I organize it with minimal performance loss? How do other implementations tackle this (SQLite for example)? Is there any literature on this? Thanks!
