You may want to look into HashMap or HashSet , both of which give constant time retrieval, and it's as easy as going: hashSet.contains(searchString) Additionally, HashSet (and HashMap for its keys) prevents duplicate elements. If you need to keep them in order of insertion, you can look into their Linked counterparts, and if you need to keep them sorted, TreeSet and TreeMap can help (note, however, that the TreeSet and TreeMap do not provide constant time retrieval).
