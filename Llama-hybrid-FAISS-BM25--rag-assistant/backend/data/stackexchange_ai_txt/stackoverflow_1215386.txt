The most accurate information you can get is their IP address. DOn't use session cookies if you want it to be accurate, since the user may simply ignore your session cookie (ie. using curl). But if you are concerned about shared ips, you could try to include additional information, such as the browser agent or use ajax to pass back other information which you are unable to get otherwise. But, everything else other than the IP address can be faked (even then, you can use proxies).
