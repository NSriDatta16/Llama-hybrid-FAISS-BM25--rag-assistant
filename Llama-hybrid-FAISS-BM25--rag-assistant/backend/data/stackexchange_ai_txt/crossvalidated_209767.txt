It is not required to normalize data for neural network models, but it is advised , as training will take longer (weights have to compensate for differences across features) or might also give you different/worse results without normalization (see e.g. this question for some more details). Obtaining the same efficiency with and without normalization is possible, but the underlying model can still be different. For example, here's a simple example using nnet in caret::train with and without data normalization that will give you different nets and performance over parameter sets - while still having similar optimal performance on CV partitions then: library(caret) m
