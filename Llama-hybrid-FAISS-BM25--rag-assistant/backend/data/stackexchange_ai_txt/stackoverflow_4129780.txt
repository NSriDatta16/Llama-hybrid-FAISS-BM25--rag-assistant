hudson cli to wait for unfinished builds

Part of our CI/continuous-test system needs to re-deploy build/test nodes. so far I'm marking them offline and then waiting for twice as long as a build usually takes... which is not very elegant. How can I (after marking it offline) wait for a node to finish its current job(s)?
