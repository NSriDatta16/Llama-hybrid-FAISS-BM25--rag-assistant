PCA probably isn't what you're after here. You probably want Factor Analysis, which is typically used to investigate the latent factors supposedly underlying a measure. However, it seems from your question that you want to reduce the number of items on your scale (which is a laudable goal too often forgotten in social science), so I would suggest that you investigate item response theory . Item response theory is a method which allows you to decompose the scores on your measure into two parts; person abilities and item difficulties. It was originally developed for answers with a true/false answer, but has been generalised to personality/achievement tests since then. I personally use R for my statistical analyses, and there are three packages that would probably help with this kind of modelling; namely mokken , eRm and ltm . A suggested workflow might be the following: use the mokken package to test the assumptions required for IRT. Following this, attempt to fit a rasch model (the simplest form of IRT) using eRm . eRm has an extremely good vingette which you can get access to by calling vignette(eRm) . If these models do not fit, then you can use the ltm package, which can fit two and three parameter models. Your problem is actually quite interesting, in that you are aiming to discern which items people find most important. This can be done using an IRT approach by looking at which items are perceived as the least difficult, these will be the items that most people consider important. One major advantage of IRT is that you can use it to select questions which will assess importance more quickly, by only keeping those which are most informative. HTH.
