The 8-bit integer could be enough to train the neural network. This link says that Intel successfully trained ResNet-50 with 8-bit integer only, using some techniques. While this link is about post-training quantization. It aims to train in fp32 (or fp16), and make inference on uint8. It is already being used in Tensorflow Lite, and does not need any specific techniques.
