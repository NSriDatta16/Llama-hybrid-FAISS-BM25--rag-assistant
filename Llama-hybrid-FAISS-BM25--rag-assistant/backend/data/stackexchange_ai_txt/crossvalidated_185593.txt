Your question is slightly unclear to me. I understand you have 100 individuals, measured across 7 variables, and clustered into 6 clusters(?) Now you want to see how these clusters compare by each variable. Basic method to compare clusters using boxplots: You can compare clusters by variables with boxplots. They should be organised like this: Each boxplot represents a variable, so there will be 7 boxplots. They have the 6 clusters along the X axis, and the quantity of that variable along the y axis. To demonstrate, I'll generate some data to be clustered into 6 clusters (only 2 dimensions rather than your 7 for simplicity) n = 1000 g = 8 set.seed(g) d Now we'll cluster it in R using the default kmeans function. k So now we want to compare the clusters across each variable (only 2 in this case). The first boxplot would be comparing the clusters by their x-values. boxplot(d$x ~ k$cluster, xlab='Cluster', ylab='x-value') And then you do it for the next variable, the y-values. boxplot(d$y ~ k$cluster, xlab='Cluster', ylab='y-value') And yeah, you can compare the clusters visually. These boxplots in the pictures are meaningless but maybe you'll see that for 5 of your variables, the boxplots mostly overlap (so those variables hardly matter to the clustering), while there are 2 variables where the boxplots show little overlap (so those are the 2 variables that distinguish the households from each other). There are more objective statistical methods for comparing the boxplots than just by looking too, you can find those by a quick search. (Note, I gave the default R functions above to plot these, but I actually used ggplot for nicer looking plots) n = 1000 g = 8 set.seed(g) d
