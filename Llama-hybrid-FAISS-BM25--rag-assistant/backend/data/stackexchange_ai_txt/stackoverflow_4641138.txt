Well, when you compile or invoke your program you need to add Stanford's JAR file to your classpath, e.g.: java -classpath stanford-postagger.jar [MyProgram] Then in your code you'll need to import the relevant packages, most things you need seem to be in edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent . Instantiating a new MaxentTagger is well described in the JavaDoc , but I'll repeat some of it here: To create a new tagger: MaxentTagger tagger = new MaxentTagger("models/left3words-wsj-0-18.tagger"); To tag a String with this tagger : String taggedString = tagger.tagString("Here's a tagged string.") Additionally you can create and tag sentences using Stanford's NLP tools. Create a sentence by reading a file using a BufferedReader : Sentence sentence = Sentence.readOneSentence(in); // in is a BufferedReader Then tag the sentence as with your tagger : Sentence taggedSentence = tagger.tagSentence(sentence);
