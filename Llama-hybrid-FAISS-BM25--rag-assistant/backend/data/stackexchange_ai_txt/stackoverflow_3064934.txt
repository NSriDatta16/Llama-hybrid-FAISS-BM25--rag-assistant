Wow, ok scary stuff. I had to hand edit the xamlx file earlier and the references I edited for the SendReplyToReceive saved funny when I switched back to the activity designer. It made it look like I had two Unsubscribe() 's and not only that but the correlation handles for each branch were crossing between branches. I'm all set now. To fix the issue I removed all the messaging activities, dropped in a new ReceiveAndSendReply activity into branch 1's action block. Then I dragged the Receive activity to the Trigger for branch 1 and configured it as I had before. I did the same for branch 2, except I placed the SendReplyToReceive activity below my If activity that validates matching addresses.
