PHP class code organization with relations to a database

I've made several classes to organize the data taken from a database. They are as such: class.Product.php class.WineProduct.php (extends Product) class.ProductAward.php (included in Product, used as array item in Product->awards) class.ProductReview.php (included in Product, used as array item in Product->reviews) class.WineList.php (includes WineProduct, uses WineProduct as array item in WineList->items) The database has a wines table which holds all the relevant data; the trouble I'm having is how to represent the wine category type in the class. In the database it's stored as a numerical value which is tied to a secondary table called _product_types (i.e., 1 corresponds to Red Wine on _product_types) . Is it best to store the numerical representation of the category or the textual representation? (1 vs "Red Wine"). On another note, is it better practice to use SQL queries outside of classes?
