A C daemon that does traffic shaping

I'm working on a C daemon that monitors a configuration file (updated using a web interface) and then uses the Linux "tc" (traffic control) command to update the systems traffic shaping configuration. What's a good way to actually invoke the tc program? Should I use the exec family? Is there a library I can use that would be a bit more elegant? Using exec or system just seems a bit hacky to me. Any ideas?
