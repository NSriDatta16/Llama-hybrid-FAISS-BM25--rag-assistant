The imports that you have provided all look correct. Do double check any other classes to make sure Eclipse didn't auto import the wrong Fragment some where. The other thing that is key is you need to add the compatibility library to a lib\ that you must create at your project's root to make sure it gets bundled with your app. I don't know if it is required, but I always have my project build path refer to it's copy. Your layout seems to be missing the class parameter. I think you meant to use class where you have used name in your layout. " android:id="@+id/items" android:layout_weight="1" android:layout_width="0px" android:layout_height="fill_parent" /> In Eclipse you should see android-support-v4.jar under both Referenced Libraries and libs.
