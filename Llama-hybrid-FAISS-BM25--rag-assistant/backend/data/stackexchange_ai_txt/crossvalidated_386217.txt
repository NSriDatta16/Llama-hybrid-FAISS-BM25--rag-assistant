I recommend you consider using multivariate analysis to compare the two groups. You could compare the responses of the participants within the groups using PERMANOVA and then visually interpret whether the groups (control vs experimental) are meaningful using ordination. Both of these steps can be completed in the R-package vegan. You would need to set up your data so that each participant is represented by a row. The columns would indicate the participate information (their ID, experimental or control, and the configuration they selected). You would have a column for each configuration and could represent the participant's selection with a 1 or a 0. Hope that helps.
