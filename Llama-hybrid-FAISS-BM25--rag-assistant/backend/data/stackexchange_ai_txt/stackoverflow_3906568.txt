pcap datalink LINUX_SLL

I'm trying to write a simple packet sniffer using libpcap. The first thing I'm trying to do when I capture a packet is to recognize the datalink protocol used and find the size of the header for that protocol in order to find the IP packet. The problem is that sometimes libpcap returns as datalink layer protocol the LINUX_SLL which is described as "Linux cooked" does anyone know the format of the headers for that protocol? Or at least the size of the header?
