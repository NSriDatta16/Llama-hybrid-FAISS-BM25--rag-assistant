These lines of code alone should work fine. What's likely happening is that you have some code elsewhere, running before the query, that relies on a browser feature (inspecting the user-agent string, cookie handling, query string, headers, etc.) which is causing this code to misbehave. If you post more code, like the whole source for the file you're working on, the problem can be more easily revealed.
