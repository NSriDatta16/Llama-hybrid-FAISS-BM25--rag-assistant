What are the best strategies to debugging SSRS?

I am looking for ways to track down where an SSRS error is occuring. I have a report that is about 90 columns wide with multiple formulas. The problem that I am having is that on one of the formulas there is a divide by Zero error. I have implemented the answer from Robert Harvey in this question but I still get the error. I know that the answer works as I have tested it on a small report. So the question is: How on earth do you identify where an error is occuring in SSRS when SSRS only reports that an error occured? EDIT The error as displayed is An error occured during local report processing An error has occoured during report processing Cannot read next data row for the dataset MainReport Divide By Zero error encounted
