Vocabulary Question: Indexing in Time Series

I'm reading the paper A review on time series data mining written by Tak-chung Fu, available here: https://zero.sci-hub.se/6989/6ea2f1e72559e22ed0a799f59f38fbb2/fu2011.pdf One term that gets used without a definition is "indexing", For instance in section 2 (Time series representation and indexing), the author writes: In the context of time series data mining, the fundamental problem is how to represent the time series data. One of the common approaches is transforming the time series to another domain for dimensionality reduction followed by an indexing mechanism. I understand the idea of dimensionality reduction. Supposing you have a list of real-valued points ordered in time as in $(t_1, v_1) \ldots (t_n, v_n)$ , and you wish to reduce it to an ordered representation $(t_{i_{1}}, v_{i_{1}}) \ldots ((t_{i_{k}}, v_{i_{k}}))$ where $k . But what does the term indexing mean in this context? Any insights appreciated.
