Hmm. That Keogh guy is smart and handsome, but I am not sure SAX bitmaps are right for this. Time series discords are empirically the best (in independent cook offs). Chandola et al. (2009) found that with 19 different publicly available data sets, comparing 9 different techniques, time series discords is the best overall technique. They are simple, fast to compute and general. I suggest you glance at this tutorial , esp slides 25 to 30. Chandola, Varun, Deepthi Cheboli, and Vipin Kumar. "Detecting anomalies in a time series database." Computer Science Department, University of Minnesota, Tech. Rep (2009).
