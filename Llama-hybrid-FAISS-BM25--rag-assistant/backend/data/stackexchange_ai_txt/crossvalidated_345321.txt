Note that, you have a perfect separation problems on logistic regression. This topic is well discussed in CV. Here is one: Is there any intuitive explanation of why logistic regression will not work for perfect separation case? And why adding regularization will fix it? In the link I provided, I also plotted the cost function contour (instead of the surface) for perfect separation case. I am not checking if your plot is correct or not. Also the shape of the cost function is also heavily depending on data. However, your data is linear separable, logistic regression will not converge. Details can be found in Regularization methods for logistic regression For sum of squares loss, even for a data set without perfect seperation, the objective is not convex! Details can be found in this post. What is happening here, when I use squared loss in logistic regression setting?
