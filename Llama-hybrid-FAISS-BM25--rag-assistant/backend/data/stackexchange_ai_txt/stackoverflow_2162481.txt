Usually the documentation for the individual tags has a description for their facets. For example, http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/tlddocs/h/dataTable.html describes some of the facts it accepts, like header and footer. If you do find a comprehensive list of all facets for every tag though, let me know. :)
