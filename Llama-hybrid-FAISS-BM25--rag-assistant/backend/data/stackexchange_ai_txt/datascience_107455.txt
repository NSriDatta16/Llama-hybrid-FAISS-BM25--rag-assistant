One way to frame your problem is with reinforcement learning (RL). Reinforcement learning (RL) train an agent to accomplish a goal in environment. In your case, the environment is 2048, the goal is to solve the game, and the agent is the model you are training. If the chosen move is bad, I don't know which of the other ones was better. That trade-off is frequently called explore-exploit. Does an agent do the move it predicts is the best possible (exploit)? Or does the agent look for better possible moves (explore)?
