What database should I use?

I am a high-school students who is learning about data science in his free time. I have gotten a neural network to work which is able to solve xor problems. My neural network uses sigmoid as the activation function for both the hidden and output layers. It also has only one hidden layer. I am wondering about what would be the best simple problem which I could solve with my neural net. I would like a database in which there is a probability output or something similar since I've had problems converting sigmoided output to normal values. I have looked on the UCI machine learning repository but have found nothing witch has caught my eye. I would appreciate any help! :)
