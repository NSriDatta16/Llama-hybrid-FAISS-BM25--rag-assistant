Tools/Resources to Convert DirectX Code to OpenGL

Are there any tools and/or documentation providing a mapping from DirectX to OpenGL? If you had to do a conversion, how would you approach it and what would you use? I know that ATI Technologies provides HLSL2GLSL, but my understanding is that this is just for shader languages and not a full coverage of the APIs.
