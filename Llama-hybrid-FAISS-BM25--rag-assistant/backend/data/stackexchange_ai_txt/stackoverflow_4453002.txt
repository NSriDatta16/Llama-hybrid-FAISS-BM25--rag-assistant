Identify webmail clients

I am developing a report for our emailing app and I need to identify which client email opened emails sent. I searched and worked with user-agent and I find out if it is Firefox, Chrome or IE, but I can not identify when it is Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo .... Please, I need your help. Thank you very much in advance.
