CausalImpact estimates a statistically significant impact for multiple intervention-free validation periods

While trying to validate the estimated impact by CausalImpact package I ran backtests on several dummy pre and post time-periods prior to the actual intervention but ended up with statistically significant impact results for several of the validation periods. Actual test: Number of Predictor variables: 12 Pre-period time series length: 190 Post-period time series length: 50 I am certain that there were no interventions before the highlighted intervention. What could be causing the model to give statistically significant results in pre-intervention periods?
