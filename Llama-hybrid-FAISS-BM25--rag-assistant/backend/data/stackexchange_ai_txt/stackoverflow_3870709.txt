#include statement consuming lot of time for building my project using VS 2008

One of my project is not building (after so many hours also) ... Its not proceeding further ... The psuedocode is like this: While building my project with Visual Studio 2008: #pragma message("This is going to Include map.h") #include #pragma message("The Included operation of map.h over") For the above code snippet, the build output is showing the first message and the second message is not at all displaying (even after several hours). What might be caused this problem?. What could be wrong with the include statement?
