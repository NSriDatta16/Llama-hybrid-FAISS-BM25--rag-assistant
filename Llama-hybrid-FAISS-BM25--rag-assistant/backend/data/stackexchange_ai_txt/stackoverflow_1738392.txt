Python: how to make two lists from a dictionary

I have a dictionary. {1 : [1.2, 2.3, 4.9, 2.0], 2 : [4.1, 5.1, 6.3], 3 : [4.9, 6.8, 9.5, 1.1, 7.1]} I want to pass each key:value pair to an instance of matplotlib.pyplot as two lists: x values and y values. Each key is an x value associated with each item in its value. So I want two lists for each key: [1,1,1,1] [1.2,2.3,4.9,2.0] [2,2,2] [4.1,5.1,6.3] [3,3,3,3,3] [4.9,6.8,9.5,1.1,7.1] Is there an elegant way to do this? Or perhaps there is a way to pass a dict to matplotlib.pyplot ?
