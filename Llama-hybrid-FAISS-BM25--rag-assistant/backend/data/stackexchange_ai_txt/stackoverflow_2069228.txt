is it worth the time to learn for a .NET desktop application developer? Absolutely! If that is your specific job there is no better technology to learn (as opposed to RIA developer, web developer, java developer etc). so if it's just "fun" and to no practical use I'd rather put my attention elsewhere. It is of major practical use if you ever want to write applications for Windows. Any applications... but in particular ones that have a non-standard, skinned or complex UI. So no, it's not just fun... but it is fun! Think about it... its Microsofts first ever major graphics / application framework that has been written without any major concessions to the legacy of Win32 ... this means its a radical architectural departure from what has come before, and with that comes great benefits. My only warning is it can take a while to get your head around it
