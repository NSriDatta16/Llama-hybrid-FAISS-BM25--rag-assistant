SQL Server knows, it has the Agentid columns and can use it, however it is not what you want, don't use IN, use EXISTS it will prevent this WITH NewAccounts AS ( SELECT 3 as Newaccountid ), MovedAUM AS ( SELECT 1 AS Agentid, 2 as Col2 ) SELECT * FROM MovedAUM WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM NewAccounts where NewAccounts.Agentid = MovedAUM.agentid ) See also here: http://sqlservercode.blogspot.com/2007/04/you-should-never-use-in-in-sql-to-join.html
