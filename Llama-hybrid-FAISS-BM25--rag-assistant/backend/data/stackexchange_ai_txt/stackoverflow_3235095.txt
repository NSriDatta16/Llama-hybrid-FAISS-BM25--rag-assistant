Like Kris said. You can get the correct URL for the latest package if you go to the package view in BRMS and check the section on the bottom "Information and important URLs". If you want the agent to download snapshot go to "Package snapshots" and you can get the URL from the line that says "Deployment URL: click here to download binary (or copy URL for deployment agent)".
