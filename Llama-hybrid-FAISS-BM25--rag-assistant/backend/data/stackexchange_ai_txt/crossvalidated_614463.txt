Mathematics for Machine Learning is one of my favorite. The first part gives mathematical foundations such as linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decomposition, vector calculus, probability and statistics, continuous optimization, while the second part concerns central machine learning problems. Also, the PDF of the book is freely available.
