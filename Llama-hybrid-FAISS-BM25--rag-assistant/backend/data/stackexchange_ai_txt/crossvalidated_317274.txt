Two answers, based on whether you are analyzing the effect of the treatment, or simply predicting number of times returning. If analyzing treatment effect: You effectively have a regression $$ y = \alpha + \beta T + \epsilon $$ The coefficient $\beta$ measures the average effect of the treatment on the outcome. You could control for the enrollment length: $$ y = \alpha + \beta_1 T +\beta_2 L + \epsilon $$ However, if $L$ and $T$ are uncorrelated, then the estimate of $\beta_1$ is invariant to the inclusion of $L$. The inclusion of $L$ will however reduce the variance of $\epsilon$, and this in turn will reduce the standard errors on $\beta_1$, because the variance-covariance matrix is defined as $\sigma^2_\epsilon(X^TX)^{-1}$ (in the usual case -- variants are analogous). If that $\sigma$ gets smaller, the SE's, which are the diagonals on the resultant matrix, also get smaller. So you're more sure of your estimate $\beta_1$, even though it shouldn't affect the magnitude of $\beta_1$ directly. Alternatively, you might believe that $L$ influences the effect of $T$. In this case you want $$ y = \alpha + \beta_1 T +\beta_2 L + \beta_3 T\times L+ \epsilon $$ The treatment effect (call it $\tau(L)$) is thus a function of $L$: $$ \tau(L) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 L $$ If simply predicting: Just throw all of your variables in a random forest (after reading about how they work, if not already familiar). Generally the more information you include within them, the better.
