I don't believe that you can change this. Vim is seeing $A$ is not equal to $B$. as the sentence. If you use dis instead it will preserve the space between the sentences but I am assuming that you want it to preserve the space before the sentence. I was curious, so I looked it up in the documentation for "das" : "das" delete a sentence das A sentence is defined as: A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the end of a line, or by a space or tab. Any number of closing ')', ']', '"'' and ''' characters may appear after the '.', '!' or '?' before the spaces, tabs or end of line. A paragraph and section boundary is also a sentence boundary. If the 'J' flag is present in 'cpoptions', at least two spaces have to follow the punctuation mark; s are not recognized as white space. The definition of a sentence cannot be changed. The last line is what is important: The definition of a sentence cannot be changed. This is a bit surprising given the general flexibility of vim, but I guess that there are limits around if you look hard enough.
