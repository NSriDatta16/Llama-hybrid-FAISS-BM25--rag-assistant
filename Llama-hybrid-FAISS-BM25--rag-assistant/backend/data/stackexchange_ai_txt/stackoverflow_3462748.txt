You might try embedding Perl code in a regular expression (using the (?{...}) syntax), which is, however, rather an experimental feature and might not work or even be available in your scenario. This s/(.*?\|)(.*)(?{ $x = $2; $x =~ s:\s::g })/$1$x/ should theoretically work, but I got an "Out of memory!" failure, which can be fixed by replacing '\s' with a space: s/(.*?\|)(.*)(?{ $x = $2; $x =~ s: ::g })/$1$x/
