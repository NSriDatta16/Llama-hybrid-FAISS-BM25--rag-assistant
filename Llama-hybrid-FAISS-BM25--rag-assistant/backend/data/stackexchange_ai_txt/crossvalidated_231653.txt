Doing CCA vs. building a dependent variable with PCA and then doing regression

Given two multidimensional datasets, $X$ and $Y$, some people perform multivariable analysis by building a surrogate dependent variable using principal component analysis (PCA). That is, run PCA on $Y$ set, take scores along the first component $y'$, and run a multiple regression of those scores on $X$: $y' = \beta X+\epsilon$. (I am basing my question on this article ). It looks like some adulterated form of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the two datasets to me. But having no background in this area I can't put my finger on it. So my question is, what could be the pros/cons of the PCA+regression analysis, compared to CCA? Intuition says that CCA should be more reasonable here, as (I believe) it builds the canonical variates not to blindly maximize explained variance, but already with the final purpose of maximizing correlation with $X$ in mind. Am I right? Reference: Mei et al., 2010, Principal-component-based multivariate regression for genetic association studies of metabolic syndrome components
