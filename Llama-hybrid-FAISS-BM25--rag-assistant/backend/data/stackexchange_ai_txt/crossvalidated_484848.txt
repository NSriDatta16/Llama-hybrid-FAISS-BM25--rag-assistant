How do I put different priors on different levels of a categorical variable in brms?

This is a just a coding query from a bayesian novice. I have a model of this type: response ~ pred + (1 | participant) + (1 | item) # pred = {level1, level2, level3} [ref level = level1] I’m using brms. I’d like to put different priors on the three levels of pred. Suppose these are the priors: intercept (level1): N ~ (1,1) effect of level2 relative to level1: N ~ (0,1) effect of level3 relative to level1: N ~ (-1,1) I think I know how to set up the prior for level1; what I’m having trouble with is setting up the two different priors for level2 and level3. With my limited brms skills, this is the closest that I can get: prior1 As you can see, I don’t know what to do with level3. Apparently, it is possible to do this in Stan. (Unfortunately, I’m not proficient with Stan.) I’ve found the following code somewhere: // prior specifications b[1] ~ normal (0, 1); b[2] ~ normal (-1, 1); temp_Intercept ~ normal (1, 1) In short, could someone possibly show me how to modify my brms code above so that I can set up separate priors for level2 and level3? I’d be extremely grateful for any help with this.
