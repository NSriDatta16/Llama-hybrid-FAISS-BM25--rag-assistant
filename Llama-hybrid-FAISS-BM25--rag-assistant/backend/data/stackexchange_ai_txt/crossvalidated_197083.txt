If we aggregate the data to get a single estimate as you have done, it is tacitly being assumed that every part of that data arose from the same data generating mechanism. With more "i.i.d." data we have a more precise estimate of the mean, which should not be surprising. However, it does not appear that the success rate is equal for all ages within the rage 40-44.
