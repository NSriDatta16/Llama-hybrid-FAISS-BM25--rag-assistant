Inclusion of prior data is easily done under a Bayesian paradigm, which is quite straightforward to apply using beta distributions (since that is its own conjugate prior). Briefly, you define a prior distribution that reflects your assumptions on defect probability before the experiment, in this case based on the historical data. Together with the data you can derive a posterior distribution, which reflects the updated probability taking into account both historical and current observations. A beta distribution $B$ in its $\alpha$ , $\beta$ parametrization can be thought of as $\alpha$ being the number of successes and $\beta$ the number of failures, with the requirement that $\alpha >0$ and $\beta > 0$ . For example, if you want to use your 100 historical observations directly this can be expressed as $B(0.001, 100)$ , taking a very small non-zero value for $\alpha$ since it must be > 0 and considering 'success' here as a defect occurring. The resulting distribution already has a lot of mass around probability of defect near zero, there's no use plotting anything above 1%: Incorporating new data and deriving a posterior is as simple as adding the additional successes (defects) to $\alpha$ and the rest to $\beta$ . If you were to observe another zero defects in your 300 new observations the resulting posterior will be $B(0.001, 400)$ : You can make probability statements directly from this distribution, for example there is a 95% posterior chance that the probability of defect is below $7.5e{-}26$ (in R: qbeta(.95, .001, 400) ), which I'm sure doesn't suffer from numerical precision issues at all. Consider another example where you'd have observed 50 defects and 250 non-defects, your posterior would be $B(50.001, 350)$ and the 95% upper credible limit for defect probability approximately $0.153$ . An elegant thing about these beta distributions is that they carry an effective sample size of $\alpha+\beta$ , so if you want to assign less weight to your prior you can simply reduce these parameters proportionally.
