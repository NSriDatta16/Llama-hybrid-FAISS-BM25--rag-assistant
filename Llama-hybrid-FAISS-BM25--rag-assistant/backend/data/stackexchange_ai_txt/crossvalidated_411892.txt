Your solution is an extension of ordinary regression to deal with time series complications/opportunities that might be present in the data. In general it is called SARMAX https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf . I took the first store (#64) as an example . You don't need the 3 averages or the difference between sales and ersales as these are derived series while original/pure information is in the observed data series ( sales and ersales (EST) ). The derived (descriptive) series often if not always muddy the water and are usually counter-productive . The role of modelling is to evolve what combination of observed data is important/significant . The data for the observed is here and I specified 25 as the ersales (EST in the output ) for next month to illustrate the approach. The model building exercise suggested no anomalies or any other deterministic structure and a memory scheme suggesting that sales should be predicted from last month's sales , current ersales and last month's ersales. and here THe Actual,Fit and Forecast is presented here with model residuals plotted here suggesting sufficiency All SARMAX models can be presented as expanded regression models as here showing details as to how the forecast is computed. Things can get a little bit more complicated when you have pulses , level/step shifts , seasonal pulses and or local time trends BUT not to worry software and methodology exists to help you. https://autobox.com/pdfs/A.pdf provides a general approach which you can follow. To generalize this in order to have 1 equation for all stores is probably not a good idea as the form of the response of actual sales to ersales is usually going to differ across stores. If one has longer series it is often possible to pull out/identify seasonal factors and use user-suggested series such as population or average price as they may play a role. There are a few questions on SE that might help you The theory behind fitting an ARIMAX model and Forecasts based on other forecasts Finally https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf is a walk through as to how ordinary regression grows into a Transfer Function (ARMAX) when time or space is in play. With respect to tour mission of predicting sales across ALL stores , I would develop individual store-level forecasts using the simulation option in AUTOBOX to make probabilistic/boot-strapped confidence intervals for the forecast AND then using monte-carlo resample those individual forecast values for each of the stores AND sum them to get an estimate of the composite. The distribution of those forecasts can then lead to probabilistic statements about the company as a whole. See Why does my ARMA forecast get smaller over time? for a discussion about developing probability distributions for forecasts that are free of distributional assumptions. Hope all of this helps you .
