DeprecationWarning: The 'categorical_features' keyword is deprecated in version 0.20

I was watching Machine Learning A- Z from SuperDataScience but when I was doing below code sample: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv') X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean') imputer = imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3]) X[:, 1:3]= imputer.transform(X[:,1:3]) from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder labelencoder_X = LabelEncoder() X[:, 0] = labelencoder_X.fit_transform(X[:, 0]) onehotencoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features =[0]) X = onehotencoder.fit_transform(X).toarray() I got this warning message: /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py:363: FutureWarning: The handling of integer data will change in version 0.22. Currently, the categories are determined based on the range [0, max(values)], while in the future they will be determined based on the unique values. If you want the future behaviour and silence this warning, you can specify "categories='auto'". In case you used a LabelEncoder before this OneHotEncoder to convert the categories to integers, then you can now use the OneHotEncoder directly. warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning) /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py:385: DeprecationWarning: The 'categorical_features' keyword is deprecated in version 0.20 and will be removed in 0.22. You can use the ColumnTransformer instead. "use the ColumnTransformer instead.", DeprecationWarning) And this below message also /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py:363: FutureWarning: The handling of integer data will change in version 0.22.

"use the ColumnTransformer instead.", DeprecationWarning) I was reading ColumnTransfer in sklearn website library I didn't understand how to fix these error messages SampleFile: Data.csv
