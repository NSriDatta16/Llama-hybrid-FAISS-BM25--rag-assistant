PHP MIB to OID resolve

I'm googling around for a couple of days, and can't find clear method/lib for resolving OID from MIB name, and MIB from OID. I've found few sites that have a large MIB database, search functions ie. but communicate with them needs cURL/socket connectivity and regexp of results (or eval in some cases) I've tried to parse MIB files myself, but this is returning to writing language parser in php witch, is "madness" ;) I have storage/cache mechanism witch work well, and every MIB lockup has to be done only once, but this one lockup must be fast and reliable [EDIT] heh and forgot about clearing the point, is there any tool/lib/method fast and reliable to lockup MIBs and OIDs?
