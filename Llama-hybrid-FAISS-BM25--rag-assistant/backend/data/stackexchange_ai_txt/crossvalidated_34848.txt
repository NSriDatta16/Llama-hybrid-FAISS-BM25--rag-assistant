MCMC for structured matrix

I'm working with a Gaussian random field, which can be described by joint pdf as follows: $$X\mid \sim N\left ( \mu, \sigma^{2} \left ( I-C \right )^{-1}\right )$$ where $C$ is a structured matrix, $c_{ij}=0$ if $i$ and $j$ is not neightbours. I'm working with the Bayesian inference on such fields. So the main question is about how to sample such structured matrix? Every draw has to be of the same structure as previous, i.e. zeros for not neighbours and the $I-C$ has to be positive definite. Although there are papers on how to generate positive definite matrix by MCMC, but I have not found any about how to draw a structured matrix.
