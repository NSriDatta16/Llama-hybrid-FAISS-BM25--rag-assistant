There is a paper named "Bias-Reduced Uncertainty Estimation for Deep Neural Classifiers". I am not deeply familiar with the article (it is in my to-read list for my own research), but its topic appears to be exactly what you need. They presented an uncertainty estimation algorithm, which is motivated by their observation regarding the training process of deep Neural Networks using SGD. They claim that during training with SGD, reliable estimates generated in early epochs are later on deformed, not unlike overfitting for classification results.
