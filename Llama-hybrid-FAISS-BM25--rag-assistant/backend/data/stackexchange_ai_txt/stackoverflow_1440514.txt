What is faster, flat files or a MySQL RAM database?

I need a simple way for multiple running PHP scripts to share data. Should I create a MySQL DB with a RAM storage engine, and share data via that (can multiple scripts connect to the same DB simultaneously?) Or would flat files with one piece of data per line be better?
