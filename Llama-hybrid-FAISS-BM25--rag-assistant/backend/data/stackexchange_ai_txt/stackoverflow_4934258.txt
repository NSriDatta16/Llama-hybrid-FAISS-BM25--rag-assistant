Returning complex types (multiple Lists) to client side using jquery.ajax

I'm designing a page which makes an ajax call (via jQuery.ajax) to a page method on the server side. On the server side, I have two classes: Agent and Channel . In the page method, I'd like to return a List and a List to the client side. How can I return two lists to client side? should wrap them up in one class like: public class ReturnData { public List Agents{ get; set; } public List Channels{ get; set; } } Or is there a better way? Also, How can I access to these lists' items in client side? Something like foreach(var item in Agents) but in client side?
