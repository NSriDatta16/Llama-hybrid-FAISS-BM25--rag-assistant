This is a linear model, so the easiest (but not completely kosher) way to fit it is using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It's easier if you rewrite the model a bit, $$w_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 w_{i-1} + \beta_2 c_i.$$ You should be able to convince yourself that this is essentially the same model, and that you can solve backwards to find your $k_1, k_2, k_3$ in terms of $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$. We can fit it in R as follows (with some random data): > w c model summary(model) Call: lm(formula = w[2:101] ~ w[1:100] + c) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.5455 -1.4231 0.1289 1.1868 5.3232 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1.429e+02 1.784e+01 8.013 2.51e-12 *** w[1:100] 1.925e-01 9.919e-02 1.941 0.0552 . c 1.095e-03 1.180e-03 0.928 0.3559 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 2.126 on 97 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.04784, Adjusted R-squared: 0.02821 F-statistic: 2.437 on 2 and 97 DF, p-value: 0.09277 Since the data are completely random, we don't actually expect there to be any relationship (other than the intercept), and those p-values are actually surprisingly low. You can do a similar fit in any statistical software. If you want to actually do it properly (as opposed to an easy and not-very-accurate hack), this type of analysis is called time series. MIT's OCW has a course about it, though I can't vouch for it personally (and I'm usually a little skeptical of stats courses from economists).
