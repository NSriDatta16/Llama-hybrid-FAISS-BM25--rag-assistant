Serving large static files with Sinatra

Sinatra can serve files from a static directory with the set :public, 'your_directory' command, but how can I replicate this in a new route? Importantly, this new route needs to respect byte ranges too! Any ideas? I feel like I should be able to leverage the already present code in the static serve part of sinatra.
