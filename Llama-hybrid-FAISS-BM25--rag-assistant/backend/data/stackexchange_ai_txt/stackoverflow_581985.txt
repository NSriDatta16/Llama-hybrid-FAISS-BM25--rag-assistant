C# replacement for standard Treeview?

I'd like to find a replacement for provided System.Windows.Form.Treeview. I need the following improvements : Multiple selection of items Better performance (performance of standard widget is simply awful, in particular when adding a long list of items) Scrolling while drag and dropping an item inside the treeview widget I may be forgetting some, but these are quite important. Since i already have a software that makes use of the standard Treeview, I will take in consideration API differences.
