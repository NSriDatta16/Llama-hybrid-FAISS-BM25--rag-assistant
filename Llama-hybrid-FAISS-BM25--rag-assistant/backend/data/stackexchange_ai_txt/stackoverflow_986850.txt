You have completely failed to provide any information on what sort of software, or what platform. On the other hand, you sound like you're going to write the software, so you aren't stuck with bad decision already. What will matter most is the display, so keep the display functionality separated from the rest. Do not, repeat do not , hard-code any strings. They need to be kept in a separate function table, with as much context as you can easily provide. Do not hard-code display layouts, particularly as English is a very terse language for most purposes, and most alphabetic languages will generally require more space to say the same thing. Be wary of doing anything with case, since uppercase and lowercase do different things in different languages. Make sure you're using Unicode for all text the user might possibly see. Bear in mind that exception strings should be kept uniform, if you're using them, and error messages to be logged may be best kept in English (or whatever your native language is), depending on whether you or the locals are going to be examining them. Whatever system you're working with is likely to have some sort of locale facility. Use it for everything it handles. You don't want to be writing out, say, February 9 as 2/9/2009 in Britain, because they'll read it as September 2. People will understand writing a million out as 1,000,000.0, but for some people that's a clearly foreign construct, and they want it as 1.000.000,0. Try to avoid embedding numbers into sentences. In English, one would say "1 page printed" and "2 pages printed", and likely "No pages printed". In other languages, things get real complicated. Something like "Pages printed: 2" is much easier to translate. Make sure the users can use the metric system and Celcius temperatures. Either use metric throughout, or convert it in the display layer. Get real translators for every place you're going to be localizing to. Google works great for initial mockups, but you probably want to sound more literate in the countries you sell to than, say, "All your base now belong to us". Make sure they have enough information to do the job; some words and phrases in English are ambiguous, and the meaning depends on context, and therefore they may be impossible to translate without context. Budget for some good translation software, if available for your platform. Translators aren't cheap, and spending a few thousand dollars to help them work faster will pay off fairly quickly. If possible, get somebody local to beta test the localized version, and pay attention to what he or she complains about. That's what I've learned by now, and I'm slowly getting our software usable in Japan.
