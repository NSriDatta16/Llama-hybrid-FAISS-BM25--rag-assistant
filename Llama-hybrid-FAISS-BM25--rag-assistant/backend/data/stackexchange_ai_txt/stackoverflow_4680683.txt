Drupal "enter key" not working in text area

I'm finding in any text areas the "enter key" is not working and does not create a new paragraph when I use it. This is for text areas which have a text editor enabled. I have tried it with tinymce and CKeditor and they both do the same thing. The strange thing is, when I don't have any buttons enabled, it works fine. Can anyone help? Ben
