Weekly seasonality: There are ~ 52,1429 weeks per year. This is not an integer number. ARIMA is only designed for seasonalities with integer numbers. Daily seasonality: Every year has 365,25 days. Every month has 28-31 days (or an other number cultural regions which depend on the moon calendar and not the Gregorian calender). Every weeks has 7 days. You will likely observe multiple seasonalities. Some pattern recur every monday, some pattern recur always at the beginning of the month and some pattern recur always at the beginning of the year. ARIMA is not designed for multiple seasonalities. A general advice about categorical regressors: Take on category, i.e. day as 0-level and the other ones as 1-6. You "save" on independent variable and avoid multicollinearity. Solution: ARIMA is not designed for multiple seasonalities and uneven seasonalities. You can try another model like tbats instead.
