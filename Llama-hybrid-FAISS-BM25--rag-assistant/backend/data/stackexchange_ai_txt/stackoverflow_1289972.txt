Linq2Entities / Linq2Sql - Comprehensive search

As I read the a similar question about searching SQL I realized I am very curious on how to do the same thing in Linq. Assume a DB Table with the fields "Title", "Tags" (comma separated) and "Body" (HTML) that has been connected to a Linq2[Entities|Sql] How would you go about searching for a string across those fields. Yes, I could brute force it but I hope there is something elegant that would suit better.
