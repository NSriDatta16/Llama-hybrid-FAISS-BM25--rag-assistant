For asking questions here, you should learn how to use JaX to format equations. The appropriate t statistic is $T = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}},$ where $n, \bar X,$ and $S$ are the sample size, mean, and standard deviation, respectively. T test. You want to do a 2-sided test. If $|T| \ge t^*,$ then you reject $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ against the two-sided alternative $H_0: \mu \ne \mu_0,$ at the 5% level, where values $\pm t^*$ cut probability 0.025 from the upper and lower tails, respecteively, of Student's t distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom. You can find such 'critical values' by using printed tables of the CDFs of t distributions or by using software (a statistical calculator or a computer program). For example, using R statistical software with n = 15 you would get critical values $\pm 2.145,$ as follows: qt(c(.025,.975), 14) [1] -2.144787 2.144787 Example: Traditionally, first midterm exams for a course have an average score of $\mu = 100.$ The fifteen students enrolled this semester had scores summarized as follows: summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 75.84 103.65 107.75 109.17 117.52 131.51 length(x); sd(x) [1] 15 # sample size [1] 13.72826 # sample SD stripchart(x, pch="|") In particular, the sample mean this year is $\bar X = 109.17.$ This is above $\mu = 100,$ but is it 'significantly' different at the 5% level of significance? A two-sided, one-sample t test in R gives the following result. t.test(x, mu=100) One Sample t-test data: x t = 2.588, df = 14, p-value = 0.02147 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 100 95 percent confidence interval: 101.5710 116.7759 sample estimates: mean of x 109.1734 Notice that the test statistic is $T = 2.588,$ so that $|T| > 2.145.$ We reject $H_0: \mu = 100$ in favor of the alternative $H_a: \mu \ne 100.$ Another way to see that $H_0$ is rejected is that the P-value (probability) of a test statistic as far or farther from $0$ then $2.145)$ is $0.02147 \le 0.05 - 5\%.$ The method of finding the P-value is shown separately below. 1 - diff(pt(c(-2.588, 2.588), 14)) [1] 0.02147282 In the figure below the critical values are shown as vertical orange lines. Each cuts probability $0.025$ from its respective tail of $\mathsf{T}(\nu=14).$ The observed value of $T$ is shown as a solid black line. The dotted black line is equally far from $0.$ The total area under the density curve outside these two black lines is the P-value. R code for the figure: curve(dt(x, 14), -4, 4, col="blue", ylab="PDF", xlab="t", main="Density of T(14)") abline(h=0, col="green2"); abline(v=0, col="green2") abline(v = c(-2.144787, 2.144787), col="orange") abline(v = 2.588); abline(v = -2.588, lty="dotted") Test for variance. Finally, I will show you a variance test using the chi-squared distribution, and the same data as in my Example above, from a recent release of Minitab statistical software.
