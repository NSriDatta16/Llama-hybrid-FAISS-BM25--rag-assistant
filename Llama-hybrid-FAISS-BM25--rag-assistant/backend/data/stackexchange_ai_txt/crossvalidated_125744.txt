In a cross-sectional study, you are almost always getting prevalence data, so as a first step, you could consider these prevalence ratios. But, it sounds like you are modeling the number of symptoms as your outcome based on some covariates, using Poisson or negative binomial models. So you have something like this model: $log(Symptom Count|Gender) =\beta_{0} +\beta_{1}*Gender$. If we want to compare men (gender = 1, say) and women (gender = 0, say), we might be interested in the ratio: $log(Symptom Count|Male) / log(Symptom Count|Female) = (\beta_{0} +\beta_{1}*1)/(\beta_{0} +\beta_{1}*0)$. When we exponentiate this comparison, the left-hand-side is the ratio of the count of symptoms in men to the count of symptoms in women, and the right-hand-side is $e^{\beta{1}}$. Which is what you want to know the interpretation of. This is the ratio of the Average Symptom Count in men to the Average Symptom Count in women (and if there are other covariates, it is the adjusted Symptom Count ratio). Say you had a value like 1.2. You could interpret that as "on average, men in our study reported 20% more symptoms in the past 30 days than women, adjusting for ".
