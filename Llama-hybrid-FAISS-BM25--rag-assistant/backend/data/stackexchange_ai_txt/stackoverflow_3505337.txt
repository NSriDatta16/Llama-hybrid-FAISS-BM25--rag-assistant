reg ex newby - how do you specify to match a characters but not include it in the output?

Really simple situation: Eg. in this string: my dog said "woof" today I would like to get the string in quotes, but without the quotes... --- more detail --- Unfortunately the regex is via 3rd party software so I don't know the underlying engine. Here's the string: href="http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/17/dengue-fever-increases-in-florida/?hpt=T2">Dengue outbreak Current regex: (https?://)?([-\w]+(\.\w[-\w]*)+|([a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?\.))+(com|edu|biz|gov|in(t|fo)|mil|net|org|[a-z][a-z]\.[a-z][a-z])\S*) this returns: http:.../?hpt=T2">Dengue Adding " to start and end of regex works, but includes the " . Perhaps there's another way?
