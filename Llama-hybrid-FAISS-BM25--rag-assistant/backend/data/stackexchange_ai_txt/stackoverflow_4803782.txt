Is there a production stable RDBMS module for RingoJS

I just ported a web app from Java/Tomcat to RingoJS and threw out tons of ceremony code and configuration. This Javascript AppServer is just great. So far I used the integrated JSON file storage, but now have to add database support (H2). There is a ringo-sqlstore and a ringo-hibernate module. Does anybody have experience with stability, performance, ease of development - recommendations?
