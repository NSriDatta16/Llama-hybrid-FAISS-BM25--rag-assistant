What exactly is your goal? And what exactly are the means you're willing to use? If you just want to get the job done with one particular compiler on one particular computer, then the fastest and easiest, but also dirtiest, solution is, to use a union. You define a struct that has your items as members and merge that with the character array. You need to tell the compiler to pack the members really tightly, something along the lines of #pragma pack(1), and your problem is solved. You just store the three values in the members, and then look at it as a character array. If the machine is little endian, and you need big endian ints / floats, you just swap the relevant characters. But there are at least another dozen solutions that come to mind if you have other goals, like portability, non-standard byte order, sizeof(int) !=4, float not stored in IEEE format internally, etc.
