Logistic Regression - ROC curve plots Sensitivity vs Specificity instead of (1-Specificity)

I am new to Machine Learning and have been doing some practice on Logistic Regression. To evaluate the models, I've been trying to create some ROC plots. The package that i used is pROC. The model name is - 'model' dataset is 'data'. The code I used in R is: library(pROC) predictionData 0.5)) plot(rocModel) Ideally, from what i have learned, ROC should plot Sensitivity or TPR (True Positive Rate) vs 1 - Specificity. But as shown in the picture below, it shows Sensitivity vs Specificity. Am I missing some obvious trick here or is something wrong with what I have done ?
