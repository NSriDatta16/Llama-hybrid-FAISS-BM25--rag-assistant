You have to pass each command line argument as different parameters to execlp. The commandline you're executing would be the same as running this from a command line: java '-Xmx1024m -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=11999' -DFBLog4j=true -jar myJar.jar Which won't work either, essentially -Xmx and -agentlib gets passed as a single argument.
