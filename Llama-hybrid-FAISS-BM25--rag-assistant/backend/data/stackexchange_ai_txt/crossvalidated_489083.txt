Depends what smaller observations would mean. Page 81 of the RiskMetrics 1996 technical document where EWMA was introduced shows an example with only 22 observations for a commonly used $\lambda$ setting, so yes it decays fairly fast with lags farther in the past having an almost negligble contributing weight. If you plan to use EWMA on financial data, don't. It's an outdated technique that doesn't actually match the autocorrelation function of financial time series like they said it does. A hyperbolically weighted moving average (RiskMetrics 2006 EWMA) decays slower than EWMA, and therefore matches real financial autocorrelation alot better. Kevin Sheppard used to have an implementation of the EWMA 2006 covariance matrix but I don't see it anymore. by the way your link only shows univariate EWMA. Page 179 of RiskMetrics 1996 shows the actual EWMA covariance matrix.
