You have $n$ observations, $y\in\mathbb{R}^n$. You correspondingly have $n$ noise terms, $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}^n$. The last sentence means that each separate noise term $\epsilon_i$ is identically distributed and that they are independent. (In more general situations, the $\epsilon_i$ may not be identically distributed, or dependent, e.g., in time series analysis. You need more complex tools in such a situation.)
