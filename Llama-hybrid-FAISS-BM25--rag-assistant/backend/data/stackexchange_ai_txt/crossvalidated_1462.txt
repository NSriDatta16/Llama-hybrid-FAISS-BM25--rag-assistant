Using Std.Dev and Mean to generate hypothetical/additional data points?

Let's say I want to make a football simulator based on real-life data. Say I have a player who averages 5.3 yards per carry with a SD of 1.7 yards. I'd like to generate a random variable that simulates the next few plays. eg: 5.7, 4.9, 5.3, etc. What stats terms to I need to look up to pursue this idea? Density function? The normal curve estimates what boundaries the data generally fall within, but how do I translate that into simulation of subsequent data points? Thanks for any guidance!
