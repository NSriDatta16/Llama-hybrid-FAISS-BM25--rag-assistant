To identify start-words on question sentences, you should go through a large text corpus looking for sentences that end in a ? , and figure out the most frequent start-words you find in those. A few you missed that come to mind include WHICH, AM, ARE, WAS, WERE, MAY, MIGHT, CAN, COULD, WILL, SHALL, WOULD, SHOULD, HAS, HAVE, HAD, and DID. Perhaps also IF to go with WHEN. Also consider IN, AT, TO, FROM, and ON, plus maybe UNDER and OVER. All depends on the sort of query system you have and how much latitude in natural language queries you hope to provide your users with. Similarly, you should examine all your own queries that people have already made in the same light, finding which of their questions actually do end in a ? to help identify similar ones which do not. That should find a lot of the interrogatives; are imperatives also a possibility? Depending how fancy you want to get, you might consider using something like Wordnet as a start of part-of-speech tagging. It’s mostly for synonym sets, including hypernym, hyponym, holonym, and meronym information, but I believe it will have the other information you’re looking for as well. Wikipedia has a couple of articles on question answering and natural language search engines . Both have references you might care to pursue. You might also glance through these PDF papers: “Towards a Theory of Natural Language Interfaces to Databases” “Natural language question answering: the view from here” “Natural Language Question Answering Model Applied to a Document Retrieval System” . Lastly, the START Natural Language Question Answering System from MIT seems interesting.
