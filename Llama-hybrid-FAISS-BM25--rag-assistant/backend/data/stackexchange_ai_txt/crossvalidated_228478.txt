Threshold value for Cluster after document similarity

I have N documents. I have found out cosine similarity between all documents. T = (N*(N-1)/2) Because docSim between a document with itself is 1. Now, I have one query and I want to find out all documents which are similar to it. I don't want to rank it but cluster it based on threshold value. Here is how I calculated threshold value. Average: Mean of all(T) cosineSimilarities Average(T) + alpha*standardDeviation(T) How do you find the parameter alpha? I found this formula here https://www.researchgate.net/post/Determination_of_threshold_for_cosine_similarity_score Is there any other way to find out threshold? Some suggestions on formula might improve my cluster. Thank you
