Confidence intervals for binomial generalised linear model with cauchit link function

The correct way to calculate a confidence interval (CI) for a generalised linear model (GLM) and avoid the problems of normal approximation intervals has been adequately discussed by Gavin Simpson here , here and here . However, the binomial examples provided always concern the logit link function, i.e. logistic regression. I would like to model my data using the cauchit link function, which is based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Cauchy distribution : $y = \frac{tan^{-1}(ax + b)}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}$ . This link function is rarely used but provides an exceptionally good fit in my case. So I tried Gavin Simpson's method on a cauchit binomial GLM. Here is a minimal reproducible example in R using these data . wasp |z|) # (Intercept) -9.28969 4.82027 -1.927 0.0540 . # leafHeight 0.14928 0.07786 1.917 0.0552 . new $linkinv # inverse of the cauchit link function # fit new$ fit $fit # same as inv(link.pred$ fit) # 99% Wald CI new $u1 fit + res.pred $se.fit * qnorm(0.995) new$ l1 $fit - res.pred$ se.fit * qnorm(0.995) # 99% Wilson CI new $u2 fit + link.pred $se.fit * qnorm(0.995)) new$ l2 $fit - link.pred$ se.fit * qnorm(0.995)) require(ggplot2) ggplot(new, aes(leafHeight, fit)) + geom_line() + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = l1, ymax = u1), fill = NA, colour = "#6b4d8d", lty = 5) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = l2, ymax = u2), fill = NA, colour = "#c7b300") + theme_minimal() As far as I understand it, the purple/dashed CI is a 99% Wald or normal approximation interval and the yellow/solid CI is a 99% Wilson score interval. I know that the Wald CI should be avoided due to the overshoot above 1 and below 0, which is clearly visible in the plot, among other problems . However, the Wilson CI also doesn't look great. Despite the high (and, at $\alpha$ = 0.05, non-significant) p value of 0.06 for leafHeight and my choice of a 99% rather than 95% CI, it looks abnormally wide. I also tried this approach with my data, which fit the Cauchy CDF better and show a highly significant ( p So here are my questions: Is the yellow/solid CI a correct 99% Wilson score interval around the predicted values of the cauchit GLM? This answer suggests that a Wilson CI can be calculated with binom::binom.confint(method = "wilson") . However, I don't know how I could apply this R function to my example with a continuous predictor variable in order to check if it comes up with the same Wilson CI as is shown in the plot. Would it be feasible to choose a Wald CI over a Wilson CI when the latter looks too wide, as is the case here, or when overshoot and zero-width are not apparent in the former? Is there another easy way of calculating and plotting a CI for a binomial GLM with a cauchit link function? Are there other R packages I should know of? I have used bootstrapped CIs in the past but don't know how to bootstrap binary data. How would I implement this in R in my case?
