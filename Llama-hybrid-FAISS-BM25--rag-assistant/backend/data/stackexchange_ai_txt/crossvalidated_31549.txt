Looking at moments of the data may not be adequate because your observations, IO's/second, are not i.i.d ; rather the process you are trying to model is Markovian i.e. the value at time $t$ depends on the value at time $t-1$. One approach for modeling such data is to use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). With an HMM you can model the data as being generated by given states e.g. normal , heavy , or failure , which can transition between each other with some given probability e.g. heavy is much more likely to transition to failure than normal is (this is the Markovian part). However, you cannot observe the underlying process (hence the hidden part); instead the hidden states emit observable variables, which in your case would be IOs/sec, with some probability, which for the sake of illustration could be Gaussian i.e. $IOs | failure \sim N(\mu_f, \sigma_f^2)$, where $\mu_f$ some value larger than the $\mu$ for the normal or heavy states. In total, the parameters of an HMM are- the hidden states, the transition probabilities between states, the emission states, the emission probabilities, and the initial probabilities (what's the probability of starting the HMM at normal versus heavy versus failure?). The simple Gaussian-HMM model alluded to above is taught in many introductory Machine Learning and Statistics courses. A simple Google search will lead you to practically implemented code in the language of your choice. Of course the HMM can be extended ad infinitum ; if you are interested in more flexible and complete modeling and you use R; check out the depmixS4 package.
