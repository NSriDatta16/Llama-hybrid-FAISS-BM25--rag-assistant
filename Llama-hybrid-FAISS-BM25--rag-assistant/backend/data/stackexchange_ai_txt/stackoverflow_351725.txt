I think that what is really really important is to make an interpreter: it gives you more insight of programming languages, and that's what you use... In scheme it is actually rnot hard at to make an interpeter! But actually I would greatly encourage reading parts of SICP for great enlightment). Concerning compilers, it's more complex as the focus here is getting some performance/doing it for an actual machine. As a programmer, what is important there is to know at least what tasks they globally perform and when do they run rather than the details, because nowadays they have grown into really complex systems especially with JIT's etc...
