What is the objective function of GAN?

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) solve some unique objective function or loss not used by other learning models, it has a name. There are already several variants of GAN so I'm getting conflicting information about what the traditional objective function is. could anyone spell out the formula with some commentary on the usual optimization algorithm used, and other considerations, used to solve the objective function variants to the original objective that attempt to overcome issues with traditional GAN such as mode collapse even the original paper and this discussion are stuck on expected values, so I'm interested in the final developed form of GAN.
