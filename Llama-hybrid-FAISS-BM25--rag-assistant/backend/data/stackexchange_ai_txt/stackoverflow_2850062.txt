How to organize database access code in Android project?

I have created a ContentProvider for my main Sqlite table, pretty much following NotePad example from SDK (although I am not sure whether I will ever be exposing my data to other apps). However, I need to create lots of other, non-trivial queries on that and other tables and views. A good example would be queries to extract some statistics from the base data, averages, totals etc. So what's the best place for this code in an Android project? How it should be related and connected to the Uri-based data access exposed by a Provider? Any good examples out there?
