When is logistic regression MLE consistent and asymptotically normal?

Logistic regression model is defined as $$\mathbb{P}\left\{ Y = 1\mid X\right\}=\frac{e^{\beta^T X}}{1 + e^{\beta^T X}}$$ where $Y$ is a random variable in $\left\{0,1\right\}$, and $X$ is a random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Consider the MLE of this model. Under what conditions is the MLE estimator $\hat{\beta}_n$ consistent (i.e. $\hat{\beta}_n \overset{p}\to \beta_0$), and $\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\beta}_n - \beta_0\right)$ is asymptotically normally distributed? The theorem I am looking at (which is provided in the lecture but without proof) is Following this theorem, the conditions I came up with were Identifiability $\mathbb{E}\left[ \left| X_i\right|^2\right]$ is finite for $i=1,\cdots,d$. The matrix $\mathbb{E}\left[XX^T\right]$ is non-singular. I am wondering if there is any reference on the conditions. I don't know if I'm right or not, partly because I can't find this theorem somewhere else.
