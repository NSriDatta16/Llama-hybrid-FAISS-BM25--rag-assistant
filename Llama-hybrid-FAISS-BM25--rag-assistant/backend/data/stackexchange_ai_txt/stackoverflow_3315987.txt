dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found - nm reports symbol found

Fairly abstract question here, as I don't know quite where to start my own investigations. I have a C package constructed with CMake that produces librpdb.so; I have a Ruby Gem set up for the same library, which produces rpdb.bundle. When used in Ruby, I get this: dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _RPDB_RuntimeStorageController_sharedInstance Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rpdb-0.1.0/lib/rpdb/rpdb.bundle Expected in: flat namespace When I look into the library, nm reports: 000000000000ea40 T _RPDB_RuntimeStorageController_sharedInstance So it appears that the symbol is indeed in the library. Why, then, would binding fail?
