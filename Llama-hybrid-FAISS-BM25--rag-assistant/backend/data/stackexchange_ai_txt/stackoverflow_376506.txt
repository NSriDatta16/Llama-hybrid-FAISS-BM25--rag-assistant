Word 2007, Open XML - embedding an image

Do you know what basic information MUST include a paragraph ( ) in document.xml inside a *.docx document, that specifies an image? I do know there must be: specifing the relationship id, but what else? It's very hard to find it in Google and experimenting with cutting out tags from a ready document or reading the specification takes a lot of time. An example with all the required tags would be greatly appreciated.
