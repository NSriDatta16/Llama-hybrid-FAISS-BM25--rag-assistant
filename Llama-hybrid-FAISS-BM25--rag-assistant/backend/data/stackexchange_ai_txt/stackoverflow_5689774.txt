Confusion with meters in AVAudioRecorder

Simply put, I'm trying to lip-sync something based on the decibel reading from the mic input stream of an iPhone, and the values I'm getting aren't quite what I'm after. I'm using AVAudioRecorder's peakPowerForChannel and averagePowerForChannel. (I'm aware that this is a rather simplistic lip-sync technique, but quality isn't a major concern). When the number of decibels increases, the meters react as I'd like them to (higher value when louder, so I can map this to the open-ness of the mouth) but when the sound stops quickly, the values decrease slowly, as though the sound was trailing off (i.e. fading to silence over a second or two) - not what I'd like. Is there a way of configuring the AVAudioRecorder so that it doesn't have this 'fade' effect, or can I do something with the values that it gives me to get the desired output? Alternatively, is there another tool I can use? Thanks!
