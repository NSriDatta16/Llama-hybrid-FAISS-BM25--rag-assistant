Loading Google GWT app dynamically into a legacy webpage

I have a legacy page which works already with ajax and I would like to load an GWT app (2.0.4) into that app without reloading the whole page. Our framework normally can insert css and js files into the page by evaluation "eval(...)" the js code or url which is sent in an html fragment. But the gwt bootstrap js code fails while evaluating and produces an blank page with a js error that the "app-name" object is not defined. Does anybody has an idea why the gwt bootstrap file behaves like that? thanks!
