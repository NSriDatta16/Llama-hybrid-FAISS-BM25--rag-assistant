As it is already said - values are indeterminate. But, I have to mention that if your array is static or global, the values are initialized to their default values, which usually means they will be initialized to zeros (or '\0' in the case of array of chars). EDIT: As Noah Roberts suggested, the term "indeterminate" is probably more appropriate than "undefined" (strictly mathematically speaking) - so suggestion is accepted and I've changed the term to "indeterminate". But majority of us are engineers or programmers here, not mathematicians (I suppose) and similar omissions should be forgiven :))
