k-NN interesting for classification and regression, but poor for probability density estimation

Why are k-NN interesting for classification and regression, but poorly suited for probability density estimation? It seems there is some issues near the data causing problem to well estimate a probability density function. EDIT A hint has been given to me, but I can't see how it helps. Pattern recognition and machine learning by Bishop, Christopher M page 125. Am I wrong to say the density estimation $p(x)$ does not work very well with k-NN approach because the resulting density estimate Is not even a density Has a lot of discontinuities (looks very spiky, not differentiable) Even for large regions with no observed samples the estimated density is far from zero (tails are too heavy)
