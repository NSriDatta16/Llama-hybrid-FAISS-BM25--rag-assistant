Expected value of average of error-term

I'm having some trouble understanding the following expression: $E(\bar{u}|x_i)=0$ $u$ is the error term and $\bar{u}=n^{-1}\sum u$ It's used for proving unbiasedness of OLS. I've got two questions: Does $\bar{u}$ equal zero like for the residuals? I know that the expected value of u equals zero. If yes, then taking expectation of $\bar{u}$ is like taking expectation of a constant and therefore the expected value is redundant?
