Don't think about how to store it, think about how you use it. And also think about how it might change in the future. The storage structure should reflect use. The first option is more normalized by the second, so I would tend to prefer it. It has the benefit of being easy to change, for example if every month suddenly needed a second piece of information stored about it. Usually this kind of structure is easier to populate, but not always. Think about where the data is coming from. If you're only using this data for reports and you don't need to aggregate data across months, use the second option. It really depends on what the data is for and where it comes from. Generally, though, the first option is better.
