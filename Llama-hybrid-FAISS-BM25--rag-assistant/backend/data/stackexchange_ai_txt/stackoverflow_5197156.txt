The short answer is no. The longer answer is WAI-ARIA can do some of what you want but there's no guarantee that screen readers will support it. For a discussion of WAI-ARIA roles see http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles Pay particular attention to section 5.4, things like banner and contentinfo may be useful to you. Do not depend on WAI-ARIA support though; make sure that you use good HTML including descriptive alt tags and headings to separate your document into appropriate sections.
