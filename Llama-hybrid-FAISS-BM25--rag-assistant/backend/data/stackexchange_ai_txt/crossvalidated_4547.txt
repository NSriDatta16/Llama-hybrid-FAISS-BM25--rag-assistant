The median of medians is not the same as the median of the raw scores. A simple case of this is that when you have an odd number of sales, the median is the middle value; when you have an even number of sales, the median is commonly taken as the average between those two values. A more "real world" challenge to this is that states will sell differing numbers of houses and thus the median of their medians is a poor guess as to the median of all home sales. Though it also will to be precise, a good first pass estimation would be to find the median of values where each state's median is reflected a number of times proportional to the number of sales in that state. Thus, I am essentially suggesting a weighted median.
