Cycling LED Modes using ControllerMate

I'm using ControllerMate with a Nostromo (Belkin) n52 (NOT the te version) Speedpad on an iMac running Snow Leopard. The official SpeedPad configuration software doesn't run beyond Tiger, or at least, it doesn't run on Snow Leopard due to the kext failing to load properly, hence the attempt at using ControllerMate. The official SpeedPad configuration software has the capability to load 1 unique set of keys per "page", where there are 4 pages. This ultimately led me to be able to do things like basic key mapping on the first page, key combinations on the second, macro'ing on the third, and I set up some global shortcuts for my music player, and bound those same shortcuts on the last page of the Speedpad. Pages were represented by the currently lit LED on the unit; No LEDs On / Red LED On / Green LED On / Blue LED On I'm attempting to use the Logic functions of ControllerMate in order to recreate this same behavior. Clicking a button bound to this routine will cause the LEDs to start cycling in the order listed above, ultimately circling around and restarting at no LEDs on. I'm going to explain this as best I can so that the basic principles of programming/logic here could feasibly be answered by any individual here, but I might fail, and you might need to familiarize yourself with ControllerMate first :P. ControllerMate presents you with a grid, where you simply drag objects in. It's a visual programming canvas. For example, my Canvas has 4 blocks on it currently; Nostromo SpeedPad 2 Keypad LeftAlt This is the key that corresponds to the large Orange button above the DPad. It's on the Canvas so I can dump other elements into it, and get elements out of it. It's a basic Input/Output system with snapping elements. Num Lock Caps Lock Scroll Lock These represent the LEDs. When these blocks turn "on", the related LED on the SpeedPad lights up. For example, if I connect one Lock block, or all of them, directly to the LeftAlt block, pressing the "LeftAlt" button on the SpeedPad turns on one/all of the LED light(s) for the duration that it's held. ControllerMate actually has a wonderful guide of explaining the "Blocks" and showing what they look like at http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/help/?show=blocks The Logic blocks I have to work with are as follows: AND NOT OR XOR ON/OFF Gate ON/OFF Latch 1:2 Selector Toggle Most of these are self explanatory already, but just in case they aren't, please consult the above link to get the specific Block Reference (My Rep. currently prevents me from linking each of the above elements). I'm thinking that I'm going to have success with using a series of Toggles and Gates, but I haven't quite been able to interconnect them properly to consistently behave in a perfect loop of invocation. Bonus Points if you're really feeling up to it (you'll get an accepted answer for satisfying only the primary question, promise!): Not only a linear On/Off per LED, but a complete permutation of all On/Off combinations; All Off Red On Blue Off Green Off Red On Blue On Green Off Red On Blue Off Green On Red On Blue On Green On Red Off Blue On Green Off etc. [edit] If anyone with suitable rep could create/add the "ControllerMate" tag to this question I'd sure appreciate it.
