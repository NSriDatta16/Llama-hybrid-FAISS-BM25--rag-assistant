Less Mathematical Approaches to Machine Learning?

Out of curiosity, I've been reading up a bit on the field of Machine Learning, and I'm surprised at the amount of computation and mathematics involved. One book I'm reading through uses advanced concepts such as Ring Theory and PDEs (note: the only thing I know about PDEs is that they use that funny looking character). This strikes me as odd considering that mathematics itself is a hard thing to "learn." Are there any branches of Machine Learning that use different approaches? I would think that a approaches relying more on logic, memory, construction of unfounded assumptions, and over-generalizations would be a better way to go, since that seems more like the way animals think. Animals don't (explicitly) calculate probabilities and statistics; at least as far as I know.
