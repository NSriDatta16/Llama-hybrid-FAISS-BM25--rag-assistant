Intercepting mouse clicks when the mouse is hovering above a control

I'm working on a MFC C++ dialog where I need to respond to right mouse click events for a dialog even if the mouse is hovering over a control. I could write event handler code for each control to delegate the work to the parent dialog, but I'm hoping there is a more elegant solution? I'm hoping there is some way to intercept the windows messages, but I'm still figuring that part out. I've tried listening to the WM_COMMAND messages with Spy++ but I didn't see what I needed. Any suggestions?
