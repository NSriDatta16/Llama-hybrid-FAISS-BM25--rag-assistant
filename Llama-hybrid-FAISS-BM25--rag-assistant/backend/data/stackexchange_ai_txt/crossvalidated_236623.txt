How do I calculate an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation, knowing only the degrees of freedom

I have $k$ groups of $m$ independent samples from a standard normal distribution. The groups are averaged as $K_1$ through $K_m$ the total number of samples is then $mk=n$. I also have the range of $K_{\text{max}} - K_{\text{min}} = w$. What is the best way to estimate the standard deviation? Should I use $s=\sqrt{\frac{2}{n-1}}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)}$?
