PHP: Using APC as general cache, XCache as opcache, possible?

I'm really intreagued by the general cache aspects of APC and want to use it in my code (this I know how to do, this is not the problem). However, I'm using XCache as opcache now and want to continue to do so since I have it tweaked "just right" for my particular needs. The reason I want to use APC cache as general cache is that I'm not happy with PEAR::Cache_Lite from Pear in terms of using it for variable caching as it stores it on the disk, and disk I/O is a bottleneck whereas RAM is not and APC stores variables in RAM, not in files on the disk. So, anyone have any experience or knows if it is possible to setup APC to only run as general cache (being called via it's API in my PHP Code, similarly to that of PEAR::Cache_Lite) while I maintain another opcache (in my case, xcache). Thanks.
