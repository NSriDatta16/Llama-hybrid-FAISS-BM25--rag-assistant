Bayesian statistics: Can a posterior probability be exactly 1?

I have a question regarding bayesian statistics. Is it possible to end up with a posterior probability of 1, that a slope is positive? My likelihood data shows a greatly significant relationship, with a p-value of 0.000715. But does it make sense that I end up with a posterior probability of 1? And do you know a smart way to calculate the posterior probability of a positive slope?
