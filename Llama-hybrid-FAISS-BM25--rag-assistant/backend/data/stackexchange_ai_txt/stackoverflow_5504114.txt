The original "Navigator" view is still available. From the FB menu choose "Window" -> "Other views..." Open up the the "General" tree and select "Navigator" This might put the Navigator window as a tab in the bottom panel (that's where it showed up for me). You can then drag and drop the tab to place it right next to the Package Explorer. Then you can easily switch back and forth between both views.
