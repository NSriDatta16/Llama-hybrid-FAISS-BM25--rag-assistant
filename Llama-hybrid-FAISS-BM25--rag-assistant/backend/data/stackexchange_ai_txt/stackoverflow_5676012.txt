Android storage advice?

When I log a user in, I pull down some user data. It's just a userid and stuff like that. A couple of strings really. The thing is I don't want to pull this down every time if it's the same user over and over and so I want to store it locally across sessions. I'm aware of SQLite but is making a table just for 1 row really the best solution? Is there not another, better way?
