Not as far as I know. Curious to see other answers though. One hacky thing that comes to mind is, maybe you could use javascript to control a div containing your swf so that the div gets large(zoom in), but is displayed within the same 'scrollRect' rectangle. you would call the javascript function to do that using ExternalInterface. A quick'n'dirty test I did using flash's scrollPane component: //zoomIn,zoomOut = button //sp = scrollPane, scrollDrag = true zoomIn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, zoom); zoomOut.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, zoom); function zoom(event:MouseEvent) { var scale:Number = event.currentTarget == zoomIn ? 1 : -1; sp.content.scaleX += scale; sp.content.scaleY += scale; sp.update(); } Then I've noticed you are using flex, so surely there must be a a container that will allow you a similar functionality.
