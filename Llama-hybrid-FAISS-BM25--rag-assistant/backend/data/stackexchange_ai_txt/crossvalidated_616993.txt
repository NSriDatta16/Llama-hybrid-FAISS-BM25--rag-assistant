when reporting odds ratios should you include R-squared values?

I'm reporting odds ratios for a logistic regression. I'm including p-values but it doesn't include R-squared as elsewhere , it says that "Odds Ratios and Log(Odds Ratios) are like R-Squared". Is this correct, should you add e.g. McFadden R^2^ to odds ratio results?
