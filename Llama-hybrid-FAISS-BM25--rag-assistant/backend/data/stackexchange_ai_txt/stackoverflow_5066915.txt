Rails recover from invalid form?

I have a Rails 2.3 application. I currently have the following validations in my model: validates_presence_of :jobno, :companyname I have the following controller: # POST /kases # POST /kases.xml def create @company = Company.find(params[:kase][:company_id]) @kase = @company.kases.create!(params[:kase]) respond_to do |format| UserMailer.deliver_makeakase("EMAILADDRESS", "Highrise", @kase) if params[:sendtohighrise] UserMailer.deliver_makeakaseteam("EMAILADDRESS", "Highrise", @kase) if params[:notify_team_of_creation] @kase.delay.create_freeagent_project(current_user) if params[:send_to_freeagent] #flash[:notice] = 'Case was successfully created.' flash[:notice] = fading_flash_message("Case was successfully created.", 5) end format.html { redirect_to(@kase) } format.xml { render :xml => @kase, :status => :created, :location => @kase } end So when you try and create a new record that doesn't contain either a jobno or companyname I correctly get the following error message: ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid in KasesController#create Validation failed: {{errors}} I have read about the recover ability, but I am unsure how/where to use it. I have read a few documents regarding the ability to rescue the content of the form. I am trying to make the form remain in place - with the entered content - but show an error on the form. One of the documents I have read is here http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/RecordInvalid I don't want to log the error, simply inform the user what the problem was so they can try again. Is this possible? Thanks, Danny
