Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32'). Without ruining Dataset

I have a datasheet that is all in Binary but sometimes there are missing cases. In one of the inputs, there is a blank, I don't want to completely remove the whole column because some of the rows have values that maybe could be useful. Example: Column 9 has all data except for Row 15 (random row) which is blank. How can I make my decision Tree without having to remove the whole column or make the data bad (By Averaging). I'm not sure if averaging in the situation is will strengthen the data because it might correlate to a different output.
