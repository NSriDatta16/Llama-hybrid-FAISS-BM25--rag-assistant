What statistics are preserved under aggregation?

If we have a long, high resolution time series, with lots of noise, it often makes sense to aggregate the data to a lower resolution (say, daily to monthly values) to get a better understanding of what's going on, effectively removing some of the noise. I've seen at least one paper that then applies some statistics to the aggregated data, including a $r^2$ for a linear regression on a separate variable. Is that valid? I would have thought that the averaging process would modify the result a fair bit, due to the reduced noise. In general, are some statistics able to be applied to aggregated time series data, and others not? If so, which ones? Ones that are linear combinations, maybe?
