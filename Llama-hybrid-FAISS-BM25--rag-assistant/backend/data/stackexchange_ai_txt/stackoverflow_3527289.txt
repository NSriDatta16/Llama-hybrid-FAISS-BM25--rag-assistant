Pull data from a website into my iphone app

I basically want to make part of my iphone app display schedule within the app, my thought is to make an xml template and then edit the file on the webserver as the schedule changes, then as a user views the file the schedule will load. My question would be what the best way would be to implement this? Just call the URL? I would like to also save the XML (storage) data until user refreshes so it can be views if the device is offline and/or the webserver is down. I'm thinking of using PhoneGap for the schedule page, would that work? Also I'm a very new developer so I'm learning everything as I add it here.
