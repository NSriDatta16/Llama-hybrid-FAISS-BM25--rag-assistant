You have to do a query to your database, asking what've been the last inserted id. You can do this running this query: SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() as lastId Then you get the value as you do with any regular query (because this is a regular query actually). In php there's a function called mysql-insert-id which is more elgant. Good luck!
