PHP code design, structure, pattern ..?

I want to get some input from experienced PHP developers on how to structure code. I feel my applications soon get "dirty" and unorganized. Should I start coding in OO? Should I start using MVC? What about design patterns? What other options are there? How can I organize and structure my application code better (beyond proper indentation and naming)? Links to resources are welcomed :) If I decide to start coding using MVC? Should I use any frameworks or just hand code everything? What is your suggestion.
