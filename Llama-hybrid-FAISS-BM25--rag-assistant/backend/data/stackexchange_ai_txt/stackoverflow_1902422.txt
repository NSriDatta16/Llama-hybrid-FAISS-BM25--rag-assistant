Has anyone done crosshairs that follow the mouse in JFreeChart?

We are using JFreeChart to make XY plots and we have a feature request to do a crosshair that moves along with the mouse and highlights the data point that most closely maps to the x-value of the mouse. You can see a similar example at Google Finance - http://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI,INDEXSP:.INX,INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC . Those Google charts only highlight the current value (we want to do that and also show crosshairs), but they show the live mouse interaction we are looking for. Anyone have any elegant suggestions? Thanks.
