django app organization

I have been reading some django tutorial and it seems like all the view functions have to go in a file called "views.py" and all the models go in "models.py". I fear that I might end up with a lot of view functions in my view.py file and the same is the case with models.py. Is my understanding of django apps correct? Django apps lets us separate common functionality into different apps and keep the file size of views and models to a minimum? For example: My project can contain an app for recipes (create, update, view, and search) and a friend app, the comments app, and so on. Can I still move some of my view functions to a different file? So I only have the CRUD in one single file?
