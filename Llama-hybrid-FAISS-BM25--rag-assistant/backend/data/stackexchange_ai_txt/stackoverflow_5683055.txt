When connecting to Glassfish V3, there is no need to supply any properties to the InitialContext constructor. You can simply use the no-arg constructor. To specify the server name and port, set the -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost and -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort properties on the JVM, respectively. As for the libraries, all you should need to include is the gf-client.jar file. It can be found at $GLASSFISH_HOME/lib. This jar file will automatically include whatever other libraries are needed. For more information, please see http://glassfish.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html#StandaloneRemoteEJB . Although that document addresses using EJBs in a stand-alone client, the same solutions apply to using JMS.
