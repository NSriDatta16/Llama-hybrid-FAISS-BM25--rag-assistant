Change isset('id') to isset($id) . The reason why you were getting 404Not found Not found was because you were concatenating the value of $content to the value of $title . Also, you're code is quite a mess. I took the liberty of cleaning it up a bit: class checkid { public $title; public $content; function status() { $this->title='404'; $this->content='Not found'; } } $checkid=new checkid($url); //$id=0; if(!isset($id)) { $checkid->status(); $title=$checkid->title; $content=$checkid->content; } echo " $title $content ";
