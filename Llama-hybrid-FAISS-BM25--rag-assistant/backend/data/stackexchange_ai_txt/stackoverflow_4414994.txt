How do I get the average string length in mysql?

This: SELECT AVG(LENGTH(string)) FROM BLAH LIMIT 10; ...seems to grind through all results. If I take off the AVG, it's way faster. Is it best to create a subquery like SELECT AVG(len) FROM (SELECT LENGTH(string) as len FROM BLAH LIMIT 10) as herp This also seems slow. I don't want to load it all into php loop through with strlen. I was hoping there was a memory efficient solution.
