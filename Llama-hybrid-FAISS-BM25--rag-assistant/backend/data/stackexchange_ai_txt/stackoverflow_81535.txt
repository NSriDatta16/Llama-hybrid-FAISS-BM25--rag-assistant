Instead of creating a temporary file, filling it up, and then sending a link, you can create a memory buffer, fill it up, and then send that as the response (serve it with mime-type 'text/html'). If you don't want to send page-buffers immediately, you can save them for later in the user's session. If you're worried of taking up too much memory that way, you may want to keep only a certain number of page-buffers around in memory, and write the rest to disk for later retrieval. Using a DB sounds like overkill (after all, there's no relational information involved) - but it would solve the caching problem nicely.
