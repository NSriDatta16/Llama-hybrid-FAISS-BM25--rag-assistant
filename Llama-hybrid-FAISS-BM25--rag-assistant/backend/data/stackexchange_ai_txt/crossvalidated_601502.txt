The original Elo system is based on a normal distribution instead of a logistic distribution ... If this still works, then why would they have switched to the logistic function? There hasn't been a switch. The FIDE uses Elo's original system for which a table is computed. See the Fide handbook . The win-probability (or score,since it includes draws), is computed as $$p(\text{A win from B})= \Phi\left( \frac{\text{Elo}_A - \text{Elo}_B}{200 \cdot \sqrt{2}} \right)$$ For example, a $100$ Elo difference will relate to a $0.6381632$ win probability for the higher valued player. Or $0.64$ as it is in the tables of the FIDE. The use of the logistic function/distribution is a useful trick to make an estimate of the values in the table. Also, several other competitions may be using the logistic function. There is not really a large difference between the two and it is just a practical trick to make computations easy. Would the Elo system still work if we chose a simpler function like this? $$E_A = \frac{R_A}{R_A + R_B} = \frac1{1 + \frac{R_B}{R_A}}$$ The system is arbitrary, so yes this would work as well. However, the computations with a linear Elo scale might be easier. For instance, one could compute an average Elo rating for a pool of chess players and approximated the win probability of a player based on the difference with the average Elo. Another example is that differences in Elo rating are more easier to evaluate. If some top player has rating 13102 and another has a rating 4996, than it is a bit awkward to compute the difference in the level between the players because this involves a division instead of a subtraction. Also, the updating works as a zero sum game. Whenever a player increases by some value $x$ , then another player decreases by a value $x$ . If you would do this for an exponentially increasing score, then the people at the top will be changing their scores only very slowly (in some sense the system does have a way to reduce the speed of changes in scores for high level players, but it does not reduce the speed that much as what would be the case with an exponentially increasing score)
