Geometrically it is the projection of a point onto a line, so AB is perpendicular to the line. $\gamma$ is the shortest Euclidean distance from the point A to the line. $b$ is minus the distance from the origin to the line. If $x_{A}$, resp. $x_{B}$, is the vector from the origin to the point $A$, resp. $B$, then, $$ (x_{A}-x_{B})^{T}\frac{\omega}{||\omega||} = \gamma^{i} $$ In this tutorial you shall find a detailed formulation of those equations and a detailed formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Really worth reading.
