I always create them during development. This is a personal bias though. Following iterative development for example means your code will evolve as the project progresses. Creating UML diagrams up front is therefore a waste of time, as after a while your end result will be nothing like the diagrams you started out with. Even with iterative development, things such as Test-Driven Development do not discourage UML diagrams. During the planning/design process for a story/task, UML diagrams can come in quite handy. However, that's not to say you should blindly write UML for every piece of code you write. In contrast, UML diagrams allow you to express large ideas to other developers in a few simple images. From the diagrams other developers can grasp how the application/components are linked. You're best off using UML diagrams as a tool, rather than a means in my opinion. Having industry experience I can assure you that just because books tell you to write UML/carry out extensive design before writing any code, it very rarely, if at all, works like that.
