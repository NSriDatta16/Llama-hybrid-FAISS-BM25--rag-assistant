People answering legal or licensing questions are not trying to be evasive. But it's hard to answer licensing questions in a way that can be as accurate as the terms spelled out in the license itself. Trying to interpret legal text can expose one to liability if one gets it even slightly wrong (even non-lawyers can be held liable). Many questions about GPL are answered in plain English here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html The Apache License 2.0 ( http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 ) covers terms of redistribution. See for example section 4, paragraph 4. The New BSD License covers terms of redistribution (for both source and binaries) in the second paragaph. That license in particular is quite short, and easy to read. Do not make business decisions without consulting with a legal professional.
