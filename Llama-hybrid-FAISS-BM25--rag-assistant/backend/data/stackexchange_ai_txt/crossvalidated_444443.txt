What is the outcome/coefficient of a LASSO?

A multiple logistic regression yield odds ratios, 95% CI's and p values which I understand. LASSO (logistic) seems to yield deviation and deviation ratios and no p values. I'm not sure how to interpret these at all? I'm using Stata and my call is: lasso logit y x1 x2 x3...xn My output: I have no idea how to interpret this. Am I supposed to take model #42 and run a prediction model (either lasso predictive model or multiple regression) on it to get something that I can interpret?
