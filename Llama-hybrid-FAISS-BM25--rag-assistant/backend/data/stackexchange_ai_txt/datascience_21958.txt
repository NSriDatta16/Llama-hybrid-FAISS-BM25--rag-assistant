One-class classification in Keras using Autoencoders?

I am trying to develop a model based on one-class classification approach. For example, the model should to identify if a given picture contains a cat or not. Keep in mind that my training dataset only contains pictures of cats and nothing else. Sort of like a anomaly detection problem I have seen some suggestions on using autoencoders for unary classification but I couldn't find a concrete example on the net? Can someone point to an implementation of this approach using Keras. Is there any other way to about solving this problem?
