RDF integration with C#

I'm working on a project where i had been asked to do a semantic search. The scenario is a database with a table containing 3 pieces of information, Doctor Name, Patient Name, and Date of Visit. I had been asked to create a form that contains 3 fields: Doctor, Patient and Date. So when a user wants to search for a patient's corresponding doctor or doctors for corresponding patients or their dates, they can just enter any of the fields to retrieve information form the database. I had done the coding in C# using Regular Expressions for string manipulation and information retrieval. But the main task is that the search should work using RDF and URI. Now that I had worked on most part of the coding can someone help me how to create the search using RDF and URI, is there any solution for this, how can I integrate RDF in C#, is there any documentation. But as per my supervisor's requirements he had asked me to build a search that works with RDF, I mean the details of patients (e.g. Patient's Name), Doctor's Name and Date would be in a form of URI which locates the details of patients, doctors and date information in the database so if anyone is trying to search for any information like doctor or patient can just enter their name in the corresponding field and retrieve the information. I'm attaching 2 snapshots of my code for your understanding.

This is the overall idea about my project, can you advice me how this can be done? I would be really grateful to you if someone could help me on this as soon as possible.
