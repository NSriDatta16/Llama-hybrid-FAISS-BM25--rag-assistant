I'm going to assume the quality control team just make a correct/incorrect judgement about each text box. If so, this looks like a good candidate for a straightforward logistic regression model, with text box as one explanatory variable with ten levels, and team member as a second explanatory variable with 150 levels. The response will be one if the entry is wrong, zero if it is right. The estimates for the coefficient for each of the various explanatory variables can then be used to identify which team members and which text boxes have higher error rates. This should then be fed into an algorithm for determining weighting for the future sampling. Weighted sampling is a straightforward technique. You will need some limits on the weighting - you don't want any text box to get below say 1/20 chance of being sampled, or any individual team member to get below 1/500 - so you choose an algorithm that sets those (or some other arbitrary levels) as the minimum for the weighting. Addition If the quality control team make a more nuanced judgement - say a rating on a four point scale from "poor" to "perfect" - then the procedure would be just the same as above but you could use ordinal logistic regression instead. The response variable would be this rating; the explanatory variables would still be the factors for team members and for text boxes. You would still then need to use the estimated sizes of the effects for each level of the factor in an arbitrary algorithm that weights the chance of those text boxes and those users being included in the next sample.
