Un-escaping characters present in recordset that is bound to control in Access 2003

I have some data stored in SQL Server that contains apostrophes. Within the SQL Server table to apostrophe is escaped. For example the phrase "Roberts's thesis" is stored as "Robert''s Thesis". I use Access 2003 as a font end for the application and I use ADO to access the data stored in SQL Server using Stored Procedures. The issue I am having is how to "un-escape" the double apostrophe when the data is retrieved using a recordset and then bound to a control. Here is some sample code. Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection cnn.ConnectionString = myConnectionString cnn.Open Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset Set rs.ActiveConnection = cnn rs.Source = "EXEC uspMyStoredProcedureName" rs.LockType = adLockOptimistic rs.CursorType = adOpenStatic rs.CursorLocation = adUseClient rs.Open Set ListControl.Recordset = rs Set rs = Nothing Set cnn = Nothing Do I have to "loop" through the recordset manually and un-escape the apostrophe? Thank you.
