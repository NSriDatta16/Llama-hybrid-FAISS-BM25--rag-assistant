Richard, the problem is that drag and drop is not as simple operation as you have coded here. Here you haven't started the drag movement which should start with code and you can read more about it here... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.dodragdrop(v=VS.90).aspx If you just want to move the PictureBox... dragging picturebox inside winform on runtime And finally Drag and Drop between Instances of the same Windows Forms Application Hope this helps.
