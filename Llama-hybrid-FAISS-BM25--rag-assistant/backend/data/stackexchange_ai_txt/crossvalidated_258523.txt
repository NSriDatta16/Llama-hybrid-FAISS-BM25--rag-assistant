Can you calculate the Area under the ROC curve (or C-statistic) using logistic regression from case control data?

I know you can estimate odds ratios based on logistic regression of case control data because the baseline risks cancel out. Does this mean that only the intercept is contaminated by the analysis of case control data in logistic regression? And furthermore, does this mean that the predictions are all off by the same fixed constant (additive on the logistic scale; multiplicative on the probability scale) so that you can still maintain the proper ordering? If the answer is "yes", doesn't that mean you can still calculate the AUC (C-statistic) because all it relies on is the proper ordering of the predicted values? Thank you
