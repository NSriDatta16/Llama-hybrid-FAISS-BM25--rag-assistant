How to transform query?

i have an sql query that has one unnamed column as a list of strings. my hbm is declared as follows: exec Diagram_Subscriptions:contactId my repository method: IQuery query = Session.GetNamedQuery("GetDiagramSubscriptions") .SetInt32("contactId", contactId) .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()); return query.List (); this doesn't work because type string doesn't have a setter. i don't want to declare a mapping class just for this one column. is there a way to transform this to a Tuple or something?
