The cause of the problem was setting a value to the key "User-Agent" in the NSUserDefaults dictionary. I wanted to specify my own User-Agent to uniquely identify my iOS app. But somehow setting this value caused the problem above. When I simply renamed this key to "OKCTC-User-Agent" the error was immediately resolved. I did log an issue on the GitHub site for the Facebook-IOS-SDK . Hopefully this will help others who have encountered similar problems.
