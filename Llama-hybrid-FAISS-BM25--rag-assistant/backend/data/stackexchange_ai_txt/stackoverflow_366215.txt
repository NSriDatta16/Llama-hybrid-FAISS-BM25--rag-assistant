I pick up the following keywords from your question: Object Oriented (modeling and programming), building desktop applications, building web application and database design. Because you didn't mention any specific language, it's very difficult to make a recommendation for you. So I pretend I'm the one asking the question and knowing me, I recommend to myself : OO: Thinking in C++ or thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel. Building desktop applications: Ultimate++ and web applications development: http://www.djangoproject.com/ Database: I don't have any good recommendation. My rational for making the above recommendations: I don't want to recommend a dozen books or more. You won't have to read them all. The "Thinking" books by Bruce Eckel can cover major OO concepts as you wouldn't have any problem picking up a new language since it's just a matter of syntax. Ultimate++ can produces leanest desktop applications and they use templates very agressively, resulting in very elegant codes. The other advantage for using U++ over something like MFC, WPF, java Swing Java SWT, Python, etc is that your executable do not have any baggage or dependencies. It won't require your users to install a JRE, .NET framework, MFC DLLs, or Python, etc. That's my choice, therefore I make that recommendation. Django because I know and like Python and I don't know Ruby very well. Ruby experts would say RubyOnRails or C# experts would say ASP MVC. Java might says Struts, JSF, Stripes, but I don't think Java has anything that can compete against frameworks from Python, Ruby, C#, or even PHP these days.
