High value of B is a matter of concern or not?

I want to ask if the higher value of B is a matter of concern for the health of the hierarchical logistic regression model or not? I have a categorical variable and for two of the categories, I have got a B value +20 and another one is -22 for which the respective exp(B) are approx. 1070563626 and the other is 0.000.
