Opengl version trouble glew.h

I am developing an OpenG L application and need to use the glew library. I am using Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express . I compiled a program using gl.h, glu.h, and glut.h just fine and it does what it's supposed to do. But after including glew.h it still compiles just fine, but when I try: glewInit(); if (glewIsSupported("GL_VERSION_2_0")) printf("Ready for OpenGL 2.0\n"); else { printf("OpenGL 2.0 not supported\n"); } It keeps printing: "OpenGL 2.0 not supported". I tried to change it to glewIsSupported("GL_VERSION_1_3") or even glewIsSupported("GL_VERSION_1_0") and it still returns false meaning that it does not support OpenGL version whatever. I have a Radeon HD 5750 so, it should support OpenGL 3.1 and some of the features of 3.2. I know that all the device drivers are installed properly since I was able to run all the programs in the Radeon sdk provided by ATI. I also installed Opengl Extensions Viewer 3.15 and it says OpenGL Version 3.1 Ati Driver 6.14.10.9116. I tired all of them GLEW_VERSION_1_1 , GLEW_VERSION_1_2 , GLEW_VERSION_1_3 , GLEW_VERSION_2_0 , GLEW_VERSION_2_1 , GLEW_VERSION_3_0 and all of these return false. Any other suggestioms? I even tried GLEW_ARB_vertex_shader && GLEW_ARB_fragment_shader and this is returning false as well.
