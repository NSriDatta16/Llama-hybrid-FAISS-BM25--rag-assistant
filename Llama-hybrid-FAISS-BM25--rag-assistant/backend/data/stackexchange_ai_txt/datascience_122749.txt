BERT is a supervised learning or semi-supervised learning?

I use 'bert-base-cased' pre-trained model for encoding a dataset of text that was labeled to labels 0, 1. Then the encoded dataset is trained using BERT model imported from Transformer library. Does it supervised learning or semi-supervised?
