In C# object is just a type name referring to System.Object . In F#, you can either use this full .NET name or a type alias obj . Now, regarding a field declaration - there are various ways to write that depending on the context. Also, it is a good practice to initialize all fields in F#, so it would be useful to see larger context of your code. However, you may write this: type A() = let mutable (myInnerObj:obj) = null This creates a private field myInnerObj of type System.Object initialized to null , which is mutable can can be assigned later ( myInnerObj , for example). I used example with private field, because public fields are generally discouraged in .NET.
