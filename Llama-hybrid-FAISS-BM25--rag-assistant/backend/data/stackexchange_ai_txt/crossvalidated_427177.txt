For time series AR model given by (...) Show that equivalent representations are :(...)

I'm supposed to show that for an AR model given by y(t) = a0 + a1*y(t-1)+ Et we have equivalent representation in (y(t)-average(y)) = a1(y(t-1)-average(y)) where average(y) is the unconditional mean of the y(t) series I have no idea how to even start? Up until now I've just been solving some normal time series with homogenous and particular solution.
