Rank players of any given sport

I've recently become interested in possibly of developing some sort of method for ranking athletes of sports such as American football and determining which players are better than others in terms of specific statistics. My thoughts are that there are two ways to go about doing this. The first would be some sort of mathematical formula which would take in the statistics of a given player and provide some sort of standardized score which could be compared with other players to determine which is better. My other idea would be to have some machine learning algorithm go through historical data and determine the patterns which indicate how well a certain combination of statistics would perform in the following week of play by using the patterns it recognizes over time. I'm not sure which approach would be more effective and so I'm hoping that someone has an idea or any advice as to which would be best to look into. Thanks!
