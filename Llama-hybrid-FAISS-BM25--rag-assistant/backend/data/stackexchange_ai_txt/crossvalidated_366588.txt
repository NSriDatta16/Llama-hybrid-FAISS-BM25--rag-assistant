Should one binarize qualitative variables before applying a random forest?

On which of theses two kinds of sample would a Random Forest (and more precisely sklearn RandomForest algorithm) give the best results ? (Y and other_features are continuous numerical variables, and the "cat_variable" modalities are not unbalanced). Y | other_features | cat_variable ...| ... | A ...| ... | B ...| ... | B ...| ... | B ...| ... | C ...| ... | A Y | other_features | is_A | is_B | is_C | ...| ... | 1 | 0 | 0 | ...| ... | 0 | 1 | 0 | ...| ... | 0 | 1 | 0 | ...| ... | 0 | 1 | 0 | ...| ... | 0 | 0 | 1 | ...| ... | 1 | 0 | 0 | My question intend to be quite general : I'm looking for the best practice, and I want to know if binarizing categorical variables has an interest. If this is still unclear, I would be pleased if you explain me why.
