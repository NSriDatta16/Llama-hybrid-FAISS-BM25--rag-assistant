Are there benefits to using LDAP for Auth for a single application?

I worked on a project a while back where the Architect decided to use LDAP for managing authentication / authorization, rather than a traditional database approach. The application was expected to scale rapidly by approx 500 - 1000 users a day, and then plateau at around 200k users. Beyond that, there was nothing special about this application. I didn't ask at the time, but I'm curious around why we would've used LDAP here. As I understand it, the real strengths of LDAP lie in organizations where users are required to authenticate against several disconnected systems, and LDAP provides a single auth provider. Are there additional benefits that make it a good fit for certain applications?
