Multilevel logistic regression for 3 by 3 factorial design? Sparse matrix problem

For the sake of example, letâ€™s say this is a costumer research study. I have a binary outcome (x) that is either making a purchase or not making it. I have three independent variables: store decoration (A), interaction with customer (B), price (C). Each variable has three levels: store decoration: high level decoration, medium level decoration, no decoration interaction with customer: friendly interaction, minimal interaction, no interaction price: high price, medium price, low price This gives me a total of 27 conditions. I have run the study on one participant using a virtual simulation, with a total of 27 trials (one trial per condition). These are the results (I am using r): A What is the best way to analyze this data? Should I use a multilevel logistic regression since the outcome is binary? I am concerned that the data is too sparse. How to get more data? If I had more than one participant, could I collate them in the matrix? Or is the right way to go to run more trials? The problem is that with a matrix so sparse I am afraid I would have to run a ton of trials.
