Basically PCA finds new variables which are linear combinations of the original variables such that in the new space, the data has fewer dimensions. Think of a data set consisting of the points in 3 dimensions on the surface of a flat plate held up at an angle. In the original x, y, z axes you need 3 dimensions to represent the data, but with the right linear transformation, you only need 2. Basically what @Joel said, but only linear combinations of the input variables.
