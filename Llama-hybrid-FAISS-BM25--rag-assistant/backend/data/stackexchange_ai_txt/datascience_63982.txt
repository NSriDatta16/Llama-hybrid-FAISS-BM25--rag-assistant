There are several different types of categorical data. For example, the severity of trauma or psychological scale is not categorical by nature: there is a latent continuous feature that was converted to discrete. In such a case described quantification is absolutely reasonable. For the non-ordered (nominal) attributes (for example, country or ethnicity) any quantification mostly meaningless and really can create bias and introduce artificial order. For the discussed database most of the attributes were ordinal. Two nominal attributes were helpless in any coding: we tested dummy coding and CatPCA based coding. Really, as Erwan wrote, each time it is necessary to analyze variables and then decide how to encode it.
