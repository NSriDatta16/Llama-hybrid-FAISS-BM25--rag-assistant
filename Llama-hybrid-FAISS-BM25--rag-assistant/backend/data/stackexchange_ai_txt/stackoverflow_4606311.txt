Well, you might not have a need TODAY to query to find out things like: What is the average number of bathrooms in a home in Ohio? Where do homes have more bedrooms? The East Coast or the West Coast? How does house price correlate with the size of the master bedroom? What would be the average dollar value return of increasing the master bedroom size by 30%? etc, etc. You will be in a much better position in the future if you design your foundation correctly to begin with... no matter how enticing the short-cut may seem right now. Plus, with a separate ROOMS table, you will be able to add additional room fields that make sense later (like width/height, color, floor level, etc.) which would all be very hard if the data were just globbed into a single field. People will want to query in unexpected ways, like: I have bad knees. Can you list houses with the master bedroom and master bathroom on the first floor? In general, having a ROOMS table will just make your application more powerful, and easier to use. Hey, I get what you're saying about "overly normalized data". We've all been there, and it DOES bite. However, having a ROOMS table in a database with housing info isn't being "overly normalized". It's just building the app the right way.
