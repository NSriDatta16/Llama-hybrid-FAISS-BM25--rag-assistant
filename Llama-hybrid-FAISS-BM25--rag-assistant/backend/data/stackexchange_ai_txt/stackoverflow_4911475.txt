The problem was that XCode was showing me a warning: warning: no rule to process file '$(PROJECT_DIR)/html/orientation.js' of type sourcecode.javascript for architecture i386 This answer contains the solution. Basically, I had to tell XCode to not try and build the JavaScript files, and manually drag them to the "Copy Bundle Resources" directory.
