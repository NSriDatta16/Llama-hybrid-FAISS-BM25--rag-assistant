This is a classification task. Classification is an enormous field. You might want to start with Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs), which have the advantage of being easy to understand and explain. Plus, they are implemented in pretty much every ML or statistics package, such as R. If you have thoroughly understood CARTs, you might want to look at Random Forests, which generalize CARTs and perform quite well across different classification tasks . In any case, be sure to tell your system what kind of data you have. For instance, your word is numerically encoded, but I strongly suspect that it is actually categorical. Same for your target classification.
