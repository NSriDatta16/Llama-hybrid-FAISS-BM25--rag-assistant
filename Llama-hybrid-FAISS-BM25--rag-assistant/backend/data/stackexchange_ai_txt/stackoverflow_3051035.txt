DNS dig command line tool returns "status: SERVFAIL". should I be worried?

Background: I've setup a site on Squarespace, got a domain on domain.com, used domain.com's DNS manager to create CNAME for squarespace (like they recommend). I changed the nameservers yesterday to slicehost (a failed experiment) and back to domain.com's tonight. Now when I run a dig, I get the following: ; > DiG 9.6.0-APPLE-P2 > veganhopeworkshop.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER Does the "status: SERVFAIL" indicate anything wrong about my configuration?
