winform application exception DragDrop occurs outside of IDE

My winform application is failing when run outside of the IDE with a dragdrop exception. The error does not occur while being run from inside the ide (VS2008). How can I trace this. I have seen mention of using JIT in the error box that is displayed post error - will this help me trace my problem?
