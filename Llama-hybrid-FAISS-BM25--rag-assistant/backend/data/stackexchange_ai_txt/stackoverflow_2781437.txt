Done properly, java/scala cloud deployment can be as painless as "regular" deployment. Also bear in mind that Scala effectively deploys as though it were Java + a library, so any java-centric cloud solutions will be available to you (GWT, EC2, etc.) I'd strongly recommend that you check out Stax if you want to go this route (and I strongly encourage you to do so). I've already started using it for a couple of Scala applications (one using lift). They're backed by EC2 and actually use Scala internally. Deployment and testing is a piece of cake too.
