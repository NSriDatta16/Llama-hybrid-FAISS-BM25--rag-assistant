I think the simple answer to your question is that a model is the best way to incorporate the aspects of Approach 1 and Approach 2 into a unified framework which allows for consistent statements to be made across the attributes. The model could be machine learning, statistical, or Bayesian and could be supervised or unsupervised. You should specify the outcome you want, then pick the best model. E.g. I want to rank attributes according to their statistical effect on revenue (generalized linear model) I want to create linear combinations of attributes maximize the variance explained and then look at the contributions to each dimension (principle components) I want to rank attributes according to their importance to some classification exercise (random forest)
