Can I use precompile symbol to determine which code fragment would be compiled when I switching target framework in Visual Studio

We can switch to different .NET Framework target in Visual Studio after 2008. I have a project, and I want to build 2 different target Frameworks assembly of it. If my target Framework is 2.0, I want it to build some code, and when I switch to another target Framework, I want it to build another code fragment to use some new functions. now I have to manually comment and uncomment code everywhere, I wonder if I can use some precompile symbols to dynamically do this to me. Like: #if Framework3 #else #endif Can I?
