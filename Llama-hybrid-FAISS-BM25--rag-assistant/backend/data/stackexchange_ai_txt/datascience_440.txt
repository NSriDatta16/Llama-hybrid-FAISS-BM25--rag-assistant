The word2vec algorithm may be a good way to retrieve more elements for a list of similar words. It is an unsupervised "deep learning" algorithm that has previously been demonstrated with Wikipedia-based training data (helper scripts are provided on the Google code page). There are currently C and Python implementations. This tutorial by Radim Řehůřek , the author of the Gensim topic modelling library , is an excellent place to start. The "single topic" demonstration on the tutorial is a good example of retreiving similar words to a single term (try searching on 'red' or 'yellow'). It should be possible to extend this technique to find the words that have the greatest overall similarity to a set of input words.
