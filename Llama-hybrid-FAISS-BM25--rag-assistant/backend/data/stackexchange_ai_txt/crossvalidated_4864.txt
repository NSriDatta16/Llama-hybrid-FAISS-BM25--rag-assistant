I know your question is about logistic regression and as it is a homework assignment so your approach may be constrained. However, if your interest is in interactions and accuracy of classification, it might be interesting to use something like CART to model this. Here's some R code to do produce the basic tree. I've set rpart loose on the enire data frame here. Perhaps not the best approach without some prior knowledge and a cross validation method: library(foreign) df I'm not sure right off how to produce the classifcation table. It shouldn't be too hard from the predicted values from the model object and the original values. Anyone have any tips here?
