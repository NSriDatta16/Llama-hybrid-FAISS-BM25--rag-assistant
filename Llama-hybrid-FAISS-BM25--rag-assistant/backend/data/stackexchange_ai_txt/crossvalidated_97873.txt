Correlate 3 vectors that are sampled from 3 different distributions

I have three vectors with sampled values in MATLAB, each from a specific probability distribution. (The vectors contain time series data of the growth rate of retail prices of specific goods) %pearsrnd(mu,sigma,skew,kurt,m,n) commodity1=pearsrnd(0.005,0.085,0.237,7.899,1,600); commodity2=pearsrnd(0.003,0.040,0.280,5.630,1,600); commodity3=pearsrnd(0.006,0.139,-0.207,4.209,1,600); However, I want to add two correlation to the data. Specifically, the correlation between commodity 1 and commodity 3 should be 0.135, the correlation between commodity 2 and 3 should be 0.115. How can I solve this most easily?
