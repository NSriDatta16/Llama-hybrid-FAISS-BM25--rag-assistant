Which design is most appropriate?

I have data from an experiment testing a new treatment. Each subject has 4 data points, 2 of the new treatment and 2 of the control. It is like a paired analysis, but instead having 1 observation of treatment and 1 of control, I have 2 of each. Which design is it (complete block, ....). How should I analyze this data ? A mixed model (response is continuous) ? How bad will it be if I average the 2 of each treatment per each subject ?
