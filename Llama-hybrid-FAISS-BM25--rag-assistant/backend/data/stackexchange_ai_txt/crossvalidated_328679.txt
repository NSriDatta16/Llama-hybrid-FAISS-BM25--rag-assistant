The irony in the statement is almost too thick to parse. Given the title of the text, I'm assuming some tongue-in-cheek was intended. However, your "gut" saying that this is wrong is probably on the right track, if intuition counts for anything. Unfortunately, a lot of scientific reporting eludes intuition when dealing with concepts we haven't encountered. It is possible that, when measuring an association between $X$ and $Y$, the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is 1.0 in 20% of the population, and 0 in the remaining 80%. The net effect is that overall the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ is 0.2. We see this all the time in pharmacoepidemiology: an experimental drug is deemed "effective" if on average there is a positive benefit; many drugs in common circulation, some of which you could be taking, may harm you because of interactions with your behavior or genetics, but nobody actually knows this. The above is but one possible interpretation of a correlation of 0.2; it is extremely far-fetched because so few things in life have a correlation of either 1 or 0, and fewer things still have effect modification strong enough to produce such discrepant correlations.
