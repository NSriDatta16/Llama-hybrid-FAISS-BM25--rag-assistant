If you are a little more careful and explicit in your formulas, it might well get a lot clearer. Specifically, one typically calculates means or sums over forecasts and actuals for the same periods (as opposed, say, to calculating the MAD over the forecast horizon, but the mean of actuals over the training sample). And then both the numerator and the denominator have the same number of summands, say $N$ . But then the sums you have yield the exact same ratio as dividing the means instead - because going from the sums to averages only means that we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $N$ , and this cancels. Some more on this can be found in Kolassa & Sch√ºtz (2007) .
