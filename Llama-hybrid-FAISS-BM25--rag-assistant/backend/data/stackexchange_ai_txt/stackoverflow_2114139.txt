Conditional popup box in vb.net & asp.net

I'm working on a piece of code at the moment that allows the user to enter values into fields. Once the user clicks on the 'save' button I am checking those fields against certain conditions (essentially calling a bunch of stored procedures to assess the values). If any of these 'rules' are met, I need to generate a popup that informs the user that certain values need to be fixed before they can continue for some of the conditions, and for others just to inform them of what conditions may need their attention. The main thing I need help with is, how do I generate a popup box in my codebehind if the conditions are met?
