I feel like this question is 6 questions... and would be better suited for https://serverfault.com/ https://serverfault.com/about But to answer you... Register your domain. Find a host that is not rated as "unlimited" They will cut you off as soon as you use more than X amount of space and bandwidth. I prefer ruby on rails, I like it better than PHP, and if you don't know either, I'd start with that. But PHP does have more code available for use. If I were you, going into making a website you know nothing about... I would partner with someone experienced than can guide you. If you don't know what you're doing, you're doomed. Site can get hacked, bandwidth overage, outages if you use a wrong DB, etc.
