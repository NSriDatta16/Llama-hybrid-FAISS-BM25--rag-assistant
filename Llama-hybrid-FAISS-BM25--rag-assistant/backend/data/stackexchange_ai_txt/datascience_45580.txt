Effect of adding gaussian noise to the input layer in a CNN

I often come across Keras code that adds GaussianNoise to the input, however its not clear to me what advantages does it offer to the learning. input_img = layers.Input(t_x.shape[1:], name = 'RGB_Input') pp_in_layer = layers.GaussianNoise(GAUSSIAN_NOISE)(input_img)
