Android CheckBox with right-aligned checking button/box

I am fairly new to Android (find it most fun, btw) and I was wondering... How can I create an Android CheckBox with the label to the left and the checking button/box aligned to the right (pretty much a switch of the way this widget is drawn by default)? Like the way a checkbox preference normally looks like... I am looking for the most elegant/short-coded version possible, if there is one. I mean other than creating your own View/ViewGroup with layouts, empty-labeled CheckBoxes and TextViews, etc... Thanks & Regards,
