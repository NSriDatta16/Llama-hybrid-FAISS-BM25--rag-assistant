A couple of recommendations: Yes, auto.arima() will account for explanatory variables. It fits a regression on the explanatory variables with ARIMA errors. ( Note that this is not an ARIMAX model. ) Of course, the problem is that you will need to forecast the explanatory variables themselves - here, series B. I hope that you are accounting for this in your holdout tests! That is, when calculating holdout forecasts for A, you should be using forecasted values from B, not the actual values, which would not be available in a "production" environment. Otherwise, you will overestimate the accuracy of your forecasts for A. You may be able to leverage how your series are "linked". Look at Rob Hyndman's work on hierarchical time series and the hts package for R. You may be able to get better forecasts by treating your two series as a small hierarchy. Finally, if series B improves forecast accuracy for A, this may actually only mean that B is a proxy for the trend and seasonality that drive both series. So I'd encourage you to do some holdout testing for A also with models that only use trend and seasonality, not series B. Check whether B truly improves holdout forecasts for A over and beyond accounting for trend and seasonality "normally".
