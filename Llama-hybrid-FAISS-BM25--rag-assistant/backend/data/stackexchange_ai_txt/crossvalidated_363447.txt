I'm working with PCA coefficients now and probably you're done with your project by now but I think this might be helpful to others. In PCA the higher dimensions present less deviation from the axis, so discarding them does not loos as much information. Nonetheless the distance of the points are not maintained but the order of the distances will be the same as on average the dimension you are truncating represents less distance than any dimension before it.
