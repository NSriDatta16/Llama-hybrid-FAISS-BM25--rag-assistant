Variance inflation factor

I am trying out VIF in order to reduce the number of variables, by removing highly collinear variables. I will be using VIF in R, but before applying it, does my time series need to be stationary?I cant seem to find a list of its prerequisites. I am currently using principal component analysis and I want to cross it with VIF.
