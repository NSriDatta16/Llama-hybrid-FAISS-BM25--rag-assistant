The standard answer is to use packages -- see the Writing R Extensions manual as well as different tutorials on the web. It gives you a quasi-automatic way to organize your code by topic strongly encourages you to write a help file, making you think about the interface a lot of sanity checks via R CMD check a chance to add regression tests as well as a means for namespaces. Just running source() over code works for really short snippets. Everything else should be in a package -- even if you do not plan to publish it as you can write internal packages for internal repositories. As for the 'how to edit' part, the R Internals manual has excellent R coding standards in Section 6. Otherwise, I tend to use defaults in Emacs' ESS mode . Update 2008-Aug-13: David Smith just blogged about the Google R Style Guide .
