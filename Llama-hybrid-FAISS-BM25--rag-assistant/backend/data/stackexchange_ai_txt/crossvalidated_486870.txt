How to manually inflate standard errors to approximate clustered SEs

I'm reading a handout on clustering here It's not clear to me how to compute $\rho_x$ or $\rho_\epsilon$ . What is meant by within-cluster correlation of the regression, or within-cluster error correlation? By way of example, let's say I have the following robust specification: library(estimatr) lm_robust(points ~ my_sex + partner_sex, cluster = team_id, se = "stata", data = data) Where I'm clustering at the "team" level and the average team size is 2. In this case, what is or ?
