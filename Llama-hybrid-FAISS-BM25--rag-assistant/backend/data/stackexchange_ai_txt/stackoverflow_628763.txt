A wiki is much more likely to be used than a bunch of word docs simply because it is quicker and easier to find an entry to edit or create a new page than a bunch of word docs will ever be! The question then becomes which wiki Almost any wiki is better than the SharePoint wiki, that one is beyond a joke Screwturn is excellent, has ACLs and WYSIWYG in v3, and is very easy to extend e.g. Using the XSLT plugin is great for embedding the output of server processes, CI builds, tests, source control stats etc e.g. We have a OLEDB plugin that reads critical values out of various company databases and embeds them into pages describing what the data is and what values it should have. We have one master page that lists all the pages that have data outside of prescribed ranges. Sort of a blend of FIT and a systems monitoring tool If you have a management possition on "everything" has to be in SharePoint, then there are Screwturn plugins that render out the Screwturn pages as PDF, HTML, xml etc (you can convert to docx then) and have a script to dump changed screwturn pages each night to SharePoint for searching and "management" purposes
