Repeated measures ANOVA and uneven number of trials

Suppose I have multiple responses from each subject in three different conditions (A, B, C). If I would decide to run a repeated measures ANOVA, I would first average over the repetitions from each subject and then run the analysis on these averages (one average per subject per condition). However, am I still right to run a repeated measures ANOVA if, for instance, condition C has less repetitions per subject than the other two conditions? The straightforward solution would be to use linear mixed models, but I would still like to know if it is "legit" to use repeated measures ANOVA.
