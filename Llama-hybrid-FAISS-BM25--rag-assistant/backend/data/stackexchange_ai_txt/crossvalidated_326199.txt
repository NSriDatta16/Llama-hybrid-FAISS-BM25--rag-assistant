You must realize that there is much money spent in medicine. Hospitals are usually large businesses so they can afford smart people to lead the business. Medicine attracts smart people, so a large number of really smart people have thought a lot about how to reduce death rates and accidents and using medication. Do not expect anybody around a hospital to be impressed just because you use a computer or R or statistics or machine learning. Then, on the other side, yes: Smart people in hospitals do good things with computers, including with R. Learning about statistics, about machine learning and about R would be a good first step, aside from learning about economics, nursing and medicine, to go in the direction you aspire. A good introduction to R is the book by Andy Field and colleagues. If you type "bioinformatics" into Amazon, you will see that there is lots of information to be soaked up. The best advice will surely be: Lay a good foundation, i.e., learn your math, learn your Frequentist as well as Bayesian statistics, learn as much as you can about the field you are investigating. You cannot know beforehand which part of math will be important for your work later.
