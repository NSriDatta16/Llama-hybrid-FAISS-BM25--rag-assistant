you can test your own xpath expression and refine it until you get your desired result, there are plenty of XPATH testers online, for example here is one: http://www.whitebeam.org/library/guide/TechNotes/xpathtestbed.rhtm just go there, paste your xml fragment from above and work with XPATH untill you get what you need.
