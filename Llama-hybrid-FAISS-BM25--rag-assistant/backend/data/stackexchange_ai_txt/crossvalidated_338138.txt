How does an individual tree in a random forest misclassify ?

I'm trying to understand how ensemble voting works for random forest. I have two sources of confusion. Let's say I have a single decision tree from a random forest built on a subset of the data. Does it misclassify because, for instance, it was built on features that have no real association with the thing we're trying to classify? Where does this misclassification come from? Is it from the out of bag sample that is withheld from the subset (i.e. the 36.8%) used to construct that particular tree? Thank you
