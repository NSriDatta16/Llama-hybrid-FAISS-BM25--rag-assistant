Answering my own question a year later after the system is in production. Following @George Savva's suggestions we looked at a number of different smoothed fits. We eventually decided on LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing). However we only want to smooth when the error for the specific point is high. To accommodate this we took the average value at the points when statistical error was low and the loess value when the error was high. To move from one value to the other smoothly we used the Gauss error function (ie ERF()) to interpolate. The ERF() is a turn on curve which is 0 at low values and 1 at high values. We used the statistical error passed through the ERF() to give the fraction of LOESS to use. The parameters in the ERF() were tuned by hand.
