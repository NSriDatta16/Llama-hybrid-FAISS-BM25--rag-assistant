A framework can be particularly valuable if you intend on handing the code off to someone else. Whatever framework you choose, you'll introduce a common set of expected relationships from which someone can build an understanding of the codebase. If the view logic is largely sequential, or at least modal, an easy non-framework mode of organization is to group your views into "pages" and have a single controller manage which page is on-stage at a time and feed in model data from wherever.
