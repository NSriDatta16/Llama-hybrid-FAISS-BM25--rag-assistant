Embedding IWebbrowser2 ATL interface control in C# windows mobile smart device application

We have developed an ATL smart device project for to save the web page locally in windows mobile device. The application uses native IWebbrowser2 ATL interface control to browse the web page and save the web page complete. Now we need to have our UI and other user interface controls to be designed and developed using C# also we have some UI module already available in C#. So please provide us a method to embed native IWebbrowser2 ATL interface control to the C# smart device project.
