What NN architecture to use for documents OCR?

I recently go interested in document OCR and would like to gather some opinions on what NN to use. I wonder if there are any proven examples that I can exploit? I have heard of CNN+LSTM+CTC is good as an end-to-end model, but it's not easy to implement using Keras (I'm very new to the world of AI), so I wonder if there any easier models to use or even models that are available on the get-go?
