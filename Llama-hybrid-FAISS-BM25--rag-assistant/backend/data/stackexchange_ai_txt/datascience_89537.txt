Performing anomalie detection on a battery volatge using LSTM-RNN

I am trying to detect anomalies in a battery output voltage for one month. I have the next data frame, as it is shown the data is collected each minute for each day so I have almost 1420 sample per day. Should I use the 'time' or the 'date' column in my time series analysis? I could not find an example like my situation all dataframes I found looks like the next : It is all about a unique value for each day. Please any help is appreciated! Thank you in advance!
