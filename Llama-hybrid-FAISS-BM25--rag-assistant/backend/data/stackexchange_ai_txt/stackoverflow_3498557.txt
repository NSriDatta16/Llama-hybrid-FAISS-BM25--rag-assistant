Typically, the easiest way to organize your app is to start a new instance of an activity for each new view. In your case, you might have one base activity that has a list of all of the questions. Your ShowQuestionActivity takes in a question and list of answer choices via intent extras. BaseActivity starts ShowQuestionActivity for result with the first question. When the user clicks on an answer, ShowQuestionActivity finishes. It can pass the answer back with an extra. BaseActivity immediately starts ShowQuestionActivity for result with the second question. To the user, this will appear as if you just moved from one question to the next smoothly. Alternatively, you can have each ShowQuestionActivity start the next ShowQuestionActivity, but then you need to keep track of which question to show, and all of the answers via intents.
