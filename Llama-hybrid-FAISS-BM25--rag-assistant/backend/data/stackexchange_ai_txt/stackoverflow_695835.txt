Just because there's code coverage doesn't mean you're actually testing all paths through the function. For example, this code has four paths: if (A) { ... } else { ... } if (B) { ... } else { ... } However just two tests (e.g. one with A and B true, one with A and B false) would give "100% code coverage." This is a problem because the tendency is to stop testing once you've achieved the magic 100% number.
