Since MobileMe stores certificates and public/private keys in the keychain, you can use security find-identity -v To generate a list of valid identities, from where you can extract the MobileMe username out of the identity with (MobileMe Sharing Certificate) in its name. To do this, I could only come up with this working, albeit ugly solution that uses sed to print the characters between the double quotes and awk to print only the username: security find-identity -v | grep MobileMe | sed -n 's/\(.*\)\"\(.*\)\"\(.*\)/\2/p' | awk '{print $1}' (If someone finds a more elegant solution for this, IÂ´d be happy to hear!)
