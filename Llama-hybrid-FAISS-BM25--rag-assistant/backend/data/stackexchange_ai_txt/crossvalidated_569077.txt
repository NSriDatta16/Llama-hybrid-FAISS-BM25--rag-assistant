Not sure about important papers, but there's the obvious traditional conjugate Bayesian updating option (using a Dirichlet prior for the multinomial parameters). In the binomial case there's of course a direct match between using different Beta priors (a $\text{Beta}(1,0)$ and $\text{Beta}(0,1)$ for the upper and lower limits to get exact binomial confidence intervals, but I'm not sure whether there's a directly corresponding approach for the multinomial. However, a Jeffreys $\text{Beta}(0.5, 0.5)$ prior often performs pretty similar to that, too. The Jeffreys prior for the Multinomial is a $\text{Dirichlet}(0.5, \ldots, 0.5)$ distribution. After observing $y_c$ items falling into categories $c=1,\ldots,C$ , the posterior distribution is then given by $\text{Dirichlet}(0.5+y_1, 0.5+y_2, \ldots, 0.5+y_C)$ . If you are then interested in any particular multinomial proport, the marginal distribution for it is just a Beta distribution. E.g. if you are interested in proportion $c$ , then it's marginal distribution is a $\text{Beta}(0.5+y_c, \sum_{i\neq c} (0.5+y_i))$ distribution. If you need any more unusual transformations of the proportions, you can always sample from the Dirichlet posterior, do the transformations to the samples, et voil√† you've got posterior samples for the transformations of these proportions. If you need things like covariate adjustments, you can use Bayesian nominal / multinomial regression (e.g. in R the brms package covers this nicely) with similar nice properties for the posterior samples.
