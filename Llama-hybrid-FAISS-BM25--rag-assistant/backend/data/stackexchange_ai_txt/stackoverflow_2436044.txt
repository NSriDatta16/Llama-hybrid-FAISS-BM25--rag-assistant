jquery ui drag and drop + ajax problem

I'm making board game and i'm using jquery ui draggable effect for figures. On drag start I send ajax request to other page where I generate droppable places soo the figure can be drag and droped only on those particular places, but the problem is I must move figure twice to take effect. Does anyone know how to solve this problem? I would be very grateful for help. here is a sample $(".draggable2").draggable({ revert: 'invalid', start: function(event, ui) { var droppable_areas = ""; for(var i = 0; i });
