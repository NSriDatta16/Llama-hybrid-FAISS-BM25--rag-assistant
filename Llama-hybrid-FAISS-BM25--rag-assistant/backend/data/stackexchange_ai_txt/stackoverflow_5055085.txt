KDbg - how to dock the memory window into the main Kdbg window?

OS: Kubuntu 10.10 KDbg version: 2.2.1 I am using KDbg 2.2.1 on Kubuntu 10.10. I installed it from one of the standard repositories (i.e. "sudo apt-get install kdbg"). What I need help with is, how do I dock the separate memory window into the main application window? I've tried to drag it over to the main window, but that does not work. Since I use the memory window pretty often, I want it to be part of the main window along with the stack, output and watch windows. Any help would be appreciated.
