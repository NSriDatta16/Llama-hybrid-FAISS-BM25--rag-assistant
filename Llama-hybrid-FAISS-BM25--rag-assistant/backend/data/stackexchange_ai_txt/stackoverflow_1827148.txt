How to include unit tests in a ruby module?

I'm trying to include the unit tests for a module in the same source file as the module itself, following the Perl modulino model. #! /usr/bin/env ruby require 'test/unit' module Modulino def modulino_function return 0 end end class ModulinoTest Now, I can run the unit-tests executing this source file. But , they are also run when I require/load them from another script. How can this be avoided ? Is there a more idiomatic way to achieve this with Ruby, unless this practice is discouraged ?
