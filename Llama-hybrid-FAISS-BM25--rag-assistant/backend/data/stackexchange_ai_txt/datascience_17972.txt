Hosmer Lemeshow Test, variable lengths differ

Doing a logistic regression in R version 3.1.2 and I want to conduct a Hosmer Lemeshow test model |z|) (Intercept) -7.827805 1.169216 -6.695 2.16e-11 a 0.582214 0.134207 4.338 1.44e-05 b -0.697126 0.462983 -1.506 0.13214 c 0.027485 0.009669 2.843 0.00448 d 0.996241 0.163006 6.112 9.86e-10 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 504.53 on 373 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 381.91 on 369 degrees of freedom (3 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 391.91 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 Using the function hoslem.test from package "Resource Selection" hoslem.test(model$y, fitted(model), g = 10) I get the following error Error in model.frame.default(formula = cbind(y0 = 1 - y, y1 = y) ~ cutyhat) : variable lengths differ (found for 'cutyhat') Looking at the code in the hoslem.test function, cutyhat is derived only from fitted(model) values, which I've verified contain no nas and are all integers, so why would they differ? Pls help.
