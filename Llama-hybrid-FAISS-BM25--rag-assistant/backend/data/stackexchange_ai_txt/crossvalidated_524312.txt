This is not really an objection to Bayesian analysis at all --- it is an objection to the rules of probability theory. If you have an event $\mathcal{E}$ (e.g., a head occurring on a coin) and a discrete parameter $p$ giving the conditional probability of the event, then the law of total probability states that: $$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) = \sum \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}|p) \pi(p) = \sum p \cdot \pi(p).$$ As can be seen from this equation, the marginal probabilty of the event is a convex combination of the conditional probabilities given by the possible values of the parameter $p$ . Your question asserts that the marginal probability of the event should be equal to one of the possible parameter values, but that is not always true. In your example, there is nothing wrong with the conclusion that the marginal probability of a head is $0.58$ --- that is the value that follows from the stipulated prior for $p$ and the likelihood function for the outcome of the coin. As to a response, Bayesians would have the same response as any other practitioners who use probabilty theory as the basis for statistics. If you are unwilling to accept the law of total probability theory then you are rejecting one or more of the axioms of probability, and the onus would then be on you to stipulate an alternative theory of probability to take its place.
