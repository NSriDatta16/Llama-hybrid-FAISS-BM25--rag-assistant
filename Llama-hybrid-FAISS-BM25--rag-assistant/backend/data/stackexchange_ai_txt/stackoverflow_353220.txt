If you think about how many "a" and "b" characters there are in D(0), D(1), etc, you'll see that the string gets very long very quickly. Calculate how many characters there are in D(50), and then maybe think again about where you would store that much data. I make it 4.5*10^15 characters, which is 4500 TB at one byte per char. Come to think of it, you don't have to calculate - the problem tells you there are 10^12 steps at least, which is a terabyte of data at one byte per character, or quarter of that if you use tricks to get down to 2 bits per character. I think this would cause problems with the one-minute time limit on any kind of storage medium I have access to :-)
