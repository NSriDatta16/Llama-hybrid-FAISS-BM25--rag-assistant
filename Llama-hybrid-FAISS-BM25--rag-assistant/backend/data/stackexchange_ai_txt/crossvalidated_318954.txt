H2O Stacked Ensemble requires k-fold cross-validation of the base models and what you're describing (although it's close) isn't exactly k-fold cross-validation, so it does not support that. There is a ticket open for a modification of stacking that allows more flexibility, but it's still not exactly what you're describing. To use the fold_column argument in H2O algorithms, you must have a column of fold indices. There is an example of how to construct that column in this Python unit test . However, I am not sure that you really want to do k-fold cross-validation, or the variant you're describing, if you have time-series data. This article describes why that doesn't work (see the "Time series" paragraph). Usually with time-series data, you must ensure that you're always training on "past" data and predicting on "future" data.
