What are the possible ways to detect skin while classifying diseases?

I am working on a skin disease classification problem where I have successfully created a classifier ( TensorFlow + Keras ) which can classify images of two skin diseases. The sample image needs to be classified in this manner : Whether the sample is an image of the skin. Does the skin have any two of the diseases ( Melanoma or Psoriasis ) If a disease is found, to which class does it belong (CLASS1: Melanoma or CLASS2: Psoriasis How can create Classifiers which could carry out the following tasks? Do I need the image localization or CNNs or something like YoLo? What steps should I implement? I have created a classifier ( with an accuracy of 96% ) which can classify an image of the two diseases efficiently. But it can't detect the presence of the disease ( Step 2 in the above task list ).
