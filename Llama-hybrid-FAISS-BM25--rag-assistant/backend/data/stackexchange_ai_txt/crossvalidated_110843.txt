You could also take GDP/export as a (calculated) measure in itself and use parallel coordinates for the 3 years. This would be the clearest representation. Drawback: it does not in itself show the difference between countries with high GDP and high export, versus those with lore GDP and low export. If you want that information as well, you might (a) use opacity for that, or (b) just add an additional coordinate (vertical line) with the average GDP over the 3 years.
