How to create a "Block device" in Windows

For those familiar with Linux, it is possible to create a module and register it as a block device. This allows the user to mount it as a regular disk (while all the block I/O is handled by the module, e.g. USB mass storage). Is there a way to do this in Windows ? (Need to create a volume mountable by Windows. The raw data will come from propriety interface).
