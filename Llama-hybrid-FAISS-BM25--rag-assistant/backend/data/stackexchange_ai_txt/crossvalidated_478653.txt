The choice of a completely randomized design will lose efficiency. You also may not be able to identify some effects which would be very disappointing. Your second choice, the CRBD, is better. While you want randomization, you are sort of ending up in a fractional factorial design situation. You may want to consider randomly assigning treatments without replacement for the first three units in a block and then assigning randomly for the remaining units. Alternately, you could use a quasi-random number generator for your randomization; that would be fully random yet tend toward equal coverage of all treatments. If you have any blocks with less that 3 units, I would also recommend reading up on aliasing/confounding and uniform designs (which can reduce aliasing).
