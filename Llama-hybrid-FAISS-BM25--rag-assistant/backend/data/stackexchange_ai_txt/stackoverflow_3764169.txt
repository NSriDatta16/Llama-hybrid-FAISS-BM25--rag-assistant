As far as i'm aware, no browser pays attention to a Retry-after header. Proxies and caches might, but Apparently, some browsers now include some level of support for Retry-After (though support is still iffy at best). I'm not entirely convinced of the benefit of doing so in a browser; generally, it's considered a bad idea to cache failures. But if you know when you'll be accepting requests again, telling the client can't hurt. (If you come back up sooner than expected, though, any program that actually honors the header should assume -- and report -- that the site's still down.) The most obvious benefit is, it seems Googlebot (and possibly other spiders) will pay attention to the header if it's there, which can keep it from un-indexing the page for a while. With all that said...if it's trivial to add, and you can come up with a reasonably accurate estimate of when the service will be available, go for it. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to do it, though. It's only advisory anyway, and putting the wrong time in there could cause more problems than not including the header at all.
