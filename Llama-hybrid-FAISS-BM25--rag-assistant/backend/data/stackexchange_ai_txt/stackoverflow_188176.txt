Named Entity Recognition Libraries for Java

I am looking for a simple but "good enough" Named Entity Recognition library (and dictionary) for java, I am looking to process emails and documents and extract some "basic information" like: Names, places, Address and Dates I've been looking around, and most seems to be on the heavy side and full NLP kind of projects. Any recommendations ?
