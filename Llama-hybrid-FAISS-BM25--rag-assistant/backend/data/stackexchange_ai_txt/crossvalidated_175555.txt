Danica's answer is correct. Precisely stated, covariance matrices and Mercer kernels are both matrices which are (1) positive definite and (2) symmetric. However, there is some research into matrices otherwise than Mercer kernels, that is, matrices which are not positive-definite but which may be useful in machine learning nonetheless. These are occasionally referred to as kernels, as in this paper , but at least in this case the authors are careful to stress that when they are speaking of kernels, they have a definition in mind which does not necessarily satisfy Mercer's conditions.
