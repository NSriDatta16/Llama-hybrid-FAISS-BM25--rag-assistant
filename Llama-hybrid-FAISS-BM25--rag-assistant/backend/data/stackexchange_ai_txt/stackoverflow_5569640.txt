There seems to be a problem with VBA, a know issue since 2004 :(. Anyway I wrote code to export and that resolved my problem. Am posting the code here for anyone else Sub ExportTextFileDelimited(FileName As String, _ DataSet As String, _ Delimiter As String, _ TextQualifier As String, _ WithFieldNames As Boolean) On Error GoTo ExportTextFile_Err Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rst As New ADODB.Recordset Dim Directory As String Dim MyString As String, strSQL As String Dim strDS As String Dim I As Integer Open FileName For Output As #1 Set cnn = CurrentProject.Connection rst.Open DataSet, cnn, adOpenForwardOnly, adLockReadOnly If WithFieldNames Then For I = 0 To rst.Fields.Count - 1 MyString = MyString & TextQualifier & rst(I).Name & TextQualifier & Delimiter Next I MyString = Left(MyString, Len(MyString) - 1) Print #1, MyString End If rst.MoveFirst Do While Not rst.EOF MyString = "" For I = 0 To rst.Fields.Count - 1 'check for text datatype (202) If rst(I).Type = 202 Then MyString = MyString & TextQualifier & _ rst(I) & TextQualifier & Delimiter Else MyString = MyString & rst(I) & Delimiter ' Usage: Call ExportTextFileDelimited("C:\Query.txt", "Query", vbTab, """", True)
