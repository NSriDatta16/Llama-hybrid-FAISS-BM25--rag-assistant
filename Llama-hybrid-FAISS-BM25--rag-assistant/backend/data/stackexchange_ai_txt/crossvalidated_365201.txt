K-Fold on a Random Forest

I have a 1400x120 matrix that I'm aiming to run a random forest regression on but have been running into difficulty understanding how the RF interacts with K-fold. Specifically, is cross validation run on the entire data-set (thus negating the need to partition into training/test), or is it only run on the training subset? I'm unconvinced that this is right, but is K-Fold CV used to determine the optimal tuning parameters, or have I confused that with something else? If not, what is being achieved by running the CV? Having obtained my data and committed to a random forest regression, I'm looking to understand what further tests I need to do in order to; 1. improve the model to its optimal settings, and 2. sufficiently report the results.
