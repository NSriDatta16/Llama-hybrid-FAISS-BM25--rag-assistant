You could use the Thread.setPriority(int newPriority) method to reduce the thread's priority. This will result in other higher-priority threads being executed more often. However, your MD5 will not be calculated as quickly as if you left the priority alone -- why wouldn't you want this calculation to complete as quickly as possible? EDIT: Here is a "Fast MD5" implementation , which boasts a significant performance increase (26% faster on average) over Java's default java.security.MessageDigest implementation. See the author's page for detailed information, including code examples and benchmarks . The code is available under the GNU LGPL 2.1 license .
