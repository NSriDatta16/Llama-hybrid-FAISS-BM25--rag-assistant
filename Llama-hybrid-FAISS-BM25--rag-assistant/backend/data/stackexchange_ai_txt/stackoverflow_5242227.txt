If i have interpreted your requirements correctly, here's a sample of how it might be done Method is 1. plot as std column chart: Arrival time, start and end 2. set order of series: end, start, arrival 5. set 'series overlap' to 100% 6. set fill color of start time series to a light color 7. set line style of all series to none Another possible, method: does this look more like what you are after? this one is built using x-y chart with error bars.
