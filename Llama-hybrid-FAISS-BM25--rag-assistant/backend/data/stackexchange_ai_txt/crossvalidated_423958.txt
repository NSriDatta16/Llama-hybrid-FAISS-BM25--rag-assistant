PCA output different each run

I am trying to analyse my data that contains many NaNs values by learning a PCA from Matlab: https://au.mathworks.com/help/stats/pca.html There is an example of using ALS Algorithm input argument for dealing with NaNs dataset. Then, I tried to make a biplot out of it, however, it seems the biplot is different everytime. load hald [coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained] = pca(ingredients); y = ingredients; % adding NaNs into the dataset rng('default'); % for reproducibility ix = random('unif',0,1,size(y)) Biplot 1 (First run) Biplot 2 (second run) The biplot would not change if I did not include the NaNs or ALS algorithm argument which the script becomes like this below: load hald [coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained] = pca(ingredients); figure(); biplot(coeff(:,1:2),'scores',score(:,1:2),'varlabels',{'A','B','C','D'}) Biplot 3 without using ALS argument and no NaNs. Is it because of the input arguments which somehow changed the biplot? or did I miss something? Thank you very much. Regards.
