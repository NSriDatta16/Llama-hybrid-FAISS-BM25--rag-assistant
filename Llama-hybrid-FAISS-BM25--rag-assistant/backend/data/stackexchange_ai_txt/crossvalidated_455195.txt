Part of the answer depends on whether you are using a probabilistic classifier or not: ie does the model produce an estimate of probability of being class A, or just a hard decision A or B? 1) If you use a (well calibrated) probabilistic classifier (logistic regression, most neural nets xgboost with logloss) then it probably doesn't matter too much (and you readjust your prediction proportionately). If you don't use a probabilistic classifier then you have to rebalance, and then ...??? 2) don't adjust your test set - I suspect any differences might be random/problem specific - ie suck it and see.
