In a (one-way) MANOVA, you study the effect of a single categorical variable (e.g. treatment yes/no) on the averages of two or more continuous response variables (e.g. diastolic and systolic blood pressure). In a two-way ANOVA, you study the effects of two categorical variables (e.g. treatment yes/no and and sex) on the average of a single continuous response variable (e.g. systolic blood pressure).
