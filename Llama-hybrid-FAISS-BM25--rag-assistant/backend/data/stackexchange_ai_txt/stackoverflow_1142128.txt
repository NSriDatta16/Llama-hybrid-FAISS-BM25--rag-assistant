Porting webkit layout engine

I want to port webkit based browser to my stack. Can anyone tell about the organisation of the webkit browser engine? Currently what i know is that it has cores for rendering html & parsing javascript. I would like to know more, like how the javascript and renderer cores interact with each other?
