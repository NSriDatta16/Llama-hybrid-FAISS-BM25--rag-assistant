Is there software/a script that can automatically create class structures for PHP scripts?

I know that PHPDoc exists, but phpdoc wants you to put comments in your PHP files so that it can parse them... What I want is something different: Suppose that I have 10 PHP classes... all I want is a script that can read those classes and automatically generate a representation of those class structures, i.e. what classes are in them, properties, methods, etc, and organize that information in an easy to follow format... Do any of you know any script that does this automatically?
