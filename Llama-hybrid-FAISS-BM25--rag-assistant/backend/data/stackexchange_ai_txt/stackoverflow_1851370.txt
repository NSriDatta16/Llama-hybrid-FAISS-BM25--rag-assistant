Why touches Event methods not detecting even after writing it inside the subclass of UIScrollView?

I want to use touch event methods for UIScrollView. But it was said that I could do this only if I subclass UIScrollView and write these functions inside it. So i did like this SubClassing.h @interface ImageTiling : UIScrollView { } @end SubClassing.m #import "ImageTiling.h" @implementation ImageTiling - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Touched" message:@"YOOY" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"YES" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Ended" message:@"YOOY" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"YES" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; } @end But its not having any effect. I have imported that in my main_file.h. What should I do now?
