Counting the number of occurrences of words in a textfile

How could I go about keeping track of the number of times a word appears in a textfile? I would like to do this for every word. For example, if the input is something like: "the man said hi to the boy." Each of "man said hi to boy" would have an occurrence of 1. "the" would have an occurence of 2. I was thinking of keeping a dictionary with word/occurrence pairs but I'm not sure how to implement this in C. A link to any similar or related problems with a solution would be great. EDIT: To avoid rolling out my own hash table I decided to learn how to use glib. Along the way I found an excellent tutorial which walks through a similar problem. http://bo.majewski.name/bluear/gnu/GLib/ch03s03.html I am awestruck by the number of different approaches, and in particular the simplicity and elegance of the Ruby implementation.
