ASP.NET and C# compilation error while attempting to instantiate a new object from a class

I have this simple ASP.NET page here: Planting Trees protected void Page_Load(Object Source, EventArgs E) { string msg = "Let's plant some trees! "; // Create a new Tree Tree tree1 = new Tree(); msg += "I've created a tree with a height of " + tree1.height + " metre(s). "; tree1.Grow(3); msg += "After a bit of growth, it's now up to " + tree1.height + " metre(s) tall. "; msg += "Maybe eventually it will grow to 10 meters tall! â€¦ "; tree1.Grow(7); msg += "*15 years later* Let's check out our tree's height now! It's now up to " + tree1.height + " meter(s) tall! Awesome! "; Output.Text = msg; string msg2 = "Let's plant some coconut trees! "; // Create a new Tree CoconutTree coconutTree1 = new CoconutTree(); msg2 += "I've created a tree with " + coconutTree1.numNuts + " coconuts. "; coconutTree1.GrowNut(10); ms2 += "I've now grown " + coconutTree1.numNuts + " coconuts on our tree. "; Output2.Text = msg2; } With this simple class: namespace One { public class Tree { public int height = 0; public void Grow(int heightToGrow) { height += heightToGrow; } } public class CoconutTree : Tree { public int numNuts = 0; //Number of coconuts public void GrowNut(int numberToGrow) { numNuts += numberToGrow; } public void PickNut(int numberToPick) { numNuts -= numberToPick; } } } UPDATE UPDATE: Parser Error Description: Error parsing a resource required to service this request. Review your source file and modify it to fix this error. Parser Error Message: Cannot find type CoconutTree.One
