How can I make my data fit normal distribution?

I have selected a number of words and asked people to rate them on a Likert scale. Words were selected according to two categories; syllable length (mono-, di- and trisyllable and final phoneme (vowel or consonant). These variables interact and are three words for each cross-category (eg. 3 monosyllabic vowel-final words, 3 disyllabic vowel final words, 3 trisyllabic vowel-final words etc). I am now analysing my data and however I cut it I cannot get it to fit normal distribution. I have organised it by broad categories like syllable length or final phoneme, and finer categories like monosyllabic vowel-final words. I have applied logarithmic transformations and all the p-values returned on the Shapiro and Wilcox tests are absolutely tiny. Am I doing something wrong? Or is this just the way the data is?
