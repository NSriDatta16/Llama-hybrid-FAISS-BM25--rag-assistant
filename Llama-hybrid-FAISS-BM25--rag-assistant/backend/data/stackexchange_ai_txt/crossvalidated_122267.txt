Your interpretation of the first two coefficients leads you a bit astray. If you look at b1 only, this tells you the average difference in earnings between men and women in percent (given that the regression is log linear), holding skin color fixed. Using your regression results women earn on average 9% less than men. Then b2 tells you the average difference in earnings between white and non-white regardless of gender. Again from your regression you see that white people earn on average 38% more than noon-whites. What you are looking for is a combination of these two effects. The best thing to do is to make a table of average earnings like this male female white non-white and calculate the differences between these cells and then the difference of those differences. You should get results similar to your regression coefficients. Think about whose earnings you get from your regression when you "switch on/off" your two dummy variables female and white, i.e. change them from 0 to 1 or vice versa. Remember there that you have an interaction term which will eventually end up in the partial effect of b1 and b2, e.g. the partial effect for female is the regression equation differentiated with respect to female. But from the table and changing the regression equation you will surely figure out what b3 does in this context.
