TFS Build Agent Use Multiple Configurations

I'm trying to use the TFS Build Agent to replace my old Build.bat file that builds all of my projects. I have C# and C++ projects that need to be compiled. All of the C# projects have the configuration Release|Any CPU and all of the C++ projects have the Release|Win32 configuration. I've created a MSBuild project that includes all of my projects. How do I specify that the C++ projects should use the Release|Win32 configuration and the C# projects should use the Release|Any CPU configuration. thanks John.
