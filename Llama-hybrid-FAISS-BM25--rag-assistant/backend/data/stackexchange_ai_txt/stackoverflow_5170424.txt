Combine the functionality in the java.io package with your own custom solution. The java.io package can write and read files from disk and create arbitrary directories or sub-directories for new files. There is no external API required. The versioning or auditing would have to be provided with your own custom solution. There are many ways to handle this, and you probably have a specific need that needs to be filled. Especially if you're concerned about the performance of an open-source API, it's likely that you will get the best result by simply coding a solution that specifically fits your needs. It sounds like your module should scan all the files on startup and form an index of everything that's available. Based on the method used for sharing and indexing these files, it can rescan the files every so often or you can code it to receive a message from some central server when a new file or version is available. When someone requests a file or provides a new file, your module will know exactly how it is organized and exactly where to get or put the file within the directory tree. It seems that it would be far easier to just engineer a solution specific to your needs.
