Here's a selector that should work: Try it out: http://jsfiddle.net/N6TdM/ var x = "Andy"; var y = "Gates"; var res = $("td:first-child:contains(" + x + ") + td:contains(" + y + ")"); Note that this could fail if you have something like the following: FIRST: Roberto Rob SECOND: Robertson Roberts Searching for "Rob Roberts" would give two matches.
