Default permissions of /dev on Mac OS X 10.5.*

Simple question. After a little bit of 'chmod' shenanigans, I have set the permissions for all pseudo ttys in /dev to a+rw which is somewhat open. Now that I have fixed the problem that I had, I want to revert my permissions back to the correct value. Therefore, what are the correct permissions. Executing: sudo ls -la /dev/tty* should provide the result I am after.
