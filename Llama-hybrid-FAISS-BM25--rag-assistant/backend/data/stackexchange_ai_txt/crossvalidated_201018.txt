What you are considering in your example of C given A-A would actually be represented by the conditional probability $$ P(C | (A \cap A) \cap (A \cup B \cup C)) $$ This would evaluate to 100% as you said. The conditional probability you wanted to monitor was $$ P(C|(A \cap A) \cap B) $$ and likewise you could calculate $P(C|(A \cap A) \cap A)$ and $P(C|(A \cap A) \cap C)$. However, these are only a few possibly ways to fit your data. For instance, the logic statement $P(C| (A\cap A) \cup B)$ also gives a result of 100%. Thus, as in most machine learning problems, it all comes down to your hypothesis set and how many data points you have to work with. Let's take for example, a hypothesis set where A, B, and C are independent events and use your three data points from above to calculate the probability $P(A) = 6/12, P(B) = 3/12$, and $P(C) = 3/12$. To test this, we calculate the probability for 4 events which are either $A$, $B$, or $C$ from your data set. Thus the measured probabilities are $$ P(A,A,A,A) = 0 $$ $$ P(A,A,A,B) = 0 $$ $$ P(A,A,A,C) = 0 $$ etc... until we find $$ P(A,A,B,C) = 1; $$ Now, if we truly had independent events our expected probability would be, $$ P(A,A,B,C) = (1/2)(1/2)(1/4)(1/4) = 1/64 \sim 0.016. $$ Now you decide if you accept or reject your hypothesis set (typically by taking the squared difference between the expected and measured values). Keep in mind, all machine learning principles apply here so be very careful how many degrees of freedom you give your hypothesis set as you can easily over-fit this data if your not careful. Therefore make sure to run proper validation and cross-validation checks. More specific to your exact question, choose a hypothesis set, calculate the results, and compare those results to other possible hypothesis sets to find the best match.
