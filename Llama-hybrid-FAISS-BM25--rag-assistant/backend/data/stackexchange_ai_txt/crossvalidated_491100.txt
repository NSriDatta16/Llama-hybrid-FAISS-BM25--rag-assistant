Calculate spline terms of a logistic regression using published knots and formula

I try to calculate spline terms of a logistic regression to generate a linear predictor/ prediction formula for the model " Lymph Node Involvement (Cores) " The source ( https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre_op/coefficients ) states the forumula to calculate the spline terms sp1var and sp2var as follows: I tried to calculate sp1var and sp2var using the published knots in R: var=10 # PSA = 10 for example knot1= 0.2 knot2=4.7 knot3=7.2 knot4=96.53 sp1var however, If I calculate the probability (according to Make prediction equation from logistic regression coefficients ), I get a wrong result: # define the Intercept Intercept = -5.37368223 # define the Coefficients cAGE = 0.00906354 cPSA = 0.21239809 cPSAs1 =-0.00132481 cPSAs2 = 0.00356913 cGLE = 3.03232465 #for gleason grade 5 cCLI = 0.71055042 #for clinical stage 3+ cPOS = 0.05499551 # no. of positive cores cNEG = -0.11987793 # no. of negative cores # define predictors PSA= 10 age=50 npos=10 # no. of positive cores nneg=10 # no. of negative cores # calculate the probability z = Intercept + age * cAGE + PSA * cPSA + sp1var * cPSAs1 + sp2var * cPSAs2 + cGLE + cCLI + npos *cPOS + nneg * cNEG exp(z)/(1 + exp (z)) # result : 0.8962046 # expected: 0.39 (https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre_op) Do I misinterpret the stated formulas?
