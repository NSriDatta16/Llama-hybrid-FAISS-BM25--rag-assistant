Stop propagation with jQuery delegate/live function not working

Here's the problem html: some header some paragraph Show Popup + // this repeats n times //... When I click on .popup-link link, it should open the lightbox popup only (which it does) but the inline onclick on li also fires. The thing is that the li tags are all part of some partial which is fetched via ajax on different pages. So I use jQuery's delegate to bind the events as follows: $('#update-list').delegate('.popup-link', 'click', function(e){ // e.target is while e.currentTarget is .popup-link e.stopPropagation(); //console.log(e.isPropagationStopped()); this shows 'true' in console $.popup(); // launch popup e.preventDefault(); // or return false }); This doesn't seem to work and the inline onclick fires anyway. I've tried with live() as well but no success. Is there something I am missing here?
