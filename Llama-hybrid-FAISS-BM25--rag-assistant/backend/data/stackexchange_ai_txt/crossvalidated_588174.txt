What information can I extract from an overlap of two personal probability distributions?

Inspiration: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trees-stars-milky-way/ Let's say I take a Bayesian approach and use probability distributions to represent my beliefs about the number of stars in the Milky Way and the number of trees on Earth, as shown below: The overlapping area is approximately 0.25. Let's say I am interested in evaluating my beliefs regarding the following proposition: There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way. I want to assign a probability to this proposition to represent my degree of belief that the proposition is true. Based on the distributions I shared previously, would assigning a probability of 0.75 be correct [ p(proposition is true) = 0.75 ]? Do I need to do some form of a Bayesian comparison of means, a t-test, or something else instead?
