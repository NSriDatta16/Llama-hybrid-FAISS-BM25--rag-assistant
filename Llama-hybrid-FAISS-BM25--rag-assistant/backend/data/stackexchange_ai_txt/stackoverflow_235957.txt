Are you an agile/pragmatic developer in a waterfall organization?

If so, how do you deal with things that just don't "feel" right such as: not writing unit tests not having a continuous build not refactoring not having a team coding standard not pair programming not doing iterations no daily standups no retrospectives Now, some agile organizations do leave out some of these practices, but most successful ones incorporate most of them. What do you do to deal with the seeming chaos of the traditional development processes?
