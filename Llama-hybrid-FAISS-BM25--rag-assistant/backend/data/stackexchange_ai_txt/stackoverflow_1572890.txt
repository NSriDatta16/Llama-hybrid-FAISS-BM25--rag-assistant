If you are trying to get the average assets of clients I think I would use at CTE. You can try if sql 2005 or greater EDIT: Took the second group by out as I think you want just one result here of average assets With clientsum (client,assets) as ( SELECT CLIENT, SUM(asset) AS assets FROM CLIENTTABLE GROUP BY CLIENT ) SELECT avg(assets) AS Expr1 FROM clientsum
