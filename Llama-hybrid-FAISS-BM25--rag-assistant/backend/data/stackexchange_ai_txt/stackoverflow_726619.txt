This could work - each single step event will create an exception and you could record the hit IP address in your map of executed code lines. Unfortunately, I imagine this would be glacially slow. It'd be incredibly inefficient, as each single line of code results in 1000's of times more work, as an exception is generated, trapped, a message sent to your debugger, and then a round trip back after you record the hit. It might be better to try to set breakpoints instead for each covered line and clear them after they are hit. That'd be faster, but most likely still very slow. The core problem is you're trying to use the debugger as a code coverage tool which it is not intended for. A quick search shows several code coverage tools for Delphi on the Internet.
