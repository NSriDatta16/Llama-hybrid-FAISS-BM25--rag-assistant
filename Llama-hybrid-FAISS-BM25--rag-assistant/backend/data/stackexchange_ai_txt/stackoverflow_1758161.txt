Anurag's answer will work very well for you if you want to add the buttons before the grid is instantiated , specifically before you add the column to the grid. If you want to add the button to the grid cell after the grid is already built , you can do it by making changes to the DataGridCell object. First you have to find it: Find the DataGridCell by using DataGridColumn.GetCellContent Use VisualTreeHelper to scan up the visual tree to the DataGridCell Once this is done, there are several ways to add a button to the DataGridCell, depending on what you're trying to achieve: Set DataGridCell.Template to a ControlTemplate containing the buttons and other styling you desire, -OR- Set DataGridCell.ContentTemplate to a DataTemplate containing the buttons and other items you desire, -OR- Have your column's DataTemplate include a placeholder panel to hold new buttons, search down the visual tree for this panel by Name , and add your button to it. An alternative approach that doesn't require finding the cell is to: Include an ObservableCollection property in your view model that supplies the information to create the buttons In your DataTemplate include an ItemsControl that reference this property and has a DataTemplate that can create the correct button out of type T When you want to add a button, just add an item to the ObservableCollection property
