gzip is only a good algorithm when the transmission/storage cost is not too high compared to the cost of CPU time. You can get better compression ratios with bzip2, 7zip, and especialy for natural language, various PPM algorithms. Of course, it's not only computation (and static vs. dynamic memory requirement) vs. compression ratio that matters - different compression formats allow varying degrees of efficient random access seeking, low latency stream decoding, and concatenation of zipped data (e.g. cat a.gz b.gz | gunzip -c is the same as gunzip -c a.gz;gunzip -c b.gz
