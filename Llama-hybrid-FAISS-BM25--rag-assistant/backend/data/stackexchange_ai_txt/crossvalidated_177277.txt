The predicted probability produced by random forests are the votes, i.e. the proportion of trees who voted for class 1. If you had 5 trees, your values could only be multiples of 0.2. On the other hand, if you have 1000 trees, the range of possible values for the probabilities will be the multiple of 0.001
