Can be considered continuous a variable obtained from Principal Component Analysis based on Likert scale?

I performed a PCA analysis on a Likert scale with 5 questions which ordinal responses can be 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). I did it in two independent samples. I obtained only one principal component in each group. Now I want to compare the principal component in each group. If my data were continuous, I know that the Principal components are continuous. However, as my Likert scale does not have continuous data (It can't), I would like to know if the resulting principal components should be considered continuous data or something else. Of course, this is important to determine which test(s) should I use to determine if there is association between the two groups that I want to compare. Very much thank you, Nicole
