A comprehensive and authoratative reference is Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics Volume 1 Distribution Theory Volume 2A Classical Inference and Linear Models There is also a Volume 2B but it is Bayesian Inference . Other than those, I agree the Casella and Berger is an excellent reference at the graduate level, and suggest Bain and Engelhardt's Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics for upper-level undergraduates.
