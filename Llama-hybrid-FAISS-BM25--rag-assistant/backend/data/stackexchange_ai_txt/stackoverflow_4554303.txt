How Java video can work, within a friendly installation procedure?

How can you capture Video using Java ? You have to use JMF ? In my research Audio part is solved, someone would not require Audio with JMF (in case to reduce installation headaches) For Java Video, In my test case: Without JMF installed in my PC, it says package does not exist, but i have Java installed. import javax.media.*; With JMF installed in my second PC, it works. which means JAVA + JMF seperately need to be installed. But: There are many users, want simple installation procedure, for example: Download -> click install -> run -> talk and watch OR Many users dont follow install JAVA and then install JMF and then finally install my application to talk and watch Solution: JNLP is one hope, but can i embed whole JMF as source for cross platform and deploy it within my application ? To minimize the installation procedure to focus user friendly installation method. Is there any other way arround to minimize this installations headache, and completely switch to some other class/libraries, where i can do RAW video capture for h264, compress video, text overlap, streaming etc etc ?
