I think you should pay more attention before claiming that something another person wrote is wrong. The part in which they do foreach (x in contact.Elements("phone")) { Console.WriteLine(x); } Is preceded by: For example, you might have the following XML loaded into an XElement called contact: Met in 2005. Patrick Hines 206-555-0144 425-555-0145 And your XML file doesn't match that. Elements only finds direct children of the element. So using the XML file you provided, the correct way to access the phone numbers (of everyone in the file) would be XElement contacts = XElement.Load(@"C:\Projects\ALL_MY_PROJECTS\LINQ_Noodling\UI\Contacts.xml"); foreach (x in contacts.Elements("contact").Elements("phone")) { Console.WriteLine(x); }
