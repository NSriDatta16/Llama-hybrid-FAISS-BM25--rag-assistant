How does outlier impact logistic regression?

I understand the outlier impact for linear regression with squared loss. @gung had a beautiful answer in this post to explain the concept of leverage and residual. My question is How does outlier impact logistic regression ? Does the same concept apply? (that we want to have a closer look at high leverage/residual points?) For example, R , plot(glm(am~wt,mtcars,family="binomial")) is telling me Toyota Corona has high leverage and residual, should I take a closer look? I found this post that says logistic regression is robust to outliers but did not discuss leverage and residual. Is it correct?
