Azure ML / AutoML: problem with univariate time series forecasting

I'm having troubles generating univariate time series forecasts with Azure Automated Machine Learning (I know...). What I'm doing So I have about 5 years worth of monthly observations in a dataframe that looks like this: date target_value 2015-02-01 123 2015-03-01 456 2015-04-01 789 ... ... I want to forecast target_value based on past values of target_value , i.e. univariate forecasting like ARIMA for instance. So I am setting up the AutoML forecast like this: # that's the dataframe as shown above train_data = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path=datastore.path(my_remote_filename)) # ...other code... forecasting_parameters = ForecastingParameters( time_column_name='date', forecast_horizon=2, target_lags='auto', freq='MS' ) automl_config = AutoMLConfig(task='forecasting', debug_log='automl_forecasting_function.log', primary_metric='normalized_root_mean_squared_error', enable_dnn=True, experiment_timeout_hours=8.0, enable_early_stopping=True, training_data=train_data, compute_target='my-cluster', n_cross_validations=3, verbosity=logging.INFO, max_concurrent_iterations=4, max_cores_per_iteration=-1, label_column_name='target_value', forecasting_parameters=forecasting_parameters) What the problem is But AutoML does not seem to generate the forecast for target_value based on past values of target_value . It seems to use the date column as the independent variable! The feature importance chart also shows date as the input feature: As a side note: running multivariate forecasts works fine. When I use a dataset like this, feature_1 and feature_2 are used (i.e. as the X) to forecast target_value (i.e. the y) date feature_1 feature_2 target_value 2015-02-01 10 7 123 2015-03-01 30 2 456 2015-04-01 20 5 789 ... ... ... ... My questions therefore How do I need to set up a univariate AutoML forecast to forecast target_value based on past observations target_value ? I assumed generating lagged values for target_value etc. is exactly what AutoML is supposed to do. Thanks!
