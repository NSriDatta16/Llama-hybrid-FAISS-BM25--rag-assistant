Asset Management: which is the better way to organise user generated files on a web server?

We are in the process of building a system which allows users to upload multiple images and videos to our servers. The team I'm working with have decided to save all the assets belonging to a user in a folder named using the user's unique identifier. This folder in turn will be a sub-folder of our main assets folder on the file server. The file structure they have proposed is as follows: [asset_root]/userid1/assets1 [asset_root]/userid1/assets2 [asset_root]/userid2/assets1 [asset_root]/userid2/assets2 etc. We are expecting to have thousands or possibly a million+ users in the life time of this system. I always thought that it wasn't a good idea to have many sub-folders in a single location and suggested a year/month/day approach as follows: [asset_root]/2010/11/04/userid1/assets1 [asset_root]/2010/11/04/userid1/assets2 [asset_root]/2010/11/04/userid2/assets1 [asset_root]/2010/11/04/userid2/assets2 etc. Does anyone know which of the above approaches would be better suited for this many assets? Is there a better method to organize images/videos on a server? The system in question will be an Windows IIS 7.5 with a SAN. Many thanks in advance.
