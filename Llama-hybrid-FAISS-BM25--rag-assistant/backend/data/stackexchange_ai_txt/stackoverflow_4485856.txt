json, rails, parse error in javascript

I need to get a ruby array in to a javascript array and I'm getting a parse error. var characters = ; That is how I'm embedding ruby into inline javascript and it's coming up with a parse error. How should I be getting this ruby array into javascript? I'm embedding this into an .html.erb file so ruby should be getting to the variable before javascript. This is what safari console is showing: Update I had a form that had three fields js, css, and html respectively so I would put my javascript in a form and then it would put it into the header. So as you can see I was embedding ruby in javascript that was the output of a ruby object so the reason ruby wasn't getting to it first was that it had already got to it and treated the just like another string. Ahh, I up voted you all for the help. Thanks!
