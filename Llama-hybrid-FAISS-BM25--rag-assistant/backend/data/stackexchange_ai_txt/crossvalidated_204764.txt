e1071: CVE returns linear separation, Hold-out returns large error

I'm using the Adult dataset that can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult After taking a sample of the dataset, I use the svm function of e1071 to obtain the accuracy with a linear kernel. adult.df = read.csv("sample_adult.csv") adult.df$X = NULL Income = adult.df$Income...50k summary(svm(formula=factor(Income)~., data=adult.df, type="C-classification", cost=1, kernel="linear", cross = 10)) This returns: Number of Classes: 2 Levels: 50K 10-fold cross-validation on training data: Total Accuracy: 100 Single Accuracies: 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 However, I've implemented a holdout method of testing the accuracy (this is rather tailored to the dataset): holdout If I run the holdout on the same SVM: >holdout(adult.df,list(type="C-classification", cost=1, kernel="linear")) ... 10-fold cross-validation on training data: Total Accuracy: 100 Single Accuracies: 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 [1] 0.39 As you can see... The holdout and CVE values are entirely different. I think my holdout code is correct, and my implementation of the svm function is the problem. Please, any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
