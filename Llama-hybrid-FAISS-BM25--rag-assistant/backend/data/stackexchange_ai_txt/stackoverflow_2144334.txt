My dad with his near infinite intelligence (despite having 2 kids) points out a rather simple solution: demorgan's law says you can rewrite any expression to use only ANDs or ORs with various uses of NOT. So simply convert all of the AND expressions to their OR equivalent, remove the parenthesis, and evaluate left to right. Very workable idea, except that in my case the NOT operation is terribly expensive.
