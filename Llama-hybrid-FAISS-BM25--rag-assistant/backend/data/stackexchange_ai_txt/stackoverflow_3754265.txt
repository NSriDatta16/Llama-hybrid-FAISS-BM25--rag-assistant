Here is an example code fragment: unsigned int Compress(char letter_1, char letter_2, char letter3, char letter 4) { unsigned int value = 0; unsigned int result = 0; value = letter1 - 'A'; result = result This is an example of compressing the letter ( letter - 'A' ) and packing into an unsigned int ( result = result ). There may be more efficient or compact methods, but this is for demonstration purposes only.
