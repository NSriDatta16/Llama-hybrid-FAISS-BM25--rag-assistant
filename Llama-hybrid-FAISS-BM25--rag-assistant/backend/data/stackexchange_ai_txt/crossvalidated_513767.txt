Being “more technologically advanced” does not make a machine learning model better. There are cases where much simpler models outperform complicated ones. There’s no free lunch theorem stating that there can’t be single best model that works for all problems. Moreover, most of deep learning models are based on a number of clever hacks that appear to work for particular classes of problems. There’s no theoretical arguments why one of those models should perform better. ResNet tried to solve some of the problems observed in earlier models (vanishing gradients), but this does not mean it will always outperform the earlier ones.
