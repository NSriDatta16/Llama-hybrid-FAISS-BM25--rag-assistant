Two Means, Different Sample Size, How to Compare Using R?

There is a sample of a student population (1,000 individuals) and from these, some were selected for an experiment (230 individuals). Now I need to compare the average of the original population to the average of those in the experiment to see if they are significantly different. I do not have the raw data on the students or the experiment, but I do have a table with mean and SD values. For example: Students (SD), Experiment Population (SD) Age 14 (.5), 15.5 (1) Days Absent 4.2 (2), 2.7 (2.2) Referrals 2 (.8), 3(2) What I don't understand is that the code in R Studio for mean comparisons seems to be for the paired t-test, not for my situation. Is there alternative?
