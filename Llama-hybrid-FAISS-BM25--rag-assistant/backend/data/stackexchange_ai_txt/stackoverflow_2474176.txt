You did so many things that I don't understand the exact status. My advice would be to strictly follow the Application Server Specific Configuration Guide for WebLogic that I've successfully used in the past with WLS 9.2. webapp.encoding.default UTF-8 javax.jws.* You'll certainly have to add more packages under prefer-application-packages to setup Weblogic ClassLoader filtering but in the current state of the question, it's impossible to provide a precise answer. Just in case, you can maybe try to blindly use the weblogic-application.xml from this thread : org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl webapp.encoding.default UTF-8 javax.jws.* org.apache.xerces.* org.apache.xalan.* But this is a shot in the dark.
