First Differencing to remove seasonality and trends

I am trying to remove seasonality and trends from my time series data. I found this post that said to use df_diff = df.diff().diff(12).dropna() ( https://www.tobiolabode.com/blog/2020/12/30/how-to-convert-non-stationary-data-into-stationary-for-arima-model-with-python ). I don't understand why we need to use diff(12) from pandas. Could someone explain this to me? Thanks!
