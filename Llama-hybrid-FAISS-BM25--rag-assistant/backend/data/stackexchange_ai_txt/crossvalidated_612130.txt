Unless a function is designed to handle censored observations, it won't handle censored observations as coded via the Surv() function in R. The nlmer() function isn't designed to handle censored observations. It seems that this particular problem can be solved by a log transform of the hypothesized power function: $$\log(aN^b)=\log a+b\log N .$$ That transformation sets the log of the known $N$ as the predictor variable, provides a form linear in the unknown coefficient $b$ , and allows for random intercepts in the form of $\log a$ . You then can use your choice of software for modeling random effects in survival models, summarized for example in the R Survival Task View . I suspect that more complicated hypothesized non-linear functions would benefit from a Bayesian survival model, but that doesn't seem to be needed here.
