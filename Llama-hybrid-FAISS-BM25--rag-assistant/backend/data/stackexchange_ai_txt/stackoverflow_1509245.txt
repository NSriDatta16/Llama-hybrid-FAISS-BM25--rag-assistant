Calculating a month as a "between" period in java

I want to select records that have a created date between the first and the last day of a given month. I calculate the month with begin and enddate the following way: The Date "month" is just a random date inside the timeframe Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(); cal.setTime(month); int endday = cal.getActualMaximum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH); int actualmonth = cal.get(Calendar.MONTH) + 1; int year = cal.get(Calendar.YEAR); Date begin = format.parse("01." + actualmonth + "." + year); Date end = format.parse(endday + "." + actualmonth + "." + year); When I think about this, I'd actually have to set the daytime as well, to avoid records going missing on the last day of the month. I feel this is kinda inelegant, anyone up for a better solution?
