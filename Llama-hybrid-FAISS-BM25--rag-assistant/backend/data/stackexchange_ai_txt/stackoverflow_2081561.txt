I'm not surprised by the fact that you get worst results when profiling your application as instrumenting java code will typically always slow its execution. This is actually nicely captured by the Wikipedia page on Profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program, potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs (due to the observer effect : observers affect what they are observing, by the mere act of observing it alone ). Having that said, if you want to measure speed, I think that you're not using the right tool. Profilers are used to find bottlenecks in an application (and for that, you don't really care of the overall impact). But if you want to benchmark your library, you should use a performance testing tool (for example, something like JMeter ) that will be able to give you an average execution time per call. You will get much better and more reliable results with the right tool.
