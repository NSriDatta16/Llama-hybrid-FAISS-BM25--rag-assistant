GLMM with ex-Gaussian distribution function (trial-level reaction time data)

I am trying to use GLMM in R to fit a mixed-effects model (three categorical predictors, one continuous predictor) to trial-level reaction times from a group of participants. The reaction time distributions (for the sample, experimental groups, and each participant) are ex-Gaussian in shape. From reading and searching the internet, it doesn't seem possible to specify an ex-Gaussian distribution with the family argument of the glmer() function (as would be possible with other distributional functions like family = binomial() ). I would like to ask if there might be a way to fit the mixed-effects model using glmer() and an ex-Gaussian distribution , or if there might be other (non-Bayesian) functions I could use instead.
