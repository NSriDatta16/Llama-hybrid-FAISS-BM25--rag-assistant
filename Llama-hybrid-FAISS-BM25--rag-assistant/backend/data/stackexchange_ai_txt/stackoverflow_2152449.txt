32 bit ActiveX Control in a 64 bit .NET App

I'm creating a C#.Net application which I want to be able to compile for "All CPUs". I also want to include a specific ActiveX control in the UI of this app, but the ActiveX control I'm trying to use does not support 32 bit. Is there some trick or work around I can use to use get this control to work? What about embedding the ActiveX control in a Web-browser control? Would this even work?
