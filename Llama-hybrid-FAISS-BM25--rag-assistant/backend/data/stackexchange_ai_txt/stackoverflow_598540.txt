Not an expert on UI, but I have seen a lot of bad UI. KISS is a good start. Make it intuitive. Keep the search both at the top and at the bottom. I'd be loathe to use something that forces me to move up the page to type (see Flex documentation, their pagination control is only at the top -- a miserable pain you know where). Organization of criteria should be two-fold: basic operators (20%) which 80% will use up-front dynamically edit the set of criteria available at any time. Get the users started with least ramp-up time and allow them to add/remove criteria on a as needed basis. The idea is to make him use something he needs and not clutter his thought or workflow with the brilliance of your feature set. As others have mentioned and is the trend nowadays with UI in general, use controls that are hidden until and unless the user explicitly wants advanced/fine-tuning (on-demand UI). A good rule of thumb is to have a maximum of 5-7 features on a page. It'd be great if you can arrange the criteria in such a way so as to make a story out of it i.e. the user can read his query and your operators make some meaning out of it. I'm a big fan of little text and easy to comprehend icons but such a setup depends on your installation environment. Can your grandkid use that mighty workhorse? Good design also necessiates that you make your UI accessible. That's a tough nut to crack and I have absolutely no idea how you'd do that. Best of luck!
