I love emacs and use it every day, but for Java development I usually use Eclipse. I've tried to set up the emacs Java Development Environment and it wasn't able to handle parsing the newer syntax features (annotations, generics) that I use regularly. For emacs macro recording/playback tasks, I'll open the Java code in emacs, edit and then switch back to Eclipse. Here are some of the features I can't live without now, which are found in Eclipse with keyboard shortcuts but not available to me in emacs: Context-sensitive auto-complete. Fuzzy search for a class name and open the source. Searching by initials for CamelCaseClasses is wonderful. Who overrides this method? Who calls this method? Run or debug just this unit test (just this method). Warn me about unused imports, deprecated methods, etc. Hover over a declaration to preview the HTML version of the javadoc. Reorganize imports, e.g. change import java.util.* to a bunch of imports for just the classes I actually use. Redeploy this webapp in Tomcat (automatic when you save a file via this plugin ) Top reasons I open emacs: Record editing macros for complex but repetitive editing. Edit remote files via tramp . Edit files when I don't have an Eclipse project defined.
