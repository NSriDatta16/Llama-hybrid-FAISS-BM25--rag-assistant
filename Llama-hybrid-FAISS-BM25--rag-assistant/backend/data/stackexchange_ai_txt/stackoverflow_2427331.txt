VB.Net is a ".net framework language". The examples you showed for .Net work just fine in VB. So, in that sense you would not be migrating from anything. As to why you should prefer the newer .net idioms over the older vb-specific idioms, there are many reasons: The newer code is more portable It uses more modern programming concepts, and therefore subtly encourages better habits The newer code is sometimes faster The newer code has more features. For example, you can set more styles on the new MessageBox than you can the old MsgBox. Sometimes neither is the best choice. For example, if you're using arrays much at all in .Net 2.0 and later you're doing something wrong. IEnumerable(Of T) and the various generic collection types are much to be preferred.
