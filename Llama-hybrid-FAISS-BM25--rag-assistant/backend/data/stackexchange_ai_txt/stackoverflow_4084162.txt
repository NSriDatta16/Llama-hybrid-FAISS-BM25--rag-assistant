Actionscript 2.0 and 3.0: Dragging Dynamic Image and not being replaced by another

I have a function that displays an image on top of a movie clip but when you click another image, it of course replaces the current image. I don't know how to stop it from replacing the image, that way I can make an image appear and drag it over somewhere on the stage and then make a different image appear and drag that somewhere else, too. and what is the drag event for Actionscript 3.0.
