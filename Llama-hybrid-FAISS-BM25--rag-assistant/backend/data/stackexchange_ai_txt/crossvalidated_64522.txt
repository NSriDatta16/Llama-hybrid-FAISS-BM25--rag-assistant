I've had some success at explaining logistic regression to educated non-statisticians by drawing the logistic curve, with the y-axis as probability from 0 to 1, and explaining how the coefficient indicates that marginal change in location along the S curve, which corresponds to a given probability. It helps people understand that the model assumes that the coefficients are only additive on the logit scale, which is quite nonlinear and uses a different interpretation than, say, a linear probability model. For example, a large coefficient (on a dummy variable for example) means less when the intercept is very large or small than it would if the intercept is near zero.
