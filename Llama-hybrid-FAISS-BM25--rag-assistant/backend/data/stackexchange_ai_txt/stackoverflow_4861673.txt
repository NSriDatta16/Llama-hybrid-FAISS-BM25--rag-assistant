You should use res/drawable for your XML state list drawables. If you get the "out of sync filesystem" error just refresh the Eclipse project (select it in the projects pane and hit F5 ). XML state lists are (in most cases) not DPI-independent. However, their content will not change across different DPI environments. Basically, this means that if you reference a raw drawable called, for example, @drawable/btn_pressed , from within a state list, Android will look for the appropriate file for that drawable, according to the environment ( drawable-*dpi/btn_pressed.png ). As you can see, although the state list is the same on LDPI, MDPI and HDPI, the drawables referenced within it could change.
