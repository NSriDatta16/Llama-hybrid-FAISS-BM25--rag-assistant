Understanding Java as a Delphi programmer

I have a database I have created in Delphi that’s still in the testing phase I found it easy to give access to my database through Java in the form of a *.dll but this is not just a standard database (its very cutting edge with Nodes). It’s taken me a lot of learning to get to this point. I very much appreciate the help and thanks of this forum and the replies I have received to my questions to get me hear. What it very exciting at the moment is Android devices and to write in java But I know nearly nothing about Java. The developers are like five times more busy than Delphi. The Google apps web page is averaging about 40 hits a day and thats only a part of java. I want to make it accessible to the Maven approach to using databases that I have no documentation on how to do this yet. I know I have ShortIntegers, LongIntegers, I'm not sure about strings that originate as ANSCI but can be UTRF-8 and other things. Do I have double numbers and do I have date records. Do I have any other type data types in java Can any one enlighten me please.
