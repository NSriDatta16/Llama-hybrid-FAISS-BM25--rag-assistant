Which data needs to be collected and what to do with it. I need step by step process with explanation for understanding.

I sell a given product through 1000 shops & average revenue for that product is 2400 dollars per week per shop, with a standard deviation of 3100 dollars. I want to analyze, the offer ' three for the price of two' would be effective on my revenue or not, if it's introduced in 50 shops. I understand that I should take average of 50 shops. But after that, I am not sure. How to go about it? .
