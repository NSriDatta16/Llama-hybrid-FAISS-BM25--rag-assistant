"Higher is better" is a bad rule of thumb for R-square. Don Morrison wrote some famous articles a few years back demonstrating that R-squares approaching zero could still both actionable and profitable, depending on the industry. For instance, in direct marketing predicting response to a magazine subscription mailing to 10 million households, R-squares in the low single digits can produce profitable campaigns (on an ROI basis) if the mailing is based on the top 2 or 3 deciles of response likelihood. Another sociologist (whose name escapes me) segmented R-squares by data type noting that wrt survey research, R-squares in the 10-20% range were the norm, whereas for business data, R-squares in the 40-60% range were to be expected. They went on to remark that R-squares of 80-90% or greater were probably in violation of fundamental regression assumptions. However, this author had no experience with marketing mix, time series data or models containing a full set of "causal" features (e.g., the classic 4 "Ps" of price, promotion, place and product) which can and will produce R-squares approaching 100%. That said, even sensible, benchmarking rules of thumb such as these aren't terribly helpful when dealing with the technically illiterate whose first question about a predictive model will always be, "What's the R-square?"
