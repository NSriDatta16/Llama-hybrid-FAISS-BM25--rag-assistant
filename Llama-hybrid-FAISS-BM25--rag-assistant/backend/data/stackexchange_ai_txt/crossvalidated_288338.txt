Rationale for model selection in machine learning

Although the choice of machine learning algorithms is more of an art than a science, a few common guidelines have been compiled on the matter, namely this diagram from scikit-learn as well as this comparison table . However, the more I stare at those guidelines, the more I am confused as to the rationale behind them. Is there a comprehensive document that explains the why behind model selection? For example, why does the scikit-learn diagram state that an SGD classifier is better than a linear SVC when one has more than 100K samples, etc.?
