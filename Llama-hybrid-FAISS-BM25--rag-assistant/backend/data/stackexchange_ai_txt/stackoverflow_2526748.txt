No. You need the second process to be executed from the first (i.e. the one setting the environment variables). Have you thought about embedding the script setting the env variables in the second process ? getting the first process to set the environment variables, dump them out, and have the Java process read them and set the variables whilst invoking the second process (via Runtime.exec ) .
