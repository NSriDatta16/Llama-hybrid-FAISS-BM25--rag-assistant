Is it possible to have "movable"/"draggable" components like JButtons, JTextFields in a JFrame?

Basically I plan to place some buttons, textfields, labels, etc. on a JFrame and I would like to make it possible that a user can move the different components around on that JFrame with the mouse. I have seen various ways with MouseListeners, subclassed JComponent code, DropSource/DropTarget implementations and so on, but I'm unsure which is the "recommended" way (I don't need to support "drag and drop" between different Frames/Applications which is what most examples seem to do).
