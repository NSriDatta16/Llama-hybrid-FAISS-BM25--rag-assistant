After wasting an hour, I got it done - VS 2010 ... VS 2017 ( this article helped): In your Deployment Project go to File System Editor Click on "Application Folder" (I assume you have "Primary Output" from your projects there) Right click on "Primary Output" of the project you want to target with your shortcut - select "Create Shortcut to Primary Output ..." Rename shortcut Drag shortcut to Desktop / Programs Menu folder That's it!
