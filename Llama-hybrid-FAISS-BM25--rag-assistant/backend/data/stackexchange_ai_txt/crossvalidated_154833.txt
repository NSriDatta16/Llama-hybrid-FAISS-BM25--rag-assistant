Choice of discrete, non-monotonic response model

Suppose I have data from coin-flip experiments done in differenet conditions X. I want to estimate P(X), the probability of getting heads. What I would normaly do is try logistic regression, where I assume $P(X) = \frac{1}{1+e^{\beta (X-X_0)}}$, but in this case I know for sure that the probability is not monotnonic in X. In fact, I'm specifically looking for the value of X which maximizes P(X). Is there a standard way of doing this, or do I have to make up my own model, such as $P(X) = \frac{1}{1+e^{\beta (X-X_0)^2}}$ ?
