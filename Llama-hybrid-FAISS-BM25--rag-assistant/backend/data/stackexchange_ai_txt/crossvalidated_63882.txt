Scaling a normal distribution while using EWMA

I have a time series of daily data and am assuming each point in the time series is normally distributed. If I have a distribution of the daily data and want to scale this to cover a month (30 days) I believe I just scale the standard deviation by square root of 30. I think this assumes the data points are independently distributed. If I use an exponentially weighted moving average to calculate the standard deviation can I still scale the daily data to monthly by multiplying by square root 30?
