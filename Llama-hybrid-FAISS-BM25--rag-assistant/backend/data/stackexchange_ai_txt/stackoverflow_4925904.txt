It depends. Speaking personally, I'd be satisfied to test all boundary conditions. So both cases where it is true, but making one item false would make the overall result false, and all 4 false cases where making one item true would make the overall result true. But that is a judgment call, and I wouldn't fault someone who did all 16 cases. Incidentally if you unit tested one true case and one false one, code coverage tools would say that you have 100% coverage.
