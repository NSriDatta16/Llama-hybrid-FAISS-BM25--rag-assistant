I would look at how much the user costs to acquire and then ask what is the cost for implementing a really good system. Keep in mind that users are a biological retry method. "I'm bored... press reload again..." While, this isn't the most perfect solution, it is sometimes acceptable vs the cost comparsion for "not lose anything - ever". If you want additional security, you can have your sessions cached to a separate set of memcache servers so there are no accidental flushes. :) There are a number of other systems membase.org, and some other persistent memcache solutions (java implementations) that will persist storage to disk. If you want to modify your client somewhat, or how you access memcache, you can do your own replication of memcache session objects. -daniel
