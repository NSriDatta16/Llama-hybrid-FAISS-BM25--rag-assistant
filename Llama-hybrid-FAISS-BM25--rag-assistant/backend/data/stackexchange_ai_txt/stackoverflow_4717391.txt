Clean way to pass parameters between JavaScript events?

I have values I would like to keep in memory when certain events fire, like when a user is dragging and I want to save the element index. The value is needed when another event might fire. I don't know if it will ever fire. I am using global variables to keep these values around. It seems there are better ways to do this like putting these values in an object with a namespace. Benefits? Any other suggestions?
