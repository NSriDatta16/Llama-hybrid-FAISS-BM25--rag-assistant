How exactly have you deleted it. If you haven't made any changes to you disks file system since then (and not defraged) then its possible the file will still be sitting on the disk as windows doesn't delete the file completely, just the File Handle. Have a look at something like this and you may be able to recover the .mdf/.ldf files from your HD. http://www.undelete.com/file-recovery.aspx If not, you'll have to restore from your last back. And if you don't have a backup... you're screwed.
