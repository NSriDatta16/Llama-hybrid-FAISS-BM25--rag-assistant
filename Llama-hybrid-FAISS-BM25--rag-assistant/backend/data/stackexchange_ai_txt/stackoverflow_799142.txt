UDP is a connectionless protocol. Sending data over UDP can get to the receiver, but can also get lost during transmission. UDP is ideal for things like broadcasting and streaming audio or video (i.e. a dropped packet is never a problem in those situations.) So if you need to ensure your data gets to the other side, stick with TCP. UDP has less overhead than TCP and is therefore faster. (TCP needs to build a connection first and also checks data packets for data corruption which takes time.) Fragmented UDP packets (i.e. packets bigger than about half a Kb) will probably be dropped by routers, so split your data into small chuncks before sending it over. (In some cases, the OS can take care of that.) Note that it is allways a packet that might make it, or not. Half packets aren't processed. Latency over long distances can be quite big. If you want to do retransmission of data, I would go with something like 5 to 10 times the agerage latency time over the current connection. (You can measure the latency by sending and receiving a few packets.) Hope this helps.
