Even though you asked specifically for C or Java, Erlang isn't a bad choice of language if this is just a learning exercise It allows you to do multiprocess style programming very very easily and it has a large set of libraries that let you dive in at just about any level you like. It was built for distributed programming in a very pragmatic way. If you are comfortable with java, the transition shouldn't be too difficult. If you are interested, I would recommend the book, "Programming Erlang" by Joe Armstrong. (as a note: there are other languages designed to run on in highly parallel environments like Haskell. Erlang just tends to be more pragmatic than languages like Haskell which are rooted more in theory)
