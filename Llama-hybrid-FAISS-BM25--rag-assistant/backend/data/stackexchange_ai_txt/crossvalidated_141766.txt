$E(X)E(1/X) \leq (a + b)^2 / 4ab$

I've worked on the following problem and have a solution (included below), but I would like to know if there are any other solutions to this problem, especially more elegant solutions that apply well known inequalities. QUESTION : Suppose we have a random variable s.t. $P(a Show that $E(X)E(\frac{1}{X}) \le \frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab}$ Hint : find constant c and d s.t. $\frac{1}{x} \le cx+d$ when $a MY SOLUTION : For a line $cx+d$ that cuts through $\frac{1}{X}$ at the points x=a and x = b, it's easy to show that $ c = - \frac{1}{ab} $ and $d = \frac{a+b}{ab} $, So, $ \frac{1}{X} \le - \frac{1}{ab} X + \frac{a+b}{ab} $, and therefore: $$ E(\frac{1}{X}) \le - \frac{1}{ab} E(X) + \frac{a+b}{ab} $$ $$ abE(\frac{1}{X}) + E(X) \le (a+b) $$ Now, because both sides of the inequality are positive, it follows that: $$ [abE(\frac{1}{X}) + E(X)]^2 \le (a+b)^2 $$ $$ (ab)^2E(\frac{1}{X})^2 + 2abE(\frac{1}{X})E(X) + E(X)^2 \le (a+b)^2 $$ Then, for the LHS, we can see that $2abE(\frac{1}{X})E(X) \le (ab)^2E(\frac{1}{X})^2 + E(X)^2$ because $0 \le (ab)^2E(\frac{1}{X})^2 - 2abE(\frac{1}{X})*E(X) + E(X)^2 = [abE(\frac{1}{X}) - E(X)]^2 $ SO, $$ 4abE(\frac{1}{X})E(X) \le (ab)^2E(\frac{1}{X})^2 + 2abE(\frac{1}{X})E(X) + E(X)^2 \le (a+b)^2 $$ and therefore: $$ E(\frac{1}{X})E(X) \le \frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab} $$ Q.E.D. Thanks for any additional solutions you might be able to provide. Cheers!
