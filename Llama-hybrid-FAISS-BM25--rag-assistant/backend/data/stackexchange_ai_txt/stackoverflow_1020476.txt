Use a vector for this (because by the sounds of it you won't need to ever edit the list in the future - and you need random access). You can do it like this: class PointerList { private: typedef std::vector IntPtrVector; IntPtrVector m_ptrVec; public: PointerList() { m_ptrVec.reserve(5); for (int i = 0; i EDIT Though to be honest this reeks of ghettoness. Are you sure your problem requires this solution? If you elaborate more on your specific problem, in another question perhaps, I'm sure you can get some better answer on how to accomplish what you want more elegantly - rather then by creating a second problem.
