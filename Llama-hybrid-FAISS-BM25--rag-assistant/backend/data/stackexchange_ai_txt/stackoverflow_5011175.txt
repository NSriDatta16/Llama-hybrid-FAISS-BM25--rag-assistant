You can't (easily) embed an MD5 of a program inside the program that it is computing the MD5, because when you change the MD5 of that you are embedding, the program's MD5 changes. Loop for a while and eventually you may reach a stable point. Then again, you may not. "a while" typically means 2^128 steps, so that's going to be a very long while --- like after the sun becomes a red giant. So there's a trick. When the program computes its own MD5, it specifically recognizes where the embedded MD5 is located and uses a set value, like all NULLs. To make it harder for hackers, don't use all NULLs --- use a SALT value. Obfuscate that value in your binary. Now it will be harder for people to edit the embedded MD5 and "fix" it after they have edited your program.
