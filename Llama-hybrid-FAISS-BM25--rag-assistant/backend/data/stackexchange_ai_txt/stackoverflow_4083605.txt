The following headers have always worked well for me (for HTTP/1.1). You should not need Pragma: no-cache. Cache-Control: no-cache Expires: Vary: * Try changing your Vary value to the asterisk from my example. Per http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.44 : "A Vary field value of "*" implies that a cache cannot determine from the request headers of a subsequent request whether this response is the appropriate representation."
