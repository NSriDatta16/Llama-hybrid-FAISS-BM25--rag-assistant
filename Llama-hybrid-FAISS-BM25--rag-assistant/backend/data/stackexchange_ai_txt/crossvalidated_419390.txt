You can consider an appropriate regression model which will be able to handle various features of your data. I would suggest generalized least squares , a type of regression which allows for correlation between the residuals. Given you are working with time series data it is very likely your residuals will be correlated across time (i.e. periods of unexpectedly high sales are likely to be followed by more periods of high sales). Within this regression model I would suggest the following which address your various requirements: Cannibalization by Y : create dummy variables for when item Y is being discounted. Discounts for X : create dummy variables for when item X is being discounted. Seasonality : an easy way to deal with this is to create dummy variables for each month, and maybe also dummy variables related to if it is just before a major holiday. From this model you will be able to estimate the effect which putting item X on sale has on its sales (based on the coefficient attached to the X discount dummy variable). Also by fitting an appropriate time series model to the residuals (possibly an ARMA model) you could forecast future sales.
