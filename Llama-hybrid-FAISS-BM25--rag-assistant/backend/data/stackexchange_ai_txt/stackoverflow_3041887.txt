You can get the item in the stop event and check that it came from the draggable (it doesn't have a handle attached, which it would if it was from the sortable), like this: $("#mySortableList").sortable({ stop: function(event, ui) { //check it wasn't here previously if(!ui.item.data('tag') && !ui.item.data('handle')) { ui.item.data('tag', true); //tag new draggable drops alert("this is the dropped item: " + ui.item.toString()); } }).disableSelection(); You can see a demo to play/test with here , since a handle doesn't get added, at least not in a way that matters, we're tagging items dropped from the draggable so that they won't fire the alert again when moved inside the sortable.
