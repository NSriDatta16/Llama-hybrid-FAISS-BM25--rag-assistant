We use free style projects and don't have this problem, so as indicated, this may be the source of your problem. To provide the merging features, we created our own artifact repository (we aren't using Maven). At the end of each build, we copy the cobertura.ser file to a network share, renaming it in the process. We have a consolidated view job that copies all of the cobertura files and the source code files (another build artifact copied to the network share) into the local build directory and generate the Cobertura report. The lack of a standard artifact repository within Hudson is a bit frustrating, but it makes sense give the authors typically use Maven for those needs. Our build process runs over multiple servers so we can't just use relative paths into the other job directories. Note, we do the same thing for other metrics: test results, JavaNCSS, ect. and joined either using the correct tools or some custom code. We use the same repository for traditional build artifacts: DLLs, JARs, installation scripts.
