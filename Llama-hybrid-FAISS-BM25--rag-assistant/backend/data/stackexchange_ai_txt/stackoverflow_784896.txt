I think the asymmetric key is an elegant solution - but a username/password is almost certainly going to be easier to implement. If you're building your own site then you are just doing it for kicks (otherwise you'd be using WordPress, Drupal, Django, etc.) so why not do things differently? You might find that having to carry around your keymat app might get a little restrictive, if you find yourself wanting to blog but without the means to identify yourself. But, that said, @Kurt has the right idea for crypto - DIY is almost certainly going to be worse than using something already tried and tested.
