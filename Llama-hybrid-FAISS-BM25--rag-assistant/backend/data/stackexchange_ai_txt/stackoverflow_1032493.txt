I don't see any code issues here. Some possibilities: you ran the C# code in debug mode perhaps? There was an issue with the file caching. The C# data file operated on a heavily fragmented disk area. I wouldn't expect half speed for such a simple C# program as this. Edit: I tried both version on a 10439 byte blah.txt. The generated file was 1 043 900 bytes long. C# (CTRL+F5) time was 18 seconds C# (F5) time was 22 seconds Java time was 17 seconds. Both applications ate about 40% CPU time, half of it was kernel time. Edit2: The CPU bound is due that the code is constantly opening, closing and writing small chunks of data. This causes a lot of managed-native and user-kernel mode transitions. My system spec: Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz, 2 GB 800MHz RAM, WinXP SP3
