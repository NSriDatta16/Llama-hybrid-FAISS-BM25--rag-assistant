Here you go: p {direction:rtl;padding-right:100px;text-indent:-100px;} This sets the css direction to be from right to left. Then add right padding to indent the whole thing from the right Then use a negative indent that causes the first line to be "outdented" Your content and text-flow is still left to right (i.e. breaks on the right), it just interprets the css (e.g. paragraph text-indent) on the other side. Here's my code: http://jsbin.com/ukese5/7
