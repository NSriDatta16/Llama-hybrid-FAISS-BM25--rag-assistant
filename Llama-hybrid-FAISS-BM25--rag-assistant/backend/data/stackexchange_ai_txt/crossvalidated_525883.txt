How to properly display technical replicates in figures?

Let's say there was an experiment with two groups that I'd like to compare, both with three biological* (n = 3) and three technical* (N = 3) replicates each. For statistical analysis, I'd average the technical replicates in advance (meaning that three values for each group remain) and then only compare the means. (I know it's a small sample size but let's please ignore that aspect here.) Now I was wondering if it's legitimate to display individual measurements from technical replicates in figures or if it's rather misleading? Below you will find an example (data is made up) including all individual measurements (left side) and averaged technical replicates (right side). On the one hand, I believe that including all individual measurements will give the reader additional information about the obtained data. On the other hand, I think that illustration might be misleading as I'm using the averages for statistical analyses. Is there one "right" way to display the data? Is there an alternative that shows the variation both among technical replicates and among biological replicates? *biological replicates: measurements of distinct biological samples, e.g. three different animals to assess biological variation technical replicates: repeated measurements of the same sample to assess variation in the method (e.g. acquiring data from the same animal three times)
