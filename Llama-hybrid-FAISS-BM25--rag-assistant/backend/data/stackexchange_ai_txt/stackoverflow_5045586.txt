Resets: I think yes, some dislike them, so it's up to you to figure out which one you like Split vs. Unified files: Depends. There are advantages to both ( chorus: advantages, advantages!) One CSS file is easier to browse, and you can clearly find relationships in a single file. Then again, if you have planned the structure of your site, are developing compartmentalized widgets, or have lots of people working on the CSS committing files, a decentralized method might benefit you. With multiple CSS files, you can always use a compressor to serve them to the client as a single file, so it's more of a maintenence question. Large Files / Line Count: Are you saying you have 2,000 CSS files (holy crap!) or 2,000 line CSS files? Both aren't great, although the latter can be managed quite easily in an IDE that provides outlines and handles inheritance for you.The former...well, at least you have job security. Parent Definitions: Again, no right answer. The CSS rules for a small site will vary greatly from an enterprise level site. A good starting point might be checking out how jQueryUI handles styles and then forming your own opinion from there. Correct Selectors: Steve Souders talked about optimizing CSS selectors , coming to the conclusion that's it not worth it for your average site. So ignoring CSS optimization and based on your example, I'd say the second one is waaaay easier to maintain and ultimately far more predictable. If you HTML changes even slightly, the first one will break quickly. The second won't, and is far more portable. There are things you can do in CSS to make your life easier. I highly recommend using a grid system for layout ( blueprint , 960GS , etc). I personally like using a reset since it makes pixel perfect designs easier to manage. Other than that, research what people like Eric Meyers or site likes alistapart.com or smashingmagazine.com have to say on the topic. tl;dr - there is no right answer, but definitely some good options
