Unit testing date sensitive functions?

I am trying to write tests for a date helper class. I am wondering what is best practice for this. Here is an example in PHP. public static function get_date($offset = 0){ $date = mktime(0, 0, 0, date('m') , date('d') + $offset, date('Y')); return array( 'day' => date('D',$date), 'month' => date('M',$date), 'year' => date('Y',$date) ); } public static function today(){ return self::get_date(); } public static function tomorrow(){ return self::get_date(1); } public static function yesterday(){ return self::get_date(-1); } So what I am looking for is examples of tests that could test these functions or a new way to write these functions so they are intuitively testable. I have found examples in Java but they seem pretty inelegant and I really don't know Java, unless you count Actionscript 3 as Java ;) Solutions in Javascript or Ruby would also be super helpful as examples but my class is written in PHP so that would be ideal. Thanks!
