Problem with dragging mouse cursor with Python

Could someone tell me why this doesn't work? def selectAndCopy(x,y,z,w): ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(x,y) time.sleep(1) win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0, 0) time.sleep(1) ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(z,w) time.sleep(1) win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0, 0) time.sleep(1) shell.SendKeys('^c') the code isn't dragging to the first location to the second, it's only moving it.
