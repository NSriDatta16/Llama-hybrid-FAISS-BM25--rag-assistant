NLP project, python or C++

We are working on Arabic Natural Language Processing project, we have limited our choices to either write the code in Python or C++ (and Boost library). We are thinking of these points: Python Slower than C++ (There is ongoing work to make Python faster) Better UTF8 support Faster in writing tests and trying different algorithms C++ Faster than Python Familiar code, every programmer knows C or C-like code After the project is done, it should be not very hard to port the project to another programming languages. What do you think is better and suitable for the project?
