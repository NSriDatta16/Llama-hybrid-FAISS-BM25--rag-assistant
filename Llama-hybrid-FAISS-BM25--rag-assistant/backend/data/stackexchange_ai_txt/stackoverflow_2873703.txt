I can say that I know of a wxWidgets application that reads Excel .xls and .xlsx files on any platform. For the .xlsx files we used an XML parser and zip stream reader and grab the data we need, pretty easy to get going. For the .xls files we used: ExcelFormat , which works well and we found the author to be very generous with his support. Maybe just some encouragement to give it a go? It was a couple of days work to get working.
