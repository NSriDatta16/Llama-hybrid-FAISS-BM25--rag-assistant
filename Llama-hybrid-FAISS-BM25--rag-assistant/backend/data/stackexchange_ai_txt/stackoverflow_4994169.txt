Loading a 3D Model outside the XNA Game class

I'm embedding my XNA Game inside a winforms' control. Because of this, I need to subclass Control, not Game. How can I still load models from my content Project? This is my code as I have it: namespace KinectGraphics.XNAEmbedding { class XNARenderControl : GraphicsDeviceControl { Game selfGame; public XNARenderControl() { selfGame = new Game(); } protected void LoadContent() { // Create a new SpriteBatch, which can be used to draw textures. spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice); // TODO: use this.Content to load your game content here model = selfGame.Content.Load ("Ka-60"); //model = Content.Load ("earth"); //model = Content.Load ("3dm-tie-f-gt"); } However, when execution reaches the selfGame.Content.Load, it throws ContentLoadException: Error loading "Ka-60". File not found. What can I do to load the model anyway?
