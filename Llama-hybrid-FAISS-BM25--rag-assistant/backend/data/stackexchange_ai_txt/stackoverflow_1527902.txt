PHP's Session Storage

I'm having some trouble understanding PHP's sessions. First off I am saving session data in a database, I used PHP's session_set_save_handler() function to define that. The way I understand when PHP saves the session data to the DB is like so: If I define some session variables then output some text to the user's browser, I believe the session data is not saved to the DB until after the text is output. Please look at this bit of code: $_SESSION['username'] = $username; //check if session variable set if($_SESSION['username'] != $username) { die('error...'); } In the code the if statement returns false so die() never occurs. Also PHP does not write the session data to the DB until after the if statement. What I don't understand is if the session data is not written to the DB yet, how is PHP comparing $_SESSION['username'] to $username ? Is $_SESSION['username'] stored in server memory until the end of the script when session data is written to the DB? Thank you for your time.
