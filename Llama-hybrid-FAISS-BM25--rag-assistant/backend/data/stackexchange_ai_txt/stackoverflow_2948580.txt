You need a code coverage program (gcov, bullseye, dev partner) and unit-testing (unittest++, cppunit, etc.). You write test that will test that function. TEST( UnitTestFunction ) { CHECK( function(true) == 55 ); CHECK( function(false) == 120 ); } Then unit tests in this case do not just check for integrity (though they still do) but they also test for coverage.
