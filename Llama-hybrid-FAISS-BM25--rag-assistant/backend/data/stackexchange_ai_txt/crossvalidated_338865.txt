I think that it could be useful to model the biomarker (log) concentration before using it as a predictor variable. Probably the best would be a Longitudinal mixed effect models. Thereafter it could be possible to use specific pharmacokinetic parameters as predictors of disease status. For example a popular PK parameter is the AUC (Area Under the Curve of the concentration against time not to be confused with the AUC-ROC curve). Finally using the baseline covariates and AUC you could build one of the many available binary classifiers: logistic regression, Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine to name a few. To end, you can evaluate the predictive performance of the classifier now yes using the AUC ROC curve. I hope it helps,
