How to obtain a confidence interval or a measure of prediction dispersion when using xgboost for classification?

How to obtain a confidence interval or a measure of prediction dispersion when using xgboost for classification? So for example, if xgboost predicts a probability of an event is 0.9, how can the confidence in that probability be obtained? Also is this confidence assumed to be heteroskedastic?
