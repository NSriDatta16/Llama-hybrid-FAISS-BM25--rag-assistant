Project JAR file structure when using JPA

I am not sure what the most appropriate way to handle JPA objects that are shared using a JAR file to multiple projects. ie If you have multiple projects that all have an Employee and Contact and Address objects, and you want to put them in a JAR file, how does this work. ie Employee.jar jpa/EMF.class jpa/Employee.class jpa/Contact.class jpa/Address.class jpa/Organisation.class META-INF/persistence.xml Project 1 src/jpa/EMF.java src/jpa/BlogEntry.java src/jpa/Comment.java src/META-INF/persistence.xml lib/Employee.jar Project 2 src/jpa/EMF.java src/jpa/Stock.java src/jpa/Transaction.java src/META-INF/persistence.xml lib/Employee.jar How does this work, is it ok to have two persistence.xml files like above? ie One for describing the JPA classes in the Employee.jar file, and another one for the project specific JPA classes? Also, the Employee.jar file should not specify the JDBC url, as each project will be using a dfiferent database or schema. If the JDBC connection properties are only specified in the projects src/META-INF/persistence.xml will the Employee.jar classes pick up those settings?
