Every Markov Chain can be viewed as a random walk. If you're implementing MCMC, you don't need to explicitly specify or know the transition function(matrix), as Greenparker suggested, M-H algorithm is a common technique, which allows you achieve the stationary distribution. If you know and prescribe transition matrix beforehand, then you could just keep doing multiplication till convergence, I don't think MCMC would be necessary in this scenario.
