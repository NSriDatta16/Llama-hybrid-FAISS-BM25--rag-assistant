Integrating over the rejection region to find average probability of Type II error for a range of values

In Wackerly Mathematical Statistics the author states that you can only compute the probability of a Type II error for a single given specific value in the rejection region. Wouldn't it be possible to integrate over a range of values in the rejection region and find the average probability of a type II error?
