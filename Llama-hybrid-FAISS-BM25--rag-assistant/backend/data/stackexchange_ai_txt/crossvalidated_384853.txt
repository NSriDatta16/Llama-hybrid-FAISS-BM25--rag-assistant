In the following picture, you can see, there are two outliers, if some-how, we can fit a closed curve around blue dots, then we can detect the outliers. Now, how can we do that? One simple approach is one-class-SVM $$min_{R,C} |R|^2 + \dfrac{1}{\nu n}\sum_i\zeta_i$$ subject to $$||X-C||^2 = 0$$ Intuition behind the objective function is that fit a circle, with optimal radius and center, with not many mistake. That can possibly eliminate those data-points that are very far from other(dense area). Note: with the use of kernels, we can fit any curve instead of circle.
