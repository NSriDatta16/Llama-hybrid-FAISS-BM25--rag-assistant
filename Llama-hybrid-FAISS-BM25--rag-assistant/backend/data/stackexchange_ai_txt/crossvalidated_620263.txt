What are some typical questions we can ask about the result of two university exams with a third final one yet to come?

I'm trying to understand the performance of students on an on-going university course. I built a histogram of grades of two exams of the same course. Here's the first exam. It seems to me that there's a relevant portion of the students that are not doing well at all and the rest seems to show something that seems expected (a cluster around the average). Here's the distribution of the second exam. It seems that the students improved considerably. What questions can I ask (that I can easily answer from the grades) that would allow me to get some safe conclusions of the performance of the course? I've computed the averages and the standard deviation in both exams. The first exam has an average of 4.51 and standard deviation of 3.08. The second has an average of 6.33 and standard deviation of 3.20. One more question, if I may. I'd like to forecast how many students are going to pass. As a simple method (which I need because my skills are null here), I'm thinking about just making the second exam's grades as the third exam grades and see what happens. In other words, suppose the performance on the third is the same as on the second. I can also suppose the third will be like the first --- and then take the average of the two suppositions as one third forecast. (Thank you!)
