Logistic regression with samples as the independent variable would be a useful way to proceed. Reshape the data so that there is one row per read, with a 0 value for wild type and 1 for mutant in the first column, and a second column identifying the sample. Your null hypothesis then is a particular pre-specified contrast of the tumor sample against the mean of the controls, avoiding multiple-comparison issues. This has some advantages: it reduces to chi-square when there is only 1 tumor and 1 control, it takes differences in total counts among samples into account, it generalizes to multinomial regression if you want to consider all 4 bases at the position instead of just mutant/wild-type, and it allows for testing differences among the controls. See this page for further discussion of this approach. That said, I'm still concerned about biological interpretation of the results if you don't have a normal-DNA match for the tumor.
