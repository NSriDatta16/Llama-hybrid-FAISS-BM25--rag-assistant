Variable keeps changing after function is assigned to event handler

I have a bunch of elements on a page, all of whose ID's are stored in an array called ids[] . I have initialized a third-party DOM script for each of these divs that detects when the element has been dragged. The next step is to assign a function to the onDrag event of each element. For simplicity's sake, I'd simply like to show a popup dialog that states the ID of the element that was dragged. I am iterating through my array as follows: for (i=0;i This all seems well and good, but toggling the drag event of any of my elements causes a dialog to popup that states the ID of the last element in the array. In other words, it looks like the above function in my iteration is always being evaluated for the last index in my array. I feel like I am missing something very simple here but this issue is driving me nuts.
