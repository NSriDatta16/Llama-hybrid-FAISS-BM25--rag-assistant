I am sure researchers in information extraction have looked at this problem, but I couldn't find a paper. One thing you can try is do it as a two step process. (1) after collecting as much data as you can, extract features, some features that come to mind: number of numbers that appear in the string, number of numbers from 1-31 that appear in the string, number of numbers from 1-12 that appear in the string, number of months names that appear in the string, and so on. (2) learn from the features using some type of binary classification method (SVM for example) and finally (3) when a new string comes by, extract the features and query the SVM for a prediction.
