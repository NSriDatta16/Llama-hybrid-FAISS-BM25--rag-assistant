A method that uses machine operation data to predict how many days until this machine will fail

Suppose there is a machine that operates every day, and time series data of its operating conditions can be obtained for each day. In this case, I want to use machine learning or etc. to detect when the machine is showing signs of failure and how many days later it will fail. What is the most common way to do this? Is it common to use supervised learning to perform a regression that outputs the number of days after a certain data using the data where a failure occurred? I think there is a problem with handling the case where no failure occurs. Also, if it is difficult to accurately predict how many days later a machine will fail because the variance is relatively large from machine to machine, what is the general approach? Is it reasonable to train the model as a classification problem with a certain range of time, such as one week, two weeks, etc.?
