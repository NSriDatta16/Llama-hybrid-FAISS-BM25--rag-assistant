First, let me tell you that the design goal of ClickOnce deployment is not to require administrative privileges. This translates into "you can't elevate privileges when running a ClickOnce application". When Windows Vista came out, Microsoft published guidelines on where to store files that you want to be able to update. NOTHING should be placed in Program Files; they generally recommend LocalApplicationData or Isolated Storage. The same issues are in place for Windows 7. So where are you trying to write data for your customer?
