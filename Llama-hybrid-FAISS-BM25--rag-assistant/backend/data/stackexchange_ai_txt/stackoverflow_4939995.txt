I have found out via testing about our issues. One question I had for you, is how are you starting the script? Is it started from logging on the machine and starting a terminal in the Mac OSX desktop screen? Or are you ssh'ing into the Mac and starting it from there. On our daemon that was trying to use the Window Manager (firefox), if we started it via the Terminal.app from the logged in user. It would work fine. If we ssh'd in to start the script (which happens when you use Capistrano to start it) it would work fine until that ssh session was stopped. In the Console you can see the logs: 2/7/11 8:32:13 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[22] Session 0x22058d0 destroyed 2/7/11 8:32:13 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[22] Session 0x22058d0 dead 2/7/11 8:32:13 PM com.apple.SecurityServer[22] Killing auth hosts This happens after we terminate the SSH session. After it terminates, we would get the errors like you did: abort() called LaunchServices: GetOurLSSessionIDInit() returned err #1, securitySessionID == 0x0, vers=10600000 uid=501 euid=501 Instead of starting the script via ssh, we now have a LaunchAgent which will start the script based on WatchPaths with a ~/jobs/ directory. It works out well, and we can still restart the server with capistrano. I would look in your logs to see if the SecurityServer is destroying a session right about the time the script fails. If so, then maybe you can figure out what is causing the timeout.
