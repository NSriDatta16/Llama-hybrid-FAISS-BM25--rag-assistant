If you drag-drop the image directly into IE7 does it display correctly? If it does, then the issue isn't with the image but it's with your HTML or the CSS. I don't have IE7 here so can't test directly, but I can recommend a simple approach to troubleshooting: Remove the CSS styles one-by-one until the image renders in all of your target browsers. That should tell you what is causing the issue (hopefully the reason why will then be relatively easy to fathom)
