PHP Application platform

I'm going to be starting a new project soon, and was having some thoughts. These are the requirements: it's going to be built in PHP it will need to be able to support plugin modules/components. These can be thought of as mini applications. users will be able to log in, and depending on a number of things, they will have access to different components it will need to be able to respond to HTTP requests in a number of formats, eg: html, xml, json, pdf - that is, it will use the MVC pattern I'm not sure what the right term for this piece of software is, but I'm calling it an Application Platform, or an Application Framework, but this isn't anything like CakePHP, Kohana or Zend - it's another level higher than that. When I was given these requirements, I began thinking that Joomla 1.5 would actually satisfy all these criteria. After ripping out a lot of the defaults to make it less CMS-centric and more component-centric, I figure that it might work. My concern though is that I might be using Joomla for something it was never intended, and that there is something else out there which would be better suited from the get-go. Are there any other PHP "application platforms" which I should take a look at? Do you have any comments or suggestions about the idea?
