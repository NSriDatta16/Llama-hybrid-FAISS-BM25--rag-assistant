Object oriented design

Currently developing a game for console. In a later stage will develop it to windows interface. Would like to know about the following things: 1. Currently I have some several classes which are holding the game logic. I also have a class for managing the whole game and a class which is managing the view for the console which is using the game manager. The class which is managing the view is being accessed through Program class (with void main) Question is : In a matter of Access modifiers which should I use for each class of the above (in general), should I use internal or public? Consider that I want this to be suitable for any later implementation without changing the code of the logical part of the game. 2.a.In matter of code organization to NameSpaces or Projects, how should it be organized? Should I create two Namespaces(projects) under the same solution: One will hold the game logical classes, second the program class and the class which manages the view for console? b.And how the access modifiers should be now in accordance to an arrangement like this? Sorry for the long story Thanks
