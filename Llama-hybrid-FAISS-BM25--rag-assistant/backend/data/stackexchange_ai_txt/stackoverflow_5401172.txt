thread_specific_ptr uses pthread_setspecific / pthread_getspecific for POSIX systems which is not the fastest possible. If you are on a POSIX system, you can use the __thread storage specifier. However, it can only be used with initializers that are constant expressions e.g gcc's __thread For Windows, a similar specifier is _declspec(thread) .
