lowUpperBound = your idea till which percentage code should be covered to be regarded as low. By default everything below 35 is low. You specified everything below 50 as low meaning your tests will be harder to get out of the red. highUpperBound = the same as lowUpperBound but for the minimum percentage the coverage should have before you regard it as high coverage. By default it is 70. So again you made your code statistically more difficult to qualify. More information is available in the manual .
