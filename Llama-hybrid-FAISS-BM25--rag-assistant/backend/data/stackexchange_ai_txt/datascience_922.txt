Can I classify set of documents using classifying method using limited number of concepts ?

I have set of documents and I want classify them to true and false My question is I have to take the whole words in the documents then I classify them depend on the similarity words in these documents or I can take only some words that I interested in then I compare it with the documents. Which one is more efficient in classify document and can work with SVM.
