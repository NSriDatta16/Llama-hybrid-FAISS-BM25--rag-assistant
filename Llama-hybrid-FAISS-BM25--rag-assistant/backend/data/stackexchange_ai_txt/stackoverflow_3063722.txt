Build off of the 1.6 SDK. It added a whole bunch of stuff you will probably want such as Gestures , Graphics scaling , screen resolution support , hardware feature specification (so that you can say that you only want to be used on a device that has an accelerometer for example), and more. If you want multi-touch, you need to use the 2.0 or newer SDK (only 2.1 is available for download actually)... All versions are backwards compatible for the most part. So if you wrote an application with the 1.6 SDK, you could target 2.0 as well (via the manifest tag ). Fragmentation is an issue. However, since 1.6, you have the ability to restrict what "requirements" your application must have (Hardware, software, screen size, version). The market will automatically filter the app from those devices that don't meet those requirements.
