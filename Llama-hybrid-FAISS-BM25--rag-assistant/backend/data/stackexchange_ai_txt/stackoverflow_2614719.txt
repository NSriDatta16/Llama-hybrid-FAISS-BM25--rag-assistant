How do I get the SharedPreferences from a PreferenceActivity in Android?

I am using a PreferenceActivity to show some settings for my application. I am inflating the settings via a xml file so that my onCreate (and complete class methods) looks like this: public class FooActivity extends PreferenceActivity { @Override public void onCreate(Bundle icicle) { super.onCreate(icicle); addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.preference); } } The javadoc of PreferenceActivity PreferenceFragment states that These preferences will automatically save to SharedPreferences as the user interacts with them. To retrieve an instance of SharedPreferences that the preference hierarchy in this activity will use, call getDefaultSharedPreferences(android.content.Context) with a context in the same package as this activity. But how I get the name of the SharedPreference in another Activity? I can only call getSharedPreferences(name, mode) in the other activity but I need the name of the SharedPreference which was used by the PreferenceActivity. What is the name or how can i retrieve it?
