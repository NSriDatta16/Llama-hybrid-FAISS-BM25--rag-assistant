For the sake of explanation, suppose you have a simple mixed model with a fixed treatment effect and a random subject effect. Suppose further that there are 3 treatment levels A, B, C, and 10 subjects. The mixed model is $$ \mathbf{y = X\boldsymbol \beta + Z \boldsymbol \gamma + \boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ where $X\boldsymbol \beta$ is the linear fixed-effects component, $\mathbf{Z}$ is the additional design matrix corresponding the the random-effects parameters, $\boldsymbol \gamma$ . Interpretation to fixed effect: Suppose we use treatment C as the reference level. Then the fixed effect $\beta_A$ tells us what the change in $y$ would be given a subject $i$ compared to subject $i$ 's own average $\bar{y_i}$ , due to treatment A. You are almost correct in interpreting the fixed-effect, except that the "as compared to i's average x" part is not quite right. It is comparing to 1-unit change in $x$ if continuous, or different levels change if $x$ is categorical. It is not compared to average of $x$ . Interpretation of the random effect: The random effect $\gamma_i$ tells us what the additional change in $y$ would be due to subject $i$ itself, regardless of any change due to either treatment effect. Hope this is clear to you.
