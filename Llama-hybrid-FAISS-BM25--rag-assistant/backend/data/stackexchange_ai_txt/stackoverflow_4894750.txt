There's several aspects to consider. Do the source and destination machines share the same endianess . If they are both x86 based, then the answer would be yes. Do they share the same OS ? Do they share storage ? Are they on the same network ? Does the destination machine already have Oracle installed ? Is it the same version/release of Oracle ? Is it the same Edition of Oracle ? What is the data volume ? What downtime are you allowed ? In the easiest scenario (same OS/endianess/shared storage/Oracle release/Oracle edition) then you should be able to simply shut down the instance on the old machine and start up one on the new machine In the most complex (different endianess/no shared storage or network/different Oracle release and edition) then an import/export is probably the only practical solution.
