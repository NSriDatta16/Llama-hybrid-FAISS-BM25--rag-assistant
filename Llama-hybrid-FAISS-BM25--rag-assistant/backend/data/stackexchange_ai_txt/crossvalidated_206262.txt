Hi thanks to lots of hints by Kamil Bart√≥n, i ended up with the following procedure: M.global Note: when using glmmadmb(family="nbinom2") the use of type="response" is not possible, but type="link" is. You could take the exp() of fit, SE, lwr, and upr, afterwards in the newdata frame. The plots can be produced by: p1 Don't foget to re-standadize z transformed predictor variables in the final newdata frame. i.e.: x Now I am just wondering, why calculation of confidence intervals from single general linear mixed models (GLMMs) are so intensively discussed. Often you hear that you need complicated bootstrap methods or MarkovChainMonteCarlo (MCMC) algorithms to produce confidence intervals. Very, very complex for non-mathematicians. And even the function confint() takes much longer to calculate profile confidence intervals from a single mixed models than does from type=averaging model objects. Probably this is a Question of Accuracy and the se.fit = TRUE method is the least accurate? Furthermore i don't know if a correction method for Confidence intervals is included in the procedure presented here.
