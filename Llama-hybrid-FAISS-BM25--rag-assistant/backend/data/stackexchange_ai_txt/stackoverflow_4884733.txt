Flickr photos have unique IDs. When you save the photos on the internal storage of the device, use their ID's for names (for example 123456111.jpg). When the user reconnects to Flicker, just check each image in his gallery if it is already downloaded. It is good to use getCacheDir() for your cache directory, because it is automatically managed by Android.
