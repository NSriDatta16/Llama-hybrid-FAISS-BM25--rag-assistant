There is no simple statement to achieve boolean value, but you can: use PRAGMA table_info(tbl_status) and analize list. try to execute SELECT col FROM table_name in try...catch block, in case of error simply set variable to bool. BTW, maybe you need to use IF NOT EXISTS in create statement for table, index creation...
