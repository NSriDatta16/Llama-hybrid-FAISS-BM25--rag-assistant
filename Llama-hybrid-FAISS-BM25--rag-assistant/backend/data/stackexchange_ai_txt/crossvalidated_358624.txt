A sufficient condition $p(\theta)$ to be the stationary distribution is the reversibility

I was reading my notes, it says that: ''A sufficient condition $p(\theta)$ to be the stationary distribution is the reversibility: $$\sum_{\theta}p(\theta)p(\theta^*|\theta)=\sum_{\theta}p(\theta^*)p(\theta|\theta^*)=p(\theta^*)\sum_{\theta}p(\theta|\theta^*)=p(\theta^*).''$$ I was wondering what does the reversibility mean here, since this expression is trivially true for any $p(\theta)$. And why the reversibility is a sufficient condition that makes $p(\theta)$ a stationary distribution? Since by definition $p(\theta)$ needs to satisfy $p(\theta)=Ap(\theta)$ where $A$ is a transition matrix (Markov Chain).
