Sync two SqlExpress using NHibernate

I am creating a simple project management system which uses NHibernate for object storage. The underlying database is SQL express (at least currently for development). The client runs on either the desktop or laptop. I know I could use web-services and store the DB only on the desktop, but this would force the desktop to be available all the time. I am currently thinking about duplicating the DB, having two instances with "different data". To clarify, we are not talking about a productive app here, its a prototype. One way to achieve this very simple would be the following process: Client: Check if desktop DB is available (through web service) Client: If yes, use desktop storage, no problem here Client: If not, use own DB as storage Client: Poll desktop regulary, as soon as it comes on, sync Client: Switch to desktop storage ... Desktop: Do not attempt any DB operation before checking for required sync Desktop: If sync needed, do it... My question is now, how would you sync? Assume 4 or 5 types of objects, all have GUID as identifiers. Would you always manually "lazy load" all objects of a certain type and feed them to the DB. Would you always drop the whole desktop DB in case the client DB may be newer and out of sync? Again, I want to stress out, I am not assuming any conflicts or stale data, I basically just want to "copy the whole DB from the client". Would you use NHibernate for this? Or would you separate the copy process? When I think about it, my questions comes down to this: Is there any function from NHibernate: SyncDBs_SourceWins_(SourceDB, TargetDB) Thanks for help, Chris
