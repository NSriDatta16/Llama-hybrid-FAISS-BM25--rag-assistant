Assuming the same Post and PostRating from Shadwell's answer: class Post has_many :post_ratings end class PostRating belongs_to :post # Has a 'rating' attribute end To get the top five ratings for all Posts: post_ratings.find(:all, :limit => 5, :order => 'rating desc') To get the top five ratings for a specific Post you can: p = Post.find(:first) post_ratings.find_all_by_post_id(p.id, :limit => 5, :order => 'rating desc') To find all posts sorted by average rating, you can use ActiveRecord::Calculations. PostRating.average(:rating, :group => :post_id, :include => :post, :order => 'average desc')
