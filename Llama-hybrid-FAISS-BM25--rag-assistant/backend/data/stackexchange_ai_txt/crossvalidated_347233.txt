I think your last assumption is the correct one. The problem with the odds ratio itself is that its null value is 1, its lower bound is 0 and its upper bound is positive infinity. This lack of symmetry about the null makes it hard to work with. Contrast this with the log odds ratio whose null is 0 and whose bounds are negative and positive infinity. The standard error of the log odds ratio is also easier to work with and confidence and other intervals also have symmetry. The log odds ratio is also what is worked with in logistic regression. Of course for presentation of the final results you may want to exponentiate the estimates and their confidence interval endpoints to obtain odds ratios as you may feel they are more easily interpretable.
