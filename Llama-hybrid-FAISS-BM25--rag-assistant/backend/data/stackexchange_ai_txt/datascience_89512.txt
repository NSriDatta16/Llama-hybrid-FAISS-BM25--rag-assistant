From my understanding you are working on a regression task in which you have applied MainMaxScaler to your target variable y prior modeling. If so you have two options: As the error message suggests, you can reshape the output with array.reshape(-1, 1) Scikit learn has implemented a class to work with transformations on target: So just try from sklearn.svm import SVR from sklearn.compose import TransformedTargetRegressor from sklearn.metrics import r2_score from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler regressor = SVR(kernel = 'linear') model = TransformedTargetRegressor(regressor= regressor, transformer = MinMaxScaler() ).fit(trainX,trainY) pred = model.predict(testX) print(pred) Every time you make a model.predict(X) it will apply an inverse transformation so that your predictions are in the same scale as prior MinMaxScaler EDIT: Working example of transformation without using Scikit-learn # array example is between 0 and 1 array = np.array([0.58439621, 0.81262134, 0.231262134, 0.191]) #scaled from 100 to 250 minimo = 100 maximo = 250 array * minimo + (maximo - minimo) Returns: array([208.439621 , 231.262134 , 173.1262134, 169.1])
