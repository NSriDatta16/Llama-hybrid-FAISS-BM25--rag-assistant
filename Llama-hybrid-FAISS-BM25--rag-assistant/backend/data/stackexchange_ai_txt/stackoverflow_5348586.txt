how to code Windows phone 7 UI only programatically (in .cs file)without using designer

I'm newbie for Windows phone 7 development. Usually the User interface Design is done with a Designer and Drag & Drop. But In my project I have to code all user interface programmatically, that is manually write design controls in .Cs file instead of .xaml file. Is it possible? I have tried googling it, I haven't found any tutorial or documentation yet. Could someone please help me to start my process.refer some documentation or books Thanks
