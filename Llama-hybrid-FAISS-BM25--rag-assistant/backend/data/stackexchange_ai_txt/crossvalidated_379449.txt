Notation in going from $AR$ and $MA$ to $ARMA$

I'm confused about the notation that leads to an $ARMA$ model. If, 1: Autoregressive model $AR(p)$ is defined as: $Y_t-\mu=\phi*(Y_{t-1}-\mu)+w_t$ Where, $Y_t$ : observation in time $t$ $Y_{t-1}$ : observation in time $t-1$ $\mu$ : mean $\phi$ : autoregressive slope $w_t$ : White noise with variance $\sigma^2$ in time $t$ And 2: Moving average model $MA(q)$ is defined as: $Y_t=\mu+w_t+\theta*w_{t-1}$ Where, $\theta$ : moving average slope Why is $1+2=ARMA(p,q)$ defined as: $x_t=\phi*x_{t-1}+w_t+\theta*w_{t-1}$ Specifically, I'm quite confused about the $ARMA$ definition: a. Where's $\mu$ the mean in 1 and 2. From looking at outputs I know it's now: $w_t$ , but I thought that $w_t$ was defined as the white noise error. b. Sort of silly, why change $Y_t$ (in 1 and 2) for $x_t$ in $ARMA$ ?
