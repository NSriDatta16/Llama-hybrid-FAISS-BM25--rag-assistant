Odds ratio interpretation if no significant correlation between outcome and predictor

Does it make sense to conduct a logistic regression (binary outcome vitamin D deficiency and predictor CRP) if there was no significant correlation between the two variables in the first place? However, there is a significant difference in the mean concentration between the binary outcome groups. The second question for the same case: if, for example, the OR is 0.224 and P-value is significant, what is the interpretation?
