Are there any deep learning models to forcast waveforms from waveforms?

I want to forcast waveforms from waveforms. Now I have collected the dataset. The input feature is a waveform, e.g.: input feature The out is also a waveform, e.g.: output feature Are there any avaliable models to solve this problem?
