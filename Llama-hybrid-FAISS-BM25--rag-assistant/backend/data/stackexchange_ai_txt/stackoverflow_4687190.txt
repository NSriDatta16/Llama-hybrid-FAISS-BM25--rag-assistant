I use iGoUSB for my backup needs. It has a very cool versioning system with snapshot history that will allow you to go back at any (backup) date to recompile your code. Now, this with dropbox works PERFECTLY: Dropbox keeps your code safe for as long as their service runs Dropbox 2GB free storage should be plenty for source code needs iGoUSB backup repository will let you go back in time whenever you need (which complements the 30 days back that Dropbox gives you for free) - instant versioning! iGoUSB allows backup from multiple computers/profiles - so you can save your code from any computer you use igousb will save only the changed files (while keeping code structure snapshots intact) and for source code files the whole backup will take only a few seconds! This combination will allow you to: backup your sources from multiple computers keep your code safe keep a transparent and really easy to use versioning system Just add your favorite editor and tools (anything like notepadd++ and winmerge) and you have an enviable portable solution ready to use anytime you like :) Note: igousb is not free, you might get a discount if you're a student, but at least it's only one time pay and you might need a good and portable backup tool anyway.
