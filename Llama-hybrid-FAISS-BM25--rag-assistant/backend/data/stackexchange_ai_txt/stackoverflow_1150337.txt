The solution here is deceptively simple. Just copy your .xcdatamodel file from one project to another and then when you run your app in the simulator for the first time it'll create a Documents folder for the app. Just drop your saved .sqlite or .binary files into the yourApp/Documents directory on the device. You can find the simulator directory in "~user/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator". You can also download, edit, and upload the myApp directory on a provisioned iPhone by dragging and dropping into and out of the Organizer. Look at the Applications list. The iPhone doesn't support xml stores with core data, only sqlite or atomic (binary). The sqlite store is by far the better option for most applications since it doesn't all have to be loaded into memory at runtime. Is this what you meant?
