In modern processors like pentium there are features which support virtual memory management. But the implementation of it has to be done by the OS, because there are so many possible algorithms how memory could be managed. Which algorithm fits best depends on how the the memory is used. which kinds of applications are run on the computer? How long do they run? How many applications are run? And how are taskswitched organized. You cannot hardwire this in hardware because of that. The operating system knows better how to efficiently manage memory, since it is made for a special tsype of computer (server vs. desktop OS), also it has a higher level view on the processes run on your computer.
