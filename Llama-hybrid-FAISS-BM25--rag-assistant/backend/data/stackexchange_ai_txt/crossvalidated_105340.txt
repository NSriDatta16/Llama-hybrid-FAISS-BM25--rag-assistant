All models are wrong, but some are useful (George Box). You are forcing a logrithmic shape to your fitted curve, and honestly it doesn't look that bad. The fit is poor at the tail because there are less points there; the two parameters you have allowed will fit the bulk of the data. In other words, on a log scale, that tail isn't far enough away from the bulk of your data to provide leverage. It doesn't have to do with the quantile nature of the regression; OLS would also disregard those points (especially on the log scale). It's pretty easy to allow for some more non-linearity. I'm partial to natural splines, but again, all models are wrong: library(splines) mod The quantreg package has some special hooks for monotonic splines if that's of concern to you.
