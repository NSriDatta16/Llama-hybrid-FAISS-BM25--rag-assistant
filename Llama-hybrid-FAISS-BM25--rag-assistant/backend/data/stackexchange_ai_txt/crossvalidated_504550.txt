What statistical analysis to run for count data?

I have 10 storages, each has 10000 units. A technical problem has been found in 2 storages, that might leads to an increase in the number of defective units. Basically, I want to compare the number of defective units of these 2 storages with the number of defective units of the others 8 storages, in order to verify if there is a significant difference between 2 groups of storages. Which statistical test should I use for the comparison, when I have only 2 storages in the first group?
