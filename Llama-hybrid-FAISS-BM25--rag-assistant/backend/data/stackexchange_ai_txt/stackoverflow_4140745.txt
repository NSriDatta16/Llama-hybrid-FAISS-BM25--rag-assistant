Warping fragments of signals in Matlab

Using a custom sensor that I built, I collected pressure sensor information of a the human gait cycle (how the pressure varies when a person walks) from a person's right foot. One of the things I want to do is break up each signal into individual steps taken by the right foot. I have a couple of sensors on the sole of the foot, but the most important one is the heel sensor since I am using that as the means of understanding the start and end of each step. This is done by looking at all the peaks of the heel sensor (since a step in my case is defined as the stuff that happens between two consecutive heel strikes). However, because it is difficult to walk with each step consistently at the same speed, some steps tend to be slightly longer or shorter than others. This brings me to the question at hand. I want to warp each step so that they are all exactly the same length (i.e. I want to warp each step to take the same amount of time), but I'm not exactly sure what the best approach is. Can anyone advise me how I can process this single signal, and modify each step so that they are all equal lengths.
