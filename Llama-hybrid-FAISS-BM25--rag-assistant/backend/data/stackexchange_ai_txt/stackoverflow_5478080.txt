The consensus is that it isn't possible directly -- the MPMoviePlayerController is not using an [NSURLCache sharedURLCache] , so you don't have access to it that way. Another option is to start downloading the movie asynchronously and play it locally when the file is sufficiently buffered -- this is viable, but it can be a fragile solution if you don't adequately handle the buffer underruns that are bound to happen on slow networks.
