A very common scenario is that we simply do not have the resources or time (or at least it's a get most of the benefit for minimal effort situation) to fine-tune a model appropriately, but can run inference on it to extract features. In that situation, extracting features from a pre-trained model might be good enough for what we want to achieve. There's also situations where the feature extraction (e.g. last hidden layer of a neural network) may be suitable for certain features (e.g. text fields, images), but other aspects of the data might be better suited to a non-neural-network algorithm. E.g. if we want to predict something for tabular data, but some fields contain text and each row is associated with an image. In such a situation, we might extract features for the text and/or image fields, but then use gradient boosted decisions trees as our prediction model.
