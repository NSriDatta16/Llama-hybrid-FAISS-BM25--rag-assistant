I came up with a somewhat-elegant solution which you might be interested in: Since the problem seemed to be that I was unable to cast or construct the data types I had in the .settings file from simple text boxes as I was using data binding, I instead made some custom controls. For example, the TimeSpans now use a TimeSpanPicker which I made out of a DateTimePicker control, with the date disabled, the up/down toggles on, and the Value property is converted to a TimeSpan from within the picker control. The added advantage of this method is that I don't need to do a lot of the validation I needed to before with text boxes, as the TimeSpanPicker base control DateTimePicker will only show valid times. What little validation I do need to do can be done in the Set{} property, so I don't need to define event handlers. This seems to be working well! Now all I need to do is replace all the text boxes with custom controls.
