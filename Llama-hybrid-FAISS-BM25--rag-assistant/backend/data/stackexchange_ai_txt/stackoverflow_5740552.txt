Windows Phone: How to retrieve the same photo from media library between application instances

How do I retrieve the same photo from the media library between application instances? I launch the photo library for the user to select a photo via: PhotoChooserTask myPhotoChooser = new PhotoChooserTask(); myPhotoChooser.ShowCamera = true; myPhotoChooser.Show(); myPhotoChooser.Completed += new EventHandler (cameraCaptureTask_Completed); and then in the Event handler, I retrieve the file name of the selected file like this: private void cameraCaptureTask_Completed(object sender, PhotoResult e) { if (e.TaskResult == TaskResult.OK) { string imagePath = e.OriginalFileName.ToString(); } } I persist this information in isolated storage so that when a user launches the application again I can retrieve the path and display the image like this: private BitmapImage ConvertUriToBitmap(string pathToImage) { StreamResourceInfo streamResInfo = null; Uri uri = new Uri(pathToImage, UriKind.Relative); streamResInfo = Application.GetResourceStream(uri); //This fails! StreamResInfo is null BitmapImage convertedBitmap = new BitmapImage(); convertedBitmap.SetSource(streamResInfo.Stream); return convertedBitmap; } However, this doesn't seem to work as the photo path from the photo chooser is some sort of guid in the form: "\Applications\Data\02E58193-119F-42E2-AD85-C24247BE2AB0\Data\PlatformData\PhotoChooser-4edd185d-d934-4dac-8a34-758cac09d338.jpg" Application.GetResourceStream(uri) is null whenenever I switch out of the application or move between pages. Is there a better way to do this? How do I retrieve the same path everytime so that when I tombstone or kill the app, i can retireve the file and display it? Or is there a different /more efficient way of doing it.
