Edit from comments above: Pretty sure your problem is that you haven't imported your graphics into the drawable folder then. Download the PNG files for the tutorial, and drag (or import) them into the res/drawable folder. That should fix your problem. When you reference a drawable with the "@drawable/ic_new_game", you're telling it to look in the res/drawable folder for a resource named ic_new_game (which is probably a PNG image in this case).
