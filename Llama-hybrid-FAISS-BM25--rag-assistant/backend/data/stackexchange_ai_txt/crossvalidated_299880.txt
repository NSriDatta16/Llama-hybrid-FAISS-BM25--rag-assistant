After some research in to the topic, I have stumbled upon two journals which address this point. 1. Control Charts for Measurements with Varying Sample Sizes (Burr, Irving W.(1969, ASQC)) 2. Standardization of Shewhart Control Charts (Nelson, Lloyd S.(1989, ASQC)) An excerpt from the Nelson (1989) below: When subgroup sizes differ there are three approaches usually recommended. 1. Draw the actual control limits for each subgroup separately. 2. Use the average of the subgroup sizes and calculate limits based on this >average size, and calculate the exact limit whenever doubt exists. 3. Standardize the statistic to be plotted and plot the results on a chart with >a centerline of zero and limits at ±3. He goes on to explain why 1 and 2 are not the ideal way to do: The first alternative may yield not only a messy chart but also one to which runs tests cannot be applied—specifically the trend and zigzag tests The second alternative can also have the kind of problem just described. Further, one must be ready to calculate the exact limit when the approximate one is called into question The third alternative, standardization, yields a neat chart for which interpretation is not a problem. The centerline is always at zero (although it is desirable to indicate on the chart the value of the mean of the original data), and because the vertical scale is a “sigma scale,” the zones for carrying out tests for special causes are always at ±1, ±2, and ±3. The formulae for implementing the Standardized approach is in the below Table. For more details, please refer to the mentioned research papers I hope this will come in useful for someone who stumbles across the same scenario as mine.
