Of course you can reach any (known) location on the hard drive using your reader code, assuming that you have adequate permissions to access that location. There are no special permissions applied to the IsolatedStorage area, but there are rules that apply to the low trust applications that use IsolatedStorage how it was intended to be used. There is absolutely nothing to prevent you from encrypting what you store there if you want to keep it private. Edit: check out CLR Inside Out - Isolated Storage In Silverlight 2 and Silverlight out-of-browser apps: Local Data Store .
