Does it have to be jquery? You can do it with just CSS if you like. a.info { position: relative; z-index: 24; } a.info:hover { z-index: 25; } a.info span { display: none; } a.info:hover span { display: block; position: absolute; top: 2em; left: 2em; width: 15em; padding: 6px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000; } Then you can use it just like you have it. Here is the tooltip content. Here is the link to somewhere. EDIT Reading my daily dose of blogs this article came to my attention. They create a jquery plugin that does what you want, pops up an image with style options and mouse movement. Check out the result here. http://james.padolsey.com/demos/imgPreview/full/ You should be able to either follow the tutorial and write the plugin or download the example plugin.
