How much is overfitting?

How much is overfitting? For example, results on seen data is between 1 to 15% better than unseen data. Is there a range of value for example 2% where it is considered normal and not overfitting? Also, Is there different range of value for different application? For example, maybe in information retrieval, 1 to 10% is normal, but maybe in image processing, 1 to 15% is normal.
