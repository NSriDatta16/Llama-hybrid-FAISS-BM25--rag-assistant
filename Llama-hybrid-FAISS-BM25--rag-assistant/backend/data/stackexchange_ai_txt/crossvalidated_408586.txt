Need help determining sample size for an AB test with two metrics

I need to run an experiment with customer support agents who are rated on two metrics by the customer: average issue resolution rate (proportion of issues resolved) and average star rating (1-5). Whenever an agent gets a new issue, I plan to show a feature to the agent (or not show) 50% of the time at random. Once the experiment is over, I would like to compare if there is: A difference in the average star rating between the issues where the feature was shown and the issues where the feature was not shown A difference in the resolution rate between the issues where the feature was shown and the issues where the feature was not shown A couple of additional points: i. The customer will not always leave a feedback. They on average leave feedback about resolution ~15% of the time and a star rating ~7% of the time. ii. The star ratings are discrete (1-5 stars) with most of them being 5*, then a few 1* and the rest are very low. The average star rating is around 4.3 in the general population and resolution rate is around 55% Questions: What are the correct statistical tests for the above two comparisons? How do I determine the sample size needed for determining an effect size of 0.1 in the star rating and 1% in the resolution rate with 90% power? If someone could work the math out here, I'd be super delighted!
