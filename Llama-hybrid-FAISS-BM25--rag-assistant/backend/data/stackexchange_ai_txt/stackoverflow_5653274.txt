Java server-client model

This question is more concerned with the general design of a program. I have a problem in hand in which a centre communicates with a set of clients individually (the clients do not directly interact with each other). The content of the communication between the centre and a client is entirely numeric, i.e. a bunch of numbers are sent back and forth. The clients are run on individual computers, and the centre can be hosted on another machine (or otherwise). The style of communication is iterative and synchronous in a sense that the centre sends a request/question msg to each individual client and the user of a client provides an answer/reply back to the centre within a time limit in each iteration, and this interaction repeats itself for a number of times until the end. The centre does some calculation given the responses received from the clients, and the clients simply provide the inputs to that calculation. I wonder what is an elegant design for this problem using Java? Any comment or suggestion is much appreciated. Many thanks.
