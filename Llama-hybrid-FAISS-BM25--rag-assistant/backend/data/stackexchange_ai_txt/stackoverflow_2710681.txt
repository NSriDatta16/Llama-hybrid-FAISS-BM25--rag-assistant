On HP-UX -Xverbosegc [:help] | [0 | 1] [:file = [stdout | stderr | ]] IBMs JDK Any platform that uses the IBM JDK -Xverbosegclog[:[,,]] Sun JDK -Xloggc:file Report on each garbage collection event, as with -verbose:gc, but log this data to file. In addition to the information -verbose:gc gives, each reported event will be preceeded by the time (in seconds) since the first garbage-collection event. Always use a local file system for storage of this file to avoid stalling the JVM due to network latency. The file may be truncated in the case of a full file system and logging will continue on the truncated file. This option overrides -verbose:gc if both are given on the command line.
