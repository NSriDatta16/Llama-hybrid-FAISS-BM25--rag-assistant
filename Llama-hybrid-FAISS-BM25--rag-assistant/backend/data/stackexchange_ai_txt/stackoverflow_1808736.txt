The idea that processes are slow to create is an old one, and was much more true in the past. Google's Chrome team did a little paragraph somewhere about how it's not as big an impact anymore, and here is Scott Hanselman on the subject: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MicrosoftIE8AndGoogleChromeProcessesAreTheNewThreads.aspx My take on it is that threads are faster?'c but only moderately so, and currently it's easier to make mistakes with threads. I have heard that .NET 4.0 is going to extend the thread library... Something about system.threading.thread.For ? And I can think of a few places I'd want to do that... For each item in this thousand item list go do something. http://reedcopsey.com/?p=87
