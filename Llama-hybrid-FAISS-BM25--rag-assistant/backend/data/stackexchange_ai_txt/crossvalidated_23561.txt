How to verify that the model is real?

Here is a block diagram which I'm using when I want to verify that my model is real. In each round a fold of 11/12 percent of the data is used to bulid the model (e.g. eigenvectors of the PCA) After 12 rounds I check that the models (e.g the eigenvectors of the PCA) from each round are not statistically different and if they indeed don't I declared the model as stable. Where the idea is that if a model is stable in a k-fold sense it is some sort of indication that the model is real I more or less thought about it myself (mainly on the last verification step) thus, I would like to know what do you think about it ? are you aware of other ways to "verify that my model is real" ?
