Replace a lookup table with machine learning

I have a lookup table with 2 input columns and 2 output columns. I want to replace it with a value function such that with a given input pair, the function can give the output pair with minimal error. The function will replace the LUT in an embedded system with minimal memory. For training, I have a very small dataset with only 40 rows . Now, I am bit confused about whether to try regression techniques or behavioral cloning (from imitation learning) because my objective is to mimic the LUT as closely as possible. I am a novice user of machine learning techniques and could not find simple starting examples for this type of table learning problems. Is there any? If it is infeasible then please also tell me.
