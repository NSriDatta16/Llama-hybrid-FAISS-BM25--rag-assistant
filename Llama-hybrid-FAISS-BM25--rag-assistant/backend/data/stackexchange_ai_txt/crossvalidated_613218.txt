Real estate: estimating average residence time based on limited time date

I've been collecting real estate transactions in my neighborhood for a while and have data about resales since 2017. The neighborhood was established in 2005, so much longer than what I have data for. I'm looking to estimate average residence time (time between sales of a single home) in two ways: (# of total homes) / (# sales in the last 12 months) This is more or less a proxy estimate since it doesn't include an actual sale of a single home twice, as if it were a longitudinal sample. The average residence time that I get out of this is very comparable to the expected (10-12 years). actual longitudinal tracking of sales This method (for now) is severely flawed because the length of the dataset is much shorter than the age of the neighborhood. I cannot seriously state that homes are being sold every 22 months because a small fraction of homes that I have longitudinal data for. The figure shows the CDF for (time of sale)-(time of next listing) for the homes I have data for. Besides collecting data for the next 20 years or so, is there a way to get an estimate out of the data I already have?
