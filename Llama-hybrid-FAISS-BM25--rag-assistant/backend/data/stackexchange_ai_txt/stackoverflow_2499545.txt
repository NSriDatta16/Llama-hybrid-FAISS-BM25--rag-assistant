Getting Greyscale pixel value from RGB colourspace in Java using BufferedImage

Anyone know of a simple way of converting the RGBint value returned from getRGB(i,j) into a greyscale value? I was going to simply average the RGB values by breaking them up using this; int alpha = (pixel >> 24) & 0xff; int red = (pixel >> 16) & 0xff; int green = (pixel >> 8) & 0xff; int blue = (pixel) & 0xff; and then average red,green,blue. But i feel like for such a simple operation I must be missing something... After a great answer to a different question, I should clear up what i want. I want to take the RGB value returned from getRGB(i,j), and turn that into a white-value in the range 0-255 representing the "Darkness" of that pixel. This can be accomplished by averaging and such but I am looking for an OTS implementation to save me a few lines.
