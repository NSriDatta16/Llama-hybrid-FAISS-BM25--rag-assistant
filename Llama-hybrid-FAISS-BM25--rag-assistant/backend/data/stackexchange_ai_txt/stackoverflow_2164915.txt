Linked-Lists will not scale. Using linked lists on the server-side to check the clients one-by-one and address their needs is all well and good for 5 to 10 clients. But what happens when you have 100? 1000? What happens if one clients request takes a very long time to handle? Threads don't just provide a way of maintaing state for individual clients. They also provide a way of simultaneously "distributing the server resources" across all clients. It's as if each client has a dedicated server to itself, there is (almost) no queue: the client wants something, it asks the server, the server replies. It's instantaneous. Plus, you could be wasting valuable resources with your linked list approach. What if all the clients but one want nothing? You'll be cycling repeatedly over a hundred clients, doing nothing but wasting CPU cycles, until you come across the one that does require the server's attention.
