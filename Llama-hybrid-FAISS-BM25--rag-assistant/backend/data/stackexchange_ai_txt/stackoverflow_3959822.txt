Does having the IIS log header in the log file mean that IIS was reset during the day?

When I'm viewing IIS log files I can see various times during the day where the header line is written out to the log file. The only time I've seen this is happening is when IIS resets; or starts up. For example the header line below; #Software: Microsoft Internet Information Services 6.0 #Version: 1.0 #Date: 2010-10-18 07:28:06 #Fields: date time s-sitename s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status The customer is saying there is no IIS resets happening; but does this entry in the log file mean that IIS was definitely reset for some reason which may be outside of the customers control.
