HTML5 Storage to the rescue! For the first frame: localStorage.setItem('variable', 'frame 1 value'); click here And for test.html: window.onload = function() { div = document.getElementById("fred"); div.innerHTML=" " + localStorage.getItem('variable') + " "; } hi there A note of caution: IE7 and some older browsers do not support localStorage. However, you should be able to use if (typeof(localStorage) == 'undefined') {} to detect which method you need to use.
