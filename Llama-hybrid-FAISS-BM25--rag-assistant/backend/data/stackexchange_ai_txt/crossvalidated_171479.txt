Difference Endogeneity and Multicollinearity in Logistic Regression

I am right now working with logistic regression and test my model over and over again. However, I am still not sure about the terminologies endogeneity and multicollinearity. For my under-standing, multicollinearity is a correlation of an independent variable with another independent variable. Endogeneity is the correlation of an independent variable with the error term. Is this correct so far? Thank you!
