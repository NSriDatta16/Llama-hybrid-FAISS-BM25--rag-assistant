Probability of reaching a threshold after several trials

I was wondering if there wasn't some better way to get to the bottom of this question I had regarding the chances of reaching a certain threshold of guessing numbers correctly over a series of trials. This isn't my specialty, so would appreciate answers that are like you were talking to a 5 year old or at least google-able :) So say I have a game where I have to pick 10 out of 80 numbers and then 20 are drawn. For each one of my Picks that is chosen as one of the 20 I get a black marble. I need to know the odds that if I can get AT LEAST 20 black marbles in 5 games, picking 10 numbers each game. Each game is discrete in that the picked numbers are replaced and the 20 numbers that are drawn are totally random I can tell what the average amount of black marbles I will win per game (2.5) and therefore the average amount of black marbles I'll win in 5 games (12.5). I can do this because for a single game, hyper geometric distribution tells me the odds of each outcome of catches: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I can then multiply each of these by their probabilities and sum them to get the average amount I will win in that game e.g. $(HYPGEOMDIST(0, 10, 20, 80) * 0) + (HYPGEOMDIST(1, 10, 20, 80) * 1)$, etc Here's how I would do this by hand if I had to ( this is the part I'd like to simplify / correct my assumptions on!! ): Find each permutation of black marbles (0-10) I could win for each of the 5 games without regard to order. Filter each permutation so that if the set of 5 games does not sum to 20 it is discarded For the remaining sets find and multiply the HYPGEOMDIST for each of the 5 games in each set, then sum every set Please excuse me if this has been asked somewhere else, I am unfamiliar with the terminology in order to search well enough on this site.
