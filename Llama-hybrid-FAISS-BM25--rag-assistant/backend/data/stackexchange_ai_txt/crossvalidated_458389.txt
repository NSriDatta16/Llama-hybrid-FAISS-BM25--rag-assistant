Bayesian Logistic Regression with Regularization

For one of my Statistics for Analytics semester projects, I am thinking of applying concepts of Bayesian Statistics, Regression and Regularization in R. I can easily find resources on Bayesian Logistic Regression and Logistic Regression with Regularization but I am unable to find something that involves all three of these. I do get something like "Bayesian Regularization" but I think it is something different than what I am looking for (not sure it makes sense or sounds dumb since I am not an expert and will be learning these concepts before working on the project). Also, for reducing variables, does it make more sense to use PCA or Exploratory Factor Analysis, given that my project requirement is that results should be "interpretable"? I'll appreciate if anyone can help me out and give some suggestions. Thanks.
