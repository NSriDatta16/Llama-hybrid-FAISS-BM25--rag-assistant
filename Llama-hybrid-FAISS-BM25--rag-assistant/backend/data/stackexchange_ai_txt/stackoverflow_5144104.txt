ActiveX is a Microsoft-proprietary framework for defining and accessing interfaces to system resources, in a programming-language independent way. It's used in many Microsoft Windows applications such as: internet-explorer , ms-office , visual-studio , and windows-media-player . These applications also encapsulate their own functionality as ActiveX controls for other applications to use. Internet Explorer also allows embedding ActiveX controls onto web pages. ActiveX is a successor to Microsoft's earlier com and ole technologies. Projects, such as firebreath , facilitate developing plugins as both NPAPI plugins and ActiveX controls.
