When you are using mocks, you should not assert every single call was made or not. That couples your tests to a particular implementation and makes them fragile and a refactoring nightmare. If I ever ran into this situation I would rethink why I wanted to assert that a dependency was never used. Obviously, if the dependency is not used anywhere, just remove it. If it is needed for some operations, but all the operations in the dependency are destructive operations and you want to make sure some operation does not do harm with them, you should assert explicitly that the destructive operations were not called and allow the implementation to do whatever it wants with the non-destructive operations (if there are any). This makes your tests more explicit and less fragile.
