How to test the influence of external factors on time series

I need an advice/ best method on how to rigorously test the influence of categorical predictors (states), or their duration (duration of war/peace in this case) on time series . How to prove that the increase in prices of oil is caused by war? I would like to get some p-value . # Example - influence of war on prices of oil # (completely speculative of course ;D) price Can anybody help me? Thank you for any guidance in advance! At least the name of appropriate technique will be helpful.
