Application not appearing in the Market for some devices

I have an application published in the Android Market. Its target is 1.6 and its minSdkVersion is 1.5. The only persmission it uses is INTERNET . My Manifest file looks like this: (I XXX ed stuff I can't show) I recently got an email from a user saying the application doesn't show up in the Market on an HTC Wildfire. I looked it up and the Wildfire is a QVGA (LDPI, 240x320) device running Android 2.1. The app does appear for MDPI and HDPI devices. Also, I can start up a QVGA 2.1 emulator and install the application without any problems. What is causing this?
