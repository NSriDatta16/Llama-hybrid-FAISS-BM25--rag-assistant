Assuming a distance measure that's valid for discrete data (e.g. the Gower distance you're using), any clustering algorithm based entirely on pairwise distances would be a valid option. The thing you want to avoid is methods that assume a continuous input space (e.g. by computing centroids/means of data points as in k-means, or defining continuous densities as in Gaussian mixture models). You could explore different linkage methods for hierarchical clustering (e.g. single, average, and complete linkage; Ward linkage isn't appropriate since it requires computing centroids). Some other popular distance-based clustering algorithms include k-medoids, DBSCAN, and OPTICS. Spectral clustering is another possibility, as long as you compute the affinity matrix in a way that respects the discrete data.
