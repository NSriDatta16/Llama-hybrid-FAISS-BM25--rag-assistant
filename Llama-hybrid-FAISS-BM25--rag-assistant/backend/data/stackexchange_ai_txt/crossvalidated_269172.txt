Why is S.D. of the sample mean getting smaller as I increase the sample size?

My guess is that if a take a sample with $n$ observations ($n$ = sample size), average them and plot it and repeating the same thing for a lot of times then I am getting "dupplicates along the way", meaning that observations which occured in the sample nr 1 could also occur in the sample nr $x$. So I don't always get new data, therefore my SD gets smaller. It's a little bit strange/counter intuitive for me that repeating the same process of taking the average of a sample and plot it , again and again will get the sample mean closer and closer to the true pop. mean. But S.D. of the sample mean keeps varrying with the sample size as opposed to the mean of the sample.
