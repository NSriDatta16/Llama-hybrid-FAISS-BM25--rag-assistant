django model design questions

I need to store various info about some movies, books, games, and maybe other media. Starting from publisher to disc count in DVD-box. At first i thought about abstract Item model, with children Book, Movie, Game. But it's all hard-coded and not very scalable, i think. What if i would need to add some new item type? Then I've read about virtual fields here Django - designing models with virtual fields? that got my attention. But looks DB heavy and not very search-able, am i wrong? What are the best techniques for such cases?
