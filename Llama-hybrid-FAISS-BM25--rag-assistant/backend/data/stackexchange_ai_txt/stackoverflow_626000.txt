All the reference cited so far are good. However the Design Patterns by the Gang Of Four is usable for Visual Basic 6. The trick to remember that most of the pattern talked about in Design Patterns rely on implementing interfaces which VB6 can do well. In fact you will find most design patterns involve implementing interfaces. This is because most design patterns focus on setting up how various objects interact as opposed to reusing behavior. So interface become much more important. Design Patterns by the GoF Patterns by Martin Fowler The various GUI and presentation patterns is the most applicable in my opinion. My own application is structured completely as a series of design patterns. For example I use a Passive View for my presentation layer. The various views called command objects which does the actual modifications of the model. I use factories to retrieve the list of reports, file types, and shapes my software support. All done in VB6 using the Design Patterns book by the GoF.
