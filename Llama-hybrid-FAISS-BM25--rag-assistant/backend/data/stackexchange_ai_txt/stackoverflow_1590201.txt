I will answer your question by a question: do you want various validation methods for the product of your method ? This is the same as the 'constructor' issue: is it better to raise an exception during the construction or initialize a void object and then call an 'init' method... you are sure to raise a debate here! In general, I would recommend performing the validation as soon as possible: this is known as the Fail Fast which advocates that finding problems as soon as possible is better than delaying the detection since diagnosis is immediate while later you would have to revert the whole flow.... If you're not convinced, think of it this way: do you really want to write 3 lines every time you load a file ? (load, parse, validate) Well, that violates the DRY principle. So, go agile there: write your method with validation: it is responsible for loading a valid configuration (1) if you ever need some parametrization, add it then (like a 'check' parameter, with a default value which preserves the old behavior of course) (1) Of course, I don't advocate a single method to do all this at once... it's an organization matter: under the covers this method should call dedicated methods to organize the code :)
