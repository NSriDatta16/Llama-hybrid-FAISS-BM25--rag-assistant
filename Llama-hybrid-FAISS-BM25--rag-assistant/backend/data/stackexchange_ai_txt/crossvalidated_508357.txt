How to interpret the probability of a negative value in a density plot

I have the following density plot in R using ggplot library(tidyverse) data I'm interested in calculating the probability of a value in each time series being negative, which I understand would be the total area under the curve up until 0. Is there a way to calculate the total area under the point up until x = 0?
