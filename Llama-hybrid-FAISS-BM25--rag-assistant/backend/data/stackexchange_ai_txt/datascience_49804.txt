How to find which features have been selected by PCA algorithm?

I used PCA function in MATLAB to decrease features on my data set. By this code I can reduce features from 12 to 8(as an example). It works good but my question is that how can I found with feature have been removed or which feature are selected on the result? [~, pca_scores, ~, ~, var_explained] = pca(myDataSet, 'NumComponents', 8);
