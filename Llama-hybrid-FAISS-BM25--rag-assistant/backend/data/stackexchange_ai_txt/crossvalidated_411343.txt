Intuition of second order differencing dependent variable on non-differencing independent regressor regression?

I have two time series sequences. One is $y_t$ , which is non-stationary, and the other is $x_t$ , which is stationary. Suppose I would like to do a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ to forecast $y_t$ . The second order differencing on $y_t$ which is $y_t-2y_{t-1}+y_{t-2}$ is stationary. Now the regression becomes $$y_t-2y_{t-1}+y_{t-2}=\alpha+\beta x_t+\epsilon_t$$ . May I know the interpretation of $\beta$ now? Or technically, it is better also to make second order differencing on $x_t$ as the new regressor, which could give a sensible intuition of $x_t$ on $y_t$ ? Inspired by this question My attempt to interpret, please correct me if I am wrong If $x_t$ is stationary, then I assume that $x_t$ is independent with $x_{t-n}$ , so now my regression equation becomes $$y_t=\alpha+\beta x_t-2y_{t-1}+y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$$ , which means I fixed the coefficients of $y_{t-1}$ as $-2$ and I fixed the coefficients of $y_{t-2}$ as $1$ on $y_t$ , and $\beta$ only explains the effect of $x_t$ on $y_t$ , is this correct?
