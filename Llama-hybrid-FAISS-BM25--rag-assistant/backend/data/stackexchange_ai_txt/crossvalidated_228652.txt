Quantifying statistical confidence from combining separate tests

Start off with a population of 200 balls. There are 2 types of tests that can be performed: call it A and B. The results of each test is either true or false. If we randomly select 100 balls and perform only test A on it. Then perform only test B on the remainder. If we get for the first hundred, A is true = 98, A is false = 2. And for the remainder, B is true = 89, B is false = 11. What sort of quantitative statements can I make about the underlying population of 200 balls? At at even simpler level, if we get A_(true) = 100, B_(true) = 100, chances are 100% that the underlying population is homogeneous (i.e. of a single type). But how does one compute the confidence of this statement? Do we compare it to a population of A_(true) = 50 and B_(true) = 50? But one is then comparing it to a random population. Is a Bayesian approach corresponding to different possibilities, i.e. underlying population of 1 species, 2 species, 2 species, etc., the right way to proceed? It would be enough if people can share the thinking behind how they would go about working out the above scenario.
