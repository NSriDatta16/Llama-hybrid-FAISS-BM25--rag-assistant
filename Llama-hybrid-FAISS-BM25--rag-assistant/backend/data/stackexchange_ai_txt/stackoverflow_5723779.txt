Description of storing UTF-8 data in SQL Server . There is also a discussion of this topic at International Features in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 . the gist of it is: SQL Server has no support for UTF-8. Feel free to upvote the request to Add support for storing UTF-8 natively in SQL Server . As a note though, since you store Unicode string via LINQ, this would point that the problem occurs before writing into SQL Server. Namely your web pulling, does it appropriately convert the data read using an UTF-8 reader? Namely, do you read the WebResponse.GetResponseStream() via a StreamReader constructed with the appropriate UTF8Encoding ? That should create the proper Unicode string and then the NVARCHAR storage in the DB (which is UCS-2) should be fine.
