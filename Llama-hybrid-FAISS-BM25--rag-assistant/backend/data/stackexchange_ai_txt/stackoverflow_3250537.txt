Elegantly escaping errors

I have statements such as @user = User.find(current_user.id) throughout my application. Sometimes a user might enter with a nil variable (such as a new user for whom current_user is nil). I'm sure the dumb way to do this would be to scatter if statements everywhere like... if current_user.exists? @user = User.find(current_user.id) else redirect_to root_url ---*or*--- @user = "new" # for use with if/case statements later on end What is the elegant way to deal with this confusion?
