Since you said you wanted to be able to define which instances should be highlighted and it sounds like that will be arbitrary, something like this should do the trick: // Define which instances of a word you want highlighted $wordCountsToHighlight = array(1, 2, 4, 6); // Split up the paragraph into an array of words $wordsInParagraph = explode(' ', $paragraph); // Initialize our count $wordCount = 0; // Find out the maximum count (because we can stop our loop after we find this one) $maxCount = max($wordCountsToHighlight); // Here's the word we're looking for $wordToFind = 'example' // Go through each word foreach ($wordsInParagraph as $key => $word) { if ($word == $wordToFind) { // If we find the word, up our count. $wordCount++; // If this count is one of the ones we want replaced, do it if (in_array($wordCount, $wordCountsToHighlight)) { $wordsInParagragh[$key] = ' example '; } // If this is equal to the maximum number of replacements, we are done if ($wordCount == $maxCount) { break; } } } // Put our paragraph back together $newParagraph = implode(' ', $wordsInParagraph); It's not pretty and probably isn't the quickest solution, but it'll work.
