Embedding Javascript resource located in another class library without ScriptManager

I am creating a new project from the ground up. I have my web application in this web application I have references set up to multiple class libraries. In one of those libraries I have some general Javascript files (like jQuery) that I need to load in my web application's mastersheet. I cannot seem to get at the Javascript. How can I access that Javascript, located in a different class library, from my web application project? Attached is a screen shot for better clarity. Update: Is there any way do achieve this without using ScriptManager?
