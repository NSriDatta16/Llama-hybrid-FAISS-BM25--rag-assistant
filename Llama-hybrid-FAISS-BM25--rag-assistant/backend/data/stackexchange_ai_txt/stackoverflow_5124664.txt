What you need to do is to check whether memcache has the value that you want in its cache (in your case it isn't), otherwise you have to retrieve from datastore or recalculate again. That's a normal behavior of any caches. The storage of the cache normally faster but smaller compared to the lower level storage which are slower but of larger capacity. Imagine disk caches, it's way smaller than the actual disks. Only smaller chunk of disk data can be fetched into the cache. It's a matter of hit/miss rate than governs the effectivity of the cache. In GAE your memcache are dynamically configured there, you don't have control over them, and most likely shared with other applications. So you shouldn't assume stuffs you put may not stay in the cache at all time. It is hit/miss game.
