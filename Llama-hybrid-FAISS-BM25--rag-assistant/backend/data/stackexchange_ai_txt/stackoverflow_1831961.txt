Copy/Paste in Windows Forms with custom controls

I am writing a small application in C# using Windows Forms . I want to let my users copy and paste data around the application and there are some custom controls, for example one is a colour picker. Some of the default controls (well at least the TextBox) have a copy and paste functionality already. I want to have the same thing with my colour picker, and also want an 'Edit' menu at the top to copy and paste. At the moment, I can't see how to do this in a nice way, my current tack is to catch the Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V commands and the menu clicks and go through a function which uses some Win32 calls to find the focused control and then copy or paste data from or to the control (with a massive if statement depending on the type of the focused control). The alternative seems to be to write key handling into every custom control, but with this method I'm not sure how to incorporate the Edit menu functions. How do I do this in an elegant or more 'standard' way?
