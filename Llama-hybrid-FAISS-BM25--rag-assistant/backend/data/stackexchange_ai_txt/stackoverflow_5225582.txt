I might have found a workaround to make my code work. However, I'm at loss to explain the default processing of ajax enabled web page. I would like to thank Tony for his insight, which got me thinking in this direction. To test the processing, I ran the module with the ajax enabled page which had an update panel which printed current system time. The update panel refreshed based on a timer control which went off every 10 seconds. What I observed was that for every request multiple calls were made to the httpmodule. The first call to the module has header that contained about 7 key-value pair such as Connection, Authorization, Host etc. The subsequent calls had some extra key-value pair among which couple of them caught my attention. They are x-requested-with and x-microsoftajax, which I believe XHttpRequest ... an ajax request. So, in my workaround I just skipped processing of my module depending on presence of these header value somthing like the following. if (HttpContext.Current.Request.Headers["x-microsoftajax"] == null) { ... old code ... } Once I do that, the module gets executed the during the first call and the execution is skipped every time its called as part of ajax processing.
