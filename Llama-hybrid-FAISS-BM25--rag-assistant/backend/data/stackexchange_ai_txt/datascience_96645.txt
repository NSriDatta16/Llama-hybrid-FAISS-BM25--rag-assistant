How can the accuracy of the dictionary-based approach be measured and improved?

I recently used TextBlob and the NLTK library to do sentiment analysis. I used both dictionary-based and machine learning-based approaches. It is relatively easy to measure accuracy when we use machine learning approach, just define a test set. The same goes for improving accuracy, just modify the training set. But what about dictionary-based approaches instead? How do you measure and improve their accuracy?
