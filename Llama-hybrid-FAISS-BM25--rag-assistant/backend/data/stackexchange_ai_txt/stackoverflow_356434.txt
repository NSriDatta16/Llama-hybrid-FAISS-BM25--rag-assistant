Visual Studio 2008 designers screw up on large VB projects

We have 3 developers all using the same version (VS 2008 SP1) and we all use large VB projects (windows forms). From time to time, the IDE will have all sorts of issues such as locking up, crashing, and even not being able to drag a form object around or it will just instantly disappear. On the largest of our projects (which is actually 5 projects in one solution file), a couple people here can only rebuild the project for testing 2 - 3 times before they have to close the studio and reopen it. Has anyone else experienced this? Does this happen with large C# projects?
