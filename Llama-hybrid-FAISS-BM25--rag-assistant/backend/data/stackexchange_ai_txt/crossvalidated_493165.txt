What is the context between texture features and image anomaly detection?

I have been looking into deep image anomaly detection, more specifically the feature extraction component, for quite a while now. (My focus is on deep learning) I have encountered various papers about texture features like texture classification etc. in my research. Since I am quite new to deep learning I can not really comprehend how these texture features contribute to an anomaly detection framework. My dataset I would like to evaluate an anomaly detection framework on consist of various objects like screws, bottles and hazelnuts. If I had a dataset that would consist of only texture images I would understand that texture features would be enough for anomaly detection. I do know that each object has a texture, but are texture features enough to detect anomalies in these objects? What kind of features need to be extracted to do so? Thank you in advance, for any kind of answer!
