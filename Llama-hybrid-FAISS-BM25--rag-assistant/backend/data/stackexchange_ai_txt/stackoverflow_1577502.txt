If you will be doing non-trivial manipulation of this data then you could consider using SQL Server Compact . It's a local database that's embedded in your application. You interact with it the same way as regular SQL server, and it supports transactions, referential integrity constraints etc. Synchronising your data would then be a matter of reading your local database and inserting records into your master database. The XML option is simpler, but you should consider crashes during save or multiple threads accessing the XML at once before you commit to store your application's data in a flat file. If that isn't a problem, soldierman's WriteXML() solution is quite neat. Whichever storage option you choose, I would recommend assigning each record a GUID when it's created. That way when you are synchronising with your master database you don't run the risk of inserting the same record twice.
