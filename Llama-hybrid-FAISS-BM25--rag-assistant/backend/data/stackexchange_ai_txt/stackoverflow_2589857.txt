You could try something like SELECT p.*, e.id FROM purchasers p INNER JOIN events e ON e.purchaser_id = p.id INNER JOIN ( SELECT p.* FROM purchasers p WHERE p.id = '$id' ) Original ON p.organization = Original.organization AND p.city = Original.city AND p.state = Original.state The subselect Original will return the original purchaser, and then link to the purchasers table by organization, city and state EDIT: Changed the query, this will still return duplicates, but only for the number of events registered per purchaser. If you wish to retrieve a DISTINCT list of purchasers, you cannot do this with the event id , so you need something like SELECT p.* FROM purchasers p INNER JOIN ( SELECT p.* FROM purchasers p WHERE p.id = '$id' ) Original ON p.organization = Original.organization AND p.city = Original.city AND p.state = Original.state
