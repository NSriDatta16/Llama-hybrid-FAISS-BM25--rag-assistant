vimdiff and CVS integration

I've always wanted to be able to get a reasonably elegant way of getting vimdiff to work with a CVS controlled file. I've found numerous (somewhat hacky) scripts around the internet (best example here ) that basically check out the file you are editing from CVS to a temp file, and vimdiff the two. None of these take into account branches, and always assume you're working from MAIN, which for me is completely useless. So, my question is this: has anyone out there found a decent solution for this that does more than this script? Or failing that, does anyone have any ideas of how they would implement this, or suggestions for what features you would consider vital for something that does this? My intention is that, if no one can suggest an already built solution to either use or build from, we start building one from here.
