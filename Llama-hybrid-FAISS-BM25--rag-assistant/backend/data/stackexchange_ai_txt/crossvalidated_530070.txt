Random thoughts, although does not fully answer the question. There seems to be a wastage of information in training new models on new data even if it is plentiful. Using an analogy with another general purpose technology, fitting new models is not totally dissimilar to reinventing the wheel. Bayesian and transfer learning seem to offer solutions in adding to cumulative data and knowledge, and hence to an extent can help mitigate this. Would the problem of replication crisis be as deep if Bayesian techniques had been used more and thus data containing surprisng results had to overcome the inertia of previous studies? As @svavil highlights, it is the accumulation of prior training that has accumulated in the past that allows (seemingly?) impressive results in the present. Training efficiency can be obtained by incorporating new data on top of previous data by transfer learning, and neural networks because of their usage in many different domains seem to be amenable to transfer learning (is this right?) and transfer learning is sometimes (usually?) going to mean potentially some efficiencies. Further aggregating of different neural networks seems to also mean potential efficiency of say training a lidar data set by a neural network and then concatenating (word used in a non-technical way!) this neural network to a radar trained neural network. As per the answer by @Tim, biased data can be a problem, and reusing a known good data set, say as a starting point for transfer learning may be helpful in mitigating a bias problem. As an aside, biased data presumably increases the problem if you accidently skew the bias-variance tradeoff too much for the former (low bias, high variance), and thus generalization will be even worse. Note here there are two types of bias used in the above sentence, and feel free to comment on this although is just an aside here. So the question may be able to be reversed, techniques that add to accumulated knowledge are helpful, and they also tend to be efficient when new data is added to them.
