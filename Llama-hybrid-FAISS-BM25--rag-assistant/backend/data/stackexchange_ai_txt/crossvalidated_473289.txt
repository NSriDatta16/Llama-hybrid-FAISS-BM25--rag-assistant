Interpret regression output using a likert scale IV (using STATA)

I want to run a regression with an binary DV and a likert scale ( 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=agree, 4=strongly agree) IV. I think the right model to use is a probit regression, or what would you guys recommend? Or would it be better to code the likert scale as an dummy variable and then use a logistic regression? If I use the likert scale IV and a run probit regression I am actually not sure how to interpret the results/coefficients of the regression. It would be great if you help me or give me some hints. IÂ´m really new to this stuff. Thanks in advance!
