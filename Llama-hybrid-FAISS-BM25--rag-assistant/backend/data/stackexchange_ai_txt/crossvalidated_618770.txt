Time Series Analysis with Non-continuous Data

I'm puzzled on how to approach this problem. Let me frame the problem like this: I am looking to predict total sales for Q1 in year 2023. I have only Q1 daily sales data for years 2022, 2021, and 2021. No imputation for missing 3 quarters. I can't put this data in a single series and use ARIMA because of the Gaps. I have about 150 non zero data points (+ a about 20 more with weekends). Guidance please on how to approach?
