There is no statistical cutoff for "biologically meaningful", it's entirely domain dependent. If you're looking at a pathway related to a common, highly variable process like glucose production, tiny changes are not likely going to have large effects on the organism. Being very sure that your treatment increases glucose production by 0.001%, for example, probably doesn't have much biological significance. If you're looking at something like exposure to botulinum toxin, however, small effects can have large biological consequences, as just a few nanograms of the toxin can kill. If are very sure that your treatment exposes patients to a non-zero amount of botulinum toxin, it's likely meaningful even with very, very small effect sizes. P-values just express your certainty of whether something changed or didn't change, it doesn't say whether those changes are actually meaningful.
