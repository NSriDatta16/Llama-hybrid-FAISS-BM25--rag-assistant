Why am I getting low performance using "ground truth of coefficients" for prediction?

I am trying to run a simulation in logistic regression but got trapped. Why I am only get ~71% accuracy even using ground truth of coefficients for prediction? set.seed(0) n Note we can get the estimation of beta by using glm . The estimation is pretty close when data size is large. > glm(y~X-1,family="binomial")$coefficients X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 0.68415400 0.59206451 0.29157944 0.84165069 0.08466564 > beta [1] 0.68309592 0.60590097 0.30353578 0.83300563 0.07931528 But, here suppose we are using the ground truth beta . Here is prediction using ground truth and the confusion matrix table(y,plogis(X %*% beta)>0.5) y FALSE TRUE 0 35499 14425 1 14456 35620
