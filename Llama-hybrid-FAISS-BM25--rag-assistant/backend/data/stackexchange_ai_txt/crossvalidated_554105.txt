One in 10 rule - logistic regression, does this apply within categories?

I hope this is not too basic a question but, for logistic regression, does the one in 10 rule of thumb (I'm aware there is some debate around 1: 10, 15, 20, other measures) apply within categories? i.e. I am looking at obesity and an outcome in a dataset of 16,000, people are divided into normal weight (n = ~7k), overweight (~6k), obese 1 (~2k), obese 2 (600) and obese 3 (n=188) groups (1 x categorical variable). I also have some other independent variables which are less relevant here. Anyway, with obese 2 and 3, both n and incidence reduce from 125 cases in 6k to 15 cases in 600 (obese 2) and 4 cases in 188 (obese 3). Subsequently, the CIs are very large for obese 2 and obese 3, so I am wondering if this is because of a lack of power and whether the rule of 10 also applies within a category (i.e. within obese 2/3) within the overall regression? Thank you in advance for your help and ideas!
