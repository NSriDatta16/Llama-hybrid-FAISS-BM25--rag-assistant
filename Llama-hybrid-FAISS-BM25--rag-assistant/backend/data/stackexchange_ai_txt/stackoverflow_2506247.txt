Adding shortcut for WiX file in a different fragment

I'm using heat.exe to generate fragments similar to this: These fragments are stored in the auto-generated wxs file. I'm then adding them into my feature (in the main WiX file) like so: This works fine. However, I'd also like to add a shortcut to Bar.exe to my start menu. I ideally want to do this in my main wix file, with the Bar.exe component still residing in the auto-generated wxs file. How would I approach this problem without modifying the auto-generated code?
