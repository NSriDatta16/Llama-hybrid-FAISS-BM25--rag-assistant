NLP - identifying which adjective describes which noun in a sentence

I need a method / algorithm for identifying which adjective describes which noun in a sentence. Sample input: "The product itself is good however this company has a terrible service" As an output i'd like to get something like: [product, good] [service, terrible] Could you please point me to some resources / names / algorithms or libraries (no matter which programming language) that might help with solving this?
