The disadvantage of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator that you mention can be illustrated with a bi-modal distribution like the following The maximum is in the point 2, but there is is not a lot of probability mass in the neighborhood. An alternative is to optimize a cost function. For instance with a square loss you would end up with the posterior mean . Edit: Xi'an mentioned in the comments MAP is not a typical Bayesian solution as it is not the result of a loss optimisation and depends on the parameterisation of the model. That is another disadvantage besides the one that you mentioned. A probability distribution will change depending on how we express the variable. The distribution of $X$ may have a different maximum than the distribution of $X^2$ . This means that changing the way that you express a variable, e.g. whether you use volume of length, can have an influence on the estimate.
