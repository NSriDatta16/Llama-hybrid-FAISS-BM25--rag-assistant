What is the best way to store usage reports over time?

I currently have a few server reports that return usage statistics whenever run. The data is collected from several different sources (mostly log files), so they're not in a database to begin with. The returned data are simple lists, for example, detailing how much disk space a user is using (user => space) average percent memory they've used for the month (user => memory), avg CPU time, etc. Some of the information is a running total (like disk usage) and others are averages of snapshots taken throughout the month. Running these reports and looking at the results works perfect, but I'd like to start storing these results to look at long-term trends. What would be the best way to do this?
