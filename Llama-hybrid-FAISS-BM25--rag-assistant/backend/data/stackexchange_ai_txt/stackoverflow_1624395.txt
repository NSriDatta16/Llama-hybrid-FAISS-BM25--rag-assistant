Removing Array Elements in Python while keeping track of their position

I'v got two numpy arrays. The first array contains some zeros (which are distributed randomly over the length of the array), which I would like to remove. My issue is that I would also like to remove the entries of the second array at the index positions where the first array elements are zero. I only came up with a very cumbersome for-loop. Does anyone have an "elegant" method for doing this? Thx!
