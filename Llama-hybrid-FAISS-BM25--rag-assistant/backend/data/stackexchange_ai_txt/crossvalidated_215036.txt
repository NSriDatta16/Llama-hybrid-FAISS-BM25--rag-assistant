After calculating inter-rater reliability, which data (e.g. consensus data?) should be used for further analyses?

My study used 2 raters in a fully crossed design to code 1) a categorical variable and 2) a continuous variable (i.e counting the number of times something happened). My question is, after performing inter-rater reliability and determining the level of agreement between raters to be acceptable, which data should be used for further analyses (T-tests, Anovas, etc)? I have not been able to find a clear answer to this. For the continuous variable, I can see how taking the average would make sense, but is this actually an accepted method? Further, how do you come to a consensus data set for the categorical data? Or, on the other hand, should the same analyses be performed with both sets of data (data from rater-1 and data from rater-2)? Thank you for your thoughts!
