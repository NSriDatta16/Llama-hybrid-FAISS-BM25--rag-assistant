Magento issue with calling isInStock() method on a product

I want to check if some products are in stock but whatever I do the isInStock() method always returns TRUE . My products are configurable products with no associated products and under the "Inventory" tab "Stock Availability" is set to "Out of Stock". What am I doing wrong? Thanks!
