Modify the sql query in asp.net?

I am using sql server 2005. In this query i want the log-in user detail should also display but it is not displaying . So please modify the query so that log-in user detail should also display with the help of session[userId].tostring(); Query written by me is: SELECT DISTINCT MUDMEMBER.PK_ID, MUDMEMBER.EMPLOYEE_ID, LKB.BANK_NAME, MUHD.SALARY_ACCOUNT_NO, MUHD.PF_NO, MUHD.PAN_NO, MUHD.GENDER, LKD.DESIGNATION_NAME FROM M_LEADERLED MLL INNER JOIN M_USER_DETAILS MUDMEMBER ON MLL.LED_ID = MUDMEMBER.PK_ID AND MLL.START_DATE Getdate() AND MLL.LEADER_ID = '1' LEFT OUTER JOIN M_USER_HR_DETAILS MUHD ON MUHD.FK_USER_ID = MUDMEMBER.PK_ID AND MUHD.IS_ACTIVE =1 LEFT OUTER JOIN LK_BANKS LKB ON LKB.PK_ID = MUHD.FK_BANK_ID LEFT OUTER JOIN LK_DESIGNATION LKD ON LKD.DESIGNATION_VALUE = MUHD.FK_DESIGNATION_VALUE AND LKD.FK_ORGANIZATION_ID = 1 AND LKD.IS_ACTIVE = 1 WHERE MUDMEMBER.ACTIVE = 1
