A far less elegant but much quicker to implement method might be as follows: var list = dataContext.CartLists.Include(typeof(CartListItem).Name).Where(l => l.CustNum == customerNumber && l.ListTypeID == (int)ShoppingCartType.WebShoppingCart).Single(); . . . but you'll need to ensure that you haven't had the EF model generator pluralize your entity set names. This is kind of an ugly solution, but it should give you compile errors once you update your EF model if your table names ever change, as ours just did, and you won't have to actually execute your code to try to find places where your strings don't match actual entities.
