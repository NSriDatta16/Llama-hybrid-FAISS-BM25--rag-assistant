How do you store your code and files for use across machines

I am interested to know what strategies people have to keep their code AND work versioned across multiple machines. For example I have a desktop PC running XP, a macbook running OSX and VMWare running XP as well as a sales laptop for running product demos. I want to know how I can always have these in sync. Subversion is a possibility for this but i find it less useful for dealing with binary files - maybe I have overlooked something here. What do other people use as they must have similar issues? Do they keep all files on a USB drive and never on the local file system. I am not always online so remote storage is not really an option.
