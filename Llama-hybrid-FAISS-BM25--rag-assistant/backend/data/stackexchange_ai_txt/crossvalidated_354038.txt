There are two parts to your analysis. Let's look at them one at a time. (1) Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Failure to reject does not mean that the data are normal. In particular, you look at three differences, but $n = 3$ is too small a sample size for the test to have a useful probability of detecting non-normality, if it exists. So there is no particular reason to believe that the differences are from a normal population. Thus there is no particular reason to suppose that results from a t test would be accurate. An exponential population is very far from normal, yet in 10,000 sets of $n = 3$ from $\mathsf{Exp}(1),$ the Shapiro-Wilk test rejected the null hypothesis of normality only 748 times. That is to say, the power of the test against the alternative that data are exponential is only about 7.5%. (Simulation in R.) set.seed(701); m = 10^4 pv = replicate(m, shapiro.test(rexp(3))$p.val) mean(pv (2) Paired test. It is true that the differences for the three pairs average about 81. This may seem a large value, but it is not a statistically significant value. You have correctly shown that the (questionable) t test does not find significance at the 5% level. Moreover, because there are only three differences, no reasonable rank-based, sign test, or permutation test can show a P-value for a two-sided alternative smaller than 0.25. For a one-sided test (that column 1 is bigger than column 2) no P-value can be smaller than 0.125. To achieve a P-value below 5% with any of these tests (one-sided), you would need $n = 5$ differences (all positive or all negative). d = c( -124.56, -51.24, -66.46) wilcox.test(d) Wilcoxon signed rank test data: d V = 0, p-value = 0.25 alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0
