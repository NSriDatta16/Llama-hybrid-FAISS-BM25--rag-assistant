You need to use the SaveFileDialog which is documented here to get the file to be saved outside of isolated storage. It doesn't help with the excel part, and there is no way to get directory information on a file being saved or opened on the client side in Silverlight, so I have no easy idea on the rest. (The hard way is a client side COM Interop Application which defeats the purpose of using Silverlight for this)
