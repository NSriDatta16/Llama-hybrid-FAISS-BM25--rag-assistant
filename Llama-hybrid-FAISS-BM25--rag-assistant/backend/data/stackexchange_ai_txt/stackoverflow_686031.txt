How do I control Regex grouping?

I have a text file which all contain the following fragments of code in it Lines.Strings = ( 'test@test1.com' 'test@test2.org' 'test@test3.org' 'test@test4.com') the e-mail address will change. as will the Lines part of Lines.String it can be called anything EG Test.Strings, or ListBox.Strings I want to match all and any text inside of this Strings = ( ) block; here is the code I'm using [a-zA-Z]+\.Strings\s+=\s+[\(]{1}(.+)[\)]{1} but this doesn't catch all of the matches I want the grouping to stop after the first ) is found. it looks like it's matching any character after the first ( and all the way to the end of the file to the last ) any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT : I'm not asking to match "emails"; i want any text between the opening ( and closing ) I think it's called "non-greedy" matching. i only want the match to end after the first ) is found.
