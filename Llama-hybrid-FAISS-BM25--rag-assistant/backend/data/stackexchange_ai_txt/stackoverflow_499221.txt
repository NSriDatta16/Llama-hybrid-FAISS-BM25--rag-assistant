How many users can an Amazon EC2 instance serve?

The use will be to serve dynamic content from data on S3. You can make up any definition of "normal" you think is normal. What about small, medium, and large instances? Ok. People want some data to work with, so here: The webservice is about 100kb at start, and uses AJAX, so it doesnt have to reload the whole page much, if at all. When it loads the page, it will send between 20 - 30 requests to the database (S3) to get small chunks of text (like comments). The average user will stay on the page for 10 min, translating to about 100kb at offset, and about 400kb more through requests. Assume that hit volume is the same at night and day.
