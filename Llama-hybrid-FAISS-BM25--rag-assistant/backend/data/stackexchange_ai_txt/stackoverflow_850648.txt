This is due to a change in the PlugIn introduced in a recent security update. Sorry! Applets loaded from the local file system are no longer granted socket permissions to localhost. Solution 246387 : A Security Vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment may Allow Code Loaded From the Local Filesystem to Access LocalHost The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains that map a name to the localhost).
