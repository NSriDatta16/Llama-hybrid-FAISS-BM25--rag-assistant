Prefered method for looping sound flash as3

I'm having some issues with looping a sound in flash AS3, in that when I tell the sound to loop I get a slight delay at the end/beginning of the audio. The audio is clipped correctly and will play without a gap on garage band. I know that there are issues with sound in general in flash, bugs with encodings and the inaccuracies with the SOUND_COMPLETE event (And Adobe should be embarrassed with their handling of these issues) I have tried to use the built in loop argument in the play method on the Sound class and also react on the SOUND_COMPLETE event, but both cause a delay. But has anyone come up with a technique for looping a sound without any noticeable gap?
