Another option is to create a static initializer similar to the following code class YourClass { private YourClass() { } static { new YourClass(); } // real ops } This way the private constructor is considered tested, and the runtime overhead is basically not measurable. I do this to get 100% coverage using EclEmma, but likely it works out for every coverage tool. The drawback with this solution, of course, is that you write production code (the static initializer) just for testing purposes.
