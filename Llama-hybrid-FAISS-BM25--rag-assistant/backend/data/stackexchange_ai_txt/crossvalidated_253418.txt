Time Series Analysis and Classifying Sequences or Identifying Sequence Motifs

Imagine if I have a game that dynamically increases or decreases the difficulty between levels each day and players can choose when they want to play/quit. Additionally, the players always get to see the changes in the difficulty level for the last 365 days so they might be able to guess that there is a local minima/maxima/trend/seasonality. In this example, there are 4 independent players (A, B, C, and D) that play the game on different days. Based on this visualization alone, we see that Player A (red circles) likes to play easy levels and stops playing when the difficulty level begins to increase. Player B (orange squares) only likes to play when the difficulty level is approximately increasing but doesn't like to play when it gets too hard. Player C (yellow triangles) is a master and only likes to play the hardest levels. Player D (green diamonds) only plays when the levels are decreasing in difficulty. I have several thousand other time series data for these players (and other players) and the first thing I want to do is identify/classify the multiple different playing preferences (i.e., what are the different playing motifs?). Then, I want to confirm whether the above trends/preferences also hold across multiple time series for each player. For instance, I want to know whether Player A exclusively plays when the game is easiest or if Player B only plays when the difficulty is increasing. A player can even spend a part of their time playing one way and the rest of their time playing a different way (i.e., 25% of the time spent playing the easiest difficulty levels and 75% of the time playing the hardest levels)
