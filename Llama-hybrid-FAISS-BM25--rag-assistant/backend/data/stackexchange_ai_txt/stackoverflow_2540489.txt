List of objects to JSON to Html Table?

If I have a list of objects IEnumerable myTypes; Is it possible for me to return this to the client as JSON return Json(myTypes); and if so, is it possible for me to convert this (now JSON format) list to a when it gets to the client? Is there any jQuery plugin to do this? The thing is, there's loads of other stuff I need to send as JSON also, so generating a table with a PartialView and embedding that into the JSON is a extra complexity that I'd like to avoid.
