I loved THINK Pascal. The debugger was awesome, and unthinkably so for its time. Not until using Eclipse in the past few years have I had anything approaching the sense of Wow that TP gave me - everything up until now has been a compromise, a step back. THINK Pascal gave the kind of attention to user interface, to usability, that I tried to give to the programs I was writing with it. Its programmers gave me the respect of thinking it might matter to me what something was colored, or where I could access it, spent time considering this and made great choices. Although other tools then and since have been more powerful - MPW, Apple's Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, for notable example - their power was inaccessible, poorly organized (from the perspective of a naive user), and unfriendly - you had to be "in the club" to take advantage of it (basically, that meant being a unixy commandline user). THINK Pascal put the goodies out where I could reach them. It is hard to reconstruct what I loved about TP, to come up with specific features that made it great, and I'm sorry. If I get a chance I'll crack open my old email account and see if I can come up with specifics.
