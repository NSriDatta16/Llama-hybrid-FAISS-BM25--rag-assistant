How to omit using python coverage lib?

I would like to omit some module that are in some particular directory : eggs and bin coverage -r -i --omit=/usr/lib/,/usr/share/,eggs,bin Name Stmts Exec Cover ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- bin/test 5 5 100% eggs/BeautifulSoup-3.0.7a-py2.6.egg/BeautifulSoup 1008 463 45% eggs/Django-1.0.2_final-py2.6.egg/django/__init__ 15 12 80% I have also try several variant of this without luck : coverage -r -i --omit=/usr/lib/,/usr/share/,`pwd`/eggs,`pwd`/bin or coverage -r -i --omit=/usr/lib/,/usr/share/,django,BeautifulSoup or coverage -r -i --omit=/usr/lib/,/usr/share/, /eggs It would be great if someone has a tip to get this working.
