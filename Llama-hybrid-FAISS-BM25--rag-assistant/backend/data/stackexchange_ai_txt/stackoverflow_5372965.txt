I think you would need to save it to a database or use local storage (which isn't supported by all browsers). Cookies would work, but they can be deleted by the user (so can local storage). Sessions wouldn't work because once the user closes their browser, they lose their sessions. Saving to a database or flat file is the most bulletproof way to do it.
