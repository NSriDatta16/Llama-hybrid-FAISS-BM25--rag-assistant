How are the channels handled in CNN? Is it independently processed or fused?

Let's assume that we are talking about 2D convolutions applied on images. In a grayscale image, the data is a matrix of dimensions $w \times h$ , where $w$ is the width of the image and $h$ is its height. In a color image, we normally have 3 channels : red, green and blue; this way, a color image can be represented as a matrix of dimensions $w \times h \times c$ , where $c$ is the number of channels, that is, 3. A convolution layer receives the image ( $w \times h \times c$ ) as input, and generates as output an activation map of dimensions $w' \times h' \times c'$ . The number of input channels in the convolution is $c$ , while the number of output channels is $c'$ . My confusion is that will CNN operate on the fused representation of the data if $c =2$ or 3 or 4 etc? Or does it operate on each channel at a time and then stacks the results? Say I have 4 channels each channel is a 2D matrix then would CNN internally form a fusion of the 4 channels and make some sort of a representation?
