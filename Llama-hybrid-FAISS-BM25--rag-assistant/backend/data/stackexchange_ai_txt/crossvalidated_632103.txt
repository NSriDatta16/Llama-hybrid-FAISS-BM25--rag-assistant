Alternative test instead of logistic regression for binary dependent outcome variables?

I have a dataset of patients who underwent an operation, and I collected information on post-surgery complications such as necrosis (binary outcome variable). Now, I would like to investigate whether independent variables such as age (continuous), gender (binary), or underlying disease (categorical) influence the likelihood of experiencing complications. My research suggests using a logistic regression model for binary outcome variables. Running it through R also gave me promising results. It just does not feel right. Is my approach the right one? This my code in R: glm(necrosis_y_n ~ age_op, data = df, family = binomial) It was a statistically significant result with an odds ratio of factor $1.053$ per unit increase of age. It just does not feel like the right approach statistically.
