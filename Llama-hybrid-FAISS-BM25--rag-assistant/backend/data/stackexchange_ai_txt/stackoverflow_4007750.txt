Why does Passenger 3.0 with nginx crash on startup(?) then 403s?

On Ubuntu with REE 1.8.7, with nginx 0.8.53 manually compiled with the Passenger 3 module doc installed as per the docs, I get an error in the nginx error log when nginx starts: Unable to start the Phusion Passenger watchdog because it encountered the following error during startup: Unable to start the Phusion Passenger logging agent: an error occurred while sending startup arguments: Broken pipe (32) (-1: Unknown error 18446744073709551615) I assume this means nginx never starts properly. When I try and view my site after this, I get a 403. 2010/10/22 00:56:47 [error] 13874#0: *1813942 directory index of "/var/ rails/myapp/current/public/" is forbidden, client: 125.197.115.16, server: new.myapp.fm, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "new.myapp.fm" I expect the first is probably causing the second. I haven't had any luck googling this. Can anyone provide insight or help me troubleshoot?
