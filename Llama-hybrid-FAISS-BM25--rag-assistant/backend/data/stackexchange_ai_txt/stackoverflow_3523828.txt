Definitely separate validation from import. Personally, I would use MS Access for the validation, as it's more forgiving than SQL Server of Excel's data storage issues, but you can use a table on SQL Server with all varchar(255) fields if you want. The import is trivial, the validation is a project all by itself. Data can fail validation tests in so many ways, each way needing it's own custom code.
