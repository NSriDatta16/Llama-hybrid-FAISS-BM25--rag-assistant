House price prediction method using Time Series

Courses mainly teach house prices prediction with multiple linear regression. Indeed the one I did on coursera and that makes sense to me. I note that some feel time series is also a suitable method. I am not clear as to why this could be so. Simply because there is no regular notion of selling a house, it can be at any time. Looking for a clarification.
