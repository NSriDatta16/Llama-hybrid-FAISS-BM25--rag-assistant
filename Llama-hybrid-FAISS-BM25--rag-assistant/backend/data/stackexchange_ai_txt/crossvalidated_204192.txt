Predicted probability values from Logistic regression are negative

I have a categorical response which i want to predict, so i am in the process of developing a logistic model. I am using k-fold cross-validation for model selection. The first model, which was just an intercept model is throwing negative fitted values. So i tried adding just 2 predictors to understand what was causing this, but the model with the 2 predictors is also predicting negative probabilities. Below is the code that i used: logistic_null1 I checked if may be the response Y is not a factors but doesn't seem to be the case either > class(trainingdata$SeriousDlqin2yrs) [1] "factor" > check3 summary(check3) predict(logistic_null1, testdata) Min. :-4.609 1st Qu.:-3.047 Median :-2.700 Mean :-2.703 3rd Qu.:-2.346 Max. :-1.601 What could cause this
