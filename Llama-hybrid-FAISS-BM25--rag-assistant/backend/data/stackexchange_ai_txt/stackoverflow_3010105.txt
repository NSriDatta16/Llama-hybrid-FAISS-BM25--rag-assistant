Which JavaScript or ASP.NET Charting Component/Tool/Library Will Work For This?

[Update]: Forgot to include ComponentArt... Hi, An interaction designer employed by the client I am currently working for produced some mock-ups, and now it is my job to determine the best way of implementing the charts included therein. After looking at the options I am aware of and was able to find doing some simple Google searches, I have narrowed it down to using either ComponentArt , Dundas Charts or Infragistics , simply because from what I can see of their demos, they have certain features I believe I will need to get things done. Here are the pictures from the mock-ups - ideally I need one piece of software that will cover all of these: This chart seems to be simple enough. Notice the arbitrary spacing between the years - not yet sure if this will be a sticking-point for the client or not. I don't know that I have ever seen a chart like this one - it combines the previous chart with some additional data. Here is the same chart, only this time illustrating what happens when a user mouses-over or clicks on an annotation within the chart. They want the nice styling within the pop-up, so the pop-up needs to be something like an iframe or similar. Obviously, as long as a control supports client-side events, with associated metadata, I can create the pop-up myself. Any ideas or recommendations would be appreciated, I haven't used charting controls in years , so I am at a bit of a loss and the client wants an estimate soon. Thank you!
