PHP can do many different things with many different libraries and supporting client-side scripting. Things I used to learn PHP: A blog with image uploader. An AJAX based tic-tac-toe game. An image storage site. There are many things PHP can do and no specific Roadmap you should follow. If you feel there is something you would like to write, simply write it.
