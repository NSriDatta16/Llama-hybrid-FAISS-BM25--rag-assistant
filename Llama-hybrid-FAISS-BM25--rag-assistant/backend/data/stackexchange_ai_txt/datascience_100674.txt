Convolutional neural network low performance

Problem description I'm doing Signal Modulation Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network, but performances are very low (around 15% accuracy) and I can't find out why. Data Dataset is composed by 220.000 rows like these. Data is perfectly balanced: I have 20.000 datapoints for each label. Dataset column Type Range Form Notes Signal i=real, q=real [i_0, i_1, ..., i_n], [q_0, q_1, ..., q_n] n=127 SNR s=integer [-18, 20] s Label l=string l They are 11 labels Neural Network Neural Network is a Convolutional composed sequentially by 2 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected. DROPOUT_RATE = 0.5 iq_in = keras.Input(shape=in_shp, name="IQ") conv_1 = Convolution1D(128, 7, input_shape=(1, 2, 128), padding="same", activation="relu")(iq_in) dr_1 = Dropout(DROPOUT_RATE)(conv_1) conv_2 = Convolution1D(128, 5, padding="same", activation="relu")(dr_1) max_pool = MaxPooling1D(padding='same')(conv_2) fc1 = Dense(256, name="fc1")(max_pool) dr_2 = Dropout(DROPOUT_RATE)(fc1) fc2 = Dense(128, name="fc2")(dr_2) out_flatten = Flatten()(fc2) output = Dense(11, name="output")(out_flatten) model = keras.Model(inputs=[iq_in], outputs=[output]) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam') model.summary() Training Training is being done splitting the data in 70% as Training set, 30% as Test set. NB_EPOCH = 100 # number of epochs to train on BATCH_SIZE = 1024 # training batch size filepath = NEURAL_NETWORK_FILENAME history = model.fit( X_train, Y_train, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=NB_EPOCH, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test), callbacks = [ keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=0, save_best_only=True, mode='auto'), keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, verbose=0, mode='auto') ]) # we re-load the best weights once training is finished model.load_weights(filepath) Results This is the confusion matrix outputted by my evaluation system. Question How to improve performance? Can someone criticize my Neural Network? Thanks.
