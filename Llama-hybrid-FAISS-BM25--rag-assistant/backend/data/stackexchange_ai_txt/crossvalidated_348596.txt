Features for relationship between medical concepts in clinical texts

I was going through the paper: Automatic extraction of relations between medical concepts in clinical texts by Roberts et al In the section: Context Features , it mentions set of 14 features. In several of these, authors mention " Any " word,POS etc in the words between two concepts. I am wondering how is "any" chosen? Is it that randomly a word is chosen between the concepts say when they choose feature CF1 . e.g. The patient was treated initially with [ceftriaxone]TREATMENT and [azithromycin]TREATMENT based on his history of [MRSA]PROBLEM. In this example provided in the paper as S1 , for the relation between azithromycin and MRSA would they choose any of the words in between from "based on his history of" ?
