Windows Icons for Details, List, etc

You know how, in windows explorer, when you click that button, and drag the slider, you can change the display from details, to list, small icons, etc etc? Does anyone know where I can get the icons that are beside each of those choices? Windows 7 would be ideal (not sure if they've changed over the years). Thanks!
