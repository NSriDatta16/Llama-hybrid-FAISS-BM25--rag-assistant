class A { public: virtual ~A() { count --; if (count == 0) { // this is the last one, do something } } protected: static int count; }; class B : public A{ public: B(); }; And then, in one and only one of your source files you need to put the following. It should go in the source file that contains the code for class A. int A::count(0); You need to do this, because the header file declared that there was going to be a variable named count, but didn't allocate any storage for it. If you didn't put it in a source file, the linker would complain that it wasn't found.
