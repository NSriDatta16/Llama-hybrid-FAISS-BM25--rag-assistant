Timestamp is from MS Docs timestamp is a data type that exposes automatically generated binary numbers, which are guaranteed to be unique within a database. timestamp is used typically as a mechanism for version-stamping table rows. The storage size is 8 bytes. This value makes no sense outside the database it was created in. Thus I don't see how it can be converted. In a non Sybase/ SQL Server database I would use a version number or last updated column
