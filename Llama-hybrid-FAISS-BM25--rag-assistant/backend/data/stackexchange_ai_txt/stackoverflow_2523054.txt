Turns out the SQL Server Profiler does report duration of stored proc calls against the stored proc name, it's just a matetr of knowing which events to listen to. The SP_Counts template seems to be the best starting point as it reports stored proc names. If you switch to use the 'completed' instead fo 'started' events then you can choose to report the duration of each call. From there you can save a recorded trace to an XML file and write XPath/XQuery to summarise the total and average tiem spent in each stored proc. I ended up writing a little C# application to sumamrise the data and output it to CSV file so I can view it in an excel spreadsheet and sort by the various columns - e.g. slowest stored proc on average, stored proc with most total time, and SP with highest invocation count.
