Why does the scaling of feature vectors improve performance of SVM classifier?

I've found that performing scaling in SVM problems really improves the performance of SVM ... But I don't understand why! I have read this explanation: "The main advantage of scaling is to avoid attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges." Unfortunately this didn't help me... Can somebody provide me a better explanation? Thank you in advance!
