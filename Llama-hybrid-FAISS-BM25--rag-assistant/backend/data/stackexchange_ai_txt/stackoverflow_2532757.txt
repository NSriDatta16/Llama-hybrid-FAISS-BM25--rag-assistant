Depends how heavy deployment is. Most of my applications are XCopy-Deployable, that is they don't need an installer and can just be copied/unzipped. So I use .ini Files (using my own INI File Parser as .net has no built in one) However, if your application needs to be centrally manageable (for example, using Windows Group Policies) or if you have a "heavy" installer anyway, the registry is the prime choice. This is because Applications that are installed normally to to C:\Program Files, and normal users do not have write access to this directory. Sure, there are Alternatives (%APPDATA% or Isolated Storage which has to be used when the Application is a Silverlight app), but you can as well "go with the flow". Of course, if your application is supposed to run on Mono, you can rule out the Registry anyway and should go Flat Files.
