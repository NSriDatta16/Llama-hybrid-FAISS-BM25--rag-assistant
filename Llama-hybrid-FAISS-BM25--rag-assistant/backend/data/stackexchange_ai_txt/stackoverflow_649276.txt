Those are parts of the specification for how Windows locates the certificate storage. The -sr location parameter tells the tool which certificate store to use: either currentuser to store it for the user, or localmachine to store it for everyone on the machine. The -ss parameter let's you give a name for a particular store, so you could, for example, have -sr currentuser -ss moe -sr localmachine -ss moe and have two different named stores -- one for the current user, one for the machine -- or have -sr currentuser -ss moe -sr currentuser -ss curly and have two different stores for just the current user.
