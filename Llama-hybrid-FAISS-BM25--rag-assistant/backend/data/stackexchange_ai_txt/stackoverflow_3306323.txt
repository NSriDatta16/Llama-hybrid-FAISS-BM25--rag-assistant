NetLogo programming questions: check agent color/have breeds pass through one another

Some basic programming questions in NetLogo: 1) In the is-agent? value command. How can I specifically check if the agent with id = 4 is green or not? By contrast, is-agent? green would only be true if any of the agents is green. 2) I have made two breeds of agents and they stop when they collide with each other. How can I make them pass over each other? Thank you.
