The layout looks fine. Where are you storing these images? For example, if you put them in the drawable-ldpi folder with the size you want, and then test on a emulator runing mdpi setting or hdpi settings the image will be bigger, you have to decide properly where to store them acording to your desing. These tags dont need the xml name space, you can write them without that, that is only needed for the main tag of the xml file.
