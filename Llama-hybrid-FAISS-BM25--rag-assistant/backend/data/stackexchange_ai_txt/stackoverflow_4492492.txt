I implemented some unattended services (Windows Services written in c#), using crontab algorithm to manage the scheduling. The pattern is powerful, and flexible. We can create schedules to any time we want, only using the cron expression. Maybe I am wrong, but the only schedule that I think cron doesn't cover is if we want the last day of the month, but this was never a requirement for all services. I copied the cron algorithm from an article in the internet (open source by Atif Aziz), and implemented in my utility class, working beautifully for years. See more details in my blog: CronTab schedule parser algorithm Cheers! Roberto
