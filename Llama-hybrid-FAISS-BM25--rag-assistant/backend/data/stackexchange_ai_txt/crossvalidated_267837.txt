Firstly lets remember $R^2$==1-$SS_{reg}$/$SS_{tot}$. Where $SS_{reg}$ is the sum of squared errors from your model: $Y=\beta_{1}X+\epsilon$ (Where $\epsilon$ is the error in your prediction) And $SS_{tot}$ is the sum of squared errors when you assume $Y$ = $\bar{Y}$. This is the same as the linear model $Y=\beta_{0}+\epsilon$, otherwise known as the NULL model. 1.Your first conclusions are correct. Because $R^2$ shows how well movements in $Y$ are explained by your model $\beta_{1}X+\epsilon$. An $R^2$ of 1 means your model perfectly explains movements of $Y$ that is $SS_{reg}$=0 i.e. $\epsilon=0$. So you can conclude an increase in $X$ by 1 will definitely result in $Y$ increasing by $\beta_{1}$. Likewise an $R^2$ of 0 means your model $\beta_{1}X+\epsilon$ does no better in explaining movements in $Y$ than just assuming $Y$ will be the average $\bar{Y}$. (That is $SS_{reg}$=$SS_{tot}$). i.e. $X$ has no bearing on $Y$. 2.If $R^2$=0.5 it means your model explains 50% of the movement in $Y$ when compared to simply stating $Y$ = $\bar{Y}$. The unexplained movement in $Y$ is captured by your error term $\epsilon$, which is white noise. This means when $X$ increases by 1 $Y$ on average will increase by $\beta_{1}$ but due to the unexplained white noise you might not see this in in the data i.e. in every instance of $Y_{i}$. 3.Even where $R^2$
