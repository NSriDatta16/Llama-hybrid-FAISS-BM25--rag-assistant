Need UltraTree Clone Method - Problem with reference

I have ultraTree (infragistics tree) which is created at design time and it has custom class as "Tag". I have List as member variable. I have two combo box. Based on the combo selection I'll check the List's each items "Tag". If list contains, just i pick that, otherwise i create a new UltraTree and add it to List and i assign to the Tree that is created at design time. My problem is, what i adding to the collection gets reference and all the item in the collection are overwritten by the last item. UltraTree don't have any clone method. I don't found any way to clone using this control. What can be my solution :( My sample code is // My custom class SelectedDeviceState treeState = new SelectedDeviceState( firstDevice, secondDevice); UltraTree tree = new UltraTree(); // This will clone the root node // (it will be executed only once -> Root) foreach (UltraTreeNode nod in tvwNavigation.Nodes) { UltraTreeNode tnode = nod.Clone() as UltraTreeNode; tree.Nodes.Add(tnode); } //Adding the custom class as TAG tree.Tag = treeState; // Assigned and added tvwNavigation = tree; _treeCollection.Add(tree);
