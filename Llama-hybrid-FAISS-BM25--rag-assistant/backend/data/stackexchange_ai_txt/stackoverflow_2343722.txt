This isn't really what you're asking, but I think it's a near-substitute. In Firefox it's possible to use Firebug (Opera has Dragonfly, and Chrome has its developer tools) and, from jQuery, use: console.log("message to display in the console, plus: " + variable_names) to display debug messages. These console.log() commands will cause js errors when the console is not active, though.
