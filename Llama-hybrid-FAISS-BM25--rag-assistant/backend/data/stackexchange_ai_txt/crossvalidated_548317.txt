Relation between PCA eigen values and data visualization

We have matrix data $X$ which is $n\times d$ . We use the covariance matrix/ design matrix/ gram matrix $X^T X$ to perform least-squares/ PCA. I compute the eigen basis representation of said matrix $$X^TX = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i u_i^T.$$ I notice that $\lambda_d \geq \sqrt{n}$ . Can I infer that there must have been at least $\sqrt{n}$ data $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^n$ (which forms the rows of the big matrix $X$ ) from the direction prependicular to $u_1$ PS : assume data $\{x_t\}$ to come from the d-dimesion sphere so that $\|x\|_2 = 1$ PS: I would be very tempted to say the number of data $x_t$ close to some region of $u_d$ is more than $\sqrt{n}$ , but I guess thats asking for too much
