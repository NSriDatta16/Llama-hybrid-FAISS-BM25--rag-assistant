This is mainly a function of how you define time = 0 for the models. If you set time = 0 to be the study-entry time for each individual, then for event outcomes you would have right censoring in elapsed time, as is common in survival models. There is no "delayed entry" for any individual, just the inherent limitation of potential right censoring. To account for things like secular changes during the course of the study, you can include the study entry date as a covariate for each individual and model that smoothly, e.g. with regression splines. For continuous outcomes like weight gain over time you could, for example, use a random-effects model. Then there is no need for all individuals to have the same number of observations or even to have them spaced evenly. Those with more observations end up being weighted more heavily, and will be the only ones to provide information about the longest times after the individually set time = 0 as defined in the first paragraph.
