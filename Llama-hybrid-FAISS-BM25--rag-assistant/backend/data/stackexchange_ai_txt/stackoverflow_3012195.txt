I see the following 3 possibilities as good candidates in your decision: 1.) Use CMS (It's simple and affordable) 2.) Give your design tasks to a university where for a small ammount students would be willing to do this for you and you could make payment as scholarship and organize the work on the project as a race between students to find the best designer. You don't have to pay taxes after scholarship payment, students are willing to do the job for a very small ammount (students are the poorest people in the world) and from 10 candidates you could choose the winner (the best in your taste) 3.) Go to a Freelancing site and open this project. Freelancer designers would try to bid for lesser and lesser prices, shorter and shorter timeframes and the winner would be the Freelancer who provides the best solution for the lowest price. However, in most cases, the cheapest person and the provider of the best quality is not the same person, in this case, you must decide how important is the cost and how important is the quality for you.
