SVN repos are usually organized with: trunk tags branches So, if that were the case, I would say that what you're looking for them to do is to create a branch, and leave the trunk alone. I don't have Tortoise on this machine, so I can't go do it to get an example, but I think there's an easy menu option to branch (maybe called tags/branches or something?)...make a branch, name it something like 'newdev' so that you have /branches/newdev/ as the development branch that they can modify in. Then, you'll just need to learn how to merge changesets from that branch into trunk.
