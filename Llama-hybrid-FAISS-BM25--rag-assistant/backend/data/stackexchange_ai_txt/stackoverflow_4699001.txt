Assuming the specific values of your configuration variables are only known at runtime (ie the configuration can't be generated statically), it makes no sense to include the configuration in the actual script as that would make proper caching impossible. It might be a good idea to dynamically generate a dedicated config.js on the server-side instead of embedding the configuration into the HTML if the rest of the page is static (or only re-generated on content change). If the page is dynamic anyway, I see nothing wrong with embedding the configuration. If you subscribe to the philosophy of completely separating markup and scripting, you could encode the configration in the markup (eg via the lang attribute and cutom classes), but the purist viewpoint is not necessarily most pertinent.
