The best strategy for this will be to use Linked Server, as it is designed for querying and writing to heterogeneous databases as you described above. But obviously due to the policy constraint you mentioned, this is not the option. Therefore, to achieve the result you want in the most optimal performance, here is what I suggest: Decide which database contains the lookup data only (minimal dataset) and you will need to execute a query on it to pull the info out Insert the lookup data using bulk copy into a temp/dummy table in the main database (contains most of the data that you will want to retrieve and return to the caller) Use stored procedure or query to join the temp table with other tables in your main database to retrieve the dataset desired The decision to whether to write this as web service or not isn't going to change the data retrieval process. But consideration should be given in essentially reducing the overhead on data transfer time by keeping the process as close to your db server as possible either on same machine or within LAN/high speed connection link. Data update will be quite straightforward. It will just be the standard two phase operations of pull data out from one and update the other. -
