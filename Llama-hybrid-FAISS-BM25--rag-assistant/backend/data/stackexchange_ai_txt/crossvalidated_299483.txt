I have the app that measures my weight every day at the same time. I don't do any stat analysis. It's pointless. Just draw the plots as they appear over time, you'll see what's going on. The only thing to do would be the trend extraction, which can be done by a simple or exponential moving average. Whatever you do should be non-parametric, because there's no model of your weight. You can try the intervention study if you're trying a different diet, but it's very difficult to do properly. The main reason is seasonality and other stuff going on in your life (which is called controls in econometrics), such as aging. The seasonality is a the beast. I've been drawing my weight for years, and can attest that holiday weight gain (around thanksgiving) is a real phenomenon :) Aging is huge too, plus other peculiarities of your life style, vacations, big events, stresses etc. You need to control for all of this in order to do statistical intervention analysis. However, a simple time plot of the weight with filters such as EWMA gives you all that is necessary. You'll see if your weight is decreasing or not once there's enough data collected.
