How to evaluate a search/retrieval engine using trec_eval?

Is there any body who has used TREC_EVAL? I need a "Trec_EVAL for dummies". I'm trying to evaluate a few search engines to compare parameters like Recall-Precision, ranking quality, etc for my thesis work. I can not find how to use TREC_EVAL to send queries to the search engine and get a result file which can be used with TREC_EVAL.
