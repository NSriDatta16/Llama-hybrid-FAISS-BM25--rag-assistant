About SVM cost and gamma parameters tuning

I am using R and e1071 package to tune a C-classification SVM. My question is: regardless of the kernel type (linear, polynomial, radial basis or sigmoidal), is there any good criterion to choose the range in which cost and $\gamma$ parameters should range over and/or to choose what the granularity should be (that is, as an example, gamma = 10 ^ (1:2) or gamma = 1:2 or gamma = 100 ^ (1:2) )? I add a second question: can tune.svm() return the best kernel type, too? Thanks,
