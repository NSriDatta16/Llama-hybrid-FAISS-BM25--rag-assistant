This is simply the interaction effect as far as I can tell. Data such as this can be analyzed as binomial since we have successes out of number of trials, so logistic regression is a reasonable option. The problem is logistic regression provides us with odds ratios not risk ratios. However, if the risk is low in all cells, the odds ratio is a good enough approximation to the risk ratio. And this is helpful because it is easier to estimate odds ratios and conduct inference on them. Inference is the more difficult part with risk ratios. And in relation to inference, the delta method results in the same solution as Wald confidence intervals. And profile likelihood confidence intervals are readily obtainable from a logistic regression model. The complicated part is that we have to parameterize the model such that the estimated parameters result in the excess interaction . The standard parameterization for GLMs (and design matrix) uses reference group coding such that the estimated parameters are deviations from the reference group. Of course, we can compute these values from the GLM, but we lose the ability to compute profile likelihood CI automatically in software for derived quantities. Richardson & Kaufman (2009) provide a reparameterization of the model that helps: $$\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}=e^{\beta_0}\times \big(1 + \beta_1A + \beta_2B + \beta_3(A\times B)\big)$$ where $\pi/(1-\pi)$ are the odds of success $(\tau)$ , and solving for $\pi$ , we get $\pi=\tau/(1+\tau)$ . And $\beta_3$ in particular is the parameter OP cares for. Since this is a custom parameterization, we can write the likelihood function, supply it to the binomial density function and maximize the log-likelihood for the parameters $\{\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3\}$ . Here is a pass at the problem in R: (dat Next to the likelihood function, precisely negative log-likelihood because optimizers have an easier time finding the minimum instead of the maximum of functions: ll $A + b2 * dat$ B + b3 * dat $A * dat$ B) -sum(dbinom( x = dat$Pass, size = rowSums(dat[, 3:4]), prob = odds / (1 + odds), log = TRUE)) } Next, we use the bbmle package for maximum likelihood estimation, it will provide profile likelihood CIs. library(bbmle) # Call mle, provide starting values (fit You will probably get some warning messages. So $\beta_3$ is the relative excess odds ratio for AB. One can arrive at the final value using standard logistic regression and the formula in the question: (coef.def This is the same value from the custom parameterization, but since it is derived, we can not obtain profile likelihood CIs from R. For Wald CI which are equivalent to the delta method: cbind(fit@coef - qnorm(.975) * coef(summary(fit))[, 2], fit@coef + qnorm(.975) * coef(summary(fit))[, 2])[4, ] # [,1] [,2] # b3 1.1980204 4.213734 And the profile likelihood CI: confint(fit)[4, ] # 2.5 % 97.5 % # b3 1.257277 4.356140 These are the Wald and profile likelihood CI respectively for OP's quantity of interest if you accept the odds ratio as an approximation to the risk ratio.
