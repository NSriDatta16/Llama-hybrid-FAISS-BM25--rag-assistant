It's straight forward to open a text file and read the contents in a WP7 project. Here is one way. Uri linesUri = new Uri("lines.txt", UriKind.Relative); StreamResourceInfo stream = App.GetResourceStream(linesUri); StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(stream.Stream); var contents = streamReader.ReadToEnd(); streamReader.Close(); I initially dragged the lines.txt file into my project from explorer - no other handling was necessary for this code to work. Include the references you need... using System.IO; using System.Windows.Resources;
