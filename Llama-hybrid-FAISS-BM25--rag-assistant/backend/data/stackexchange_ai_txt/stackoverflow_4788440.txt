The premise for your question is mistaken :) boost::thread_specific_ptr works even if the thread is not a boost thread. Think about it -- how would thread specific storage for the main thread work, seeing as it's impossible for it to be created by boost? I have used boost::thread_specific_ptr from the main thread fine, and although I haven't examined boost::thread_specific_ptr's implementation, the most obvious way of implementing it would work even for non-boost threads. Most operating systems let you get a unique ID number for the current thread, which you can then use as an index into a map/array/hashtable. More likely you have a different bug that prevents the behavior you're expecting to see from happening. You should open a separate question with a small compilable code sample illustrating the unexpected behavior.
