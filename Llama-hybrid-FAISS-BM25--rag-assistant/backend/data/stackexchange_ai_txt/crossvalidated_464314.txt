Is it appropriate to use a lagged feature in combination with those static features to predict the total percentage of tests passed and/or tests passed at 90 days? Yes, and it's commonly used (at least in the industry). Not all time series problems are solved via traditional time-series methods. It also seems like if the time features were included in a traditional ML model there might be some issues with iid assumption? iid assumption concerns the independence of different samples. Say, you're predicting $x_t$ with features $x_{t-1}$ and some other static ones. And, let another training sample $x_{t-1}$ with features $x_{t-2}$ and corresponding static ones. Surely, the training samples are not iid, but even so this type of approach is commonly used as well. A typical example would be LSTM networks.
