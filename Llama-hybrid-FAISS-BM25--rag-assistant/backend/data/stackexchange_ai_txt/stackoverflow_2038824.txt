I have done a few projects that used Lua as the data storage/config language The key element in the decision to use it was "Were we already using Lua on that project?" Another thing is that its portable to anywhere you can compile the lua interpreter. Its the same on all the platforms - there are no special xml libraries JSON is a good alternative. The only way ill use XML these days is with annotated code-gen for the serializers .NET xml or JAXB for example).
