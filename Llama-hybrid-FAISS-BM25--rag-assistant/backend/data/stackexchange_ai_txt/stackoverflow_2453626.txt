You might be able to set something up using the SimpleParse module, but this does require creating an EBNF grammar which might be more investment than you are interested in. The Sphinx/Doxygen bridge ( Breathe ) uses the xml output of Doxygen and acts on that instead. Perhaps a similar approach could work here - run Doxygen to extract xml formatted docs and then leverage some of the code from Breathe to get at the data you require.
