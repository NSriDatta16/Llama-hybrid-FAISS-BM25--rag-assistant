A full text index is an index you apply in a MySQL database to text fields that you plan to run a full text search on. A full text search uses the match(field) against('text') syntax. If you want to run a full text search you must have a full text index on the columns you'll be running it against. There are three types of Full Text searches. I'll quote the manual, because I think it says it best: A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a special query language. The string contains the words to search for. It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be weighted higher or lower than usual. Common words such as “some” or “then” are stopwords and do not match if present in the search string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean search. For more information, see Section 11.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”. A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special operators. The stopword list applies. In addition, words that are present in 50% or more of the rows are considered common and do not match. Full-text searches are natural language searches if no modifier is given. A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language search. The search string is used to perform a natural language search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search are added to the search string and the search is done again. The query returns the rows from the second search. The WITH QUERY EXPANSION modifier specifies a query expansion search. For more information, see Section 11.9.3, “Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion”. For more information take a gander at the Full Text Search Reference Page .
