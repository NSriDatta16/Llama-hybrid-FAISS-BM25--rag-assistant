It is difficult to visualize more than 3-4 dimensions in a single plot. One option would be to use principal components analysis (PCA) to compress the data and then visualize it in the main dimensions. There are several different packages in R (as well as the base prcomp function) that make this syntactically easy ( see CRAN ); interpreting the plots, loadings, is another story, but I think easier than a 10 variable ordinal scatterplot matrix.
