How to define default "TagPrefix" for custom controls

I have a number of custom controls that I am trying to enable designer support for. The signature looks something like the following: [ToolboxData(" ")] public class MyDropDownList: DropDownList { ... code here } This works fine, but when I drag a control onto the page from the toolbox, the TagPrefix that gets added is "cc1": Obviously it is somewhat irrelevant what that TagPrefix is... it works as it stands, but I figured I must be able to change it somehow and curiosity got the better of me... Anyone know how to define what the TagPrefix will be set to when dragging a custom control onto a page in visual studio? Thanks, Max
