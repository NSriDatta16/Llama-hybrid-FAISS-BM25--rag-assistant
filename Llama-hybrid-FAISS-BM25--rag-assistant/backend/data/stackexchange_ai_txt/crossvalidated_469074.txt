What core topics would all statisticians be required to know?

I would like to know what topics are considered 'core knowledge' for a statistician. Please keep in mind I know very little about statistics. At my university, I hear statistics students discuss topics such as: Time series analysis , Descriptive statistics , Non-parametric statistics , ANOVA , Regression Analysis , Statistical learning , etc. Assuming these are distinct courses, I am curious what topics like these are considered 'core' for a general statistician? Before anyone marks this as a duplicate, I have read through a good few similar threads. For instance: If there was a certification exam for statisticians, what would be the syllabus? Mathematician wants the equivalent knowledge to a quality stats degree However I find none of these really answer my question specifically. I don't want references. I'm interested in a specific list of topics (if one exists) that every statistician would be expected to know, with a brief description of what that topic actually is. Perhaps to give an example: I am a maths and theoretical physics student. It seems to me that, no matter what field of expertise a maths/physics student may eventually choose, there are a number of central topics they would be expected to know. For instance, one can list the following topics that are standard for most maths degrees: Set Theory Category Theory Point Set Topology Real analysis (Calculus, Measure Theory, Functional Analysis) Complex Analysis Abstract Algebra (Group, Ring and Field Theory) Number Theory Differential Geometry PDEs Algebraic Topology Algebraic Geometry etc Whether a student has taken a full course in this area or not, most maths students would be expected to know at least the basics in these 'core' areas. For physics, one can come up with a similar list. My question is: Can one come up with a similar list summarising the basic topics a statistician should know? If so, please give a basic description of each topic in the list (even just one or two sentences). I understand such lists are never a perfect (or even good) way of summing up the core knowledge for a field. Nevertheless, I am interested in getting a rough idea of what topics a statistician has studied.
