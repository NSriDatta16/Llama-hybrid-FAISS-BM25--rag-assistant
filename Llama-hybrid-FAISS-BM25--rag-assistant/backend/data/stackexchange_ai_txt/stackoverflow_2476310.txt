I found out in the documentation of Apple there is small paragraph explaining the UIToolBar. In this paragraph there is a very tiny sentence stating: "[..] When displayed, this toolbar obtains its current set of items from the toolbarItems property of the active view controller [..]" But they don't explain that view first has to be active to obtain these buttons. So that means that the UIToolBar is ready to retrieve it's Buttons on viewDidAppear and NOT on viewDidLoad message. - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated { [[self tableView] reloadData]; [[self navigationController] setToolbarHidden: NO animated:YES]; UIBarButtonItem * logoutButton = [[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Log out" style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:self action:@selector(logOut:)]autorelease]; NSMutableArray * arr = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:logoutButton, nil]; [self setToolbarItems:arr animated:YES]; [super viewDidAppear:animated]; }
