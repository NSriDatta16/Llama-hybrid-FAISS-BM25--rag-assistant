To confirm -- are you seeing the home page inserted into #notice , or is the browser redirecting to the home page? That is to say, is the default form submit action being canceled or not? Are you using any sort of web framework like the Zend Framework, Wordpress, PHPCake, etc? EDIT1 : This is an unusual issue. A few followup questions: Is the entire code of phpscripts.php included in your question? if not, please include a bit more code. Be sure to paste it in between and tags in the StackOverflow.com UI so it's easy for us to read Try putting the line of code: die('this is a test'); at the top of phpscripts.php . Repeat the process and see if you see the home page, or this is a test . If it's the latter, move the die() function down a few lines and repeat. This will help you diagnose what's wrong. Please post the results if you're still stuck...
