Thanks Joao. This looks like very clever and elegant solution. Little issue was that I had to source my script first to run myfile function e.g. I borrowed from your suggestion and made my runint.sh as follows #!/bin/bash script_name=$1 func_name=$2 func_arg=$3 source $script_name $func_name $func_arg Now I can run it as follows $ find ./ -name *.ogv -exec ./runit.sh ~/.bashrc myfile {} \; ./out.ogv: Ogg data, Skeleton v3.0 Otherwise I was getting $ find ./ -name *.ogv -exec ./runit.sh myfile {} \; ./runit.sh: 1: myfile: not found Anyway thanks a lot.
