In MyISAM : SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE MATCH(firstname, lastname) AGAINST ("Joe* Robert*" IN BOOLEAN MODE); This will run much faster if you create a FULLTEXT index: CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON mytable (firstname, lastname) For the query to be able to search the short names (like Joe in your case), you'll need to set the variable @@ft_min_word_len to 1 before creating the index. In InnoDB you'll need to split the search string: SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE firstname LIKE 'Joe%' AND lastname LIKE 'Robert%'
