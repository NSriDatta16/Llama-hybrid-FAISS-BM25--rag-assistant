Machine learning methods that maximize true positive rate

I am looking for a method that maximizes true positives only. Put another way, what I am looking for differs from usual classification in the sense that I would like the learning method to identify a region where the "positive" labels are as dense as possible, regardless of other positives (of course there must be a minimum expected size for this region, otherwise, any small enough region around a specific point would do the job). An option that I have would consist in thresholding the probabilities coming from a usual classifier (with a high threshold), but I would like to know whether there is any method designed with this objective in mind.
