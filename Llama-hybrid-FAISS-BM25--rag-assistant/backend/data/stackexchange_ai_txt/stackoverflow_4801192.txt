Error while adding Attribute in Magento 1.4.2

I have started working on a fresh Magento 1.4.2 installation. When I try to add a new attribute I get the following error: Fatal error: Call to a member function setIsPopup() on a non-object in /var/www/projects/magento/app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Catalog/Product/AttributeController.php on line 117 I tried searching in google and found a solution here: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/214159/ But that resolves add issue but it causes problem in Modifying a attribute. I like to know if any better solution is available to this issue. Thanks
