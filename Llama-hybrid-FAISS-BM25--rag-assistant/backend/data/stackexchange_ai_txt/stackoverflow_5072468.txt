This is covered in chapter 5 of iText In Action, 2nd ed . The code examples are all freely available online. In particular MovieCountries1 and MovieHistory2 both deal with page headers and footers. It boils down to using a PdfPageEvent implementation (usually derived from PdfPageEventHelper to cut down on boilerplate) to draw into the page's Direct Content during an EndPage (or BeginPage I suppose) event. You have to know where you want them, and you have to draw using a PdfContentByte instance, so you can't use the high-level Paragraph/Chapter/Chunk/Image/etc classes. You have to draw-this-there, draw-that-here. ColumnText can help a bit... but only for Plain Text. Anything even remotely fancy and you're on your own.
