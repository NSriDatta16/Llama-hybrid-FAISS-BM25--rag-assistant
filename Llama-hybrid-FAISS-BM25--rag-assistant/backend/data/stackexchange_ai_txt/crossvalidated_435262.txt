An artificial neural network (ANN) learns in your (supervised) classification problem, just like any other ML model, a function $h_{model}$ which approximates the 'true' unknown function $h_{data}$ . These functions map an input image to the set containing $c_1$ to $c_k$ . In the bigger picture it is not much different from the way logistic regression learns this: the weights are fit to minimize a loss function e.g. using randomized gradient descent. Just that the ANN has multiple connected units doing this instead of doing just 'one' logistic regression. It sometimes helps to just view ANNs as interconnected linear regressors with a non-linear activation function instead of anything else.
