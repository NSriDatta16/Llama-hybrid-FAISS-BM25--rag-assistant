Programmatically assigned eventhandler not showing up in HTML onClick attribute

I'm currently having a problem with event handlers assigned in the code-behind not appearing in the HTML code of the .aspx page. Below is the code fragment that does that: HtmlTable table = new HtmlTable(); HtmlTableRow row = new HtmlTableRow(); foreach(XmlNode item in IDList) { LinkButton btn = new LinkButton(); btn.Text = item.InnerText; btn.Click += new EventHandler(btn_Click); HtmlTableCell cell = new HtmlTableCell(); cell.Controls.add(btn); row.cells.add(cell); } table.rows.add(row); Something like that, more or less. So when I run the page and inspected the buttons using FireBug, I noticed that the eventhandler names for the buttons created have been changed to the LinkButtons' unique ID(ct125, 126, 127, etc), I think, and not "btn_Click" I'm hoping to hear if anyone else has faced this problem before and found a solution for it. Thanks.
