THE ACTUAL ANSWER IS The outer RDLC contains a LIST control which contained the following controls: TABLE (containing items related to the collection as a whole) SUBREPORT The SUBREPORT points to an RDLC which contained the following controls: TABLE (containing row items) (1) Use the LIST's "grouping" property to group your 1-to-N collections. The "grouping" property is found by choosing the LIST control then choosing Visual Studio's menu options as such: VIEW > PROPERTIES WINDOW. (2) Next, set the LIST's data source. This is found using by choosing the REPORT and then choosing Visual Studio's menu options as such: REPORT > DATA SOURCES. Drag any field onto the control and the data source will automatically set itself up. NOTE: If you cannot "see" any data sources in Visual Studio's data sources window it is "probably" because service references in your project are causing issues...temporarily exclude them from your project and choose RESFRESH icon within Visual Studio's data sources window (they should then appear). Sadly, you must do this EVERY TIME your data source changes. Once you have the LIST iterating properly you can add-in the SUBREPORT and any other controls. ...I now OFFICIALLY hate RDLC's.
