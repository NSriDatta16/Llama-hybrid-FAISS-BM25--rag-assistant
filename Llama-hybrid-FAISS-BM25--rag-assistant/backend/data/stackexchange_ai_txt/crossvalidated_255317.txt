How to forecast based on time series data and additional predictors?

I am currently working on an analysis project where I wish to predict sickness levels of employees in different offices for a company for the remainder of 2017. In the past, I have made predictions based purely on predictors and also just purely on the time series. For this project, I feel I need to combine the 2 types of forecasting for the must accurate results. I have the following data available: The past 4 years sickness data measured in hours per day per office. The number of people working in the company in each office for each day of the year for the last 4 years. I feel that combining these 2 measurements will lead to reasonably accurate forecasts. I can see that that the time series data has a seasonal element to it and a slowly declining trend. My problem is combining the employee numbers per office with historical sickness data per office. Any help on this is much appreciated. I am attempting to do this in R but any theoretical advice is appreciated too or a book/website reccomendations for learning this kind of methodology. Thanks!
