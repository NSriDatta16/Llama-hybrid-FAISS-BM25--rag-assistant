If a credible interval has a flat prior, is a 95% confidence interval equal to a 95% credible interval?

I'm very new to Bayesian statistics, and this may be a silly question. Nevertheless: Consider a credible interval with a prior that specifies a uniform distribution. For example, from 0 to 1, where 0 to 1 represents the full range of possible values of an effect. In this case, would a 95% credible interval be equal to a 95% confidence interval?
