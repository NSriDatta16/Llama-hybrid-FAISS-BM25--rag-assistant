It doesn't matter what time limit you're gonna use - it won't solve your problem. What you need to do is either use their API, which is inconsistent with the real results you see, or sign up for 100 proxies and iterate thru them all in a round robin format. You can easily scrape Google 24/7 with 100 proxies or so, and it just costs $100. Make sure you clear cookies after every request, and set a good user agent (nothing dumb that makes Google think you're a bad bot). I rather do that than pay for their API which gives you X amount of calls and wastes your money. Yes, I know technically it's against their TOS, but it seems like what you're doing is harmless.
