Why are you calling the methods ccTouchesBegan:withEvent: and ccTouchesMoved:withEvent: instead of the original names? You don't have to change the names of the methods when you subclass UINavigationController; instead, you should keep the same names and call super on them as well as appropriate. For example: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"I'm overriding touch"); [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"I'm overriding move"); [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; }
