MbUnit: The most elegant way to compare doubles?

The code Assert.AreEqual (9.97320998018748d, observerPosition.CenterLongitude); produces Expected Value & Actual Value : 9.97320998018748 Remark : Both values look the same when formatted but they are distinct instances. What is the most elegant way to compare two doubles for equality in MbUnit 3.0? I know I could round them up myself, but is there some MbUnit construct for this? UPDATE: I consider my current "workaround" to be non-elegant: Assert.LessThan( Math.Abs(9.97320998018748d - observerPosition.CenterLongitude), 0.0000001);
