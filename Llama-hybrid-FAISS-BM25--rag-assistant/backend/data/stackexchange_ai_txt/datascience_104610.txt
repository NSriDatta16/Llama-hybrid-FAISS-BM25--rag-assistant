Bad accuracy on predicting user ratings upon his reviews

I am trying to predict user ratings based on books he rated(ratings range between 1-10). So I encoded the summary of the books and then tried to train the model with the text encoding(practically the matrix). I used CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer to encode the summary of each book. My thought was that if two summaries are similar the user will probably rate them the same. But, unfortunately the accuracy metric and loss return awful results. For example, when I am running the code for 5 epochs: I believe that until the model creation I am doing fine, but because I am totally new to keras I cannot understand how to build the perfect model. What can I do to improve my model? Thanks in advance! import pandas as pd from keras import models from keras.layers import Dense from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None sw = set(stopwords.words('english')) def html_decode(s): """ Returns the ASCII decoded version of the given HTML string.
