The difficulty is that stored procedures are non-relational. Therefore, apart from participating in an Insert statement, they can't be leveraged in other queries; or to borrow some Linq vernacular they are not "composable". You way want to consider table valued functions (which I believe are available as early as SQL Server 2000))
