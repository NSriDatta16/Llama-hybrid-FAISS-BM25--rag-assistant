One of the papers is publicly available at this address . From this paper, it seems to be an acronym designing an evaluation criterion: Evaluation criteria. Following the protocol [15], we report Average Precision (AP), Precision at the top 10 ranked videos (P10), and P100. This would mean that P100 holds for: Precision at the top 100 ranked videos. This seems linked to the specific data set used in that paper. I do not think this is a common acronym for any type of scoring/performance quantity in image classification.
