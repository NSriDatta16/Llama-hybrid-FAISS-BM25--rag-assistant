XSLT Transforming performance

Here is links to my files XML , XSLT , Include XSLT Hi I am transforming xml into html. My xml file is about 10kb big and my xslt 70kb and output html about 10kb big. Transformer xformer = StylesheetCache.newTransformer(templateFile); xformer.transform(new DOMSource(outlineDoc),new StreamResult(out)); The creating of the transformer takes about 10s to create thats why i created cache that bring it down to 300ms if its cached. The transform line takes 3s to execute. Now is this long. I have written similar transforms on windows mobile and it execution time is about I changed the TransformerFactory to Saxon but the result was about the same. thanks
