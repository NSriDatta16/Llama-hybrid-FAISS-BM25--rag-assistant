How do I interpret the coefficients of a mixed effects multilevel logistic regression differently from regular logistic model?

I am trying to wrap my head around mixed effects multilevel logistic regression. Have a look at my variables: y: Popularity (0 = Not popular, 1 = Popular) x1: Extraversion (Continuous) x2: Teacher experience (0 = Low, 1 = High) And here is my code and results: library(lme4) library(haven) library(tidyverse) library(texreg) # Load df df % mutate( popular = case_when( popular 4 ~ 1, # Popular ), texp = case_when( texp 15 ~ 1, # High ) %>% as_factor()) model1 If this was a regular logistic regression, I would interpret model 2 as the following: Intercept: The log-odds of being popular are -5.31 when extraversion is 0 and teacher experience is 0. The log-odds (or logits) of being popular increases with 0.87 when extraversion increases by one (Teacher experience is hold constant) The log-odds of being popular are 2.10 higher if you are in a class with high teacher experience than one with low (extraversion hold constant). Questions Is this reading of the coefficients wrong when the model is mixed effects multilevel? What can I make of this "Var: class (Intercept)"? Why does is decrease? Imagine the intercept was insignificant in model 1 but turned significant in model 2. Why?
