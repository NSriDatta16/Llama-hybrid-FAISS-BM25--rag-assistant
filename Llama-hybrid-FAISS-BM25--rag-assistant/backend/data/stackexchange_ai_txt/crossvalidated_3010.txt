Structural equation models are better suited for this kind of data, e.g. by introducing an extra factor for couple which allows to account for the dependence structure (paired responses). David A. Kenny reviewed the main points for analysis dyadic data ; although it doesn't focus on questionnaire analysis, it may help. A couple of references : Olsen, JA and Kenny, DA (2006). Structural Equation Modeling With Interchangeable Dyads . Psychological Methods , 11(2) , 127–141. McMahon,, JM, Pouget, ER, and Tortu, S (2006). A guide for multilevel modeling of dyadic data with binary outcomes using SAS PROC NLMIXED . Comput Stat Data Anal. , 50(12) , 3663–3680. Thompson, L and Walker, AJ (1982).

For more thorough description of the models for dyadic data (although not restrained to item analysis), I would suggest Kenny, DA, Kashy, DA, and Cook, WL (2006). Dyadic Data Analysis .
