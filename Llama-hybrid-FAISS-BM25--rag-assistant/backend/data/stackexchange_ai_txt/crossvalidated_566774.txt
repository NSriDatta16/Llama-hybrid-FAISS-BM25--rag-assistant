The differences between CCC and DCC should be clear from the papers that introduced DCC as an extension of CCC: Engle & Sheppard (2001) and Engle (2002) . They are also discussed in time series textbooks that cover multivariate GARCH models such as Lütkepohl (2005) (chapter 16) and Tsay (2013) (chapter 7). The essential difference is that in CCC, the conditional correlation matrix of the residuals from the conditional mean model is constant over time, while in DCC, it is time varying in a an autoregressive (more precisely, GARCH-like) manner. Neither CCC nor DCC can model volatility spillovers. Some articles may claim otherwise, but as far as I can tell that just shows a lack of understanding of the mechanics of these models.
