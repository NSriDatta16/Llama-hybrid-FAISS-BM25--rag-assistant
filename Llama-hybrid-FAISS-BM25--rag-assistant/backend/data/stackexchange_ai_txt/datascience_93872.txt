What if Training and testing dataset comes from the same source?

I am working on a classification problem in which I have to distinguish between healthy and damaged plates. when I use the combination of k-means clustering and SVM algorithm together with 10-fold cross validation, I can achieve the accuracy up to 95%. All the training and validation datasets come from the experiment. For the testing, can I get the datasets after repeating same experiments with same specimen or I have to use different sets of specimens?
