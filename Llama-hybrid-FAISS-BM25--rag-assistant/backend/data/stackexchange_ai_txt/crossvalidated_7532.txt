How to choose number of lags in ARCH models using ARCH LM test?

I would like to ask you, what is the correct number of Lags in ARCH LM Test? I am referring to ArchTest in FinTS package, but other ArchTest (such as the one in Eviews) provide same results. In many time series, when I choose Lags between 1:5 the p.value is usually higher than 0.05, but with increasing of Lags, p.value becomes smaller. So how to do the correct decision if for lag=1, the time series looks homoscedastic(NO ARCH Effects), but for lags=5 and lags=12 result is heteroscedastic (presence of ACH) or reverse? Thank you Sincerely Jan #Example code in R library(quantmod) library(FinTS) getSymbols("XPT/USD",src="oanda") ret_xptusd
