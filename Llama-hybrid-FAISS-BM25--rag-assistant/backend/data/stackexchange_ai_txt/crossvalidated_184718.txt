Method to model one Neural network to predict multiple responses

I'm trying to predict events that are represented by a vector of 70 values. They are continues values ranging from 0 to 1. I'm fitting a model that outputs 70 numbers for every sample. Normally for classification one would pick the highest value as the prediction, but I'm going to keep all of them as I'm trying to use all of these value. Is this something reasonable to do? Any public available information available for this? For example, I could try to predict someone's preference about topics in school. My Y would look something like this: [1 0.5 0.9 0] 1 being the most preferred topic say statistics 0.5 being the neutral topic computer science 0.9 being the second most preferred topic say economics 0 being the least preferred topic say history and I will have features in X for every sample to fit a ANN model to these numbers, at the end instead of picking one highest number, I'm going to keep all values and the values would look something like this [0.9 0.4 0.7 0.2] Is there anything related to what I'm trying to do? Looking for sources for additional information.
