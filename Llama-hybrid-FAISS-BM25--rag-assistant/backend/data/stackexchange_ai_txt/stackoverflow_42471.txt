Many MVP's have gift subscriptions that they can give away, so it pays off to be visible in the community. Speak at your local user group, start (or participate) in an open source project, start a blog... just generally get your name out there. Eventually you'll get one (or an MVP :)). What I've found is that if you pay attention there are plenty of opportunities to snag a free copy of Office or Visual Studio at local Microsoft events. Good luck!
