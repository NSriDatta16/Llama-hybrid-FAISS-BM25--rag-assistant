MySQL conditional statement

Alright, so I have a query that looks like this: SELECT `orders`.*, GROUP_CONCAT( CONCAT( `menu_items`.`name`, ' ($', FORMAT(`menu_items`.`price`,2), ')' ) SEPARATOR ' ' ) as `items`, SUM(`menu_items`.`price`) as `additional`, `children`.`first_name`, `children`.`last_name`, `organizations`.`base_price` FROM `orders`, `order_items`, `menu_items`, `children`, `organizations` WHERE `order_items`.`menu_item_id` = `menu_items`.`id` AND `order_items`.`order_id` = `orders`.`id` AND `orders`.`added_by` = {$user_id} AND `orders`.`date` > '{$cutoff}' AND `children`.`id` = `orders`.`child_id` AND `organizations`.`id` = `children`.`organization_id` GROUP BY `orders`.`id` I know it's a monstrosity and that some people will die before not using explicit joins. Ignoring that, however, what I wish to do is to only use the CONCAT inside the GROUP_CONCAT if the menu_items.price is greater than 0, otherwise only return menu_items.name . I have had, however, no success trying to throw an IF in there. I've read the manual but all the ways that I've tried aren't working and I'm pretty sure I'm missing something on the whole conditional statements thing.
