Think first about multiple linear regression. In that case, regression coefficients of independent predictor variables add. I suspect that's where you got the idea of adding the hazard ratios. But the hazard ratios are not the coefficients in a Cox regression. Hazard ratios are obtained by exponentiating the Cox regression coefficients. So by the laws of exponents, summing coefficients means multiplying hazard ratios. This is what you figured out in one of your comments; 2 * 6.5= 13. That said, I would be extremely hesitant to apply this rule to your situation. Mother Nature has beat me up too often, over my decades as a bioscientist, to let me believe that your two genes are really in "completely different pathways." Your lack of finding cases with both genes deleted might be a sign of synthetic lethality: you can get by if you have one or the other, but lose both and the cell (or organism) dies. Or perhaps one is functionally downstream of the other in some yet un-described pathway; then adding the loss of the second gene may have no additional effect. Without data on true functional independence you should proceed very cautiously.
