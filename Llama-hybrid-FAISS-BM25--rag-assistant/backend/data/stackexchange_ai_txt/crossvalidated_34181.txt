Sometimes when we look at a treatment effect by computing the difference on response post treatment ot pretreatment we say that the patient act as his own control. The purpose for providing a control group is to account for the so-called placebo effect. Sometimes there can be a positive change even if the treatment is not applied. So the effect we want to determine is the average increase above the "placebo effect."
