What are some of the methods that can be used to avoid a page being cached by the browser?

I have a user that is trying to view the questions of an online exam. During the exam they select 1 of 4 answers and click "Answer". For this user it seems to load the same page/question over and over again, where as it should advance to a new question after every question answered. My guess is that it's caching, but it doesn't seem to be browser caching as they have tried both Internet Explorer and Firefox. They are using satellite internet, so my guess is that there is some other caching on their network/router. Here are the headers that are sent from the server. HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 03 Mar 2009 05:52:38 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Unix) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6 Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=[...]; path=/ Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 I have had the user reset their browser settings completely, but it hasn't made a difference. I have added a timestamp to the GET query/string of the page, such as: /path/question.php?exam_id=2323&user_exam_id=2334&timestamp=1236063834 What other methods can I use to force the user's computer to refresh the page on every page load? The server is running Apache, PHP, MySQL.
