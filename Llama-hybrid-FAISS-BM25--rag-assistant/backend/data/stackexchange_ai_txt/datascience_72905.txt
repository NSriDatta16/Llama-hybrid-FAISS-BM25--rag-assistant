Your images_dir actually seems to be the path to a single image... but nevertheless, I would simply create a single number array with shape: (num_images, height, width, channels) by doing the following: import os import numpy as np # Root directory holding all images (I recommend removing the space in "Atom projects") images_dir = "/home/awesome_ruler/Documents/Atom projects/Compression_enc/Images/IMG/" # Number of images you want to load N= 125 # Get all paths and take the first N n_image_paths = sorted([f.path for f in os.scandir(data_root)])[:N] # Load the images using on of the variants of loading images images = np.array([Image.open(f) for f in n_image_paths]) # Be careful with variants: the order of channels is different for different methods! # images = np.array([plt.imread(f) for f in n_image_paths]) # Matplotlib # images = np.array([cv2.imread(f) for f in n_image_paths]) # OpenCV Now images can be passed directly to your model: autoencoder.fit(x=images, epochs=50, ...)
