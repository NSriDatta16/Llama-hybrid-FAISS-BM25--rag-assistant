Get Logistic regressions odds from equation result

By using logistic regression in SPSS I get an equation that looks like this: 0.1535 * X1+ -0.0002973 * X2 + -114.9 * X3 + -114.0 * X4 How do I transform the result of the equation to the odds of the classifier (between 0 and 1) using SQL? Thanks in advance!
