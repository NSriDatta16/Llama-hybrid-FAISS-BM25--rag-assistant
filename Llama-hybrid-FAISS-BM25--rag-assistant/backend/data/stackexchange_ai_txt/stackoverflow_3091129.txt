First - please don't name your PostMethod variable get . Second, try this: PostMethod post = new PostMethod("yourUrl") { @Override public boolean getFollowRedirects() { return true; } }; If you ever happen to be on the "other side" and want to prevent your users from suffering, use the response code 303 (See Other) when redirecting a POST request to a GET , instead of the common 302 and 301 (per RFC ). Regular browsers tend to be nice, break the rules and NOT ask us to confirm these redirects, but a lot of mobile browsers still do. Regarding your question about form based authentication - you just need to figure out the parameter names to use (by looking at the source of the website where you "normally" log in, for example), and then populate them with the appropriate values: post.addParameter("username", username); post.addParameter("password", password); I played around with the login form at myoffice.bt.com, there's a few things going on in JavaScript. The form is submitted to https://myoffice.bt.com/siteminderagent/forms/login.fcc The form elements that are submitted were as follows ( name=value , some values were empty): Segment=btb.hub SubSegment= searchType=0 searchPlatform=BEA lob=btb.hub queryText= searchText= ctl00$masterWebpartManager$gwpCustomLogin1$CustomLogin1$UserName=your@email.com ctl00$masterWebpartManager$gwpCustomLogin1$CustomLogin1$PWD=yourpwd ctl00$masterWebpartManager$gwpCustomLogin1$CustomLogin1$RememberMe=on USER=your@email.com PASSWORD=yourpwd SMENC=ISO-8859-1 SMLOCALE=US-EN userFirstLoginUrl=https://myoffice.bt.com/ManageBusinessApplications/SecretQA.aspx PrivateLoginSuccessUrl=https://myoffice.bt.com/sm/privatecreatesession.aspx?siteArea=btb.mya PublicLoginSuccessUrl=https://myoffice.bt.com/sm/createsession.aspx?siteArea=btb.mya target=https://myoffice.bt.com/sm/privatecreatesession.aspx?siteArea=btb.mya&TARGET=https%3a%2f%2fmyoffice.bt.com%2fdefault.aspx (hidden) submitStatus= smauthreason= smagentname= postpreservationdata= AnonUserName=anon@myoffice.bt.com authMode=SITEMINDER smUrl=https://myoffice.bt.com/siteminderagent/forms/login.fcc notSMUrl=https://myoffice.bt.com/default.aspx smIdentifier=1 Try adding some or all of these (at least USER and PASSWORD ) to your PostMethod , and make sure you are submitting to the correct URL.
