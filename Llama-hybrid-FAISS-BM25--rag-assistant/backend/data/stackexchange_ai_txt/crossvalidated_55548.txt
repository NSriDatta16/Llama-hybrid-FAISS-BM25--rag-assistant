Based upon your research design, I would hypothesize that one analysis you might want to look into is a logistic regression model. This model is typically conducted with a binary response variable, and predictors are incorporated to see how well they help differentiate between the response categories. In your case, you are predicting school membership (Alpha | Beta), and trying to use your plagiarism, drugs, and gender scores to do so. A significant predictor in this model would tell you that, controlling for the other predictors, it accounts for a proportion of the variability in the log odds of attending one school or the other. You can further interpret the individual coefficients to understand what one school is doing more or less of. To get you started, I would recommend looking at the logistic regression chapter in Tabachnick and Fidell's Using Multivariate Statistics , or (for an applied example using SPSS, without much of the mathematical background) Andy Field's Discovering Statistics with SPSS .
