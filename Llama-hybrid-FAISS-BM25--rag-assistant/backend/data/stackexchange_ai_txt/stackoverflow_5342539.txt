The two strings ARE allocated in read-only memory and are completely different. But you use one and the same pointer to point to each of them... What's not to understand? Remember, char* is just a pointer. It is mutable (non-const). char* p = 0; p = "Hello"; //OK p = "Jo" //OK; p[0] = 'X' //OOPS, now THIS is bad (undefined behavior) After your edit: No, string literals have static storage duration (unlike all other literals), they aren't created on stack . They will exist till program termination.
