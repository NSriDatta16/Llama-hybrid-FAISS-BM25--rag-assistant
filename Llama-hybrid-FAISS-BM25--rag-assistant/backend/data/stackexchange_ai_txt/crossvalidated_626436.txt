Your expectation is wrong. It's all about evaluation metrics and loss functions: Poisson regression minimizes the average unit Poisson deviance. lm() minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE). Thus: If you evaluate the models with MSE, you can expect lm() to "win". Similarly, if you evaluate with mean unit Poisson deviance, glm() will win. Now enters Juan the game and chooses mean absolute error as evaluation metric. Neither of the two models tried to minimize this, so either of them might win. Try: Run a linear median regression via quantreg::rq(...) . I'd expect it to do better because it was fitted to minimize mean absolute error.
