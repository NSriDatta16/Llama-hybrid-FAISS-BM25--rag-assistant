Your query is using joins. You can either use an outer join, or use Include for "eager loading" so that you will pull all entities and their relations: var employees = Employees.Include("ChildOrganizationMaps").Include("EmailAddresses").Where(e=>e.ContactAttributes.Any(ca.AttributeID = 19730317) .Select(e => new {e.FName, e.LName, e.EmailAddress.Address});
