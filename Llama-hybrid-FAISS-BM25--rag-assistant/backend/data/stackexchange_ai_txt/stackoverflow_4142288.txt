Some long integers are 8 bytes, some are 4. The 8 byte variant usually exists only on 64-bit systems. Check this page if you want to get an idea. Of course, we don't know what it is in your case, so you'd have to post more details. To be on the safe side, you could decide to put the 8 bytes into 2 long integers anyway. That way, it will always work. In the worst case you'd be wasting half your storage space.
