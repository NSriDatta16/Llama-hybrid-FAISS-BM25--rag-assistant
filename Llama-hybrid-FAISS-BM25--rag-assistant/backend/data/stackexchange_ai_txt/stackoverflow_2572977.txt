If the style at your company is set to use Hungarian notation then there is no problem using it - a policy is a policy. There are plenty of tools that help enforce coding naming conventions (like Stylecop for C# ) so you can move on if you are allowed. Basically having standards is a good idea - but what those standards are depends on the company you work for. If you have some authority you could attempt to impose the standards that MS are currently promoting - but if you have a lot of legacy code that will involve a lot of expensive refactoring with little material benefit. I would recommend that you move away from Hungarian notation for new projects (possibly by utilising a code analysis tool) but be pragmatic about legacy code.
