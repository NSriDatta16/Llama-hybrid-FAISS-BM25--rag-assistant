If you have the numbers a[1] a[2] ... a[n] and you know their average is avg(n) = (a[1] + ... + a[n]) / n , then when you get another number a[n + 1] you can do: avg(n + 1) = (avg(n) * n + a[n + 1]) / (n + 1) Some floating point errors are unavoidable, but you should test this and see if it's good enough. To avoid overflow, you could do the division first: avg(n + 1) = (avg(n) / (n + 1)) * n + (a[n + 1] / (n + 1))
