1) I'm not sure that it matters what kind of numbers you use to feed your NN (Neural Network [or perceptron]). This is to say that you could make the 4 input nodes accept a signed floating point number (or signed Decimal if its available) This way you can have the inputs all accepting the same type of data for processing. As you will multiply the input by a weighted value you would most likely get a float or a decimal value anyway within the NN. 2) I would generally say that as you have 4 data points, that 4 inputs to the NN is a good starting point! 3) As for the output it is perfectly possibly to have one output node for the entire NN. To use this design there will need to be a threshold function which takes the final output from the NN and converts it to usable values. in your example I would suggest that anything below -0.5 you classify as -1, any output between -0.5 and +0.5 you classify as 0 and anything above +0.5 you classify as 1. e.g. Value | Output ----------------|---------- +0.5 | +1
