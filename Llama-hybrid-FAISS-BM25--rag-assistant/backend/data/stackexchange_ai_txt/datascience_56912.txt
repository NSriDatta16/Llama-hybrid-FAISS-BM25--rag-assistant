RL Sutton book, initial estimate of q*(a) for 10 arm testbed

The Sutton book does not mention what the initial estimate is for q*(a) before the first reward is received. In this code repo that seems to go along with the book: Sutton code repo They have initialized it with 0 per snippet below: def __init__(self, kArm=10, epsilon=0., initial=0., stepSize=0.1, sampleAverages=False, UCBParam=None, gradient=False, gradientBaseline=False, trueReward=0.): But the explanation for Figure 2.1 that shows the distribution of rewards for the 10 arms of the bandit says, Figure 2.1: An example bandit problem from the 10-armed testbed. The true value q ⇤ (a) of each of the ten actions was selected according to a normal distribution with mean zero and unit variance, and then the actual rewards were selected according to a mean q ⇤ (a) unit variance normal distribution, as suggested by these gray distributions. So should I initialize instead with np.random.randn() ? Edit: The distribution
