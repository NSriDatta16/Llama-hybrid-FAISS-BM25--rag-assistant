Off the shelf discriminative reranking software

Is there existing software for discriminative reranking, such as that used by the Charniak NLP parser , Shen, Sarkar, and Och's parser or Shen and Joshi's techniques ? I'd like something that I can easily adapt for my own uses, which are similar to parse reranking.
