If you want to know which of the hypotheses is more likely, why don't you calculate the probability that the a posteriori mean $\mu$ is below a certain threshold close to zero, say, $Pr(\mu \le 0.5\, |\, D)$ (where $D$ is your data)? That would allow you to make direct probability statements about the mean of the effect sizes (e.g. "there's an $6\%$ chance that the effect size is, on average, close to zero"). If you are set on using the Bayes factor, a conceptually simple way to calculate it is to set up a model with a random discrete indicator variable whose value decides which prior ($\mu \sim N(0, 0.1)$ or $\mu \sim N(15, 0.1)$) is used in each step. The posterior and prior distributions of this indicator variable can then be used to calculate the Bayes factor, sidestepping the difficult issue of multi-dimensional numerical integration. Unfortunately, I'm not fluent in R, so I can't help you with the implementation. Cheers!
