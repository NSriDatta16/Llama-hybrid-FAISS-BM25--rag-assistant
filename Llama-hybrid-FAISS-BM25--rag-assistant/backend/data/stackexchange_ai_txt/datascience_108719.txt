Does the Data Science process (CRISP ) comply with the Agile methodology?

A common method for conduction data science projects is CRISP - https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/ . However in job descriptions they are often combine data science with agile methods, mostly SCRUM. How fits data science together with Agile, Scrum? I get that CRISP and Scrum both use the cycle as a way to approach the end result, but there is a lot of different methodology and terminology. Any ideas or hints for further readings?
