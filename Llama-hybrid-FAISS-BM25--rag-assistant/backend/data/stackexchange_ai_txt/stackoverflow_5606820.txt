From http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html : Content providers store and retrieve data and make it accessible to all applications. They're the only way to share data across applications; there's no common storage area that all Android packages can access. If you want to make your own data public, you have two options: You can create your own content provider (a ContentProvider subclass) or you can add the data to an existing provider â€” if there's one that controls the same type of data and you have permission to write to it.
