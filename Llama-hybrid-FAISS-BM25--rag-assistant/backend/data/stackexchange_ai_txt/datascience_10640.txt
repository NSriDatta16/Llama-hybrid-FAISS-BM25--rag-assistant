How to perform feature engineering on unknown features?

I am participating on a kaggle competition. The dataset has around 100 features and all are unknown (in terms of what actually they represent). Basically they are just numbers. People are performing a lot of feature engineering on these features. I am wondering how exactly one is able perform feature engineering on features which are unknown? Can somebody please help me understand this and some tips on how can I perform feature engineering on unknown features?
