If your lock is on the server, make the lock time out after (say) 30 seconds and have a function on the window automatically renew the lock every 25 seconds. Call the function from a setInterval. When the window is closed, the interval is canceled and the lock will timeout 15 seconds later (on average). Crude but effective.
