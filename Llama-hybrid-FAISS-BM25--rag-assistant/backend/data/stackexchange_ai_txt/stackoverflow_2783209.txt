I believe Exception is just a standard class in the SDK libraries. If you extracted it, modified it and put it somewhere on your classpath before the SDK, I think it should replace the one in the SDK (If not you could put your "new" exception back into the SDK jar) Anyway, your new exception could set a static value that can be read by the testing framework. May not be the most elegant solution but it doesn't require any "Magic"
