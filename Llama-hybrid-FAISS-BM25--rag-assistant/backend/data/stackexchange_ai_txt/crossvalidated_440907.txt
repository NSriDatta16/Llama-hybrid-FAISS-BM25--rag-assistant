It is the first one. In general, the average partial effect of a continuous variable $x_k$ is $$\frac{\beta_k}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(\textbf{x}_i\beta),$$ where $\textbf{x}_i$ is the observed vector of explanatory variables corresponding to observation $i$ . To estimate the average partial effect of $x_k$ you can thus compute $$\frac{\hat\beta_k}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(\textbf{x}_i\hat\beta).$$ Thus, since $age$ is continuous, it is the first expression you need to compute.
