If the high variability in cell culture tests is just random variation there is nothing special that can be done about it other than the reduction in variance that averaging provides. However, if there are differences among the tests that can be explained through explantory factors, a linear model could be used to reduce the uncertainty. Regarding your comment above about separating the inter-experiment variability from the intra-experiment variability you can perform a simple one-way ANOVA with experiment as a factor.
