Alternative to Expression Blend

Is there a free alternative to Expression Blend? I am not able to purchase Expression Blend and am looking for a stand-alone XAML designer that I can use to help me when designing WPF controls. I found apps like Kaxaml but I am looking for something that has drag-drop support so that I can build the control right in the designer. Does such a thing exist? Thanks.
