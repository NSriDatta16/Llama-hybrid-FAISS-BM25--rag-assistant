Does auto.arima of the forecast package deal with seasonality and trend automatically

I'm reading some code involving auto.arima method from the forecast package in R. What I'm curious is whether there is a necessity for decomposing the time series data into seasonal, trend and stochastic compoents before passing to the auto.arima method, or is it automatically handled by the functionality of the method? Thanks in advance!
