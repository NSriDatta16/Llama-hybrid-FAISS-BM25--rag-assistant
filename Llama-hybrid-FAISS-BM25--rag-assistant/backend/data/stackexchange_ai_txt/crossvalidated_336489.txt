Harvey is right that you should rename your "variance" column to "discrepancy". Assuming you accummulate enough values for your "discrepancy" variable, you will end up with a time series of "discrepancy" values, which would then put you in a forecasting context. Specifically, you could us the "historical" values of your "discrepancy" time series to forecast the next value of the time series. This forecast exercise would give you the flexibility to consider various models to capture the temporal dynamics of the historical time series (e.g., ARIMA models, exponential smoothing models). However, the key is having enough data to perform a meaningful forecast. If your historical time series is quite short, you'll have to consider much simpler models than if it's quite long. How well your forecast will work will ultimately depend on the level of "noise" in your data - you may be able to reduce that "noise" by incorporating some relevant explanatory variables in your model. This time series framework will also enable you to compare your forecasted "discrepancies" against the actual "discrepancies" (once they become available) so that you can keep track of whether or not your forecasting ability improves/degrades over time. The linear regression approach already suggested has the drawback that it doesn't account for the potential temporal correlation of the values of your Actual variable. That unaccounted for correlation can "dilute" the signal you are after.
