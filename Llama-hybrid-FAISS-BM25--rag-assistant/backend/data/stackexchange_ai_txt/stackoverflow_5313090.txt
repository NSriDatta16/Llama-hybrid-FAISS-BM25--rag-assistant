Looks like Toolkit problems. What references have you got in the project? There are quite a few assemblies that make up the toolkit. Looks like some of them it wants are 'System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit' and 'System.Windows.Controls.Input.Toolkit'. The DockPanel is part of 'System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit' or something similar so that one might have been added when you dragged a DockPanel in.
