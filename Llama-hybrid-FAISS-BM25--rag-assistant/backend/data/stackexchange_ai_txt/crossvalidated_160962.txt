Classification Model on Single Feature?

this is my first time using StackExchange so forgive me if I commit any faux paus with this question, and it has only been a few months since I first started learning machine learning. In my research, I'm developing a binary classification algorithm for cancer screening. I have two continuous numerical features. The AUC of Feature 1 is 0.7343 , and the AUC of Feature 2 is 0.5874 . All good, right? Both features have some predictive ability, and Feature 1 is stronger than Feature 2. However, when I build an algorithm using only one feature at a time and cross-validate, the results are weird. When I do 10-fold stratified CV (averaged over 100 runs) with logistic regression using Feature 1 as the only input, I get an AUC of 0.7325 (reasonable enough). Using only Feature 2 as the only input gives me an AUC of 0.5087 ; in other words, useless. My question is, why aren't the Feature 2 AUC's more similar (0.5874 vs. 0.5087)? A logistic model is monotonically increasing, so shouldn't the cross-validated AUC be essentially the same as the AUC without any model? Even weirder: if I use a Random Forest classifier instead of logistic regression (Matlab's fitensemble function, 100 trees, using % of trees in each category for probability, average of 10 separate CV runs), I get a wonderful AUC of 0.8729 for Feature 1 but an abysmal AUC of 0.2504 for Feature 2. What gives? Why are these results so weird? Is the heavenly AUC of 0.8729 real? I have a hard time believing that. The practical implication of this is that I'm trying to develop a classification model that utilizes both features (and possibly another) as inputs and am trying to show that it's better than each feature on its own. I don't have a large data set so I'm reporting the performance of the model that includes both features based on cross-validation rather than a fully independent test set. Am I "allowed" to compare the raw AUC's of the features by themselves sans model (0.7343 and 0.5874) with the cross-validation based AUC from my two-feature model? That's what I was doing but I'm confused with the results I'm getting when I build a single-feature model. Any assistance is appreciated!
