Weekly data that correspond to measurements or reports made or issued on one day of the week are in my experience best handled as daily data spaced 7 days apart. Woe betide you if your software doesn't support that! At worst take the daily date (as days from some origin) and divide by 7 to get weekly dates that are successive integers. If you need for some unstated reason to aggregate to months (and do avoid that unless under compulsion) then averaging the weeks that notionally fall in a given month may be adequate when averages are needed but splitting weeks between months is likely to be required when totals are needed. The problem now is that variously 3, 4, or 5 weeks may be assigned to each month. That variability gets in the way of tracking variations from month to month, which are of interest if you are interested in months at all. So, aggregation means getting monthly totals. You need to split totals for weeks to do that; otherwise results will depend sensitively on how many weekly reports fall within each month. I've published on how to do it in Stata. See especially Section 4 of this paper . The principles are naturally identical across programmable software. It's most unlikely that you're the first person using your software to have this problem. I can't see that any trickery is needed beyond using the fractions 1/7 to 6/7 and their complements according to the number of days belonging to each month. Aggregating months to quarters, half-years or years is then simple.
