What are R-structure G-structure in a glmm?

I've been using the MCMCglmm package recently. I am confused by what is referred to in the documentation as R-structure and G-structure. These seem to relate to the random effects - in particular specifying the parameters for the prior distribution on them, but the discussion in the documentation seems to assume that the reader knows what these terms are. For example: optional list of prior specifications having 3 possible elements: R (R-structure) G (G-structure) and B (fixed effects)............ The priors for the variance structures (R and G) are lists with the expected (co)variances (V) and degree of belief parameter (nu) for the inverse-Wishart ...taken from from here . EDIT: Please note that I have re-written the rest of the question following the comments from Stephane. Can anyone shed light on what R-structure and G-structure are, in the context of a simple variance components model where the linear predictor is $$\beta_0 + e_{0ij} + u_{0j} $$ with $e_{0ij} \sim N(0,\sigma_{0e}^2)$ and $u_{0j} \sim N(0,\sigma_{0u}^2)$ I made the following example with some data that comes with MCMCglmm > require(MCMCglmm) > require(lme4) > data(PlodiaRB) > prior1 = list(R = list(V = 1, fix=1), G = list(G1 = list(V = 1, nu = 0.002))) > m1 summary(m1) G-structure: ~FSfamily post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp FSfamily 0.8529 0.2951 1.455 160 R-structure: ~units post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp units 1 1 1 0 Location effects: Pupated ~ 1 post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp pMCMC (Intercept) -1.1630 -1.4558 -0.8119 463.1 prior2 = list(R = list(V = 1, nu = 0), G = list(G1 = list(V = 1, nu = 0.002))) > m2 summary(m2) G-structure: ~FSfamily post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp FSfamily 0.8325 0.3101 1.438 79.25 R-structure: ~units post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp units 0.7212 0.04808 2.427 3.125 Location effects: Pupated ~ 1 post.mean l-95% CI u-95% CI eff.samp pMCMC (Intercept) -1.1042 -1.5191 -0.7078 20.99 m2 summary(m2) Generalized linear mixed model fit by the Laplace approximation Formula: Pupated ~ 1 + (1 | FSfamily) Data: PlodiaRB AIC BIC logLik deviance 1020 1029 -508 1016 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.9861 0.1344 -7.336 2.2e-13 *** So based on the comments from Stephane I think the G structure is for $\sigma_{0u}^2$. But the comments also say that the R structure is for $\sigma_{0e}^2$ yet this does not seem to appear in the lme4 output. Note that the results from lme4/glmer() are consistent with both examples from MCMC MCMCglmm . So, is the R structure for $\sigma_{0e}^2$ and why doesn't this appear in the output for lme4/glmer() ?
