A) It appears that Wikipedia's OpenSearch implementation does a prefix search on page titles only. There is no way to specify categories to look in. You should look into action=query&list=search instead. Note that you can easily create a Wikipedia url from the page title by simply percent-encoding it and appending it to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ . B) As you've noted, Wikipedia's categorization system generally eschews broad categories such as "Music" in favor of more specific hierarchies. At this time, there is no way to search in subcategories of a category. You could "set up" such a category by convincing the Wikipedia community to change the way they do things (go here ), but you're unlikely to meet with any success. The "In music" you might see on a disambiguation page has nothing to do with categories you might be able to query or search on, it's just a section in the page used to organize the list no different from the section header "Sister sites" in Wikipedia's article about Stack Overflow .
