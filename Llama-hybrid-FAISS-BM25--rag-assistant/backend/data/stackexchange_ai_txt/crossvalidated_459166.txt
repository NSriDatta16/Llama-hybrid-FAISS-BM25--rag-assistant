Where does the logistic function come from?

I first learned the logistic function in machine learning, where it is just a function that map a real number to 0 to 1. We can use calculus to get the derivative and use it for some optimization eventually to have some binary classifier. Later, I learned it in statistic literature where there are odds, log odds, and bunch of probabilistic interpretations. Today I am reviewing some differential equation literature, and found the logistic function is a solution for the following system: $y'=y(1-y)$ , and $y(0)=0.5$ . So, my question is more like a "chicken and egg" problem: where does the logistic function come from? Do we first have the function or the ODE?
