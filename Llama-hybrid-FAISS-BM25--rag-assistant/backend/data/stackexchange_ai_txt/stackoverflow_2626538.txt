Return a pointer to a char array in C

I've seen a lot of questions on that on StackOverflow, but reading the answers did not clear that up for me, probably because I'm a total newbie in C programming. Here's the code: #include char* squeeze(char s[], char c); main() { printf("%s", squeeze("hello", 'o')); } char* squeeze(char s[], char c) { int i, j; for(i = j = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) if(s[i] != c) s[j++] = s[i]; s[j] = '\0'; return s; } It compiles and I get segmentation fault when I run it. I've read this faq about about returning arrays and tried the 'static' technique that is suggested there, but still could not get the program working. Could anyone point out exactly what's wrong with it and what should I be paying attention in the future?
