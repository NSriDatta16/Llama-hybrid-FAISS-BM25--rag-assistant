Possible to combine code coverage results (VC++)

I am using VC++ 2005 and 2008 on a project. Now I want to see if the unit test cases cover all the code, and a found a problem. We use Boost.Test for unit testing, and each file is designed to test a particular function or method. Each file is compiled into a separate executable. I am able to view the results per executable in Visual Studio. What I am really interested in is to view the overall code coverage by all the tests combined. Is there a way to combine the code coverage results?
