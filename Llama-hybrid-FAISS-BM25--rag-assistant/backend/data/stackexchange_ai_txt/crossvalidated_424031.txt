How can I design a target feature that will result in a good model that predicts when customers are "responding to ads"? So I guess, that someone in your job asked you to predict "Which customers will respond to ads?" , but they didn't define what they mean by "responding to ads" . Now, you are trying to come up with your own definition "learned from the data", so to predict the learned label instead. This is not the way to go. First, notice that if you had an algorithm that given the data would predict that customers responds to ads you would already solve your problem , no need to use the result as a target label for other algorithm, since you would already be able to predict who responds to ads! So making the labels given the data, and then predicting those labels using the data is circular. What you should do instead, is you should come up with a definition of something measurable to predict . Instead of predicting that someone "responds to ads", maybe predict something like "visiting website in 24h since receiving the advertisement e-mail", or "buying product during 30 days after seeing the advertisement", etc. Moreover, this doesn't need to be binary. You could predict things like probability of buying the product as a function of time after seeing the advertisement (check survival analysis models ), or number of bought items as a function of the number of advertisements seen (this is a linear, Poisson, or logistic regression, depending on details of the problem!). Finally, if you had a way to manually (and reasonably!) label some of the customers as "responding to ads", you could use semi-supervised learning algorithm to learn the missing labels. On another hand, if you could come up with some heuristics that approximately help in labeling such customers, you could use Snorkel software to help you with learning the labels based on the provided rules and the data. Notice however the meaningfulness and quality of the labels, will impact how meaningful are your results.
