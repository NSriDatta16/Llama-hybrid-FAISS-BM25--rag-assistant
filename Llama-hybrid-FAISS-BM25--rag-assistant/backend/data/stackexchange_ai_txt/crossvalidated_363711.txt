The usual approach with word2vec seems to be to take the average vector of each review. Then cluster these. Good luck - I am all but convinced that this can work particularly well , because of the underlying assumption that every point is part of a cluster in the first place... But I guess many users don't care, they just need some quantifiable result for the hype cycle.
