You can't get away with adding custom attributes to HTML elements whilst still being valid. It will generally work in current browsers, but it's a bit fragile in that if you happen to pick a name that is in use (now or in the future) as an HTML or JavaScript property by any browser, the clash will stop it from working. HTML5 proposes attributes whose names start with “data-​” as valid extension mechanisms. You could also consider namespaced elements in XHTML; this still isn't technically “valid XHTML” by the DTD but at least it is safe from collisions. HI I suggest using the ‘title’ attribute for this particular purpose.
