VAR model for a short time series yields autocorrelated residuals

I am currently conducting an analysis on a small sample ($n=41$) first-difference VAR. The underlying data is only available in yearly terms so there is unfortunately no possibility to increase sample size. All variables are unit roots and stationary in first difference. Predicting a first difference VAR with 6 variables, the maximum lag length that provides a stable VAR is $p=3$. The model's predictive power of $p=3$ is better than the previous models; however, I am highly concerned about the remaining auto-correlation in the residuals series. My econometrics textbook and several articles recommend that I am supposed to add lag length; but increasing the lag order to $p=4$ yields an unstable model. I have one variable which is adjusted for a strong structural break by regression on a dummy variable and predicted residuals used as estimated values. Accounting for the structural break clearly causes the autocorrelation in the residuals series, but not accounting for it would bias the model results. Can anyone help?
