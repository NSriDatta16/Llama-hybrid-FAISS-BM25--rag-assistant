Use Bayesian modeling & PyMC to find players with similar skill levels to match for game

I'm trying to learn Bayesian modeling and PyMC and I'm working on building a match-making service for an online game that avoids pitting two extremely unequal opponents against one another. What I'd like is to estimate the probability of player X winning vs. player Y given their match history in the game and then use this to prohibit very skilled players from mopping the floor with newer or weaker players. It seems that the actual probability of player X defeating player Y can be measured with a Bernoulli variable but I'm struggling with how to incorporate the players' previous matches. Furthermore, some players will have played more matches than others and the distributions of their performance will be flatter and more uncertain. Then, I may also want to incorporate other performance variables that could influence performance. However, I'm still struggling with how to even set up a basic example where the two performance variables of the players influence the single probability that player X wins. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
