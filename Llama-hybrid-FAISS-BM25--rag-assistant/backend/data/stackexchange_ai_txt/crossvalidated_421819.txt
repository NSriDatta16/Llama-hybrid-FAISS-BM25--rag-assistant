A couple of points: When you use the identity link function both the GEE and a (linear) mixed model give you coefficients that have a population/marginal interpretation. In all other cases where you use a nonlinear link function, such as the logit or the log, there is a difference in the interpretation of the coefficients. Namely, GEEs provide coefficients with a population/marginal interpretation whereas mixed models provide coefficients with a subject-specific interpretation. The population/marginal interpretation refers to groups of subjects. For example, in the case of a dichotomous outcome and the logit link the GEE will give you a coefficient for the sex variable you that is the log odds ratio between the groups of males versus females. The subject-specific interpretation on the other hand is at the subject level. Continuing on the previous example, the coefficient for sex from a mixed effects logistic regression would be the log odds ratio if a specific subject changed sex. It is possible to obtain coefficients with a population/marginal interpretation from mixed models. For example, in the GLMMadaptive package Iâ€™ve written, check function marginal_coefs() illustrated here . Mixed models provide valid inferences under the missing at random missing data mechanism, whereas the basic version of GEEs only under the more restrictive missing completely at random mechanism. The sandwich estimator in GEEs better protects against a misspecification of the working correlation structure in restrictive settings, i.e., when you have a balanced design, with few categorical covariates, and many subjects.
