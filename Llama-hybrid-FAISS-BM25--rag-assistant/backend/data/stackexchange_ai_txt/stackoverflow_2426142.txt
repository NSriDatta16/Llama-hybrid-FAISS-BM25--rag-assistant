SQL 2000 - Execute process task - doesn't run exe

I am currently developing completely on a local machine and have a DTS package that on completion should run a local exe file that compresses the csv files that were just imported. If I run the package in the designer or from the list of packages then all is fine and the files are compressed. If I run the file from SQL Agent as a scheduled task or manually start the task then the DTS runs fine and completes successfully but the files are not compressed. I also tried pointing the step at a basic bat file that deletes the csv files. This doesn't run either. I don't think there are any network access issues as everything is running from local disks and the data is imported from the same directory as where I want to run the exe. I have tried running my SQLSERVERAGENT service as .\Administrator and also as Local Service Account without success. Any ideas? Thanks, Matt
