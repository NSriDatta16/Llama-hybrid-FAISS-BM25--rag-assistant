Is vanishing KL a problem in vision based VAEs as well?

I came across some work on the problem of a vanishing KL contrbution in Variational Auto Encoders Cyclical Annealing Schedule: A Simple Approach to Mitigating KL Vanishing . This work particularly is in the NLP space where they use recurrent neural networks to model sentences which yields to the vanishing KL term problem. I wonder if there is a similar issue when working with convolutional networks and images. Cheers
