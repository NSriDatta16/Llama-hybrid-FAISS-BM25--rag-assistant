An em supposedly represents 1 letter M's worth of width, but in practice is the current font size. Ems are relative, so if you do: table { font-size: 2em } td { font-size: 2em } Text in your td's would be four times the size of the body text, since the table's font size is twice the body's, and the td's font size is twice the table's. p { margin-bottom: 1em } Paragraphs will now have one line break beneath them, of exactly the height of one line of text. (Letters will usually be shorter than the line, but you get the idea.)
