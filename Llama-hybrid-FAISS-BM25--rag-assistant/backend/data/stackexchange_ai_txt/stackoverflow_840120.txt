Timespan formatting

How do you elegantly format a timespan to say example "1 hour 10 minutes" when you have declared it as : TimeSpan t = new TimeSpan(0, 70, 0); ? I am of course aware that you could do some simple maths for this, but I was kinda hoping that there is something in .NET to handle this for me - for more complicated scenarios Duplicate of How can I String.Format a TimeSpan object with a custom format in .NET?
