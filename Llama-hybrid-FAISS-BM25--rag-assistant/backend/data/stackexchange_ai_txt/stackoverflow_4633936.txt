Dynamics CRM 2011 - WCF error

I am trying to get to grips with MS Dynamics CRM 2011. I have have the beta installed on a VM and things look pretty good - some great new features etc. However I am getting an exception when trying to connect to the new XRMServices (updated 2011 WCF web services) Exception: System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException: The service '/organame/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc' cannot be activated due to an exception during compilation. The exception message is: 'System.ServiceModel.Description.UseRequestHeadersForMetadataAddressBehavior'. This collection only supports one instance of each type. Parameter name: item. ---> System.ArgumentException: The value could not be added to the collection, as the collection already contains an item of the same type: 'System.ServiceModel.Description.UseRequestHeadersForMetadataAddressBehavior'. This collection only supports one instance of each type. Parameter name: item The only reference to this exception I gave found suggests that it is caused by multiple bindings configured in IIS, which in my case I did have, but the problem persists even after removing them. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
