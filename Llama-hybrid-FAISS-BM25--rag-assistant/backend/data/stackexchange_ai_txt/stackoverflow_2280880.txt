Customized right click Menu in a Web Page text area!

I'm developing an application in C# using visual web developer. I'm displaying some text for reading and I want the user to be able to select a word or fragment, and then right click it to display a customized menu (One that has for example define, search, show grammar...). I I don't know how to do it. I'm fairly new to the .Net Thanks!
