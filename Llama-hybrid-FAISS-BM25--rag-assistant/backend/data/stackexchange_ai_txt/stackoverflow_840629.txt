Reporting Services Report Timeout

We have a 2005 report that can be 2 to around 250 pages with the average being in the ballpark of 10. When the report was developed, our developer was told that 10 pages or so was the right number, and without knowing the business domain very well he decided reporting services was the correct approach. Now that the report has been deployed to PROD, we are having some complaints of the report timing out. Neither the developer or I on this are terribly surprised given the sheer size of the report that is being requested (250 pages). My question is what options do we have to use our current report that works 95% of the time and make it work for the remaining 5%? Are there configuration options anywhere to improve the rendering performance or anything like that? The report is used for return authorizations so the size of the returns can very. Each authorization page has 4 different return labels with logos and barcodes. To clarify: The report is rendered fairly quickly from reporting services to the report viewer, but when we export to PDF is when it takes a while to load.
