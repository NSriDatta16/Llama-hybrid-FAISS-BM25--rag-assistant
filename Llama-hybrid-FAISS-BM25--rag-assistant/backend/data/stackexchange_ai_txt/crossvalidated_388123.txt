Interpretation of the rate parameter of a Gamma distribution

I am toying with mixture models, especially in a bayesian context and the Gamma (or the inverse Gamma) distribution appears quite often. For example, inverse Gamma is used as a conjugate prior for the variance of a gaussian mixture. The shape parameter seems to have a quite intuitive interpretation. However, I am more confused with the rate parameter. Is there any clear interpretation for the rate parameter (or inverse scale) of a Gamma distribution ?
