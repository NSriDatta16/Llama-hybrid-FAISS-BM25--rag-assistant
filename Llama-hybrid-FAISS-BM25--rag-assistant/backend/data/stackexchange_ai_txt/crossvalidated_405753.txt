What is the proper way to standardize non-stationary data?

I have a 19-year time series of satellite imagery (spaced irregularly temporally). The mean and standard deviation of the dataset changes over the 19 years. I get multiple variables from each image; these are each set up in their own array. My ultimate goal is to run a multiple regression of these variables where the outputs are standardized beta coefficients. I'm using the equation (as Matlab code): Standardize_Array = ( ARRAY_IMPERVIOUS - nanmean( ARRAY_IMPERVIOUS(:)))/(nanstd( ARRAY_IMPERVIOUS (:))) My question is : Should I standardize the entire array at once (that is, use the mean and standard deviation of the entire 19-year time series), or should I standardize each day independently? Since standardization just rescales the data, does it matter so long as I'm consistent?
