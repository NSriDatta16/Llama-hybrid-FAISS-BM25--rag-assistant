If you're looking to flex your programming muscles trying to solve the problem yourself, I encourage you to; however, the wheel exists if you would like you use it. Windows 7 ships with this functionality built in. A component called "Extended Linguistic Services" (ELS) has the ability to detect scripts and natural languages, and it's in the box, on any Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 machine. Depending on whether you have any such machines available and what you mean when you say "free," that will do it for you. In any case, this is an alternative to Google or the other vendors mentioned here. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd317700(v=VS.85).aspx And if you want to access this from .NET, there's some information on that here: http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/developers/archive/2009/05/18/windows-7-managed-code-apis.aspx Hope that helps.
