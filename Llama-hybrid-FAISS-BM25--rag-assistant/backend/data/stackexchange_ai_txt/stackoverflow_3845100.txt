storage location of server objects in SQL Server

Subquestioning [1] and [2]. Where does SQL Server store server objects? And why there? Update: This question is defined as subquestion and in context of cited questions... Should I understand the answer that sql_policy_trigger, shown under Server Objects\Triggers in Object Explorer of SSMS (MS SQL Server R2), is stored in master database? =====Update2: Please give me the references to msdn docs in your answer(s). It is not obvious that system or server configuration objects, meta-information or catalogs are stored in database(s). For ex., FTS catalog is not stored in database but in file (system), etc. [3] (BOL2005-2008R2) tells that: "master Database Records all the system-level information for an instance of SQL Server" "In SQL Server, system objects are no longer stored in the master database; instead, they are stored in the Resource database " So, it is instance-wide (but not server-wide) and it clearly mentions "system". As well as it hints that "they" are not stored in master database. Also, I would like to understand why SSMS permits to script server objects (for ex., right-click in Object Explorer under Server Objects --> Triggers on syspolicy_server_trigger --> Script Server Trigger as...---> ) while, for ex., system views do not have such possibility.
