CCA species coordinates relative to ordination surface

I want to display species coordinates relative to an environmental variable using ordination surface ( ordisurf in vegan package ). In order to do this, I guess I have take the scaling of species scores into consideration. plot.cca function in vegan package seems to scale species proportional to eigenvalues (see example below) and leave site scores unscaled: library(vegan) data(varechem) data(varespec) mod Species scores seem aligned correctly. Now if I specify another scaling: scal Species scores get higher values than site scores. The ordination surface, however, seems linked to the site scores. Related questions: Does the default scaling plot species scores such that they are correctly related to the ordination surface model? (Why) can(not) I specify other scaling such as "sites" (row scores) and still get the species scores correctly aligned related to ordination surface if I consequently specify this for all layers (as above)?
