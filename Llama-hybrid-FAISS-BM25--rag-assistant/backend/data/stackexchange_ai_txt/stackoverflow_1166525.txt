I don't really see your problem with speed here. On my machine (Core 2 Duo T7200 @ 2 GHz) generating a random integer with MT19937 or MT19937-64 takes around 20 ns (on average, when drawing 50000 numbers). So that'd be around 4,32 Ã— 10 12 (so around 4 trillion numbers) a day. And that's for one core. With Java. So I think you can expect the performance to be more than adequate for your needs. To actually answer your question: I don't know of a C# implementation of SFMT, but conversion of the C code to C# should be fairly straightforward. However, you're not gaining much, as SFMT is optimized for SIMD and C# currently doesn't support this directly.
