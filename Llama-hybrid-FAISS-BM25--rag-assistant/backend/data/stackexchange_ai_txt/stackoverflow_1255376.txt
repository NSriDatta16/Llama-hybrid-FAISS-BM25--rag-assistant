The HTTP 1.1 spec contains this paragraph as 8.1.4 Practical Consideration : Clients that use persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy. A proxy SHOULD use up to 2*N connections to another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously active users. These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response times and avoid congestion. I don't know what real world proxy implementations do with this requirement, though. Maybe you'll find something in the Caching Tutorial , even if it's only useful links. The ultimate action might be to send a mail to Mark Nottingham (mnot@pobox.com). If he doesn't know, nobody does.
