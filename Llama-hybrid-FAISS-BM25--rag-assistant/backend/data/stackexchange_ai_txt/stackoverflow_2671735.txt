The reason you cannot do this in general is because most classes are not simple empty examples. They have methods: class MyClass { static T _storage; public void DoSomethingWith(T obj) { _storage = obj; } } interface IMyInterface { } class Derived : IMyInterface { } MyClass a = new MyClass (); Now, a has a method DoSomethingWith that accepts a Derived and stores it in a static variable of type Derived . MyClass b = (MyClass )a; If that was allowed, b would now appear to have a method DoSomethingWith that accepts anything that implements IMyInterface , and would then internally attempt to store it in a static variable of type Derived , because it's still really the same object referred to by a . So now you'd have a variable of type Derived storing... who knows what.
