Multiple controllers for this?

I'm new to zend so I'm not sure what's the best way to organize what I'm trying to do. I direct the user to a series of quizzes. mysite.com/quiz1 mysite.com/quiz2 mysite.com/quiz3 mysite.com/quiz4 When the user answers the first quiz, he is forwarded to a page that tells him if his answer is correct, and on the same page he can choose to answer another quiz. If he answers it, he again will be taken to a page where he is told if his answer was correct and presented with the third quiz. From the architecture side of things, are each of these quiz1, quiz2, etc. pages considered a controller of their own? Their path says they may be, but doesn't make sense to me if they are. Is there a way to have them at those same paths but bundle them in the same controller. As I said I'm new to Zend so would appreciate some feedback about the right way to do this.
