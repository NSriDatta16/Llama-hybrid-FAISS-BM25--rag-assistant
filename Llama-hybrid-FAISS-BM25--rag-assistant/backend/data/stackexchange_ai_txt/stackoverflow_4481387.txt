Okay, try this (use copy and paste): alias dtxt = `pushd %1 & dir %2$ & popd` This sets the alias ' dtxt ' to the following commands: pushd %1 dir %2 popd Pay particular attention to the inverted single quotes (`) around the alias definition. This is found on the top-left key on the ISO (UK) and ANSI (US) keyboards. You will need to supply two parameters, %1 and %2 when executing dtxt - a target pathname, and a parameter for the DIR command as in the following examples: dtxt c:\temp *.txt In a nutshell, PUSHD pushes the current working directory name onto a LIFO stack and changes directory to c:\temp. The DIR command then executes with %2 as it's parameter - in this case '*.txt '. Finally, POPD restores the previous working directory by popping it off the stack. FYI, this is equivalent to the following standard DOS command: dir c:\temp\*.txt The following command in standard DOS will also work fine: pushd & dir *.txt & popd But obviously, ' dtxt ' is shorter and saves keystrokes!
