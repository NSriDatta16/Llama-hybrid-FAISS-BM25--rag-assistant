VB6: List available commands, then execute a random one of them

Hallo! I'm a n00b, and I'm looking for a few lines of code in VB6 to implement this: I want to list a certain number of commands to execute, then tell my program to chose a random one among them and execute it: strictly speaking, I'm dealing with a MSAgent character, and I want him to make a face every 5 minutes. How can I achieve this, please?
