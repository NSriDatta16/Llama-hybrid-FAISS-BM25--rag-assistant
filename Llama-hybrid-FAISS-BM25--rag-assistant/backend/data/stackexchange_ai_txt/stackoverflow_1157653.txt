Java/Ruby based IMAP proxy library

I'm looking to create an IMAP proxy to a custom back-end mail and document storage engine and was wondering if there are already any production-ready, stable libraries I can pull on for interacting with the client via IMAP so I just have to write the backend code for mailboxes, listing, retrieving messages, etc.
