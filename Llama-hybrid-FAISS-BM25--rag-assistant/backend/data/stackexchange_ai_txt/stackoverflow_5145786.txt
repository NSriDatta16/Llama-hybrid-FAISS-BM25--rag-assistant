gawk simple programs differences

Given the following input: SQ SEQUENCE 365 AA; 40909 MW; 78539C59DB8B1DFC CRC64; MAVMAPRTLV LLLSGALALT QTWAGSHSMR YFYTSVSRPG RGEPRFIAVG YVDDTQFVRF DSDAASQRME PRAPWIEQEG PEYWDRNTRN VKAQSQTDRV DLGTLRGYYN QSEAGSHTIQ MMYGCDVGSD GRFLRGYRQD AYDGKDYIAL KEDLRSWTAA DMAAQTTKHK WEAAHVAEQW RAYLEGTCVE WLRRYLENGK ETLQRTDAPK THMTHHAVSD HEATLRCWAL SFYPAEITLT WQRDGEDQTQ DTELVETRPA GDGTFQKWVA VVVPSGQEQR YTCHVQHEGL PKPLTLRWEP SSQPTIPIVG IIAGLVLFGA VITGAVVAAV MWRRKSSDRK GGSYSQAASS DSAQGSDVSL TACKV I need to join the lines which starts with 5 spaces. The following simple gawk commands first filters white-starting lines, and the other one strips out the white spaces, and it works as intended (I know there are many ways I can do this, I'm just learning gawk now): gawk /^" "/ input | gawk '{ gsub (" ", "", $0); print }' My question is why, if I unite the two commands into one, it doesn't print anything. I'm sure it's a syntax issue somewhere: gawk '/^" "/ { gsub (" ", "", $0); print }' input
