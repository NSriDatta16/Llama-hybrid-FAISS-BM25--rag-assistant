Calling an executable by a different name

I installed QT for windows, and it uses mingw. There it has this mingw32-make, but I would like to be able to just call make whenever I want to use it.. as it is rather long to type that. Anyone know how to do this? I know I can make a copy of mingw32-make, and rename it make in order to get something to work, but that is just so lame. Is there a more elegant way. Ted.
