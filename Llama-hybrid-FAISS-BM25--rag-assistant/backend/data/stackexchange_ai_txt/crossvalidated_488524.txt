The randomization is not supposed to balance differences between groups. Since the assignment is random, it will happen 5% of the times that the differences will be significant with the alpha =0.05. The randomization is there to get rid of systematic biases and unknown unmeasured effects, on average. Yes, it's possible that your results are due to chance, but since the assignment was completely random, we can calculate what is the probability that if there is no effect the results would happen by chance (i.e. p-value). So your study is still valid because it's the randomness of the assignment that makes the results valid, not the balance after assignment. Assuming the effect of your treatment is constant for everybody, then pretest scores won't affect the change scores you are testing. In general, testing post-test scores adjusted by pre-test scores is the recommended approach, because it is more sensitive and has fewer assumptions. If you think pre-test scores affect the post-test scores, this is what you should do. Some people don't like it because they don't understand adjustment, but statistically, it's the correct thing to do. There is no difference between testing post-test scores adjusted by pretest scores, or testing change scores adjusted by pre-test scores.
