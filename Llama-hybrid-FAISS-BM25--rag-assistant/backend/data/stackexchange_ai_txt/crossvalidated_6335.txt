If I understand you correctly, your design is: $\begin{array}{rcccl} ~ & B_{X} & B_{B} & M \\\hline A_{X} & \mu_{11} & \mu_{12} & \mu_{1.} \\ A_{A} & \mu_{21} & \mu_{22} & \mu_{2.} \\\hline M & \mu_{.1} & \mu_{.2} & \mu \end{array}$ The first part of your hypothesis (effect of treatment B within control group of A) then means that $H_{1}^{1}: \mu_{12} - \mu_{11} > 0$. The second part of your hypothesis (no effect of treatment B within treatment A) would then be $H_{1}^{2}: \mu_{22} - \mu_{21} = 0$. So your composite hypothesis is $H_{1}: H_{1}^{1} \wedge H_{1}^{2}$. The problem is with the second part because a non-significant post-hoc test for $H_{0}: \mu_{22} - \mu_{11} = 0$ doesn't mean that there is no effect - your test simply might not have enough power to detect the difference. You could still test the hypothesis $H_{1}': (\mu_{12} - \mu_{11}) > (\mu_{22} - \mu_{21})$, i.e., an interaction contrast. However, this tests the weaker hypothesis that B has a bigger effect within A's control group than within treatment A. I'm not sure what you mean by "the results of the analysis show that only Group 3 was significantly different than the others". I don't understand how exactly you would test that. You could test $\mu_{12} \neq \frac{1}{3} (\mu_{11} + \mu_{21} + \mu_{22})$, but that is a weaker hypothesis (Group 3 is different from the average of the remaining groups).
