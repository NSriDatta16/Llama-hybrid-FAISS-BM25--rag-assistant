"Fair" Integer Average

I have a need to get the average of a number, but not in decimal form, I need it in "fair" integer form. I don't know if that's the best way to explain it, so here's some examples. Example: 51 / 4 = 12.75 But I need something more along the lines of: 51 / 4 = 13,13,13,12 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
