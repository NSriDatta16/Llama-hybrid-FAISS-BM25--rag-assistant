As @Darin suggested, using the rel attribute with a value of nofollow is a good technique. However, to prevent search engines from accessing or indexing parts of your site, you should use the Robots exclusion standard . See the interpretation of nofollow by various search engines. To tell all user agents to not follow or index a given url, use a robots.txt file with the following contents: User-agent: * Disallow: /usercontrol/ Google and all other bots should respect the contents of your robots.txt file, and not index any links starting with the path /usercontrol/ .
