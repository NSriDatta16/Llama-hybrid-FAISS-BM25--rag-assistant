An administrator may create symlinks to arrange storage without messing up filesystems; e.g. a web mirror may have thousands of sites hosted, and dozens of disks mounted: /mnt/disk1/ /mnt/disk2/ ... and want to store data in their /var/www/htdocs/ without users caring about which disk holds their data. /var/www/htdocs/debian -> /mnt/disk1/debian /var/www/htdocs/ubuntu -> /mnt/disk2/ubuntu /var/www/htdocs/centos -> /mnt/disk9/centos Second, you may have a 'latest upload'; your users are uploading photos, or software packages, and you want http://example.com/HOT_STUFF to always be the most recent uploaded photo. You could set the symlink($new_upload, $HOT_STUFF); and users will never need more than the one URL to see the newest thing. Third, Debian and Ubuntu use the update-alternatives mechanism to allow multiple versions of a tool to be installed at once and yet still allow the administrator to say which one is the default. e.g., $ ls -l /usr/bin/vi lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 2011-01-11 01:07 /usr/bin/vi -> /etc/alternatives/vi $ ls -l /etc/alternatives/vi lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 2011-01-11 01:07 /etc/alternatives/vi -> /usr/bin/vim.basic $ ls -l /usr/bin/vim.basic -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1866904 2010-09-28 04:06 /usr/bin/vim.basic It's a little circuitous, but the configuration is maintained in a per-system /etc/ directory, and the usual /usr/bin/vi path will execute something that is very much like vi , when there are many choices available (nvi, elvis, vim, AT&T vi, etc.)
