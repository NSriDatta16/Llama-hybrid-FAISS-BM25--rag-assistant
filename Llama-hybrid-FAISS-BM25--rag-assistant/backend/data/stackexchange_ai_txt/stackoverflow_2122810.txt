How to refactor Netbeans generated GUI code?

I had created a GUI in Netbeans through Netbeans Swing GUI creator. So I just dragged and dropped the Swing Components from the "palette" window and all the code was generated by netbeans. Now the code is too long to maintain (approx. 10,000 lines). So some experts on SO suggested me to refactor my code. I can refactor the code that was generated by me but I don't know how to refactor the code generated by the Netbeans as It doesn't allow editing in its generated code. Any suggestions?
