What is the right attitude toward open source machine learning toolkits?

There are lots of machine learning toolkits nowadays, such as weka , sklearn , R libs. If we choose to use these toolkits, besides that it is convenient, sometimes we might lose control of what is really happening. For example, in some learning methods the value of features should be scaled to $[0,1]$, but there may be lots of different methods which can achieve this. When we use a scaling function provided by a specific toolkit, we just don't know what's really happening, and this will cause trouble, say, when we want to check if different scaling would affect the performance of learning algorithms. If the learning system is entirely implemented by ourselves, there could not be that much confusion, since we know exactly what happens. So what is the right attitude toward open source machine learning toolkits? Just use them for the first phase, and then implement manually without the help of learning toolkits in order to have more control over algorithms, or can we just rely on such kinds of learning toolkits?
