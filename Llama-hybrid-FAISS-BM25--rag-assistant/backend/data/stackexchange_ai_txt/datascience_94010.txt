There is this dataset and if it doesnt match, maybe you could contact the authors at Brussels University for more information. https://data.world/raghu543/credit-card-fraud-data The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. This one uses simulated data but sounds more like what you are looking for. There is also an academic paper that goes with it. https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/banksim1 We ran BankSim for 180 steps (approx. six months), several times and calibrated the parameters in order to obtain a distribution that get close enough to be reliable for testing. We collected several log files and selected the most accurate. We injected thieves that aim to steal an average of three cards per step and perform about two fraudulent transactions per day. We produced 594643 records in total. Where 587443 are normal payments and 7200 fraudulent transactions. Since this is a randomised simulation the values are of course not identical to original data.
