Each estimated moment is a random variable with unequal variances, and, usually, non-zero cross-moment covariances. Using the inverse of the covariance matrix re-weights the moments, so that you effectively pay more attention to moments that are more informative or perhaps better measured, in the sense of having smaller variance. This gives you the most efficient GMM estimate and is analogous to same benefit with GLS.
