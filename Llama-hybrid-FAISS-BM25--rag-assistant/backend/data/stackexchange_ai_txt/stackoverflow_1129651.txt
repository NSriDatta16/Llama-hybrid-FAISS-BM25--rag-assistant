Yes. Encoding the # as %23 effectively says "I just mean a plain old "#" character, not a URL fragment". The same is true of other reserved characters: escaping them stops them from having special meaning in the URL. In your case you do want to encode the URL when passing it to your login page as a parameter, but your login page should decode the URL before performing the redirect.
