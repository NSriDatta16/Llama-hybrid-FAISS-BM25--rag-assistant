I think that, your are messing up with the state transition probabilities. I recommend to you to draw the Markov chain with the probabilities of both jumping to a new state and to staying in the current state. Remember that for each state the probability of staying a leaving the state should sum up to $1$. For example, in the state $0$ (i.e., no component is working): The probability of staying is $p_{00}=(1-r)^2$, that is both components failed to be repaired. The probability of jumping to state $1$ (one components is working) is $p_{01}=2\cdot r(1-r)$, that is, one of the components is repaired and the other is not (note the 2, that accounts for the fact that either of the components can be repaired/no repaired). The probability of jumping to state $2$ (two components are working) from state $0$ is $p_{02}=r^2$ that is, both components are repaired. If you sum up those probabilities you get $r^2 +1+r^2 -2r +2r -2r^2=1$
