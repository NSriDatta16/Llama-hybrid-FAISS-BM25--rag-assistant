uniform histograms in copula approach

I would like to model some time series. For this purpose I have the marginal distribution and want to use a gaussian copula to build the dependency. Following a tutorial the following should give me the desired dependency structure with correct marginals library(mvtnorm) S However, the histograms look not at all like a uniform distribution. What is wrong with the above code? The help of "rmvnorm" says sigma is the covariance matrix. Looking at other example in the web I see that often they use the correlation matrix. So what is expected by rmvnorm? Moreover, the covariance of uniform should stay the same. However, I get the following result: cov(uniform) [,1] [,2] [1,] 3.481586e-10 3.626536e-08 [2,] 3.626536e-08 1.440411e-05 > which varies a lot from the input matrix $S$. So whats going wrong here?
