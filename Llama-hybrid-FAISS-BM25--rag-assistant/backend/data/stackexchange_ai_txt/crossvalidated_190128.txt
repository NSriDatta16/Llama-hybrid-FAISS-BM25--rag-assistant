This subsequence testing is actually related to the locally stationary extension of the Box test to detect time-varying dependencies ( paper ). Under the null hypothesis of independent white noise you can compute the Box test on $N$ non-overlapping subwindows over your time series, add them all together, and then test the sum of these test statistics for significance. This works out since asymptotically the test statistic of window $i$ has a $\chi^2$ distribution with $k_i$ degrees of freedom, where $k_i$ is the lags tested in subwindow $i$, $i = 1, \ldots, N$. Under the null they are independent, and the sum of independent $\chi^2$ random variables has again a $\chi^2$ distribution with $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} k_i$ degrees of freedom. This should answer why one subwindow of your time series may have a low p-value; but when you add all sub-window test statistic, this one large test statistic in your particular window will be balanced with some extremely low test statistics in other subwindows. Overall, you will get again the right test coverage. See the paper above for technical details. For R code and a data application see this blog post or the other stackoverflow post: `` Nice example where a series without a unit root is non stationary? ''
