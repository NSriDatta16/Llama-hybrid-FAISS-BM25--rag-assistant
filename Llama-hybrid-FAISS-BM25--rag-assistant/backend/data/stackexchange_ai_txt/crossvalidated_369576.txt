The concepts of "analysis" are different from that of "recognition". Ideally successful result of analysis should give you a spectrum of results. The "rules" of such analysis would be valid across similar classes of datasets. Whereas a successful result of "recognition" would be to evaluate the given dataset in order to match it to a set of pre-analysed reference point and to find the best match. Applications of NLP might be doing"Sentiment Recognition" but what we want to achieve is ultimately "Sentiment Analysis"
