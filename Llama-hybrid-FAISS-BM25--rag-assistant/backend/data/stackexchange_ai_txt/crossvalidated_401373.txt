First, when you say random forests grow trees of limited depth you are incorrect. Random forests typically grow trees of full depth since overfitting is mitigated by the subset of features used and the bootstrapping of data. Second, random forest does not consider x1>x2 as a split. As you suggest, you would have to construct this feature.
