OpenID development and debugging tools

Any pointers to development, primarily debugging tools, for OpenID? In particular, I'm looking for a tool to record and view the OpenID traffic through the User-Agent during an indirect communication authentication session. An OpenID provider and relying party that offered debugging info about authentication attempts would be nice, too. Yes, I've asked Mr. Google about this, and haven't hit the right keywords or I wouldn't be asking here. I can build this myself, but if someone else has already done the work... Thanks for any help.
