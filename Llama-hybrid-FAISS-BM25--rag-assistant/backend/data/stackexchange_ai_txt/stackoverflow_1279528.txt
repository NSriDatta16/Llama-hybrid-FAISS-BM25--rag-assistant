Don't fully switch to Xcode, just use Emacs for editing and Xcode for the rest (UI design, compilation, debugging, etc.). It seems to be a better compromise for you (and for me, because I use Xcode this way :-). The best part is that Xcode will let you change the default editor to anything! Just set the "text -> sourcecode" editor to Emacs.app (or lowercased emacs if you wish to use the terminal version) in the "File Types" tab of Xcode's preferences and your life will be happier :-) Just in case: when opening a file from OSX (dragging it in the Dock icon, open it from the Finder, ..., and even open it from Xcode), the default behavior of Emacs.app 23.1 is to open a new frame. If you don't like it, just add (setq ns-pop-up-frames 'nil) to your emacs' configuration file.
