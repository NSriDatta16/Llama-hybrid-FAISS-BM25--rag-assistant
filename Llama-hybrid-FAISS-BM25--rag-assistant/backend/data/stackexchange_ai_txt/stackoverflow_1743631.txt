Code Connecting Hardware and Software in Modern OS

Im a bit confused on how software interacts with the hardware even though Ive taken a computer organization class. Where can I find the code from a OS like Linux or BSD, or even of C that allows the abstraction of hardware. Are there any good material's which I can read to fully understand the interaction of hardware and software.
