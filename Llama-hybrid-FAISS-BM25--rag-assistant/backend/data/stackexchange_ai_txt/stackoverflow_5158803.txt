grails criteria 'has at least one'

guys! There are many Managers in one Organization. Manager - is a child of spring security SecUser class, that has many Authorities(in my case 'buyer','seller'). I`d like to find organizations that have at least one manager with authority 'seller' class Organization { ... static hasMany = [managers:Manager] } class Manager extends SecUser{ ... Organization organization } class SecUser { ... Set getAuthorities() { SecUserSecRole.findAllBySecUser(this).collect { it.secRole } as Set } } Criteria or hql - doesn`t matter. Thx in advance!
