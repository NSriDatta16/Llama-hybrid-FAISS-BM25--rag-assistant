Calculating covariance of a linear combination of random variables, negative random variable?

I have three random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$ that are normally distributed each with different means $\mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3$ and share the same variance $\sigma^2$. I want to find the covariance of $(X_1-\bar{X}, \bar{X})$, where $\bar{X}$ is the average of the three random variables. I did the following , $Cov(X_1-\bar{X}, \bar{X})= Cov(X_1, \bar{X})+Cov(-\bar{X}, \bar{X})$. Now I am unsure if I can apply the formula $Cov(X_1, \bar{X})=E[X_1\bar{X}]-E[X_1]E[\bar{X}]$ because $\bar{X}$ and $X_1$ are not independent? Also I am not sure how to handle $Cov(-\bar{X}, \bar{X})$, because of the negative sign inside. Is it still $Var(\bar{X})$?
