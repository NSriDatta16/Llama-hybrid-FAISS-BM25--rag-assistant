The application's sheer 'size' could be safely measured in LOCs or any other metrics you could think of as long as you use the same approach across all of your application. However the size on its own really matters only when you're talking about re-factoring and maintainance of the code base. It's almost mandatory to use the size metrics are useful in conjuction with the coverage statistics. But most of the time Function Points or similar concepts give you much better view of how big your application really is. I.e. as an example if it has 10 FP it's tiny, if it has 200 it's probably big. But if it has 100 KLOCs what does it tell me on its own, aside from the fact that I'll probably spend some time reading those lines? Almost nothing, I have to take an enourmous amount of other factors into an account to be able to understand this metric. Obviously the FPs have a significant downside of being expensive to properly calculate.
