Where can I find information about using SPSS for EFA and CFA? Is PCA (two samples) and reliability sufficient for scale development?

Context: I am in the process of developing a scale for my thesis. My advisor has guided me to using SPSS PCA to complete my analyses. Initially we reduced my scale to 3 factors (her insistence), and we collected a second sample with the 3 factor scale. I have had issues with the 3 factors loading appropriately. Participants respond differently to the third factor based on age and gender, and the loadings are coming in at .45 and then .42 in another factor. When I consider the two factor model (15 item scale vs. 10 item scale), all loading is .65 or higher, and responding is not effected by gender or age. Questions: What do you suggest I read in order to learn more about using SPSS PCA for scale development? Should I use SEM? Are there additional analyses I can conduct on this scale to determine the fit/factors?
