Install JBoss Tools in Eclipse. This gives you a button to start the server in profile mode (and to deploy your app to the server). Another option is to add -agentlib:JPIBootLoader=JPIAgent:server=standalone;CGProf to the startup script of JBoss and attach a standard profiling tool (like TPTP) to the running instance, see Profiling J2SE 5.0 based applications using Eclipse TPTP .
