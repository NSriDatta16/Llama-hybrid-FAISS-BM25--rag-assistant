One version of CLT tells us that the distribution of averages of independent identically distributed random variables will start to look like the bell -shaped normal distribution as the number of variables in the sum ($n$) gets large. Formal mathematical convergence takes place under mild conditions on the distribution when the average is appropriately normalized. This will work for most population distributions of various shapes including gamma , triangular , uniform , beta , chi square and even discrete distributions like Bernoulli . This makes it easy to do inference on the mean of a distribution based on a random sample by testing hypotheses or constructing confidence intervals based on the approximating normal distribution. Because the variance of the sample mean goes to $0$ at a rate of $1/n$, the mean will actually converge to a degenerate distribution with all its probability mass at the population mean. So the appropriate normalization for convergence to a normal requires recentering and multiplication by $\sqrt{n}$. There are other statistics that come up that also converge to the normal. The fact that the normal distribution can be used to approximate the distribution of various test statistics is the reason for its prominence in statistics.
