How to train a Neural Network on sparse data?

I am trying to train a sequence model to extract specific substrings. I am working on extremely sparse text data (Sparsity ~ 0.03%, I am wondering if it's possible to train on F1-score? My intuition tells me it's not possible as it's not a differentiable function as it should use a count function, which itself is not differentiable. Is this right? Some other methods I am considering to improve performance are: 1. Training on more data. 2. Extract more features to reduce sparsity and improve training due to inter-feature correlation. 3. Training on a deeper model. 4. Using Attention weights. Do these seem like reasonable approaches? Are there any methods to optimize sequence models on sparse data? Any help appreciated. Thanks in advance.
