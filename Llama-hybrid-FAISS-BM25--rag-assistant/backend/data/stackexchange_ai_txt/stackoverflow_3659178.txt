As Zoidberg commented, its easy with JQuery or Yui, or any other javascript library that provides drag & drop functionality. They are almost easy to configure, checking at demo they give. They also expose certain events like beforeDrag, afterDrag, onDrop, etc. where you can fire a simple js function check the elements' dropped position store it in cookies. For setting cookies, there are world of code on internet. Also, you might want to check floating absolute/relative positioning css, if your DOM divs are going to be floating around the page. GoodLuck.
