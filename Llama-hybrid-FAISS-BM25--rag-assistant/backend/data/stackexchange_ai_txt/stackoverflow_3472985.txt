What technology does ie6 have that legacy system must require it?

Possible Duplicate: Why is IE6 still a corporate favorite in some organizations? As of July 2010, IE6 browser usage is still lingering at around 7%. ( w3schools.com ) It's well known that most installations of IE6 are coming from companies that have internal software systems that absolutely require the use of Internet Explorer 6 and have the browser installed on most if not all machines at said institution. What is it exactly about these systems that they have to use this browser to run their software? Some initial thoughts I had were: Relying on IE6's implementation of CSS for proper page rendering. Relying on IE6's implementation of Javascript that takes care of page logic. Special .NET web controls specific to IE6. IE6 extensions/plugins required for the web app to process properly. Security restrictions imposed in IE6. What are some cases you all have seen out in the wild?
