In medical sciences, calibration can refer to the precision of assays. The goal of your comparison is a calibration study to determine if your model is valid for predicting DNA concentration as a function of time. The basic concept of a Pearson correlation coefficient is sufficient to identify discrimination: that is that comparing any two observations, better discrimination means that the one with higher predicted values is likely to have higher observed values. This is a result of the fact a correlation coefficient is a weighted average of the pairwise slopes between all observed values. A negative consequence of the Pearson correlation coefficient is that it is invariant to scale/shift. That means that with an observed sequence [0,1,2,3,4] and predicted sequence [500,505,510,515,520] your agreement is 100% but the predictions are orders of magnitude off. If you want a measure of predictive accuracy that ranges from -1 to 1 and achieves a value of 1 if and only if the predictions are identical to observed values, fit the following linear model: $$ E[\text{Observed}_i|\text{Predicted}_i] = 0 + 1 \text{Predicted}_i$$ This can be done with regression through the origin and fitting the predicted value as an offset term. Then, using model statistics, calculate the square root of the $R^2$ coefficient from that. The sign of direction must be found post-hoc , but let us assume it's not an issue unless the model in question is terrible. This model has a correspondence with the concordance calibration coefficient of Lin 1989. There are analogues for mixed/repeated measures designs. An example of performing such a design is shown here. I am using data from Margaret Pepe's study on inspecting a biomarker's relation to development of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) following cardiac surgery. The biomarker is longitudinal, but I am using just the first observed value for each patient. aki Gives: summary(calib.model) Call: lm(formula = statusall ~ 0 + offset(pred), data = aki.test) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.6599 -0.4257 -0.3525 -0.2539 8.7043 No Coefficients Residual standard error: 0.9518 on 900 degrees of freedom So $\sqrt{1-0.9518}$ gives a calibration coefficient of 0.22 which is very poor. This is likely a result of the ordinal encoding of AKI severity which includes 9 as death from AKI. Obviously, biological measurements like creatinine clearance would be preferable. Excluding "9"s as deaths: the R^2 is much better: > calib.model summary(calib.model) Call: lm(formula = statusall ~ 0 + offset(pred), data = aki.test, subset = statusall != 9) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.6599 -0.4269 -0.3528 -0.2570 1.8659 No Coefficients Residual standard error: 0.6419 on 894 degrees of freedom Gives a calibration coefficient of sqrt(1-0.6419) = 0.60 which is still low. A last issue to consider is: what is the appropriate scale on which to calibrate the expected and observed values? The raw scale is nice because it is interpretable, but DNA concentrations are often measured on a log scale or a complementary log-log scale. Consider these changes of variable based on your knowledge of the problem.
