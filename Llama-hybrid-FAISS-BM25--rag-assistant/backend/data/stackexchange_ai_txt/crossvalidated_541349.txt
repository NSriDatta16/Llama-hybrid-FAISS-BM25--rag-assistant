Is n-dimensional hypervolume different from n-dimensional state space?

Is there any difference between Hypervolumes (e.g. Blonder et al., 2014; Barros et al., 2016) and state spaces (sensu von Bertalanffy, 1972; e.g. Tett et al., 2013)? If so, what is it? It seems that these are essentially the same thing, but the surplus of definitions is confusing. Reference : Barros, C., Thuiller, W., Georges, D., Boulangeat, I. and Münkemüller, T.
