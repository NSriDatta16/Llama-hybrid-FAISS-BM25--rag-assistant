Is the MAP the maximum value of the posterior or its mode?

According to the WP definition of MAP : In Bayesian statistics, a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution . (emphasis added) which, given a posterior $f(\theta \mid x)$, can be defined as: $$\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{MAP}}(x) = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \ f(\theta \mid x) $$ As far as I understand it, the mode of a distribution depends on how I construct its histogram (or KDE). This looks to me to be in contradiction with the above definition, where the MAP is the $\theta$ value found for the maximum of the sampled $f(\theta \mid x)$ and does not depend on anything else . What am I missing?
