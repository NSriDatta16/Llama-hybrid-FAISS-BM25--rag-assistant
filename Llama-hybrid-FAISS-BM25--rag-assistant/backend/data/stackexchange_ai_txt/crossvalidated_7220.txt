Depends on what you mean. I've gotten deeper and deeper into statistics based on exposure to machine learning. (I had previously been more of a general AI guy, and hadn't had good experience with statistics, but gained greater understanding and appreciation of statistics as time has gone on.) So it's certainly a useful gateway. I've been mostly self-taught in statistics, however, and that leaves a lot of holes. I understand and use some fairly advanced techniques, but I wouldn't have to get too far off of the path to get stymied, while someone with a firmer statistical foundation would not. And I think that would apply in your scenario of using Machine Learning as the way to learn statistics: your knowledge would be fragile.
