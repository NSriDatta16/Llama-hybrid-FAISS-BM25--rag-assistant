The simplest form is always the best CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[age](@set varchar(10)) RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN SELECT * from player where ((@set = 'tall' and height > 180) or (@set = 'average' AND height >= 155 and height This form is called INLINE table function, which means SQL Server is free to expand it to join player directly to other tables in-line of a greater query, making it perform infinitely 1 better than a multi-statement table valued function. You may prefer this though, so that your ranges are complete (you have a gap between 175 and 180) where ((@set = 'tall' and height > 180) or (@set = 'average' AND height >= 155 and height SQL Server takes care of short circuiting the branches when the variable @set is parsed. 1 exaggeration, but only slightly
