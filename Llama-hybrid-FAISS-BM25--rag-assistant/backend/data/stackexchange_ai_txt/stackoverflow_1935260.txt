If you're looking for something like the remote api that the App Engine has in python, then you'll be disappointed to find it missing in Java. That said, absolutely nothing stops your from hitting your app and posting data either through POST / JSON / XML / any other format you can think of. The same thing goes for getting your reports back. If security is a concern, the OAuth protocol allows you to authenticate to app engine from your android device. This is an aside, but as far as reporting is concerned, you might not find the app engine a very suitable platform for reporting type apps. Just make sure you understand its limitations - the lack of joins, 1000 object limit, no sum / average, necessary indexes, etc. It's certainly not impossible, but do think carefully about how you're going to model your data.
