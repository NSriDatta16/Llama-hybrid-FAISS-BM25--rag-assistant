C - allocating an array of pointers, and usage - typecast safety

I'm working with some legacy code that makes extensive use of this kind of thing: // Allocate a look-up-table of pointers. long *pointerLUT = (long *) malloc(sizeof(long) * numPointers); ... // Populate the array with pointers. for (int i=0; i As you can see, this allocates an array of longs, with the idea of using them generic pointer storage. Q1. Is this approach safe? Q2. Style-wise, how could it be improved? Does it need to be? (The typecasting rattles the fear-monkey in me.) Thanks.
