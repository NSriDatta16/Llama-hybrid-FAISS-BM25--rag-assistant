Presuming you mean the pixel distance the thumb hops when dragged, try this: var thumb = dualSlider.maxSlider.thumb; thumb.setXConstraint(thumb.leftConstraint, thumb.rightConstraint, newTickSize); If you mean the value that corresponds to the thumb placement uses a different conversion factor from pixel position to "real" value, that would need to be implemented in the function you built to do that translation.
