Tensorflow choice of values of variables after training

I am trying to build a neural network, that is able to perform a linear regression. After for example 1000 epochs, I encountered the situation, where the smallest loss-value was not the last loss-value of my training. After 800 epochs I reached a loss of 17000. After 1000 epochs I found a loss of 19000. I guess, that Tensorflow does not use the weights of the smallest loss but of the latest loss. Is there a way to tell Tensorflow to use the weights of the smallest loss instead?
