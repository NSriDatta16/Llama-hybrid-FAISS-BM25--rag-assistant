Generally if there is only ever one (or a handful) of databases, and you have direct control over them (typicall corporate environment), I'd recommend not auto upgrading the databases as it is more hassle than it's worth. Just pass the script on to the people doing the install. For more widespread releases in the past I have used a script as you suggest along with the SQL Server SMO library (Server.CurrentContext.ExecuteNonQuery()). I don't find it inelegant is it is simple and it works. For the first release we would include a full DB build script, then add an upgrade script for each subsquent release. So if someone installs v1.2 over v1.1 we would only run the v1.2 script. However if they did a fresh install we would run v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2.
