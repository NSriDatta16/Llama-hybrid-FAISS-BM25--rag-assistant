Prove that ML estimate of a function of a parameter, $g(\theta)$ is the function of its ML estimate $g(\hat{\theta})$

As titles say, given $\hat{\theta}$ is the Maximum Likelihood estimate of a parameter $\theta$ , how to prove that Maximum Likelihood estimate of $g(\theta)$ is $g(\hat{\theta})$ . Additionally, is this property applied to Bayesian estimate? I think given that $\hat{\theta}$ is the Maximum Likelihood estimate of function $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ , then $\frac{\partial f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)}{\partial \theta}|_{\theta=\hat{\theta}}=0$ . Then we can continue proving that $\frac{\partial g(f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n))}{\partial g(\theta)}|_{g(\theta)=g(\hat{\theta})}=0$
