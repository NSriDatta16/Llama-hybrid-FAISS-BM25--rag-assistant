Why use Binary Cross Entropy for Generator in Adversarial Networks

I'm trying to work with General Adversarial Networks and there's something I'm seeing everywhere but can't explain why... the GANs are usually constructed from a Generator (which usually generates an image and is connected to the discriminator) and a discriminator (which is responsible for determining if the generated image is fake or not). I can understand why the loss function for the Discriminator should be Binary Cross Entropy (determining between 2 classes) but why should the Generator's loss also be Binary Cross Entropy? If the Generator is supposed to generate images, isn't it more appropriate to use a MSE or MAE loss for it? and what exactly happens when we use any loss functions other than BCE for the generator ? Thanks so much...
