cforest - Prediction without labels

I have some data that I want to get the important variables from. I want to use random forest to get this information. The problem is that the data does not have labels. From what I understand random forest is a supervised learning algorithm, but one can generate synthetic data to help with the prediction. Can random forest look for an underlying pattern in the data? If so how would I do this? Essentially can I get the important variables from this unlabeled data and how? How does this compare to clustering?
