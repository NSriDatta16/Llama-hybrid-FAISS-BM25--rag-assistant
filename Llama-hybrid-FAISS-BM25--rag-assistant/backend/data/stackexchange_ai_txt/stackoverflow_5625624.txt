Trouble disabling LLVM optimizations via pragma

I have a chunk of code that crashes unless I build with optimizations off. I'm building with LLVM compiler 2.0 I would like to turn off optimizations by wrapping the offending code with a #pragma compiler directive; or turn off optimizations for an entire file. I've been digging in the clang manual and code; but nothing jumps out at me. Does anyone know how to change the optimizations for a single CU (as opposed to for the entire app)?
