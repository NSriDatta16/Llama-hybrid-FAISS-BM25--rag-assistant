Concatenating an integer to an LPCWSTR / string

I have a program that generates/'rolls' two dice. I would like to output these two values to a MessageBox, for example: "Dice Rolled: 1 and 3". The problem I am having is how to go about concatenating these integers to the string. The code I have so far is as follows: MessageBox( NULL, // hWnd - window owner (none) L"Dice:", // lpText - text for message box L"Dice rolled:", // lpCaption - title for message box MB_OK | // uType - make ok box MB_ICONEXCLAMATION); What would be the best way to go about doing this? Thanks in advance.
