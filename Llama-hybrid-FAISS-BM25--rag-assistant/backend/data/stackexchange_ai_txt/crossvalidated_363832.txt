You will need to have some information about the parametric form of $P(y)$ in order to determine the form of the posterior. He's saying that if the likelihood is from the exponential family, then the posterior is logistic, but that requires knowing the form of the prior. I don't think it follows necessarily, and he was most likely talking about logistic regression for binomial classification with some abused or confused terminology.
