Infer (supposed) Poissonian probability from data

Suppose to count the drops of rain in a square meter in 15 seconds, producing 16 observations: 40, 20, 24, 15, 23, 12, 39, 26, 29, 33, 16, 36, 17, 32, 40, 15. What is the probability of counting 28 drops in a following measure? By simple computations we can find the mean and sigma of this dataset, namely $\mu = 26.06$ and $\sigma = 9.43$ . My issue is the following: from the definition of the problem, I would expect the data to be distributed according to a Poisson distribution, being it a count process. By plotting the dataset in a histogram, however, it is clear that the distribution is far from a Poisson distribution or even a Gaussian. I could only come up with two possible solutions to this problem: I nonetheless suppose the dataset is Poissonian (and we would see a Poissonian appear with more measurements) and we can estimate $\lambda$ by taking the average value between $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , since they should both converge to $\lambda$ for infinite observations. If this approach is true, the dataset is generated from $$ P(x) = \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda} $$ with $\lambda = \frac{\mu+\sigma}{2} = 16.24$ . This approach would give a negligible probability and I would say is clearly wrong. I forget all my assumptions about the process and only believe the data. In this case I would just find the probability from my histogram. by taking e.g. 6 bins with extremes (10-15|15-20|20-25|25-30|30-35|35-40) (right extreme included) I find the histogram (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4). The subset (26, 27, 28, 29, 30) appears with probability $\frac{obs_{(25, 30]}}{obs_{tot}} = \frac{2}{16} = 12.5\%$ and assuming all the numbers uniformly distributed in this subset, since there are 5 numbers, I get $P(x=28) = \frac{12.5\%}{5} = 2.5\%$ . The second result seems much more reasonable but is totally heuristic and obviously depends on the histogram chosen, although I am pretty sure we wouldn't get completely different results and this feels somewhat right. Question Is my second approach reasonable? What would be the "smart" way to infer this probability?
