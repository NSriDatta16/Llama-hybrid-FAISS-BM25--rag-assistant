What is a good algorithm for estimating the median of a huge read-once data set?

I'm looking for a good algorithm (meaning minimal computation, minimal storage requirements) to estimate the median of a data set that is too large to store, such that each value can only be read once (unless you explicitly store that value). There are no bounds on the data that can be assumed. Approximations are fine, as long as the accuracy is known. Any pointers?
