Weighted vs Non weighted scores for unbalanced classes

I have a dataset which has 99.8% negatives and 0.2% positives. The scores I have got for my model(built using XGBoost) is as follows: Testing dataset F1 score=0.1276595744680851 Precision=0.07086614173228346 Recall=0.6428571428571429 Weighted F1 =0.8821858216331502 Weighted Precision=0.9717719236678019 Weighted Recall=0.8176426982950333 ROC AUC=0.7321023034497675 Samples:1321 Negative,28 Negative I am not sure which metric to focus and optimize for this case. Should I aim for the normal F1 score or the weighted one? I understand my model is overfitting.
