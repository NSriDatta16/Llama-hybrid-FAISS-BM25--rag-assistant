PayPal Orders Cancelling Automatically In Magento

I have this weird issue in Magento when someone places an order using PayPal Express Checkout. Every so often an order will come in and then the order gets canceled a few seconds later. The comment that is left is as follows: Canceled order online. Amount: $59.23. Transaction ID: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-void". (ID blanked out just in case) Now our customers are swearing they did not cancel their orders and when we ask PayPal they say it is a problem on our side. Has anyone heard of this issue and do you know of a fix? I am running Magento Enterprise 1.8.
