Your diagnosis is correct. Since you are using a model with two main effects, one interaction, and (I presume) one intercept, you have as many parameters as conditions. Your model will fit itself exactly to the empirical results under each condition: it will predict a probability of 28 / 28 = 1 for Cond A T1, et cetera. For a logistic regression to predict a probability of 1 or 0, some combination of the coefficients must go to the logit of 1 or 0, which is $\pm \infty$. It doesn't seem profitable to analyze these data on a logit scale. I'd suggest you look instead at the the risk difference between the groups. You can test first for a difference between condition A and condition B using a simple z-test like this . You can also test different times within condition B with same method. One warning: the normal approximation may not work great given your low counts. In my opinion, there is not too much point in looking for a main effect of time. On a risk-difference scale, the model with intercept, condition main effect, and a condition B : T2 indicator can explain as much of the observed variation as anyone possibly could with those covariates.
