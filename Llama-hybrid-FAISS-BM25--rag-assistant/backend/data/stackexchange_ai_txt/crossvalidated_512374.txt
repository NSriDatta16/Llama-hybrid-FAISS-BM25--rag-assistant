MAPE vs. SSE error minimization on generated data from a function?

I have a question regarding the performance of MAPE and SSE in fitting datasets generated from another equation. I have the following equation (I am truly sorry, I do not know how to write in LaTeX): f(x) = exp(x), whose data is generated from 0.1 What I did is I fitted the quadratic equation g(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C using SSE and MAPE, and got totally different results, the graph shown here: While I know that this is expected considering that I used different objective functions in minimizing the errors, I would like to understand why is this so. As I can see from the graph, the SSE seems to be performing well on average, but with MAPE, the model is performing better than the one calculated by SSE, except at the larger values of x.
