Ridge regression coefficients show model importance but the model evaulation not

I have performed two ridge logistic regressions in R to check which of the two models perform better. From the first look of the coefficients, it looks like model1 has more influential variables than model2 - simply that the coefficient are closer to 0 in model2 . model1 model2 Int -2.04×10+1 1.86×10+1 V1 -2.14×10-1 8.08×10-3 V2 3.05×10-3 1.20×10-2 V3 -1.80×10-4 -2.22×10-4 V4 -4.33×10-4 -1.40×10-2 V5 -3.11×10-3 -9.87×10-3 V6 5.51×10-1 4.31×10-2 V7 2.94×10-2 2.42×10-3 V8 -4.04×10-1 Once I look at the model evaluation, all of a sudden model1 has no predictive power, while model2 shows relatively good predictive power. The overall script is found here Why does the individual variables for model1 seem more influential, but evaluated all together have no predictive power, and vice versa for model2 ?
