ASP.NET MVC - append GET value to every URL... ActionLink? Routing? How?

I'm after an elegant way to append a token to each URL in an ASP.NET MVC application. eg: http://mysite.com/?token=81541858 From any given page, when a link is generated (eg through HTML.ActionLink) it should append the existing token to the new URL. eg: HTML.ActionLink("Show me","Detail",new{id=5}) should produce: http://mysite.com/Product/Detail/5?token=81541858 What would be the best way to achieve this while keeping with the existing overall design. An ActionLink wrapper? Perhaps there's some kind of routing-based solution?
