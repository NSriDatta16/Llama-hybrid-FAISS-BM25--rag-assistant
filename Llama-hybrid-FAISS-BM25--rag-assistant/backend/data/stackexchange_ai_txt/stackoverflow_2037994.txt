If you are talking about removing a project from a solution, you can either delete it by right-clicking the project and select "Remove". This will physically remove the project from the drive as well as (obviously) remove it from the current solution. You can also right-click the project and select "Remove" which will remove the project from the solution, but not from physical storage, so the project will still be available, but not attached to the current solution. EDIT: For solutions, simply delete them from your physical drive and then, if the solution still shows up in the recent projects list, you can edit the registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\ProjectMRUList) and remove the item there.
