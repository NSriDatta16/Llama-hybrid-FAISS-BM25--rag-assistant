Average Precision if Target Class is Not in Evaluation

Suppose I have 5 classes, denoted by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and this is used in object detection. When evaluating an object detection performance, suppose I have classes 1, 2, and 3 present, but classes 4 and 5 are not present in the targeted values. Will each of classes 4 and 5 have average precision of 0 (due to its precision being zero as no true positives can be identified)? Or perhaps there are other considerations to take when this case occurs?
