What is the difference between these distances in self organized maps

I am building an anomaly model and am confused between these distances below. What is the difference between these distances in self organized maps. som.iris$distances dist(som.iris$codes[[1]]) As far as I have read, 1) is between vector to Best Matching Unit, and 2) is the euclidean distance between adjacent neurons in the som topology (also seen in U-matrix) . When do i use 1. and when do i use 2.? How are they associated with each other? is 1. a more granular version of 2.? I'm interested to assign a score based on how 'different' one is against another. thanks. library('kohonen') set.seed(1) train
