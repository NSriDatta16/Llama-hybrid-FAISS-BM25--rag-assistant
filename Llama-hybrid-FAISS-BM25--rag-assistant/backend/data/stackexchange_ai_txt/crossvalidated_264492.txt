Problem using new input data on machine learning classifier

We have built a machine learning classifier for some experimental data. During this process, we performed discretization on the continuous target variable using its median as a threshold. We would like to test our classifier on a similar new study. The problem we are facing is that the median of the new input data is significantly different than that of our original data. This would mean that the classifier will produce erroneous predictions. How should we address this issue? Do we need to normalize the new input data? If so, then what method would be best?
