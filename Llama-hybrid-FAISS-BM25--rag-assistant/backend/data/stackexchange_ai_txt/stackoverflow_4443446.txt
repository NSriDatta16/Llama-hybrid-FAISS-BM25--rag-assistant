CodeIgniter auth security model

I've built a custom auth system for CodeIgniter (I know there are various 3rd party libraries available but this is for my own benefit) but I'm worried I'm missing something obvious that could bring the whole thing down. I use CI sessions (through the database) and encrypt cookie values for a little bit of probably pointless obfuscation. Logins take place over SSL (and cookies are modified to be secure only). I also use phpass to hash passwords for storage, though thats not really relevant here. There may be a weak link in this part somewhere but my main concern is that page-to-page checks basically consist of a if is_logged_in = true type approach along with their username in the session. This bit concerns me as it seems a bit too 'easy'. Is this approach quite vulnerable? Should I be computing a page-by-page hash of, say, user-agent or whatever and making sure they match? Any pointers would be most appreciated. Like I said, I'm aware of pre-existing solutions but I'm trying to learn me some learning here :)
