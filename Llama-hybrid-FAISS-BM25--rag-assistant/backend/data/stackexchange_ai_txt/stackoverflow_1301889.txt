Zend Forms - populate() and setDefaults()

Let's say I have a form that collects a first name and a last name: $first_name = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('first_name'); $first_name->setLabel("First Name") ->setRequired(true); $last_name = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('last_name'); $last_name->setLabel("Last Name") ->setRequired(true); $form = new Zend_Form(); $form->addElement($first_name) ->addElement($last_name) If I want to use the "populate($data)" or the "setDefaults($data)" method on the form, how does the array need to be organized? What kind of an array do these functions expect? I haven't been able to find this information in the docs. Also, I know that I can set the value when creating the element itself, but this is not what I need.
